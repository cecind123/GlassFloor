rating,review
bad,Poor communication very unprofessional this facility has a very high turnover rate never keeps employees including management team members and leans I don't suggest working here
bad,"too stressful, too busy, not enough help, long hours, no lunch breaks, poor management, lots of turn over, not enough employee training, not enough paid holidays"
bad,The company is not doing well at the moment I really don't know what to say but I would say look for a a job that was not at Walgreens if you want something that can last.
bad,"I truly thought I would love this job. They were great through the traing and flexible. As soon I was there full time. Then shifted my hours, had no steady person to train me and left me to answer phones, run register, answer drive through and input scripts that  I hadn't been taught to do because of not having enough help."
bad,I’m hey will work you to the bone and not pay you enough for your job. Management of horrible they get desperate and hire people that do not know what they are doing.
bad,Ever since Boots Alliance took over and Wag started to be run by the British the work environment & morale has gone down the tubs. They are no longer employee friendly.
bad,No team work Management sucks they don't really care about employee they want you to work harder than them you have to be on their side beg them like a dog if you want to be promoted you have to let them do whatever they wanna do with you to get their stupid promotion this is one of the worst company to work for.
bad,"A very poor place to work. Supervisors very early on select their favorites and their opposites. The favorites are strongly encouraged to learn from their mistakes and everything is ok, the others are constantly harassed and belittled in front of other employees. A good example- a management team member will comedown and give you a 15 minute pep talk, ie learn from your mistakes, you are doing great, etc. Afterwords, your immediate supervisor will approach you, tell you that because of that talk, we have to work overtime and it is all because of YOU!"
bad,"It was an okay job, very all over the place, little to no guidance from management, decent first job, pay is okay and minimal benefits are offered. Discounts at the pharmacy worth it."
bad,"Company is going downhill, only cares about people on top and shareholders, disconnect with store level. Dms dont care about leaders moving up and everyone backstabs everyone and only looks out for themseleves"
bad,Allowed for me as a sfl to get sexually harassed by another manager & retaliated on me for it as well as I got physically jumped by customers & because I defended myself they punished me
bad,Don't work here even if it's the only job available. Management treats you poorly expects too much doesn't pay you what worth sides with customers who are rude to you discourage defending yourself
bad,"This company does not care about customers or employees. They push employees without proper training, and dont care about customers. The numbers are the bottom line"
bad,Mediocre place to work without good compensation. Schedule is bad and random. No appreciation by management and no sense of productiveness or improvement.
bad,"Has excessive favoritism. Schedules are not fair, some people never work evening or weekend shifts. Others only get evening and weekends. PTO is difficult to get approved."
bad,I was hired to work day shift and night shift.  I only get to work day shift once a month if that.  I was hired to work in the pharmacy but they move me all over the store.
bad,"Don’t work at Walgreens they do not care about your outside life they want you to be all about them and if you’re not then they will take away your hours until they feel as need they will give you your hours back, so please save yourself the time and don’t do the application"
bad,"I worked for Walgreens going on 17 years . Always getting high reviews every year always promises if I do more I will get to Asm but 5 years and nothing,  to you guys reading this I still work here but just started school because going to work is a love hate relationship love my coworkers but hate Walgreens for taking advantage of my hard work."
bad,Walgreens is not the company it used to be. Employee's used to get raises every 90 days or promotion to another department. They no longer have these options and there is one set pay for handling many department tasks.
bad,"Employees are really lazy, don’t want to pick up there slack, always late to work, slow, can’t keep up with the pace. Management are not helpful or understandable."
bad,"This place and the vast majority of its people just sucks. Do not expect to advance or be treated with any semblance of respect, unless you’re a shareholder."
bad,Unless you are management's nothing you say matters...you always get write ups for useless stuff the district managers are a joke and the actually management are rude and worthless
bad,"First it was a great company, it's all about leadership and management. management shows basis and favoritism I never experienced a hostile environment"
bad,Company doesn’t care about employees or its customers.  What was once a great company is not a terrible place to be.  Stay clear of this sinking ship.
bad,"This company is full of racist people ,who judge you based on personal feelings and what you look like rather than your qualifications.If your not white don't bother trying to be a pharmacy technician if your lucky they might let you be a cashier."
bad,the pharmacists put all the work on the technicians. I worked 60 hours a week 7 days a week for over a month with no days off with no appreciation from management. They work you until you are completely burnt out.
bad,"Same as most retailers.  No use of clinical knowledge, bad hours.  Unreal expectations that cannot be completed.  Overworked and very underpaid.  As profits drop staff pays with excessive cuts in both compensation and workforce."
bad,"Working at Walgreens might be great for students but not for adults. You get less hours after your training period. Don't be surprised if you see only 3 working days on a schedule. Not nearly enough money, and management structure is completely hilarious. If you are employee, EXPECT, to be given ""titles"" that offer NO EXTRA PAY. Pretty much you do the managers job for them for NO EXTRA PAY, only a title which is stupid ridiculous."
bad,"Minimum wage and ridiculous job duties expected for pay compensation. Management is non responsive and certain co workers are favored which gives them a better work schedule with less job duties, for example, exempt from cleaning the bathrooms or unloading the trucks"
bad,Walgreens is the worst company who should be out business .The company is a racist and promotes discrimination at the highest level.The Company as whole is worthless and garbage .
bad,"Walgreens sucks I worked there 12 years since the UK took over everything changed for the worse employees were petty, verbally abusive, yelling at managers, managers yelling in front of customers."
bad,"Totally unfair company. Just like all chains, only interested in making money. Don't care about employees at all. NOT AT ALL. Worst company I have ever worked for on my 30 years."
bad,"I worked there for three years as an overnight shift lead. I was put on with minimal training and was assigned tasks daily. At first there was a lot of work to be done. After a few years and about a half dozen manager changes. I got a manager who wanted to do it all herself. Eventual my workload was cut down to almost nothing. So I sat in the office most of the night. Another manager replaced that manager and she was a vicious tyrant of a boss. I was on a mini paternity leave using my PTO when the regime change happened. I came back and was working for a week. During this week she watched the cameras from up to six months ago and saw how little work was being done. Instead of assigning more work, sitting us down and saying this isn't how she wants things, or even just a write up with a things are going to change around here speech, She ended up firing me on my birthday. I called HR to plead my case and they didn't even give me the time of day. I would strongly suggest avoiding this company they have no clear expectations set and your managers will constantly change and the details of your job will change with it. Sometimes to disastrous results."
bad,Pharmacist at this Walgreens like to make fun of people race and religion not fond of this at all people need to learn work ethics and at least give better pay and training instead putting new people to train with others who are rude
bad,"Felt like a number and not a part of a team, if you are looking for something long term this is not the place. Company cares more about their profit than looking out for its employees"
bad,Don't apply here. The manager will tell you something then the next day do something different.  The hour was cut due Walgreens was attempting to buyout an business.
bad,"Expect too much, pay too little. I ran the store top to bottom and was not appreciated. From helping in RX to cleaning toilets. Got robbed at gunpoint and was asked to come to work hours later."
bad,"Co-workers were rude. Customers were rude. Management continually put management work off on employees. Witnessed managers being rude to customers, but expect employees to be nice."
bad,"Management is not accepting of disabilities in an employee and encourages gossip and negative behavior regatding said employees.  Training offered in interview, as were other things, and never given.  Instructions often given across the room as training, and then chastised I'd done incorrectly or person didn't understand directive.  Very negative place to work."
bad,"LOVE my customers, LOVE my co-workers...management is difficult, negative, lack education, and adequate communication skills. The work load does not allow customer service to be priority.  The cuts with store hours, pharmacy hours and location closures...along with dropping stock prices; has created a very low morale that unfortunately, ultimately effects the customer.  Walgreens CEO's current primary focus to recoup lost revenue from 2018.  They are feverishly cutting staff that have tenure, while hiring lower paid replacements.  Experienced staff with enough self-confidence to say ""NO"" when patient health is at risk are leaving by the truck loads.  It is very sad how they have destroyed a good company like Walgreens.  Walgreens, in its glory decades, employed MBA's or pharmacists that know pharmacy law in top management positions.  It seems they would have learned from their mistakes of today and successes of decades past. Unfortunately, they have not."
bad,Never learned anything there and they didn’t have tome to teach new hires new things. They only assigned new hires for cashiers and they never advance.
bad,"""The corner of happy and healthy""....PSYCH. this company is pretty rotten to work for. They do not promote healthy lifestyles. The amount of customers seen each day is so large, that if I spent too long helping one customer, I would get reprimanded. The high stress environment does not radiate a positive company culture in the least. I did not enjoy my experience working at Walgreens. You are overworked, underpaid, and disrespected."
bad,"I USED to feel appreciated by management, but... management changed to different store manager so... but I TRULY love my awesome customers!!! I’m made to believe I’m just difficult because I speak my mind"
bad,"horrible company, let people steal everyday, always fights and drama, very unorganized, shelfs never stocked. old pills and food stocked on shelves. bathroom always broken. police never shows up if anything goes wrong. no security"
bad,"Not a job I would recommend, low morale, poor management, no accountability. Good coworkers for the most part, but management doesn’t care about anything except corporate rules that are beyond out of touch with reality."
bad,Overall working at a pharmacy was a lot of fun and a great experience but you must be prepared that this place is usually understaffed and must able to deal with customers who need their medicine.
bad,Bad and selfish leaders who only care about them selves and are not interested in helping their teams grow. They will threaten and intimidate you if you do not do what they ask.
bad,"The store manager at the Gulf to Bay Blvd. location seems to care only about corporate and not at all about employees. He is cold and uncaring, does not hear what you say, plays favorites and never encourages you or lets you know your doing a good job. But he is always there to tell you you're not doing something or you need to be doing more and more. If this store is a representative of Walgreen's corporation, it is a cold, uncaring place that is only concerned with profits."
bad,AllianceRx Walgreens Prime does not care about their employees. They are unfair and racist and show favoritism thru out the company. The management is corrupt from the top hr all the way to phone specialist.
bad,"They do not care about you or your family. If you are kit involved in the drama they don’t want you there. Management is a joke! You have a death in the family, they expect you to be at work or get written up. Management calls out and works when they want. The schedule is done around their life , leaving no work/ life balance for lower level management. As with every job they have favorites but this place is ridiculous ."
bad,"I am not sure about how is the working environment in other Walgreens, but the one in Okatie, Sc is the worst. You are almost forced to work without receiving your proper breaks because of how busy the store is. The managers doesn’t care about giving you your breaks. You’d be lucky if you even received a 15 minute break on certain days. The pay is terrible. The store is busy none stop all day, you would think that you work in a mall."
bad,"When I first started with Walgreens 8 years ago, it was a very different place to work than it is now. They run the company on a skeleton crew. Most nights 2 people close the store. Extremely dangerous. It is extremely stressful to work this way. When you want to be the best and do your best Walgreens now makes it virtually impossible. Very sad."
bad,They over work you with no time and very low pay their open door policy doesn't exist if you don't mind you don't matter and if someone calls in be prepared to have double the work your managers don't help and ignore your calls customers get frustrated waiting on management to help them and they start yelling at you for not being helped quickly if you chose not to believe by all means be my guest and check it out yourself
bad,Always Short Staffed; company isn't growing so I don't see it getting better. Unfairness of schedule at all locations. If you need a quick job sure but if you are looking to grow within the company choose another company.
bad,"I totally would not recommend working here to anyone at all!!! You will be miserable if you work here. Overworked and underpaid so if that is your dream then by all means go for it. Horrible managers, horrible pay, horrible customers seriously just don't put yourself through that!"
bad,Terrible Treatment there I can’t believe all the stuff they get away with that company and how bad they treat the employees the management was horrible they don’t care about the staff at all all they care about are the numbers it’s not worth it
bad,They have created a terrible culture at Walgreens. They want to just write-up and fire you if you breathe wrong. After working for the company for five years I have seen a lot of changes. BEWARE - you have been warned.
bad,Literally had to teach myself mgmt things in the office. Went without store manager for 3 months. Pay rate is shitless compared to other places. Corporate does not interact with stores enough to recognize the needs in each store individually
bad,Employees in there first 90 days got treated better than the employees that had been their a year or more. The management stand strong against any negative remarks made from anyone not on the management team even if the management is in the wrong.
bad,"This company is the absolute worst company I have ever worked for. They do not care about you. They do not care about customers. They only care about numbers. The store manager is one of the most selfish people I have met. Understaffed. Under paid. Random schedule. Mentally exhausting. Never good enough. Too much to do, not enough staff.never good enough. I went home every night literally contemplating whether or not to go back. You are their slave. Most unorganized selfish careless company I have ever worked for!!!! You are worth so much more than they have to offer you!!!!! Don’t work here...."
bad,Managers and shift leads are only trying to get hourly employees to do their work on top of the daily work of the hourly employees. Management does not care about their employees.
bad,"I watched them take away benefit after benefit, taking away pay and hours. The company just cares about shareholders, as most large companies do. They lie to their employees saying tough decisions had to be made, while the CEO was getting million-dollar raises. Avoid Walgreens. You will not have a life, get sick all the time, and made to feel guilty about calling out."
bad,"If you want a job where you feel important, valued, and appreciated, don't work for Walgreens. You're just a number, management doesn't care about who you are or what you need. You have no direction or purpose, they employ as many people part time as they can in order to avoid paying for benefits, and they encourage you to go to work when you're sick. Given the average age of the customer and the fact that many are older and have compromised immune systems, you would think they would encourage you to keep your germs at home. As well as give free flu shots to employees, and offer health benefits. But they dont."
bad,All manager  not working on weekend or  closing store just like the KING sitting to the office Monday  to Friday  in the morning  and enjoy a  lot  just give all tasks  to other employee to finished it. Do  not  waste time to work there they dont care about anyone just end of year you get 0.20 cent extra and never give you  offer any higher position.
bad,The company is a joke. Very terrible place to work if your young or old I wouldn’t recommend it. The work environment is Toxic. The opportunity for growth is non existent.
bad,This company will burn you break you down and make you go crazy as a former member of management employees run the management any little thing employees say will get you fired if you wanna move up in the company just lay back and let the employees walk all over you
bad,They are an evil company that only cares about selling prescription drugs one day all of the people that get there drugs there will realize that they do not care about you or your well being
bad,"Walgreens  is more about sales, does not care about their employers.  Will retaliate if you speak your mind.  Unfair practice, discrimination is terrible.  Do not come to work at Walgreens."
bad,"First, my first 3 days, the trainer barely trained us, especially the first two days, after orientation,  we saw her twice. 2nd day,  computer issues, so we given a full hour lunch break, 30 of it was played. We weren't considered actually employees til all our paperwork came in, and we pop as the call it to start training for whatever department they decided we were, not what we applied for."
bad,"Horrible place to work, expected entirely to much of, they have you do all store manager duties while only paying you shift lead which for me is only $12.00 hr and the store manager is only in store once or twice a week while they have them playing district manager and only getting paid store manager wages, they like to play games with you telling you you can move up from within but untrue  they always hire out of store they just look at you like a number no appreciation for the hard dedicated work you dothey always hire from"
bad,New Managers at Walgreens 11224 are only there to intimidate and bully hard working employees who have been with the company for years. Refusing to accommodate or compromise schedules so that techs can fall off payroll because they know that’s the only way to get a great employee terminated. 13 years of service never had an issue with employees of customers. Now the store has constant drama amongst team members and customers are always frustrated and upset.
bad,The company  extremely unexpected work environment it’s long hours not enough break time you don’t get a specific job also shipment days werre hicktick there was not enough space to stick anything
bad,"Management very bad,bad people."
bad,Hostile workplace environment. Lot of cultural discrimination and harassment. Cannot trust management and coworkers spy on each other to report to management every little stupid mistakes   just to suck up in order to get ahead. There’s a lot of gossiping and backbiting all around. Like working daily under a big cloud  of negativity - so detrimental to a person’s overall well-being.
bad,"CSA and shift leads are overworked and underpaid. Management has no power to change anything. Corporate is clueless."
bad,"An very awful place to work. like herding cattle in an out they dont care about people, just about metrics. Not a team environment and never will be. can't keep people employed"
bad,Leadership here was the worst that I have observed in my career. I had a DM that was having an affair with a member of his District team and nothing was ever done. The leadership teams are self serving and there was no room to grow. It could have been the Region/Market I was in but this was by far the worst working experience I had in my career.
bad,This job was horrible from almost the word GO. No proper training nor anyone willing to take the time to explain any training or why things were done the way they expected. Corporate didn’t want to pay for adequate hours so everyone struggled to do their job plus 3 others at any given time. Complete lack of professionalism displayed from management. Low moral. Don’t advise!
bad,Managers were really rude and were really didn’t care about employees needs they told us we couldn’t take off like we wanted it had to be 6 months in advanced
bad,Mangers was very rude they didn’t care about the employees they had favorite employees that they looked out for I would never work their again if they had a different manager people wouldn’t quit so fast
bad,RUN!!!!! DO NOT APPLY HERE...If I could rate this job 0 stars I would. The management was horrible! I had extreme anxiety to the point that I would become physically ill everytime I had to go to work. Please dont work here if you value your life and mental health.
bad,Being a shift lead means nothing. Store manager does nothing to help out in the store. Your a nobody unless your a asst.manager. They cut your hours and don’t care how you manage
bad,"From day one I was honestly bummed about working for this company due to them buying out my rite aide store and closing us down."
bad,"Its okay, communication sucks and management sucks, had to call HR a couple times with my situations, and you get written up without verbal warnings. You don't get warning until you get written up, terrible management."
bad,If management doesn’t like you then you’re as good as done. The rate and speed they time you on is just a bunch of bull. People there are mean and rude. You have to start out on 3rd shift before you can advance to 1st or any other shift .
bad,The company does not care for its employees. Do not work for Walgreens. Do not put yourself in such a bad company. You can do much better with YOUR life.
bad,"Horrible store manager. He would change your time if he did not like you and if you called corporate, they would not do anything. Very uncomfortable work environment."
bad,"the job will pay the bills for the most part, but they treat you like dirt. Managers and most supervisors are completely oblivious to the work thats actually being done. It doesnt matter how well or fast you perform, they just raise the standard of production every couple months and tell you your not performing well enough. extremely strict attendance policy. When you finally get a manager or supervisor thats actually good at their job, they end up leaving the company because they realize too how terrible that place is. you might be expected to work 16 hours shifts during peak season. THEY ARE NOTORIOUS FOR CHEATING EMPLOYEES OUT OF OVERTIME PAY. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PAY STUBS."
bad,Most managers/pharmacy manager do not know what they are doing.  The few managers that are efficient and hard working are overworked with fixing the problems of other managers.
bad,Please don’t work here! The management treats people like robots and not humans. They just don’t care about their employees. I know many people that stayed hours past their scheduled shift because no one did any work.
bad,It sucked there they just didn't care about the employees at all. Especially what they were going through.  They overwork u. And dont pay u enough. I hate working there
bad,"Don't work here as a shift lead. Basically they have most of their work done by shift leads. They will give shift leads 3 to 4 closing shifts every week. They want them to work every weekend. On top of that, they are open all the year. That means, you will miss Christmas, Thanksgiving, and New Year."
bad,You do not matter at this company. Your store manager can act inappropriate and he will get a raise while denying you one and saying you didn't meet the calibrations.
bad,This job sucks no wonder people leave and never looked back I thought it was just bad luck but Walgreens is something else never have I felt so betrayed by and embarrassed by a company
bad,"Pharmacist for 19 years with company. No meaningful raise nor bonus in past 9 years.  Always cutting bonafide technicians and using non trained designated hitter to ""help"".  New annual review is based on company mandated metric goals, which are truly unobtainable."
bad,"Worked with the company for many  years because I got comfortable, but as far as liking it NO! The pay sucks, the yearly raise is few cents if you even get one. The staff is fake when it comes to customer service. Worst part of all they’re open EVERY holiday you get one holiday off a year if lucky. Depressing!"
bad,"Was hired then trained. Then was promored. Then was traiined again. Then the store closed, now looking for another place. .Better Than other places thats walgreens"
bad,"Absolutely terrible place to work. Especially in the split case picking, there are huge bullies who make your life miserable. Incredibly fast paced every single day even if it's not technically busy. Management is so so. Theres absolutely no chance of advancement. People have been working there for 20 years and are still at the bottom of the hierarchy. Mark my words, IT IS NOT WORTH IT."
bad,"Training is PPL videos. Out date videos and the computers freeze up. They work you to death! Team leaders and managers are rude. If you have a problem they chew you out and call the district manager. It's not an enjoyable job. The associates have their clicks and kiss up to the managers. Pharmacy is just as bad. Don't apply at Van Buren, Ar Walgreens if you don't want to lose sleep and dread going to work."
bad,This was the worse job I’ve ever had they were unorganized customers prescriptions were always/ lost or misplaced. Pharmacy management had a very poor attitude and they were always short handed and acted as if they didn’t care. Peak time is 5pm when people get off work there would be 20-30 people waiting and complaining to get assistance in a timely manner daily. WhWhich Which never happened
bad,"Poor management. I temporarily worked in the pharmacy as a pharmacy technician. This was the most stressful job i have ever held. It was extremely fast paced and i was expected to do just about everything and know everything right away. The only type of training i had was on the computer, watching videos and taking assessments. Any question i had was always frowned upon and was always told that i should know this information when i had never worked in a pharmacy before. You're expected to answer phone calls, count medications, assist customers at the walk up window as long as the drive through window, contact patients, and insurance company, know different brands of medication all at the same time with out bothering the pharmacist."
bad,Working at Walgreens was very unprofessional. My manager never were on the same page with each other and it was very confusing. We were always understaffed and there was no change of improving. No one (not even our store manager) was fully trained in photo which constantly put us behind in with customers.
bad,"Management does not value their workers. They talk down to you and be-little you. Store manager negatively puts down her own management team. Theft was a huge problem but i was shocked when a woman stole food and the store manager said ""I hope she chokes and dies while eating it""."
bad,i used to love working at this job was there for 10 years but no advancement felt like i was never good enough for the company. If they would of gave me advancements i think i would stayed with the company.
bad,"Not a good company wasted almost 10 years for a dead end job, I got a pay cut doing the same job but 40% less pay.  MR. Walgreen you HAD a good company that employees love comming to work but not anymore."
bad,"Terrible place to work, over work you ,under pay you, dont care about your safety,  dont give you enough help, dont want you to have overtime they will write you up for everything"
bad,Only care about business. Staff is replaceable and treated as. Managers pic favorites. Management does not discipline or correct wrong behavior or when staff is doing things wrong.
bad,You a good place to work.  A manager is a manager and a highly paid stock person.  They salary is not good either and they always  cutting the payroll and expect the store to look immaculate.
bad,"The work itself is somewhat challenging, work environment can be nice if management would stop letting personal feelings affect it. The district manager does not care about your problems, everything gets swept under the rug. Only worked with Walgreens a year and you’d be surprised how much drama this one location has caused! & if you voice your concerns to the higher ups they will seclude you and do everything in their power to ruin your reputation and make sure you do not advance within the company."
bad,Very unorganized place to work. The Pharmacy Manager does not train employees to help aid in making the pharmacy more efficient. People aren't scheduled to rotate in and out of different areas on a regular basis. I would almost guarantee a McDonalds has more organization than this pharmacy.
bad,Working for a company that never closes Makes it hard to balance work and life. Don’t get holidays off with your family and upper management doesn’t care about you
bad,The hours are ridiculous. The managers are horrible. Everyone is rude. You get sick all the time. The customers are the only decent thing about this walgreens.
bad,"This is the worst job I have ever had! It only LOOKS easy. It is an exploitative environment, in my opinion, where you are required to work everywhere in the store at some point. I was supposed to be the cashier (service clerk), but I have washed windows, scrubbed trash cans, mopped restrooms, taken out the trash, shipping and receiving, stockroom, vacuuming, upselling; everything you could thing of, on a regular basis. All for minimum wage. Walgreen's wants more out of their employees for less. And, unless you are management, they will keep you at 35 hours or less so that they don't have to pay you benefits. This place is the bottom of the barrel and many people get stuck here. I'm glad I got out. If working here doesn't motivate you to do better in life, then I don't know what will. And you WILL work holidays, so kiss those goodbye. I spread the word about this place every chance I get. Even customers feel sorry for you when they see everything you have to do. Raises are an insult at CENTS PER YEAR, and can be manipulated by the manager through your annual performance review; and the less money the employees make, the higher their (management's)  year end bonus! Therefore, management is incentivized to keep you at a lower wage, from my experience. Conflict of interest much? The impression that I got is that Walgreen's is a very cheap and stingy company that will cut corners on essentials, in order to maximize profits. Trash bags leak and break every night because they insist on using the clear plastic bags that cannot support the load. You will cry at this job when no one"
bad,The don't back employees up and it all about money got too big for their own good. I'm sorry customer are not always right.  I have have anything else about Walgreens that is nice.
bad,this company is all about catering to the egos of upper management.  it is not about job performance or results. favorites of district managers are allowed to not do any work and are promoted to move them to other stores.
bad,"Working for Walgreens I've seen it ,all I even got in trouble for telling customers about the drug use in the bathroom and to watch their children when using the bathroom we had to pick up needles and wipe down the toilets after someone who did drugs in the bathroom even had to use the bathroom while someone was getting high exposed to the drug .even had mental health patients.that could come in and make treats"
bad,"Demanding, uncomfortable atmosphere with inept, incompetent management. They want your everything and barely give you wages. You can forget being off on holidays."
bad,"Very stressful, over worked , under paid . Don’t matter how many hours you work you only get one 30 min break . Some days if it’s to busy you get no break . Corporate is only worried about numbers , not about your well being . Benefits are not good at all . After 5 years there I have not been promoted to head tech even tho I have done the packet 3-4 times . The manger never wants to take time to go over it and review. I do believe th it’s because they don’t wanna give the raise tht comes with it ."
bad,The managers were the laziest and they get paid the best. We were so short staffed and there was only 2 people that actually did work and that was me and a shift lead.
bad,Walgreens in Eureka is the worst place to work. Abusive work environment verbally and mentally. Management doesnt care and neither does corporate they would rather push a seasoned tech out then lie about them instead of encouraging them to work as a team.
bad,"Working at the Distribution Center was a good job  initially.   Health Benefits were good, 401k, Disability Ins, and Dental all were taken care of.  You were encouraged to join the Profit Sharing Plan and it WAS a good deal. Some years they matched 3+ times the amount you put in.  They also gave a great discount and loan deal on buying Walgreens Stock.  Not that you'd want to do that anymore because the stock has been dropping like a rock past few years, but it used to be great.  I made plenty enough for a down payment on my home.  Ever since Boots Co was brought in, Walgreens Distribution Center has been on fast track to a Terrible Place to work."
bad,"Terrible management, a lot of favoritism, verbal and mental abuse and upper management will do NOTHING about it!!! My store manager had a terrible attitude and was always nasty with everyone."
bad,the people that works there talk about people behind there backs and managers are not friendly .they don't train you very well they just leave you up front at the registers
bad,"Not loyal to their employees, they thank you for been loyal, but you don't get the same treatment, that is a back stabbing, for you not even a interview or a chance for you to try to get into a store position, after 20 years. You make your own mind?"
bad,"Very unpleasant place to work. Poor, poor management. No staff. No management support. Desperately wanted my certification, but management would never move on the matter. We transitioned from Rite-Aid to Walgreens and I was suppose to get a hourly rate increase. The increase never happened. Basically, just poorly managed by the pharmacy manager. Loved working with the staff pharmacist! We made a great team! Sorry that he could not  take over the manager's role. I live in a very small town and the people of this town hate that Walgreens is the pharmacy they have to use. It good be such a great place to work if the right people were placed in the given roles."
bad,"I have seen abuse through the years from other Companies but this is the Worst!!  You no longer receive retirement Benefits even after working for 24+ years.  You have to earn your vacation and no more sick time, so basically you work for nothing.  No incentives.  No Benefits.  Employees are treated as if it is their last day working.  Loyalty means Nothing.  They have No concept of the meaning ""Team"".  I am sure this was not Mr. Walgreens Vision for the direction the Company went in!!!"
bad,"You have 3-4 people working hard and rest halfing everything. Management plays favorites. I had severe allergies to coworkers cologne & manger told me to “come in& sample cologne & compromise with him”. I often missed appointments and what not because I had to cover for unreliable coworkers. Managers literally run when customers come. Shift Lead (part of management team) acts like a stuck up valley girl. Other shift lead is crude. Assistant manager is impossible to work with. She allowed a staff member to move in with her& take hour breaks/lunches without clocking out. Main manager is spineless and blames everything on cooperation rules.  The RED NOSE DAY is a joke! Less than 50% of donations go to the cause but we’re not allowed to tell customers. It’s no wonder Walgreens in Longview,WA is short staffed. No one wants to stay."
bad,"There’s too many technicians that won’t switch roles (for instance cashier,rather be in the back talking and ignoring customers). Pharmacist allow BS!"
bad,"Walgreens is violating so many osha rules and regulations, They have a rate system which is basically a slave system , The feds need to look into that place . All the employees are so stressed out its not even funny people are talking about coming back and shooting the place no thank you i had to quit . Osha needs to go in there with the feds do a questionnaire and find out that Walgreens is crooked  hel"
bad,This company are very manipulative and lie and gives no warning and is very poor to understanding when asked about certain topics when they agree with you they say the will find a way to fix and make it work but instead it fails.
bad,"Terrible Pharmacy manager, you aren’t treated as a person but another number, no respect from customers and poor training. Drama like high school. Wouldn’t wish that on an enemy."
bad,"The worst company in the world"
bad,"They pay you minimum wage, expect you to be flexible and spend half your life there. Pharmacists are very rude and prejudice. Theres no such thing as constructive criticism its a terrible terrible place to work. I wouldnt ever go back."
bad,"The manager was extremely controlling and belittling. Rude in front of customers for ridiculous things.  I had customers say, ""I can't believe she treats you like that."""
bad,"Went down hill as a company 7 years ago. Just keeps getting worse. No family time. Over worked underpaid. Don't  allow any religious beliefs, hours all over the place run your body down."
bad,"Low pay, much favoritism and a lack of true advancement opportunities beyond manager. Dealing with a constant stream of rude, entitled customers is more than soul crushing."
bad,"i used to keep my stuff near the register (keys and wallet) because someone was caught stealing stuff and i didn’t want my stuff stolen; so they fired me bc i didn’t trust their terrible locker system. also accused me of stealing an item, bc i returned it even tho it still had tags and a receipt. terrible place. never work there. choose CVS if anything"
bad,"Management will cut your hours and give it to the people THEY hire. Management doesn’t care working with your schedule if you work elsewhere. They’ll tell you, you must work a full shift or you will NOT be scheduled meanwhile, the people they bring on they allow them to come an hour to an hour and a half later than the normal shift. Or they will allow them to leave and hour before the store close."
bad,I was not happy at Walgreens the manager was a bad person and other managers are trash people or so cuz they don't know what they're doing how to run a business
bad,Its the worst place i have ever worked if i was in a better position i would leave. The manager is bad to her employees several employees have transferred out because of her the the work is not worth the pay. The company any general need to offer more pay and better hours shared equally.
bad,This company is RIDICULOUS!!!!!!! The whole business is ran poorly. I would not recommend this place for any one.... They do not care about their employees..
bad,"Walgreens management at my former place of employment was horrible starting from the store manager down to her leadshifts. The store manager at my store would not offer me any work flexibility such as requested days off. The store manager hardly worked weekends or was out on the field instead she runs a dictator type atmosphere. She would not lead by example or offer any customer interaction at all. She would not even let you communicate your side of any issues instead she would say things such as “shh” “I don’t want to hear it”. She has her preference at her store only keeping employees that have been there longer than 10 years and firing the rest. The beauty advisor at store 9394 is only responsible for covering front register lunches, IC3, and stocking merchandise at every department ranging from feminine isle to men’s razors and your department also. Never had time to actually do the actual “beauty advisor” duties which in any other store would be assisting customers providing great customer interactions and applying makeup which is what a beauty advisor does. In a brief summary the store manager at this particular location sees the beauty advisor as a floating employee who has to cover lunches, work front register and stock and never work in the actual Beaty advisor department yet she would still complain of department not achieving sales goals when no time is allotted to bring up the numbers impossible to deal with a person who is leading a store like that many other employees feel the same way just afraid to speak for fear of losing their jobs but cameras never lie. All"
bad,"my ex colleague got his evaluation change by my ex boss so he can get promo to the next level because they are buddy's, what a shame kingwood district."
bad,"Working here was very difficult, only because my manager didn't want to train me the right way. Because he feared that I would take his position due to holding a degree. You have to work very hard, answer all customer's complaints, count till, drop cash in the safe. Run to bank sometimes to get change for big bills. You will be threaten by customer's. You will work you tail off, for little pay of 16hr. The work I was putting was at least 25 per. That what I should have been getting paid."
bad,"I am a part time floater pharmacist, I have not worked in 4 weeks except my every other weekend.  They have hired too many new graduates and have to give them hours so the full time staff pharmacists and the seasoned floater pharmacists have had their hours cut to make room for the newbies.  I have had a new District Manager for over 2 months now and I just found out about it by accident by reading email at the last store I worked at that happened to be printed out and left on the counter. (Only store and pharmacy managers have access to store email, no one else.  Otherwise you have to hope someone happens to send something to your home email to keep you informed.).  You would think a new District Manager would be something they would want everyone to know about, he is who you contact if you can't get to work or if there is a problem at the pharmacy."
bad,"This company is going the way of kmart. Nasty, silent racist policy prevents verbalized wrongdoing, from management. Very sneaky and deceptive. All white customers know that Walgreens is a racially biased billion dollar company. Don't ever work or shop here."
bad,Walgreens was once a family run company. They cared about you as a person and your family. It was like work for your own family. Then a couple years ago everything changed. The last straw was them cancelling retirement medical for its long term employee's ( 30+ years ). Also the upper management is horrible. My last day the DM was in and never said a word to me after 30yrs shame on him.
bad,No direction. Poor trainining. High stress. Bad managers. Management will talk to you like a piece of garbage. Other employees will feel threatened. Coworkers don't work as a team and management doesn't care. It's finger pointing and walking on top of each other to try to get the best job of the day.
bad,"I was a 23 YEAR employee and I wouldn't recommend this company due to its lack of everything. For instance help, hours, structure, favoritism, lack of communication, "
bad,Horrible place to work.  Upper management does not care about employees under them nor does corporate. Pay sucks and benefits arent that great. I would never work there again.
bad,"I've transfered to different walgreens and so far, they're all the same. "
bad,"Unless you have management that cares which is rarely, don't expect your hours to be consistent. Trash management and bosses, but usually really cool co-workers. That's about it."
bad,"Horrible managers who don’t treat others fairly.A lot of favoritism, no coverage and who or suck up front all day saying “Hey Welcome to Walgreens “ to people that ignore you half of the time ."
bad,"Unloading Trucks in all climates of weather was hectic, then putting the truck away while trying to run the cash register was very annoying. Cleaning up bathrooms, mopping floors, taking out trash was all apart of your job duties.None to zero team effort, as long as one person was doing the work it was alright with them. I would recommend if you was looking for a job, please pass this place by."
bad,I wouldn’t do it...they are not worried and you are what you have to do...they will fire you in a heartbeat!!! They work you like a dog!!! And the pay is horrible
bad,"There is no work/life balance. Work on skeleton budget. Hours have been cut repeatedly with the workload being the same. No autonomy, only micromanage. Company does not promote thinking, only execution."
bad,After being with the company so many years they keep changing the “pay raises” so now it goes by reviews and I’ve made the same pay for over 6 years and I’ve been with them for 13 years I’m looking for another job. I can’t live off of what I get paid
bad,"Rude management, rude co workers. I see why the turn over is high at this place. Managers don’t know how to talk to employees with respect. Weird vibes if you speak up for self. Whispers among each other of what’s going on with an employee. Overall definitely would not work here at the store on Midwest blvd. Missed out on a hard and dedicated worker. Also horrible hours."
bad,"When I 1st started working there it seemed like a great place to work. As the years progressed,  I've seen many employees get treated horribly by management. favoritism was shown for promotions.  I only stayed as long as I did because I needed to keep making money."
bad,Horrible experience! There is no work life balance and they always want you to do more with less. No one cares about the store employees including the manager of the store. They are just numbers to the upper management. Expect to give up your life working for them if you are in management.
bad,"I was told so many great things about working at Walgreens, but now that I work there for myself it is horrible. The management is poor and does NOT care about you. You are a robot employee and not a human when you work at Walgreens. You’re not allowed to show any emotion other than happiness and will be reprimanded if you do so. If you don’t enjoy having your weekends then Walgreens is the place for you. Employees are treated as if they do absolutely nothing right. The managers are hypocritical. Other employees ROCK, but the management is just so horrible you wanna pull your hair out as soon as you step in the building. Even my friend said to me a few weeks ago “I feel like I would get depressed working at Walgreens” and well she dang sure isn’t wrong. If the management care even a little bit about the people they have working for them day in and day out their turnover rate probably wouldn’t be so high and maybe they could hire a few people."
bad,If your a professional don’t work here especially former hair dressers.The management was awful didn’t support beauty cut your hours have favorites impossible goals to meet back stabbing co workers it was one of the worst jobs I ever had and I love cosmetics. I finally quit or was actually forced out by management I had panic anxiety attacks because of this job don’t work here!
bad,"Pros: Able to slack off a lot"
bad,"Not a lot of help for the Front Cashiers, hardly any breaks, did not want to work with school schedules, a lot of push back from managers onto other employees."
bad,you never get days off they  dont care if you have a medical condition and wont let you leave work to go to the hospital without a abstance try to work pregnant women hard and pay sucks
bad,Horrible management and management shows favoritism towards certain individuals and it's almost impossible to get a 40 Hour Work Week.  Chances of moving up in a company or slim because of favoritism and in Walgreens eyes at least in the retail department and Retail Pharmacy there is no such thing as overtime because it's never offered and is actually punishable if you go over 40 hours because of a so-called budget but yet in the corporate world they're making millions wow us workers we're lucky to get paid more than $12 an hour. I was with the company for more than 4 years I started at $10 an hour and I left at $12.35.  You get raises once a year based on performance and that raise is generally no more than $0.35 if you're lucky
bad,"Management asks like its high school taking about everyone to people , telling lies and stories. Company policies put in place are a joke. Employees do whatever they want call off 20 times a year With NO discipline. Worked there over a year and was treated like a joke . Do not do it"
bad,"Very  bad experience  not happy. "
bad,The Pharmacy Manager was an undiagnosed Bipolar and A Bully  never work in an abusive environment. It will scar you for A lifetime. You will need therapy if you stay .
bad,I did not the midnight schedule. there was no other available schedule. the training was horrible. The employees were not friendly. I will not work for this company again.
bad,Walgreens was a great place to work at the beginning and then things started to change. They didn't care about their employees and started cuttng hours. The open door policy didnt apply. I wouldn't recommend that anyone apply.
bad,Store manager did not tell employees in advance about lay off when 24 hr closed even though we knew.. Offered no condolences. Needs better leadership.
bad,this was one of my worst job experiences. The managers would cut my hours to give to themselves or their friends. I was forced to work 4hr shifts at night and had to face the whole front of the store within that time being the only person ringing up people. many strange druggies and agressive people come off of the street and try to rob you and follow you to your car. if i felt in danger and called the manager they would ignore my call or hide in the pharmacy the entire shift. we had no security. i felt so unsafe due to men memorizing my schedule by coming everyday looking for me and asking employees what days i work and the employees giving strangers my schedule. The managers were disrespectful always and would write me up in secret and lie in the reports and try to force me to sign things.
bad,"i dont acctually have mroe to say on the topic. is not a great job but its not the worst ive had either"
bad,"avoid this company."
bad,The worse job I could have! Lots of shoplifters in an out ! No security! Danger ! Poor management. Horrible place to work and long hours. If you apply to a shift lead sometimes you can take breaks because you are alone on the floor
bad,"Worked here for 14 years and by the time I left I was so stressed out every day I would cry every night when I got home and I hated just to pull in the parking lot to start my shift. If you don't suck up to the bosses, you are criticized and treated unfairly. Do not apply at Walgreens!"
bad,they lie to you about promotions that never happen the management team is unorganized the customers suck and pharmacy is the worse i do not want to work for this company ever again
bad,"Walgreens is the definition of a large corporation with only executives and policy setters interests in mind. If you want to work in a place that continually increases goals and demands, while giving you less and less time, help, and benefits to accomplish these things, this is the company for you. They do not care about staff at the store level or what the working environment actually is, just about increasing prescriptions filled and maximizing profit. All management operates under the corporate brainwash philosophy, or they won't be around long. I'm still not sure how they get around federal labor laws for pharmacists. No breaks, no lunches, 13 hour shifts multiple days in a row. I have worked for this company for 23+ years and have only had vacation time decreased, my 401k contributions negligently distributed leading to substandard retirement funds, and work conditions deteriorating by the day. Think twice before joining their 'team'."
bad,"Managers only care about you when it’s survey time because it only benefits them.  They do not reply in a timely manner to your email requests.  You are watched constantly, even if you get up to go to the bathroom. Equipment is always broken."
bad,"No the place to work, especially on a closing shift. You get less people and have way more work. Plus to many call off’s , so you never catch up, and you always have double the work. They will work you like a dog with cheap raises . And all the asmt’s are fresh out of college, never worked a day in the retail field. So shift leads trying to get promoted takes ten years or more, vs some rookie yahoo."
bad,Doesnt give any incentives and absolutely NO wage increases !!!! I have been an employee since technically 2015 and have only received $1.75 increase in four yrs yet cost of living including Walgrenens prices continue to rise
bad,"Pay is very low but yet you are expected to do EVERYTHING in the store!!!! This place is the true definition of OVERWORKED & UNDERPAID!!!!! The store manager plays favorites with her managers and also hires people that aren't  qualified only because it benefits her personally. I would NEVER recommend anyone to work at the store in Little Elm, TX!!"
bad,"to demanding on selling at register and duties, does not give reqired brakes. The homeless people are scary and lots of confrontations and stealing. Management ignores you unless you are pushed in to additional duties thy put on you. It is worse then a prison setting, they are to controling and demands you to work late until 1130pm then  schedules you for 630am next day and you can get fired for 4 call ins even so. Yucky place to be stuck in just to pay your bills."
bad,Very fast paced enjoy working there and meeting new people also helping the elderly keeping the store in clean and orderly manner work at more thann one location
bad,"They fired me just before my 10th anniversary. I loved my job when I was first hired, for about a year or so. Once the last of the Walgreen family left the company, they turned into every other ""corporate greed"" type of company. Always walking the thin line with our hours and jeapordizing our benefits. They became another sleazy corp. bowing to profit over employees."
bad,No help from coworkers Manager preferences no security and cutting hrs. Experience worse customers ever. I won’t ever recommend anyone to work for Walgreens....
bad,Hate that job- always stressful- people steal- boss lies to you- unappreciated- go anywhere else and be happy-upper management does not care about your concern
bad,Horrible company to work for. They don’t care about their employees and the management is awful. I learned nothing that would help me in any other job.
bad,"Too much work, low pay, arrogant managers, rude and racist leadership, co-workers and leadership are sexist, being the only man working there at night they put me to work hard like a mule while everyone else sat and gossiped all day at the photo counter, the people that work at Walgreens are ghetto and low class, please do not work here, I left for these same reasons, Walgreens is going downhill, there closing mad stores!"
bad,"Lies and more lies . Job description is nothing that you're actually doing,  cold calling solicitations is what it is. Supervisors never took calls they just care about numbers so they can get a bonus."
bad,I absolutely do not recommend working here for Walgreens. You're extremely underpaid and under appreciated. No raises and no over time. Over worked and always on your feet with no lunch breaks
bad,"Depending on the position, the hours are long and not very flexible.  You given intra-company learning opportunities and requirements but no time to utilize the system to take advantage of the opportunities.  Walgreens, in my experience, is more interested in store procedures (i.e.: stocking shelves etc) than providing good customer service."
bad,Walgreens was my first job. I wasn’t supposed to stay as long as I did. I was a good cross trained employee that worked hard for a company that didn’t deserve it. I was underpaid & overworked. No raises. I did the work of a manager without the pay. This company has gone down the drain since the first year I started. Don’t do it. Horrible management. All the good people have up and left only the bad ones are still there.
bad,"Working for Walgreen's is TERRIBLE!!! The only reason I stay is because I like my schedule. But , otherwise manager s don't ever tell you when"
bad,"This company will suck the life out of you and leave you to be a dying rotting corpse. They work their employees to the bone with horrible pay and even worse insurance benefits. If their multitude of demands are not met even in the slightest, they will make your time employed with them unbearable. There is NO team, just what the corporate puppets desire. They allow the customers to abuse the employees and incentivise the abuse by giving gift cards for “their horrible experience” when in reality nothing wrong was done. I suggest staying away from this company unless you enjoy being abused by upper management and customers everyday, then by all means, do you."
bad,Never ever recommend working there no work life balance management is much to be desired rude ignorant only concerned with themselves. If you don’t make rate or accuracy your fired... This was a place orginally to help people work with disabilities .thats not the case at all. Revolving door people in and out of there.
bad,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE  management at Walgreens Sabattus St. Lewiston Maine. The store manager and assistant manager are the worst people I have ever met or worked for. They lied and do absolutely nothing while they throw their responsibility onto their shift leaders. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK because of who's in charge."
bad,"I have Worked for Walgreens for 10 years "
bad,Basically don’t work here. The managers suck so much. Nothing gets done EVER. Everyone is so rude with some people being friendly. I hate it and I don’t get paid enough. Period sis anyways don’t do it I’m watching out for you guys I’m just saying
bad,The store manager never listens to employee complaints. If you aren't one of her friends then she doesn't give a ... about u. She plays favorites and had her BFF working as the ASM and another one in the pharmacy. The pharmacy manager just graduated college and doesn't know how to properly run it. Customers constantly complain about everything.Whatever you do just RUN!!
bad,"Worked many years for this company.  I would love to continue, but the way it is going, that doesn't seem likely.  They are going through a lot of changes and they really don't seem to know how to go about it.  They talk about customer service, but remove all the tools to allow you to do it and then hold you accountable (their favorite weapon) if you make any missteps. Avoid this company at all costs (unless you are a masochist)."
bad,"Nothing good to say, staff and management one sided. Lot of responsibility for low pay. Was part time and got less hours. Dirty place too. Would not work for them if called back."
bad,"Disappointing. Chaotic and stressful environment with incompetent staff that added to the dysfunction of the workplace. Not a livable wage. Absolutely no effective loss prevention which furthers the bad reputation Walgreens has left with me,"
bad,"Sexist bosses, no real training, always felt like someone was pushing their foot on my head, keeping me from advancing. Need 41 more letters so just filling in"
bad,Walgreens is out for themselves. I made them good money. Brung in Customers. I was Customer Satisfaction. Customers still ask for me. They denied my unemployment. Retirement. All I worked. Hard for to achieve. For 15 years.  Their Crooks.
bad,"This company is a J O K E!!! How can you say that you care about your workers when you cut hours like its a sport. How is ANYONE supposed to live or pay bills when you keep cutting hours? Management is a joke with all the personal issues they have going on that they bring into the workplace. People steal like its nothing, just overall a horrible company. I have NEVER worked for a company that takes away money like they do. I'm giving them until mid August to get their stuff together or I'm leaving this company."
bad,"When I first started at Walgreens it was great but now it as gone downhill "
bad,"I worked at Walgreens for 11 years ."
bad,Constantly under staffed. Raises don't even keep up with inflation. If you get sick or get hurt at work and have to miss any days they will take away your paid time off hours to put towards the time you missed. I 100 percent do not recommend anybody work for Walgreens. They could not care less about you or your family
bad,It used to be a great place to work but change of management have turn the company into the worst place to ever work at never been in such a bigger bunch idiots
bad,"If you are seriously considering working for Walgreens, please take the time to read this review. I worked at a Walgreens store close to my house for over two years. The work environment was depressing, toxic, miserable, and draining. Why? The main problem is starting at the top with the money-hungry executives. Walgreens is constantly cutting the budgets, including payroll. The stores are almost always understaffed and each employee has to do the work of two-three people. Long lines, angry customers, and stressed out employees is typical when you work here. Additionally, the pay is awful. I got paid the same per hour as the new hires even though I'd been there two years and had more responsibilities than my peers. Although my store manager (who happened to be a good manager) told me I was an excellent employee, I never once received a raise. ""Corporate"" has to approve all raises apparently. Because employees are so busy, there is typically no time for cleaning/maintaining the work place. Let me tell you, my store was FILTHY. There was dust and dirt everywhere, bathrooms were disgusting and smelled bad, and there was even a rodent problem. Outdates were never prioritized, so expired food was often on the shelves (I found eggs expired by a month in the cooler.) Finally, management can be rude and power-hungry. While most of the managers got along with me, I saw some mistreat my co-workers. They were also very unprofessional and would come to me about their personal problems/issues with other employees. It put me in a very difficult position, because I didn't want to gossip about"
bad,"Over worked,under paid,unappreciative, most management used to hit on me most locations I ever worked. No room for growth. NO line between the customer is always right vs. just being treated like garbage, you just had to take it with a smile. I came in bright eyed and eager to work. I left with my soul and spirit crushed and hating people in general. I would never work for Walgreens again. "
bad,It isn't for someone that is seeking something part time. The hours keep getting slashed and part timers just lost more benefits. On top of that you could go literally anywhere else and make more starting than you would at Walgreens. Growth and advancement above a shift lead position is a joke. I have seen this company keep jerking around several assistant managers and assistant managers in training about getting promoted to store managers a few times. It's really sad. Then even if you do get promoted to a store manager I hope you're prepared to work extra because they don't give you enough hours or staff to work with so you catch up and work way too much or let your store fail. I wouldn't recommend Walgreens to anyone. It's fine if you want something to do as an old timer or maybe a kid if desperate but I feel you have better options.
bad,"My experience working there started off well it was a good first-time job when it comes to experience. that being said the job started off well at first but the pressures of the company and disorganized nature in the ways things were done led it to be stressful. Things that could not always be accomplished based on the business of the branch could not get them to hire more people so inconsistent hours, as well as inconsistent days, was something I had to deal with. as well as lack of proper trained that led to more strain on the job and miscommunication."
bad,Walgreens is a very cheap company when it came to paying their technicians. Not to mention the pharmacy technicians completed most of the work. There were only a few pharmacist willing to conduct team work anytime. It's like the give the manager jobs to anyone with a PharmD.
bad,The management does not care about employees welfare. The break room is filthy and rest room is not well maintained for employees nor customers.  Walgreens makes all the profit
bad,This is the worst company I have ever worked for. The management is horrible. They expect you to take emotional abuse from customers and they get mad if you need time after a call. 0 stars horrible place!
bad,So I worked for this company for 6 plus years and while Walgreens has very flexible scheduling and very close to where I live which was nice they really don’t pay well and we seemed to have high turnover and have consistent long lines not enough help and just the customer clientel is rough.
bad,"Not safe, no living wages,the majority of workers still depend on food stamps and medical card, not up graded ,constant equipment malfunctions,  management horribly lack leadership skills, leadership staff very inconsistent."
bad,"They love starting new programs!  They change job titles, and shift people around a lot.  Each time you get a pay cut or lose benefits.  Stay away from this career killer.  Go Team Crowe."
bad,Poor management! Lots of fast paced work with very little pay! They don’t work with you’re schedule and there is a lot of favoritism! Very disappointed in the environment!
bad,"Work culture is terrible. Store managers & all upper management positions have been leaving the company past 3 years due to the crazy changes. Past 4 years the stock has shot down from 90$ to 50$. Company is constantly getting fined because of the poor Corporate management, there's been turnaround in every position from Corporate positions all the way down to store level. Great opportunity for people looking to move up fast but with all the fines the company has been paying they're just slashing more and more budgets and expecting more and more. Customer service is such a focus but it is actually not forecasted in the budget. WHOEVER  is doing the budget is not doing their job. Tell me why we still have positions to for picking new locations when we haven't been actively building and just buying into other companies. Tell me why we got rid of the position who train managers and now hire managers from outside the company with no real structure in training them? COMPANY is literally on FIRE.  Bonus no longer exists and tiering system won't get you the pay you want. There's so many better jobs/companies in Austin. The DM, DPR, and RVP better realize that before we start seeing these store burn down to the ground."
bad,"This was the absolute worst job Ive had. They show favoritism and if they dont like you, you get all the night shifts and the worst load no one wants."
bad,"I had been at Walgreens for months, recently had got sick and had to have surgery done, they told me it would be excused and for me to keep them up to date with everything! I did as they told me to and the day before I was supposed to return back to work I got a phone call saying I was fired, keep in mind I turned in doctor excuses and EVERYTHING, left several voicemails with my function lead that rarely returned my phone calls. Had I known I was going to get fired for having surgery I wouldn’t have just went ahead and quit!"
bad,"They will never give you the shift that you need. They refuse to be flexible. They need over time EVERY day but still will not give morning shift. As a mother of two and a wife trying to work full time and have a family...this job is awful. Managers NEVER respond to your emails, only when it is beneficial to them. Requests go unnoticed. You also never know if you are doing your job correctly because the training. Is terrible and they never call you to help you do your job right. Rant over"
bad,I would pass on working for this organization. everyone calls in and their work becomes your work. Always short handed. If you like dealing with 1500 customers a day and long lines and not getting your break than this is the place for you!
bad,"There are little to no opportunities to move in any direction within the company. Staff is underpaid and over worked. Work environment is toxic with constant verbal abuse from customers. Management watches your every move. You can't even use the bathroom at will. Work from home employees are expected to provide an office space with a phone line and are given no compensation for the out of pocket expense, its not even tax deductible, but certain departments are required to work from home. There are no opportunities to switch departments. When openings become available they hire from outside."
bad,Very unorganized customers are so rude low pay no benefits never steady hours thus no health benefits managers and techs always on the phone techs always fighting to fill so they dont have to deal with customers so if your the New hire goodluck managers dont intervene ....for example this regular heavy set indian customer of the pharmacy skips the whole line of the pharmacy and goes to the counter and demands someone helps her (no she didnt have express pass) the cashier send no and the heavy set indian lady started being very rude calling the cashier fat as and blatantly cuss her out the manager literally 1-2 steps away its a small pharmacy manager just acts like nothing is happening arent you suppose to help esp as a manager to calm down the situation no she gets her phone and start texting stupid as
bad,"The location I was at, had a beyond strict manager and owner and would favor some employees over others. I was given absolutely NO accomodations while I was working at 8 months pregnant despite doctor's notes"
bad,Management seems to constantly be on  power trip. They require you to do too much and guilt you into doing more if you cant manage to get everything done in time. I have been with the company for three years and get paid the same as someone on day one which is really unmotivating. They do not hold anyone accountable and overwork those that actually work hard and dont punish the lazy employees. Can't wait to leave this horrible company.
bad,Always cutting hours so there’s never enough staff. Certain staff call out all the time. Unfair scheduling. Tired of picking up slack. One pharmacist too slow.
bad,Wasn’t a good fit with people who are parents and management didn’t fix issues in the store. They pay less then they should for the amount of work you put in.
bad,The manager is at best incompetent he puts everything on his ASMT without regard to whether she knows how to do it or not. As a shift lead you are constantly being ridiculed about your job performance whether you do an outstanding job or not. When you file a complaint you are brushed aside by ER as they will always take the managers side. Even if the manager is calling his employees malicious names.
bad,If you’re African American just don’t even apply here .  I had to do all of the work while all of the Hispanic workers and managers sat in the office .  They will treat you poorly if you’re not Hispanic .they will talk about you behind your back and say sarcastic things to you . Just don’t apply here nor work for them .
bad,"I worked with Walgreens from fall 2015 to fall 2018. From what I understand, things used to be a lot better, but my experience in particular was horrendous. High stress environment, managers and shift leads becoming tyrannical, demeaning and totally unprofessional, and unbelievable cost - and hours - cutting from corporate. They pile on tons of work, yet cut their stores down to skeleton crews. Not to mention selling cigarettes even though other pharmacies have ceased doing so. Apparently money is more important than actual health to Walgreens."
bad,"I had the pleasure of working for THE WORST boss that I’ve ever had in my entire life. She would rarely take the time to provide me with any type of feedback and I only saw her 5 times over the course of more than half a year. When I actually got some feedback from her, it’s like she made it all up because she didn’t even take the time to observe me while I did the job. Her method of instruction was to accuse individuals of some type of misconduct, ignore the persons perspective, devalue their opinion, and then inquire how they feel about working there. Say what?! Of course I don’t think it was a good place to work at. Try getting suspended and being refused an explanation as to why you got suspended. Absolute worst experience at a job that I ever had. That boss was incredibly untrustworthy, dishonest, and exceptionally two-faced."
bad,"I would not recommend this awful place to work. This is really the only job in the surrounding area. Management is terrible, low, high stress, never have time for yourself and your needs, this job consumes your life, no room for advancement. You have to brown nose to get ahead. Watch out for the snitches up there that will tell on you for frivolous stuff for wearing certain clothes, not wearing a bra, and other silly stuff. Schedules they give you are terrible and you have to be high ranking to get a good schedule. You don't get raises and there are pay discrepancies between agents even though we all do the same job. Some management is very childish, immature, mean, and unprofessional. Their attendance policy is the worst and they don't accept doctor's notes so you'll always have the fear of being fired for attendance. You get 10 days to miss and after that they fire you."
bad,"""I wouldn't be here or care about this place if i didn't get"" this is what my store manager told me the first time i tried to leave the company. I was a shift supervisor your Gonna be treated poorly by most people the site manager will always be smiling cuz they work 8 to 4 m-f and half time are at corporate meetings where they pat themselves on the back for hiring goals 95% of the company is hitting. Just don't."
bad,I did not care for the managment there. i worked all women who were lazy and wanted me to do everthing with no reward.  the winter condions were cold and long. the customers were awful
bad,Being an assistant store manager was essentially a babysitting job for adults who make minimum wage and hate their job. Older employees complained about how low the pay was and how overworked they were. One employee had been there 10 years and was making less then $10 an hour! Younger employees didn't care if they did things right. We had a girl who gave a customer $80 more then she was supposed to but didn't get fired because the store manager liked her. Store was chronically understaffed and any mistake was blamed on managers. Punishment was given based how much store manager personally liked someone. Leaving this place behind felt incredibly liberating.
bad,"It was my first job. The managers were never nice to me, I always did what I was supposed to but never got credit for anything. They worked me so much more then I told them I could. It was a good first job experience but never again."
bad,"If you work in the front end, expect insane hour cuts while they throw pointless meetings at you to improve their numbers.  They have unrealistic expectations, and just cut hours and people non stop. The people are great, but the corporate side is lacking."
bad,"Lack of true leadership "
bad,"Budget cuts, hiring freezes, low morale. Therefore, not enough flexibility and people are overworked for the amount of money they pay out. Unfortunate...the company wasn't this bad three years ago. Please allow more people on one shift. Pay us more. Taking back our PTO and other time even though we work so many hours. Even said that Im not eligible for benefits despite working so many hours a week."
bad,"Not very friendly people."
bad,no good work life balance. work all holidays and weekends. not enough floor staff to help out so your'e doing most of the job on your own. Raises are very minimal
bad,They will try to find anyway to get you fired if your making to much money. They don't back the employees when management is doing something wrong. They don't give you job security like they are suppose to. They don't put you in for the correct leaves. They make sure they don't give you enough hours to get your FMLA benefits when needed. This company is a complete scam. They don't care if the employees are sick or injured as long as you show up to work. They don't care if you have a sick child. They work you like slaves and pay little to nothing.
bad,I have been promised to be put in the pharmacy.  I haven't been able to go back.  Management doesn't communicate with the employees. It's an alright job.
bad,"Management was a joke. Store manager did nothing all day but sit in her office and eat. We had security cameras, but not for shop lifters. But to watch employees and tell them what to do, whilst doing nothing herself. The only time you saw her was when she had a visitor, or when she was leaving early. She allowed the assistant store manager to gossip with team leads and mistreat anyone under them. They allowed shoplifting, but checked employees personal belongings before they could leave the store. Overall, it's a miserable place and you don't want to work there."
bad,"Management was horrible. You’re treated like you’re just a number, they don’t value their employees. Sometimes you have to work a closing shift then open the store, which is exhausting. The pay was subpar. However, Walgreens is a great job for students and it is easy to transfer."
bad,nothing worth talking about really place was good when I started but just went down hill and heard it keeps getting worse still shop there and love most people I worked with but not the best place to work
bad,"Srtict corprate rules, with very little cocerne for the little guys, new managment all the time due to corporate rulings. Very bad energy place to work with non realistic goals. Customers were allowed to steal. And if your tried to do anything you would get terminated instantly. Due to the high theft prices were raised, with un realistic sales goals. I wouldnt recommend for anyone long term"
bad,Beauty Consultant job is all about sales.  The job is not what you sign up for. The sales pressure is stressful and you will have to explain why you didn’t meet your goals.  Then you will be asked to go in to the community to drum up sales. This is not a place for a licensed Cosmetologist.
bad,"All they care about is handing out surveys and getting stuff done. Your just a number not a valued employee. There is a huge lack of communication and many projects are left unfinished for the next person and not communicated what needs to be done. They push you to hand out whats called a buck slip which is a survey which is connected to the costumers receipt and the only reason they care is because it all reflects on the manager. There is never any true recognition for hard work and productiveness. You get paid minimum but for the amount that you do it is not worth the wage. The hours suck and compared to Pharmacy is unfair, for example on Memorial day the pharmacy was closed all day but the store was opened their normal hours which that day were 7am-10pm. Overall this is a temporary last resort place to work. I will say not everything was bad because i did enjoy some of my coworkers and they did partake in me waiting to put my 2 weeks in but the 25% off walgreens brand and brands connected to walgreens and the 15% off all other brands excluding dairy products, alcohol and tobacco was not worth the 9 months i wasted working there. If i could give it 0 stars i would."
bad,Management  never had anyone other then myself or assistant managers alcohol certified which caused me unable to take a lunch on more then one occasion. Also know coverage in case of emergencies. I twisted my ankle and they demanded I go into work regardless if I had a cast on or not.
bad,walgreens needs to treat employees with respectand the employyes who have been there for a long time should be in a program to move up in the company  if they wanted to.Also walgreens should be close major holidays so employees can spend time with their families.
bad,"This company is not a place I would recommend to anyone pay is horrible benefits ok.  Managers ohh wait team leaders yeah dumb, but you get what ya pay for ehhh Walgreens"
bad,"Not a good place to work for a career. They try to find something on you to let you go and hire someone for lesser pay wage. Management is poor on leadership,"
bad,The front store manager targets employees with the help of the pharmacy manager. They have recently targeted two employees and are trying to get them terminated/fired. A few months back they succeeded at firing a long time employee they targeted. This oh s NOT a company or store location (NORTH EASTON MA) you want to work for!
bad,Not very challenging.  I enjoy a good challenge that I can overcome and pursue a better  paying job. Stability is also important that was not the case here.
bad,"No hours,overbearing managers, and youre required to do the job of 3 people on one minimum wage salary. Managers schedule themselves on holidays so they'll get overtime and not the cashiers."
bad,"Not good pay other places hiring for a lot more.  no advancement even after 2 years and asking for full time and day shifts. stressful,  because we do not know the system no help in learning the system not there long enough to learn the system customers complain."
bad,More like the Walmart of pharmacy. Walgreens will cut costs in every possible way they can. Employee moral is very low and there is a lot of micro managing. I highly would not suggest working here if you want to have any type of happiness in your life. Constant conference calls on my day off and management giving conflicting information are 2 of the most annoying things.
bad,This company has went down hill in the 17 years that I have worked for it.  Employees lost many perks and benefits when the stock market fell. Six months later the stock prices where higher than before the fall. Employees never received any thing back. Hours and staffing has been cut to the point that work expected far outweighs the actual work that can be accomplished.
bad,"If you want to be a regular Walgreens cashier that’s also required/heavily forced to sell certain products that corporate chooses  & maybe rarely get commission because you will be too busy checking out the rude, nasty, ignorant people with their 1,000 coupons for the 1,000 items that aren’t beauty related then yes you might like this job 😊 your corporate trainings will be a joke & if you have an actual cosmetic experience you will see that."
bad,"Lots of favortism, bad mouthing employees in front of other employees. Very hostile work environment. Go somewhere else. Will not let you finish your hours. Lack of stability."
bad,Terrible place to work. Management lies to you and talks about you behind your back. Unrealistic goals for employees and abuses you if you work hard. Work place ever to work. Don’t recommend anyone to work here ever  Pendergrass Georgia location. 3rd shift is the worst. They make you load 2 sometimes 3 trailers at once. Boxes constantly coming down the line. Don’t have any breaks. Work for 4 hours get 20 min break. Don’t let you leave until 2 min after break is called. You basically get a 12 min break. Have to be back at your trailers 2 min before break is over. Upper management are abusive to their workers and make the younger people do the hard work while the older ones who’ve been there a while get one trailer and an easy shift every night.
bad,Never want to work for them again. Don't care about employees or customers and only care about bottom line profits. Getting worse as time goes by and job security has gone out the window.
bad,"There is no loyalty with this heartless company. They took over our office after they bought out our small hometown infusion company. From the minute they came on board, it was all the worst of corporate America. Even worse, they then brought another company on board called Option Care to ""streamline"" and essentially gut the company for monetary gain, forcing more and more work on their remaining employees while pulling away every possible benefit they could legally. Their bottom line is all about money. Not their employees. And not patient care. I was ""let go"" after 20 years of past service when they decided to ""restructure.""  This is some of the worst of big American business....I cant imagine what else they could do to make it even more miserable to work for them, but they always find a way to ensure that happens!"
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, customers were awful as was management. Working on Christmas, and all holidays as Walgreens is never closed. Must be in the clique also to get any sort of good hours and not treated poorly."
bad,I work front-register and I show up and I immediately want to leave. It's a god-awful place to work at and work for. My manager is an idiot who doesn't have a single clue on how to schedule properly.
bad,Everything is wrong. From the unorganized first start day all the way down to the managers. I’d never think working for a big coloration as Walgreens would rank the same of my third party jobs. It’s sad. Never again.
bad,Bad management in Lexington SC on sunset blvd . Will never give you hours that you deserve and lies. Been there for 5 months and was ready to leave after January! Show favoritism will not train and expect you to know so much and then get mad when you dont. Worst job EVER!!!!
bad,I didn’t like working at Walgreens. People were mean and condescending. It is not a place where anyone would want to work. I am sorry I have had this terrible experience.
bad,"I was here for 5 years if you do apply make this temporary, the company changes every day with new rules, I quit due to very low pay and extra work..."
bad,"Overall Wallgreen is a convenient place for quick necessary shopping. Pharmacy is doing an important role, to help customers and especially patients in need."
bad,"I applied when I was stuck in a strange city desperate for work with no car and there was a Walgreens within walk of where I was living."
bad,New corporate ownership takes from employees to increase bottom line. Company moving toward a mobile part time workforce. Not good for company’s customer service expectations.
bad,Pay with all the expected hrs worked came out to around $10 per hour plan on working with insubordinate lowlifes who think just because they show up for work they deserve a paycheck management totally unsupportive district manager not a clue what she's doing
bad,I’m a single mother of a two year old and my boss constantly told me I had no choice but to work every Saturday until 12am when I had told him I couldn’t I told him I could do every other but he told me no. And he always put me on with a woman who constantly made racist remarks and he did nothing. I will always put my family before my job and this job made me so exhausted to the point where I’d barley have time with my child
bad,"I worked for Walgreens 5 years. The first manager I had was awesome, but after I moved stores, I began to notice the company was changing for the worst. Corporate can't give a rat's behind about it's employees. They need to hire management that actually cares about people. If I died one day, my manager would just be worried about finding a replacement. They shouldn't hire managers that don't care."
bad,"Poor management, treat you poorly, safety is non existent. All new implemented policies make working there horrible. They dont care about their employees at all just themselves. If you are a good worker, RUN!"
bad,"the pressure at work is too much.  they only give you three times to go to the bathroom, they do not give part time, they do not accept doctor's notes as an excuse, you get sick and faults, you're fired .."
bad,"Super stressful, lots of work for low pay and the manager at the sugar mountain location is horrible to work for. She’ll treat you unfairly and like you’re in elementary school."
bad,Days are aggressive and business and the compensation was very very poor. The scheduling was all over the place and that makes it impossible to have life outside of work.
bad,Left the company a few years ago because of restructuing in the company my pay was cut dramacally so I resigned. Was ask to come back to the company at a certain pay rate so I agreed to come back but when I received my first check I did the math and it did not add up so I ask my DM what happened to the pay I was supposed to get he said that he wasn't able to give me that amount. Really really so you lied to me
bad,I had an horrible experience. The pharmacy manager was extremely unprofessional. I will never work for walgreens again. It was a horrible experience for me. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company.
bad,"I worked for them for over 17 years. At first a great company to work for. I loved my job. Then little by little they started chipping away. Started in corporate. Trickled down to taking every possible benefit away from the employees in the store. You name it, they did it. Hours cut, vacation cut. Benefits cut."
bad,"Walgreens is a costumer oriented company. So much in fact that they continue adding new projects for the employees to take on without taking away or slacking off on other projects. They do not really give the opportunity for growth and in my area the pay is below the national median for compensation to others in the same field. The lack of flexibility and working with the employees can be stressful and make like outside of the company hard to deal with. I feel as if they wanted a better work morale they would find a way to raise the spirits of the employees. With the lack of proper compensation and the non flexible hours it makes it a hard place for adults, such as single parents to work."
bad,I worked there for almost a year and it was horrible. The promise of being moved off the register and learning new things was a joke. Management just sat in the back and didnt do anything.
bad,Manager constantly out and lead pharmacist was not much help during the internship. Had to rely more on the lead pharmacist to answer any questions I had about the position
bad,"I’ve worked at the Walgreens on howdershell in Florissant MO. I literally have given my all the short time I was there and did everything they’ve asked me to do and they wrongfully terminated me for no reason at all.Racism was is a big issue here as well as favoritism. I love my job, got no customer complaints, and had gotten their performance score up and they repaid me and my children with a big fat f me. Trust me YOU WILL NOT LAST LONG HERE. No matter what you do."
bad,"The culture of the team I worked on was challenging."
bad,"I never liked working at Walgreens I didn’t feel confórmale the mangers were really rude and disrespectful , sometimes I would have fun but sometimes I wouldn’t"
bad,"YOU DO TOO MUCH TEDIOUS WORK FOR VERY LITTLE PAY AND HOURS!!! "
bad,"Retail jobs typically don't pay well.  That doesn't excuse not paying well, that just means that a large number of companies don't believe their employees deserve to both eat and pay rent in the same month at any point in time.  Walgreens is absolutely one of those companies.  They spend a ton of time and money on ""employee engagement"" to prevent total mutiny or having to pay you enough to live on."
bad,My co worker's were good people and I was happy to know them. They were like my second family . I liked it when people were happy with what I did for them and they always came back.
bad,"Walgreens has no concern for employees’ wellbeing. They expect too much cleaning from pharmacy. Pharmacy management engages in gossip concerning patients and co workers. Don’t expect your 2 15 minute breaks; they will be denied even with extenuating circumstances. Unprofessional conduct and favoritism displayed among employees and store locations. Varying pharmacy conduct conflicting employee conduct. Also, judgment towards with controlled prescriptions. Expired dairy & food/drink products occurs frequently. Overall most disturbing pharmacy conduct. Expects employees to fill prescriptions with pills even if they’re dropped on the ground."
bad,"Horrible work/life balance, management only cares when corporate is coming to the store. Horrible place to work, ask an ex employee, or even the ones there only through a contract."
bad,"horrible place, bad pay, poor management. horrible employees. customers are even worse. was miserable. no no no no. goodnight good nue 150 characters im out"
bad,the work-life balance is terrible the management is terrible the pay does not match the responsibilities you are responsible for they make you work till 11 p.m. just to schedule you at 7 a.m. the next day corporate doesn't give a poo about its workers not to mention the heat and radio level is controlled by corporate
bad,When I first started working at Walgreens I worked a part time shift overnight and did not feel safe. One night I had a gentleman follow me into the bathroom saying that he was looking for his girlfriend cigarettes she believed to have left. I informed him there was nothing in there to leave and he did so. I told management about this situation and they seem to do nothing about it. I transferred stores and shifts working the day shift. At the new store it was good the manager was a very professional and good leader in the workplace. They then got a new assistant manager who seemed to be the complete opposite. Eventually with her being there the workplace went downhill and seem to be very toxic. She eventually got the manager fired and weary hired a new manager who seemed to be just like her. Long story short the workplace went downhill and employees started quitting and leaving left and right
bad,"DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY! This company cares less for it's employees than any ive ever seen. Management is an absolute nightmare unless you get very very lucky. Corporate ONLY CARES ABOUT QUARTERLY NUMBERS! you go to lunch an hour after you get there, they DO NOT give breaks, and its non stop customers in . your face. Your coworkers will be nice but ALWAYS stressed. they cut hours and make employees suffer to cover quarterly losses. I HATED this job. im warning you now this is a terrible company to work for. the only thing that is important is how they look to investors so get ready to get screwed if you apply here!"
bad,"Job is ok, nothing special "
bad,"company has lost its vision , it does not value employees any longer , you would do better working at mcdonalds its turnover is awful , you cant keep employees because they ask to much for 10 bucks an hour"
bad,"To much drama can't focus on your task. Nothing don't ever be done about it. Overall job was amazing. But no structure. "
bad,"You can't grow with the company, you either stay as a tech or become a senior tech which takes years. They underpay their techs with all the work that is needed. A great foundation job when a tech is out of school or with a trainee license."
bad,Horrible place to work. You are a slave to the company.  Mandatory overtime with no notice. They actually call the employees children and treat them as if they are children. Management only cares about making their own numbers. Heavy favoritism. You never get the vacation time you actually want. Black Friday to Christmas expect to work 14-16 hours a day 6 days a week.
bad,I worked ther for a year as a shift manager they lowballed me in pay offering only 13 an hour I stayed there for a year after 6 months I started looking for another job I got excepted at another job and my boss at Walgreens asked me if I pay you 15 an hour will you stay which is 2 dollars less then what the other job was offering me but since I would be saving that 2 in gas I stayed worst mistake ever DO NOT WORK FOR WALGREEN'S ESPECIALLY THE ONE IN FRIDLEY MINNESOTA
bad,"no tech hours or support staff, drive through is a detriment to the profession, difficult to use vacation days, you have to work weekends, pay is decent though"
bad,"Did not give enough time for family, they don't follow their company strategies.  Promote many that should not be promoted and then do not get rid of those that need to be terminated from the company."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work at, things may seem peachy at the start but, no matter how long you have worked there, if you're new, they're going to continue to treat you like you're new. And if you are in the pharmacy program trying to make your way in, good luck because they'll take that right away from you without reason for the tiniest slip up."
bad,"A typical day would be cashiering, dealing with customers, answering phones, and stocking. Work can get very repetitive. I enjoyed working with my coworkers the most."
bad,all they do is play favorites and disregard any thing you say if you are not the favorite of your store manager they don't follow their own policies and have little regard for the rules or whats morally correct
bad,"They don’t care about their employees or shift leads, they barely train you thenjust leave you to the dogs and  expect  You too learn everything on your own and get mad when you don’t know something. The hours are  ridiculous part time workers only work 17 hours but if your a favorite you get more hours. Managers sit around and talk about employees it’s not enough workers and they give you like 50 task to complete with only 2 or 3 people working a shift"
bad,the hardest part about working at walgreens in the pharmacy was always being short staffed. it would just be me and the pharmacist on the weekends with no breaks.
bad,"I loved working at Walgreens in Cutrus Heights but Napa was like night and day. "
bad,This company use to be a great employer but with new leadership comes drastic changes in culture. They do not care about their employees. Particularly their minorities ones. They do everything to prevent you from moving up in the company.  If you are considering working for this company DO NOT!!!!! The best decision I ever made was leaving this terribly run company. Check back with them in 5 years and they will be hanging on by a thread. Rite Aid purchase put the company into significant debt. Their idea of innovation is cut cut cut so if this is your idea of a great company go ahead but if not stay far and clear away.
bad,"Horrible place to work, very hostile environment. The only way to get a promotion is with bribery. The harder you work the more you're treated like dirt."
bad,Walgreens is not interested in helping their employees improve themselves. They even decided that their pharmacists do not need raises because they are replaceable.
bad,There isn't any good thing I can say about this company! They lie to you and lead you to believe that are working with you but in the end you find out that they are only doing things for themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't get ahead and if your not kissing the right butt your not ever getting any help whatsoever when you need it unless its helps them!
bad,money is all they care about. masking it behind a good for people is rubbish. next targets are people with cancer. sell them over priced meds and cosmetics.
bad,You get the lame end of the stick in this company. They will find anything to let you go. They don't care about you. They continue to cut positions and so It's impossible to move up. They're going bankrupt and so they punish the workers. They hire idiots and fire the actual good workers. The employee discount is a joke. They never give enough hours to receive benefits. They give out inconsistent schedules. Just sucks.
bad,Awful company to work for. Management only cares about the  bottom dollar. They do not care about the employees who actually do the work. The people who sit behind the desks no nothing about the actual doings in the stores and refuse to do anything about actual complaints and problems. Over work employees and refuse to get adequate help as it doesn't affect them.
bad,Basically they want you to work long hours but not enough to put you at full-time but when you do get the insurance for working those hours they want to down your hours so even if you’re paying for the insurance you lose it because you’re not working full-time hours!  Now that they start you out $10 an hour you do not get a raise after three months and they have taken cosmetics and photo person out so you’re not just a cashier you’re running the entire store most the time by yourself because of being shorthanded!  While you’re trying to do all of that they will bring your truck so you can unload stuff to the shelves they never want you to skip your 30 minute lunch but be prepared to never get your 15 mkn breaks! This doesn’t count working your bays that you get graded one but never get relief to work on them! You get told to do things one way and the next day it’s different! So I would say don’t work there unless you want to work you butt off for little pay and no advancement till next shift lead leaves which could take years!
bad,"This place ran my life for 5 years. I dedicated myself to this company, bent over backwards and was terminated over a minor error despite having never been wrote up before, and great reviews every year. This place was always understaffed and I always felt unappreciated."
bad,"walgreens work employees to death, you are for certain going to endure some type of physical element from working there, doesn't matter if your bleeding from the ears, eyes, nose, or mouth you HAVE to come to work or they will write you up, your only given 2 20 minute breaks out of a 12 or 13 hour shift, and permanent employees will leave at their allotted time leaving the rest of the work they didn't complete for the next shift making it harder on them forcing them to have to work longer hours. ALL IN ALL I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT TO ANYONE!!!!"
bad,Worse place I've ever worked for. Worked in 2 different districts and many different stores and it was no different. By far my worse job experience ever.
bad,"If you brown nose the right manager and have the correct cup size you'll advance quickly."
bad,Took inbound calls to refill prescriptions and also would have to get in contact with the patients Doctor for a new prescription. Listening to the patient is important to get the prescription correct.
bad,I felt like the manager did not want me to move up in the company I was offered a position as a pharmacist and she removed from the pharmacy department.
bad,Supervisors are pitiful. If you kiss A** you can be promoted if not forget about it. I hated going to this job. They made us work mandatory over time each week.
bad,"There were several problems with the location I was working in, and anyone that raised a complaint has been fired or put into a position where they were forced to quit."
bad,"This is a very fast and busy work environment, limited to no career advancement and hours are very closely monitored and it takes a strong person to work in a high volume store."
bad,"If you love being used as more of a tool, than an assessment, and/or a human being, then Walgreens is perfect for you. The time it would take to write the review is not worth the effort. Save yourself the headache, go somewhere that will pay and treat you at least half as good. And Demographics shouldn’t be a factor, but with Walgreens are a big factor in accordance to who/how they deal with their customers and employees."
bad,"While you are promised advancement, increase in wages, vacation, and sick time, these do not happen. There is no set training that really gives you a good grasp on your duties and responsibilities. You are expected to wing it. Also, you're expected to deal with rude and sometimes unruly customers and unfortunately when you are the low hanging fruit, i.e. the new person, you're expected to deal with customers and/or patients no one else wants to deal with. Management is terrible at actually listening to their employees and hearing their concerns. This is not a good opportunity."
bad,"the place was based on favortisim. Raises,time off, You could call in on christmas and get by with if your the bosses favorite. Your schedule was based upon favortism."
bad,Manager doesn’t train her team. Took 3 weeks to acknowledge me as an employee. All she ever did was complain about about employees not knowing was expected. Yet she didn’t train. She is running/ and the district manager are running that store into the ground.
bad,There is no team there. Everyone just kind of does whatever they want. They come in whenever they want and they don't come in when they don't want to. The management plays favorites and is horrible.  This only applies to the Walgreen's in Liberty Lake. That is the only one that I ever worked at.
bad,Walgreens started out as a great company but slowly began to treat employees as nothing more than resources. It became about what can we get away with vs what is right for the team member. The company is full of crooked individuals who want to turn pharmacy into a commodity. The old regime was nothing like this however this new regime run. Run as fast as you can from this company. An American dream has turned into a U.K. nightmare!!! Read between the lines!! Pun intended.
bad,Do not take this job unless you don’t have a life and don’t mind not having a break or a lunch and don’t mind working your to the bone. Store managers are trained to treat the staff like what they do is never good enough and the more you do the more they expect you to do no praises and no gratitude at all by far the worst job experience I’ve ever had in my whole life. I wouldn’t wish this job on my worst enemy.
bad,Honestly the walgreens I worked at personally wasn't the best but there are other walgreens that I did work out as a floater and they where great. Just my home pharmacy wasn't the best.
bad,"I must say, depending on management maybe. After walgreens switched from a Family Company everything went down hill. Walgreens is all about money and over working their employees now."
bad,"Service all electronic issue for all Walgreens Stores. Repair all electronics or replace and configure for use. Upgrades, hardware,software, network, installs, ect."
bad,"Not a great work-life balance. Managers often had unrealistic expectations. The pay was low and the hours were not always ideal."
bad,Lack of hours and money always understaffed. They do not care if you meet the qualifications to be able to qualify for insurance. They treat employees unfairly and are biased
bad,"Expectations are extremely high. Every week or month they change their expectations, which would result in you having to change your plans. Initiated new program which requires Managers to do less work, but provide little to no pay role hours to get the physical work done. No tools to do the jobs properly, but are held accountable within those expectations. I've made good relationships here with some of the staff, but that's primarily because we share the same views. Find Employment elsewhere."
bad,"When I first got hired there I loved it, but then they brought in new management and all h** broke loose! Management barley spoke to you! Very unprofessional environment!"
bad,if you have an accident on the property to bad. It counts against you. No professional management. Look to fire the day after they hire. If you die to bad you are getting written up in case you begin breathing again. they will have a reason to fire you
bad,Walgreens was my first job. As a first job it helped me with customer service when I was very shy. Over the year of working there management wasn’t as great anymore. There were a lot of favoritism and they made it obvious. New hires would get better things than people who have worked there longer. For example: I worked there for a year so I wanted to be in the photo department and move away from the cash register. The new hire has to be up at the register most of the time to get comfortable just like the other employees had to do. They switched me with a new hire that was just hired a month previous to be in a different position and I was at the register
bad,Have been with Walgreens for a little over 2 years and in that time i have seen the company as a whole go down.New hires get paid at the same rate as someone that works both in pharmacy and in the store.
bad,"Constantly changing employees which includes the management. Work is not consistent with job description. They will promise promotions and options to gain more knowledge, yet never follow through. They like to overwork their employees and underpay them. Store managers typically stay in their office all day and don't have a clue about the stores operation on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it's time to leave. Do not work here and think you will have holidays off. You are required to work no matter what. If you have children, this isn't the job for you. They want you to put your job before your children or family. You only get 5 sick days a year so good luck if you ever get really sick. You will be forced to take a ""leave of absence"" and then pray you still have a job when you are able to come back to work. Speaking with corporate about in-store issues with management is a joke as well. They only care about the money they are making by keeping the store open and operational. You are not an asset to them in any way."
bad,the call center is very unprofessional they hire anyone don't really look at the back round people yelling across the room fighting on break room is out of control
bad,The store leads are lazy and sometimes unethical. You ask for advice and are told to just shut up. The store manager is careless and at most could care less.There is nothing pro or con it's just a horrible place to work!!!
bad,I wouldn’t recommend Walgreens employment to a dead dog. They work you way over the maximum and could care less if you need a day off or if you are exhausted.
bad,"Always understaffed needing to cover all departments while running the floor, tasks, and cash handling.Given many tasks but no rational time to complete. Have to deal with Store managers favoring employees, for example working 6 years in a company while upper management promote and give pay raises to their favorites that only worked 5 months starting. Holiday pay taken if you miss one day the week off a holiday."
bad,"There was a time when it was easy to get promoted and the company was very optimistic, now it has a lot of store managers with very unrealistic expectations and store staff that overworked and underpaid, not a great company to work for."
bad,"I was here two and a half years and I actually really liked working at Walgreens. Most people were chill and relaxed so like honestly it's not a bad job. The pay isn't great by any means, but I definitely recommend it IF YOU CAN DEAL WITH PEOPLE. There were always occasional people who were rude and hateful but oh well that's their problem."
bad,"Walgreens is a cesspool of a company. Upper management doesn't care about its employees, the only thing it cares about is its bottom line. It will under staff its sales floor and pharmacies, and then be all over the employees wondering why things never get done on time, or why customer care isn't perfect. On the front end it is common to see one employee on the register, and one manager having to run the whole rest of the front of the store (this includes the photo department, customer assistance, managing cash in the register, and assisting the pharmacy if they are falling behind). The pharmacy is most commonly one pharmacist and one technician frantically running back and forth between stations trying to help patients as fast as they can. This particular habit of Walgreens staffing pharmacies like this is a risk factor for messing up patient medications when your staff consists of two over-worked individuals. On top of that, their system of asking employees for feedback on the company is shallow. If you answer honestly as to all the problems Walgreens has and how they could fix them, the District Managers will come down on Store Managers, blaming them for loss of employee engagement. Avoid this company at all costs, it is a toxic work environment, and the only ""winners"" are people who work at the district level or higher. Anyone bellow that is just warm bodies the company needs to keep going, and you will feel that attitude about yourself working here."
bad,"Do not work for Walgreens. The only benefit is the health insurance, but other than that, it is truly awful. Management is under qualified and have no idea what they're doing and will always shift the blame to one of the regular employees to save themselves. The hours are terrible and the pay for the work you do is honestly criminal."
bad,"terrible management,  the turnover rate is soo high because of the terrible pay, the expectations of certain jobs over others for the same pay is just mind-blowing. while i was cleaning out the cooler and freezer after taking over for a newly promoted manager I pulled out stuff that had been expired for YEARS."
bad,Started out fine. Store manager decided to blast my spouse behind my back. Long story. Steer clear. Legal matters now being pursued. Broken promises. Lazy shift employees
bad,Very desapointed I been working in that place for 8 years but they never happy no matters what you came do still not happy not even appreciated the years that you been. Help
bad,They treat you like a slave bad pay bad benefits. I would not work here again. They just care about numbers not customers nor employees. They don’t tell the truth at all.
bad,"Staff are lazy. Management will not discipline those who deserve it. The store manager is verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive. The assistant manager is even worse. I do not recommend this company if your looking for a career."
bad,Walgreens does not care about their employees or customers.The employees work in humane hours and never have a chance to make special plans. They do not work with employees schedule under any circumstances.
bad,"The favoritism at Walgreens is the worst I have ever seen. There are too many managers not enough regular employees. No-one knows what is really going on. Only a few of us do,the work while the stand and talk all day"
bad,"The managers were some of the worst managers I have ever seen. One manager would just talk smack about everyone, while the other two showed no care for safety then I almost got fired for trying to do the right thing.. Do yourself a favor and don't work there"
bad,"It is very micro-managed and not in a good way, managers hated managers and meetings were very repetitive and not done with adequate coverage. They were done at random, even if you had a line of customers/patients. They would cut hours and cut them again until there was one manager and one cashier on the floor. In the Pharmacy there would be one pharmacist and one to two techs. Walgreens cared about their bottom line, not their employees. The only enjoyable part of the job was the relationships formed with regular customers and patients. Also, I did make great friends with several employees and managers."
bad,The manager made this a hostile and toxic work environment every single day. Management is terrible and there is no team work. Very stressful environment
bad,Management was rude and unbearable.  when I asked management could I transfer I was told yes. but I had to find my own store. when I did the district manager was upset and gave me a bad review to the new store that was going to hire me.
bad,"They underpay you, they work you to death, they are under staffed. This used company has gone downhill for quite some time and its a shame that someone with no experience can come in and make the same amount of money as one that has been there for years"
bad,"Very stressful place to work.  Company does not give lunch breaks or breaks for their pharmacist.  Very numbers driven, can get burned out really quick."
bad,"Overall I have learned a lot, but the work place is quite toxic. Anyone can get away with anything as long as you are close with management. The management is often rude and unwilling to help."
bad,"Horrible work environment with little to no chance of moving up , pay rate for technicians suck not considering the amount of work they require of the technicians . Every month they add more daily tasks for technicians and pay  rate does not change. They make it impossible for single working mothers ."
bad,A typical day at work provides lack of management skills and team-oriented skills that needs close attention daily. The company needs to follow and understand the lack of leadership skills and the lack of hiring new employees that are needed in this company in order to stay successful.
bad,"Wasn't able to get advice, or help while training because management didn't have time for you, so how do you get training but through other employees.  Lunch breaks employees would eat while they worked. Employee stressed and unable to get someone from management to help and overwhelming to other employees when I needed help as someone who had just started working. Who do you go to or ask when the employees are dealing with their own stress because of management. Management seems to always have someone else to blame, who is in charge? They stab people who left in the back to take away from the blame of management and not dealing with the fact new management is to blame. This store has lost respect from many customers because of new management. I'm ashamed of what Walgreens has become since change of management. Even going to the restroom is a stressful time. It's not the employee's; it's new management! Employee's are so stressed they can't help new employee's, managers seen to not care."
bad,"I was an Assistant Manager her while I was in college which was known at my time of hire, but management was not supportive of this.  I got the worst shifts just because I needed flexibility for certain days.  Staff was under payed.  Younger employees and management members (like myself) weren't treated the best. Advancement was possible if your store manager liked you."
bad,"This company is always changing policies and cutting corners to save money with complete disregard to their in-store, bottom barrel employees. They can't comprehend that if you only give enough hours to schedule four people a night in a crazy busy store, that you will not get everything done!! And when you don't, ugh. It's all you hear about all day from the managers with threats of who will be held accountable. By the way, the four people is including the person you have to keep at the register which leaves three other people on the floor if you're lucky one person doesn't call out and one manager who usually loves to just take their time counting money all night. Tasks usually involve cleaning up after your managers because floor work is beneath them, picking up the slack of previous shifts, working on trucks, packing out overstock from the stockroom, ringing up customers, facing all the aisles in the store at the end of the day, sweeping and mopping the entire store, changing all the garbage in the entire store, cleaning up after horrible messes left behind in the public restrooms, and just helping any customer who asks. Managers are phony corporate wannabes who smile and lie in your face and then just screw you when you turn around. Best thing is building relationships with your peers. They become like war buddies."
bad,"Paid Vacation being taken away , hours constantly cut, hostile work environment. District managers only care about quota, not patient safety. Pharmacists allow discrimmination"
bad,"CPO office, one of the worst places to work. They get you in with their typing tests, however the floor supervisors want double the speed. Pharmacists will change one letter in your script typing and it counts as a strike against you. HR not any better. The I feel for you but cant reach you mode."
bad,"My time at Walgreens started out just fine, but over the span of four years it became almost unbearable. Coverage for a shift became a skelton crew. Everyone in the store became stressed, from front check out to the pharmacy staff. Unloading a full case by myself was standard. No sense of accomplishment because I had to run the store by myself beside one cashier. Silly meetings that were BS kept you from getting task finished. Benifits were horrible. Work/Life balance very poor. Corporate greed apparent. They took away the neighborhood drug store away. I don't understand what they are trying to become. Longterm,  not employee friendly. They don't care about employees. Turnover is dizzying."
bad,Many of the days are the same and constant emails from district manager. All number and performance driven. Once you hit one target you get ripped for another.
bad,"Nothing good about working at Walgreens."
bad,I cannot even begin.... This company is very much profit driven. There is no camaraderie. The hours suck the pay sucked. People shopping there sucked.
bad,"No encouragement or appreciation for associates. No mentoring for people who wanted to advance. The harder you work the more you are used and taken for granted. Promotions and mentoring go to the people who do the bare minimum.  Very low to zero  associate morale. "
bad,I did not enjoy my time at walgreen I was over worked and underpaid and highly unappreciated but some people find this job worth it so to each its own  j-
bad,I did not enjoy my time at Walgreen's. One of my shift managers had a prejudice against me. He would follow me around the store without reason and harass me even when he was not on shift. My Assistant Store Manager sided with him even though another Shift Manager verified the harassment. She also cut my hours.
bad,"Walgreens is only about making a profit. Employees have less say than customers. The store I work at is a dump. Manager does not care, so manager is completely unhelpful in all situations. If you need a part-time job, then it's fine."
bad,Walgreens was overall a great job. The pay was great and so was the work. It was laid back and really easy. Everyomne I worlked with was awesome and really nice
bad,"I do not wish to comment on my experience with this company at this time. The hours were not great, and too many turnaround shifts made it difficult on me."
bad,"Do not work here, The managers get away with anything they want, which can include degrading you based on any status, marital, career, opinions, etc. While working here, I overheard a manager say that they like to employ students because they are less likely to leave. While this may be true, it created problems because some staff were immature and vengeful. Often blaming an employee for something they did not do. This goes beyond the clerks, this is in the upper management as well. Something that was enjoyable about this job was the communication shown was some of the best in the industry, the training received is still useful in other positions at other companies, and the customer service skills developed actually helped me nail my interview at my next job."
bad,The company's mission and vision is not being followed or upheld in some stores.  The pay isn't competitive enough and it's too many requirements in order for someone to be promoted
bad,"I worked there for several months. My plan was to work full time in order to qualify for medical benefits. The pharmacy manager and store manager were sure to keep me one hour below what I needed to qualify. Obviously this practice is pushed by the company. The managers receive bonuses for keeping this from happening. I had SEVERAL discussions about this. I was clear at my interview as to what my intentions were. I was forced to quit after being ignored for 7 months."
bad,"the pay is horrendous, staffing and hours are worse. Capped Salaries that dont even compete with starting salaries at other jobs. Management is lackluster at best. Nobody knows how to move the company forward, only backwords in its progression. Equipment is horrible all around, constantly breaking on a daily basis with no resolution in sight on basic necessities, i.e printers."
bad,"You can die and they won’t care, they will replace you and keep it moving. They do not care about you or your health.  3 sick days and you are gone. Don’t try to advance in the company, it will never happen. "
bad,"Walgreens has gone downhill tremendously in the past 5 years. They have taken away budgets, pay and bonuses, leaving no incentive for anyone. The engagement level is very low."
bad,"on a regular day of work you would come in. do anything the managers asked. tend to customers needs. was not a hard job, but was very busy. stressful because you have multiple peope giving you things to do at once."
bad,"Managers who have been there longer than you will treat you as if you dont know anything and then take credit for all of the work YOU did. Also if you are a female and have a female manager, it is a very catty environment."
bad,"After 12 years of working for Walgreens I was terminated for taking a picture of a thug in my parking lot after he stold over $800. 00 of product from my store. I was never given paperwork or asked to sign anything. I gave 55 plus hours every week to them. I made the stores I was given shine. My last store I was at made 8% sales growth for each of the 2 years I was there.  "
bad,"If you work at Walgreen's you'll receive  a very low income, experience understaffed pharmacies, and suffer through constant verbal abuse from patients who have a right to be angry at Walgreen's. I do not recommend working here."
bad,"Wrk there for a yr & in that yr so many changes were made, being in the store for a hour along was not safe, we had all females manages two of them was super lazy meaning the others had to pick up slack, no raise, you working like slaves on truck day , hours cut for employees, poorly staffed, company not worth being at"
bad,"It just depends who knows who. They hire employees even with master degree and offer them a minimum wage jobs and give empty promises to promote within, but the promotion never happens. Sweat shop of the USA."
bad,I loved working that I loved being a cashier salesperson providing excellent customer service to my customers and willing them to come back and come back it was just a great experience for working at Walgreens
bad,Working at Walgreens was hard because I love people. They seemed to want me to treat them like cattle. Just continue to keep the line moving. This was not something I could do.
bad,Management plays favorites and treats others poorly. They Have a fit  for calling out and threaten to replace you. People make up lies to throw you under the bus. The only cool people are coworkers.
bad,"Chain pharmacy that will consistently lead you with a carrot in front of your nose under the name ""annual performance bonus"" and then whisk it away citing factors that were out of your control and completely irrelevant."
bad,I Was a loyal worker for 13 years.  I learned a lot about the pharmacy profession and customer service.  I discovered that there wasn’t a sense of caring toward the staff at the end of my time there like in the beginning.
bad,"I’m under appreciated, under paid, over worked. That’s it. This company is twisted and unstable. No one looks out for good agents. It’s a very selfish place."
bad,"I worked their for 26 years. Would not recommend to anybody unless you are really desperate for a paycheck. Not the same company it used to be. Always understaffed and if you are really sick they still try to keep you at work. Raises just suck."
bad,"When I started I had to work more than one store just to get full time and promised weekends off. Yea right. Took them 2 weeks to get my pay I was promised right, no benefits was ever shown to me. Working up to 2 weeks at a time without a day off. Managers did not care as long as they had a warm body at the register. You wore many hats and paid for none. So much favoritism.They would take associates off the floor to sit in the office for hours and leave me there in the whole store alone,trying to do 5 things at once. No breaks or lunches was furnished until the next person to work came in hours later . Scheduled to work on my days off and not told about it. When I quit the manager said "" ok ""and walked off."
bad,Would never work for them again. Most manager have a good old boy way of thinking. It is a very white company to work for. I know it is not the company. It is the people they put in management positions.
bad,Horrible place to work.  You are not treated with dignity or respect .  Walgreens only respects the higher ups .  A multibillion company that cannot pay employees a fair wage .
bad,I had so much fun working at Walgreens the crew members were very fun to work with. there was never one day where I didn't want to work. it was fast paced sometimes
bad,The Walgreens I worked at was awful. Our GM did nothing for the store. We have three good managers but two of them quit due to the poor treatment of employees at the store. The training is insufficient for many of the jobs. The only way to advance your career at my store was to suck up to the management. I would not recommend working at the store in Clovis NM.
bad,"I was given work that was for management to do while they sat in the office, talking with themselves and yelling at employees for no good reasons and refusing to listen to them when they were asked something important."
bad,Walgreens has cut pay and benefits several time in the last five years. Morale is very low at Walgreens. The put profit above the people. Benefits are not very good for the cost.
bad,If you are willing to put your job above all else in your life then this is the place for you. Jobs like this will most certainly burn you out especially if your salaried and work 50-80 hours a week.
bad,this was the worst company I had ever worked for. they don't train you properly and then throw you into the work flow. then get mad at you for not knowing exactly what you were supposed to be doing or how to use their computers
bad,"I feel like the employees are underpaid for all the work you have to do , they should take off the second lane in drive thru it’s too much for one person and get a call center because there is to many calls for one store"
bad,walgreens used to be a great company to work for ... this last year things have changed in a negative way for the employees... they are not great with there pay.
bad,I understand you guys need data but you really need to include and opt out option. We don't all want to take trips down memory lane or else would be on here.
bad,"poor management, horrible place to work, pay is low, customers are rude, walgreens tried to make me work on Saturdays knowing that i can't in that day because it is against my religion"
bad,I'm going to make this short and sweet. I've been in the beauty business for over 20 years and this is absolutely the WORST company I have ever worked for. Horrible pay..horrible management at store and upper levels. Could care less about their employees and unethical business practices. DO NOT WORK HERE!!! Abusive managers and customers. Just run. They cut hours while other companys are giving raises. You will be better off somewhere else.
bad,The store that I worked at was very poorly run.  I was employed there for over 2 years and never got offered a promotion.  There were people who were hired after me who were getting promoted and I was not.  I only made $0.02 above minimum wage.  My managers in general were not interested in anything going on in the store and there were numerous crises that I had to address on my own with no help or backup.  The training I received was very lackluster and I learned more by doing things on my own than under the supervision of a manager.
bad,Walgreens is a money hungry company that doesn't value it's employees. The store managers pin bogus accusations on its employees and get them fired. They do this so that they won't have to give them their unemployment benefits.
bad,"horrible management, stressful, the bathrooms are not clean, people always want to start problems with the new people, the boss is mean, management is racist."
bad,It was a very good experience working at walgreens.  It took me a while to learn the company but i figured it out.. I enjoyed working there but better opportunity.
bad,If you are not apart of their certain views and read the bible daily dont bother applying. If you aren't a minority you will be treated as someone who doesn't matter. There is limited job training and it's very busy
bad,Every one I know is jumping ship and watching as our lives go down the drain. The company has changed for the worst in the past 10 yrs and all us old time people want out before they let us go.
bad,"very productive place to work. plenty of workflow, nice enviornment, great company to grow with. steady work, hardest part was the leadderships lack of help"
bad,"Management would talk down to you, did not like going into work because I never knew how I would be spoken to.  Made complaints and the company never did anything"
bad,"A typical day at work was opening the store at 730, slow mornings meant time to work on the candy aisles restocking shelves and cashiering for any morning customers. My favorite part of this job was the photo counter, it had the most to offer and it was fun."
bad,The whole company is very cut and dry. Do one thing wrong and you might as well walk yourself out the door. Management didn't care and would stand around talking.
bad,"Retail pharmacy is good exposure to customer service and communications skills development. Unfortunately, walgreens is at the mercy of Amazon, just as I predicted in 2014 when I first started working there. There's just no way I see this organization being around in the next 50 years based on their unwillingness to adapt with modern innovations."
bad,"The management would not listen to other employees about the way they were being treated instead made the others to be victimized."
bad,"This job was very stressful, and due to poor management the "
bad,"Being a single mother I was hoping to get a set schedule, and they couldn't work with me. I was pregnant and wanted to pick up more hours, but they wouldn't schedule me more than 30 hours."
bad,The manager played favorites and was always putting the closing shift under the bus. Would be left with half if not more then half of the opening shifts jobs and would have to clear that up before we could get started on closing duties which of course we fell behind o. For obvious reasons. But it was never not our fault. Was a cluster disaster as far as scheduling went and manager didn't bother listening to the employees unless he liked them.
bad,Its a ok place to work if your in school other than that i wouldn't work there. They cut hours like crazy and they always have you doing crazy tasks. Management was ok.
bad,"Sad place to work, more concerned about poaching employees from competition than creating a culture. Below average pay if you have experience. They want you to rush into decision so then they can ""hold you accountable"" for making a decision with 5% of the information they do give you... You can make more money with a lemonade stand."
bad,"The Walgreens where I worked had relatively low customer traffic, but the shifts were anything but easy. Miscommunication and finger-pointing among the four (male) managers had put stress on all of the employees and pitted the shifts against each other. Adding to that, I eventually left because too many people were hired for the number of hours we had available, and I was scheduled for as few as eight hours a week. When I pointed out that I couldn't survive on those hours, I was told that I was stuck with it because that is how much I agreed to when I had started (Note: I was sixteen when I started and nearly eighteen when I made the request for more hours. I had acquired bills and was responsible for my own expenses and even in the process of moving out). Overall, it is very easy work, but with management's constant battles and impositions of new rules (cashiers can't leave the front counter but the aisles must be tidy before closing, etc.) I was very glad when I got to leave."
bad,Don't do it unless you have way too much time on your hands. It's pretty ridiculous. Plus the main supervisors have a basic GED and are allowed to evaluate those with doctorate degrees
bad,My manager was not understanding or helpful with my situation. Motivates people using fear tactics rather than constructive criticism and praise. It was miserable.
bad,"communication with the leaders was stressful, so finding solutions to a problem that could have easily been solved with the help of management was always a difficult task to complete, especially for the older people I worked with and the newcomers. sometimes it would feel like I would be training the entire store while the managers and store owner would gossip in the back and complain about others work."
bad,"I believe Walgreen is one of those jobs that for high school or college students or if you just want some extra money on the side. I liked meeting new people everyday but I hated how unsafe it was to work night shift. No guards so people was always stilling and anyone could come in and your exposed to anything happening to you. At the time of me working there, Walgreens only had 3 people plus the pharmacist working at night now its only 2... i don't know who they think about to save they store goods at night with 2 people working. This was bad experience but good people I got to meet.."
bad,"The way Walgreens is becoming is very cooperate. It use to be about both the employees and customers, but now it's about numbers and making their money."
bad,"Stressful and shedules takes u away from family time had to work weekends, late shifts saterdays and sundays. Theirs no room for promotions. Also have to work hplidays only one holiday off per year."
bad,"Management suck, asked for a transfer they took me off the schedule for a whole month, finally transferred dealing with another sucky manager, stuck at the cashier. Low pay for graveyard shift and barely no sleep. Same schedule boring cold nights."
bad,"I don't why this has to do with creating an account with indeed, every one has different opinions where they work and they have to find out them selfs"
bad,BORING job. Weren’t allowed to do anything but clean and front face store. Hated to go to work everyday! Was miserable the whole time I was employed there!
bad,Walgreens used to be a good place to work but now it’s turned into a cold corporation that doesn’t care about their employees whatsoever. The company bottom line is that the customer is always right even if the customer is not a customer at all. They will throw their employees under the bus just to save them selves regarding issues and liability or lawsuits. Time and time again they have shown their new company values are to the customer And I’ll need them
bad,"There were too many political agendas here. Only the popular staff members got promoted. There was alot of he said she said stuff. Management was horrible, and didnt know how to treat employees"
bad,Management is nice at 1st.. Than expects you to be able to run a store with 1 day of training.. And work 6 day's with little to no employees at all. Unsafe work experience.. Unsafe environment....
bad,"Walgreens no longer worries about staffing stores or allowing employees to earn a fair wage. Limited hours available and pay caps for most positions. Most employees start at minimum wage in the area now. "
bad,In the beginning the first head manger was good took care of his employees friendly and great to talk to didn't work you to death. But the last manager was rude didn't take time to talk to us it was his was or the highway.
bad,"Mangers show favoritism to certain employees. they are wishy washy, store manger feeds off drama. always short staffed never had store meetings. No communication. No engagement. Only thing they care about are NPS scores and not the actual employees. Maybe other stores are different BUT NOT GARDEN CITY, Ga"
bad,People don't stick around long because it's too stressful. You don't get paid well and the hours are bad. Customers are also terrible and management is always unable to do anything because corporate doesn't give them any power.
bad,"I spent almost half my life working for this company to be terminated in a group-like termination for something I didn’t even do.  My pharmacy manager desperately wanted to hire me back and I was hireable, but one man prevented me from returning because of his personal problem with me which I wasn’t even aware of until after I was terminated."
bad,"When I first started working here in 2017 it was alright I got decent hours the store manager seemed sincere and the managers except for one were down to earth.  Now the store is no longer 24 so we lost a lot of people and hours were cut to the point where many are looking for other jobs.  The store manager and the assistant store manager are crooked and if you do something they dont like they will build a case against you or cut your hours to where theyll either have reason to fire you or youll have no choice but to quit and move on.  The assistant manager C. lies, talks and acts in such a condescending way you cant help but feel disrespected and insulted, and she'll give out phone numbers to fellow coworkers without permission so that they can call and ask you to cover them even though it is the managers job to do so.  The store manager pretty much told us to lie on a review of him because he could see who did the review by our number I think he even got a certificate for it.  And for some reason even though most of us even full timers arent getting the hours we need hes continuously trying to hire new people.  In fact the newest person got 34 hours while the people that have been here for years are only getting 20 to 25.  The store is trash since we changed hours as well disorganized and improperly stocked overstocked where we dont need it and understocked on items that are consistantly bought.  And for those who want to train to get into pharmacy theyre called designated hitters you work in the front and in pharmacy...he doesnt schedule the ones we have to go back there"
bad,"It was okay ,your basically filling rxs all day,..Standing 10 hours..Dealing with rude customers...That pretty much it....It was a great 1st pharmacy tech job...Retail pharmacy gives you tough skin."
bad,Where I worked there was some favoritism every one quit in like a 2 month span. I tried to stick it out but couldn't it was just real messy for sure. Ruin me from going there ever
bad,Many people suffered massive lay-offs after the merger with Boots.  Most of the technology is outsourced to off-shore management.  They offered to hire us back for 50% of our current salary.
bad,"For a large corporate company they are extremely disorganized,  do not offer competitive compensation,  or a good benefit package. They do not promote from within in a timely manner and even though in the position I worked they claim to offer commission, getting those commissions is almost impossible"
bad,"At first I liked my job and boss, then he was transferred to another store right when he promoted me. This resulted in poor training and went down hill from there. As soon as he left, the store started to lose it's luster."
bad,management goes by favoritism that will be the only way you will advance in the company by kissing up not by your great work ethic . the whole management needs to be fired and replaced with new people.
bad,Worked here for a little over a year as a certified pharmacy technician. Since day one I experienced bullying and bias tendencies within the upper management (lead tech and pharm manager) I would highly recommend seeking employment elsewhere unless you do not like positive recognition because you will never receive it here. Schedules are always set by lead tech who gets to pick her hours (gets to have a set schedule and never has to work weekends) and then displays favoritism towards certain techs while “punishing” the others with constant closing shifts week after week after week for no valid reasoning.
bad,This was the worst place i have ever worked. the manager that i had never dealt with confrontation so whenever faced with it he would cower away from it. it was the worst place to ever be employed.
bad,"I was offered the position of head photo specialist, then was thrown into the position without training. I taught myself with manuals. Just a lot of responsibility for the position plus other tasks for the store. I enjoyed the job but when things did arise the manager would not back me!"
bad,the area was dangerous . The workers were lazy and  insulting the pay was awful and it is something that I would recommend to a child for a possible summer job
bad,No rotations in work environment. the management was not professional and bullying was encountered in the small pharmacy where it could obviously be heard. another pharmacy tech was transferred because of this issue as well. there was also favoritism which was not a fair working place.
bad,I’ve have worked with walgreens for 3 years now and let me be honest it is not the best experience. There is so much drama going on when all i wanna do is just work. I get treated at work by an employee and the management did NOTHING. I am currently working less that 30 hrs per week whick does not pay my bills.
bad,Was a good place to work at until some newer management was brought in and I was moved to a different dept without my knowledge or agreement. That was the beginning of the end.
bad,"Walgreens I thought was good to me, but I recently discovered it’s actually garbage. And can go to a certain place. Trust me when I say do not apply, or work for this company. They will run you ragged and the when you have no energy to continue, complain you can’t work more."
bad,"I worked here for about 4 months and it was not what I expected. The managers were not helpful at all, I was thrown into cashiering with no training, the hours were terrible and not worth it, and I never received a discount which made it even worse. I do not recommend it at all unless if you're looking for 25 hours or less a week, then go for it!"
bad,"The stress is unbelievable. They love to tell you that the Call Center is a loser and makes no money for the company, yet all day long all you do is sell drugs to people. You can hear a cash register in your mind going cha ching!  Yet they tell you work faster, work faster, make each call last no longer than 3 and a half minutes. And follow all SOP's, don't make a mistake with HIPPA, don't converse with patient, remember go faster, go faster, and don't forget, we make no money for the company, they say. Its such a mind bender experience. Its a human meat grinder. When you get terminated, each person in HR goes on stage and plays a part in a play, all toward the goal of getting that person out of there as soon as possible. They really know how to make the sausage. They are that good at termination. You'll be talking to someone and practically in midstream, poof, they are gone. What a horrible legacy. I should write a play and call it"
bad,"Always slashing hours and support, while increasing work load. "
bad,"This was no more than a number crunching job. I have a worked a few really bad jobs and this place takes the cake. The management is bad, the loss prevention is crooked. The pay is garbage. If you want a job where you wake up looking into the mirror every morning hating life, than by all mean walgreens in the place. You will build a thick skin after even the patients hate the place but use what is closest too them and in turn take it out on you. This place will take 10 years off your life. good luck"
bad,"I don't want to do this. I don't like working for Walgreens, they are unfair on wages as they do not care about the amount of time you have put in and the score you get on your review. The company is customer oriented and not employee friendly. ***********************************************************************************************************************************************"
bad,"Awful company to work for, employees go unheard of with issues that are lowering customer service, they should compensate employees more for everything the job intells"
bad,"No security when opening and closing the store, no security during business hours felt very unsafe. The pay does not match work and store manager hires part time employee's making as much as the assistant store manager."
bad,"unfair, bad management, too much work, too few people. felt like working at mcdonald's. employee relations are unhelpful. do not care about employees. no breaks"
bad,Management had to complete all the work because Walgreens would not hire any employees to help. So Salaried assistant managers and the manager were forced to work between 50-80+ hours. No overtime and some of the worst upper management I had every seen. District Managers playing favorites and just terrible individuals overall. I have nothing good to say about this company. Except I am glad I do not work there.
bad,Working as a Cashier here was terrible. The hours were never stable and I had to close the store or work overnight. I let management know I could not work overnight due to school and they did not care. I left after 3 months and was glad to do so. The pay is way too low for what is expected and items are priced way too high. Customers always complained about the price and left the store.
bad,The company does not know how to take care of loyal employees and rather replaced you if you ask for what they promised you. Always get eberything in writing do not trust management. They will change their mind whenm convient for them!!
bad,"The store manager knew nothing of his employees or his store , he ran the store with this ""high horse"" mind set . He made his own rules and drove people out with his nasty attitude. The other managers fought to make the employees happy only for him to turn around and tear them down. The store strived on the customer service the employees gave, but you can only do so much when the team is unhappy"
bad,Rite Aid transition time. Company is removing managers with seniority. Experience counts for nothing as mgrs from rite aid make less. Bonus based on metrics easily manipulated by corporate to pay out less. CEO is anti bonus. Reviews also easily manipulated by superiors to make sure ratings below 3.0. IE no raises. Expenses cut at all levels. IE your an expense to be cut. Payroll budgets a joke. Every employee basically doing work of three. Then when you fail it falls into your review. Dangerous payroll levels in Pharmacy as well. Greater mistakes happen when dept. more concerned about selling numerous immunizations and services than being able to keep verification checks important.
bad,"I hated working at this location because of how the manager treated everyone. No one came from the same background and he treated everyone as if they were spoiled entitled children in need of punishment."
bad,"-never fully staffed"
bad,It’s a great first job and good pay but management is horrible and they never close not even for holidays. Don’t have any personal emergencies they count against you. Heartless people.
bad,"Horrible management, constant OT and if you don't finish you usually have to come in on Sat which is your day off to finish the night before. I've worked there for 5 yrs and its gone down hill due to the management especially the IO's."
bad,"Awful supervisor, not assisting with improving, but instead critical of every single thing no matter how insignificant and constantly pointing our errors..."
bad,Didnt work with schedule. They were not understanding of medical needs. MEan to people who call off for good reasons. Hard work with no pay in return.
bad,"Walgreens only cares about sales. No matter what department you work in, they just want you to sell something extra. Working in the pharmacy, it just seemed like the customers were a number instead of a person."
bad,I did not like working at Walgreens. the pay was not good and the hours were long and overdrawn. I would not recommend working for the walgreens company under any circumstance.
bad,"Customer Service Specialist - Call Center position pay is $10.00 Per hour, slave wages, Walgreens has no employee value the slave wages they pay if you opt into benefits you're working for free"
bad,It has been awhile since I have worked here but the management was everywhere. Some were way too strict to the point you didn’t want to come in and others were so lenient that they wouldn’t care about anything.
bad,"Run, don't walk this company is the worst company I have ever worked for. Its like being in high school. you are expected to give everything and get absolutely nothing in return."
bad,"Long hours, poor management and lacks quality of work. Management has no idea what they are doing. They do try to work with the stores but treat their employees poorly."
bad,badly managed low pay and terrible even worst now that there vanderbilt shady place to work I would stay far away from this place..............................
bad,"Poor management, low income, stressful, not enjoyable. It's truly a place that doesn't care for employees and even customers. It's dreadful having to come in for a shift."
bad,"Not the best place. A/C broken for 2-3 months. Dirty. Very unsafe because of the homeless. No body watching the parking lot. Bathroom abuse from the homeless. Management (one, not all) played favorites, no employee support."
bad,"Walgreen's is busy growing and buying other stores. Typically this causes stress for employees. Communication breaks down. Cuts to budgets and hours of operations are made. Stress builds. All trading is CBT, so you learn by making mistakes, not a very positive environment."
bad,Of course everyone's onions and encounters are different but this had to be one of the most unprofessional jobs thus far that I have had. People there where very mean and in all honesty it was not a fun and motivating or healthy environment that's why I left.
bad,"They need to hire more help and stop"
bad,You were graded even if you didn't work with the supervisor that did your review. The company is friendly but they want a lot of work for the little bit of pay.  They need to not try to work their employees so hard for the little bit of pay that they get
bad,"The rules do not apply to everyone and favoritism is a huge problem throughout this company"
bad,I did not work for this company long because my previous company was bought out by Walgreens. They subsequently closed our stores down and laid off a lot of the employees.
bad,"Walgreens as a company protects who they want to protect, if you are a  regular worker your no good to them, no matter how many years you spend breaking your back for the low pay."
bad,Walgreens was a start up job to understand the basics of the work environment for a college student. Only motive at Walgreens was trying to figure out a work ethic. It is retail and my sole motive working in retail is merely gaining exposure to how a business is run and also understanding people along the way. No growth in this company and lack of career advancement for any one really.
bad,"Each day was the same. When you weren't getting yelled at by customers, it was management yelling at your for sometimes the smallest of things. This job was more stress than it was worth. One could hardly go to the bathroom and barely had the opportunity to take a break when working 8, 9 and sometimes 10 hour shifts. One could say they felt voiceless and ignored even when heard. It was clear this place couldn't care less about their employees."
bad,Run as fast as you can like the ginger bread man. I was employed on miami beach location & it was horrible management  they don't help they don't care
bad,"I have worked several retail stores and this one by far had to be the worst.  No communication, no training and only certain people were allowed to work on their cbl's"
bad,cutting hours that is all i hear now since i came back its crazy need to find a new company to work for. over walgreens. i have costumers screaming at me daily for not having help and its not my fault.
bad,"plenty of room for moving up if youre willing to be overworked and underpaid. you don't have to be a ""people person"" to excel but it helps and most of the kids you work with are NOT."
bad,I've been with the company 10+ years before I could be promoted to sr technician but you get someone that's been there a year and trying to promote then. the management is poor and unethical
bad,"Worked there 10+ years finally had enough and quit.  Horrible management, toxic work environment!  Company has gone completely down hill.  Wouldn’t recommend working here."
bad,The experience i had there was very poor the store manager was racist and very rude at times i was treated very poorly and had a very bad time working there the only up side was the employees ...
bad,The management is awful they dont know how to talk to their employees with respect but want them to work at 100% really need some help with their management skills
bad,"It’s a good place to start as a tech but don’t stay forever. You’ll learn on the job to fill meds, type RXs into the system, Insurance processing, and what medications are for.Benefits aren’t that good, they’ll work with your schedule. There’s better Pharm tech positions out there"
bad,"My store manager made the job unbearable.  She was constantly degrading me, making me feel stupid and useless.  I could not learn how to properly learn the job in that environment."
bad,"Left walmart for jod at walgreens to find out the horror of walgreens. mangement did not do anything at the store i worked for. The store manger was always hiding out in the pharmacy or back room talking. "
bad,"The company does not care about there employees any longer. 30 year employee and I could walk out today and they would replace me tomorrow, nobady would care"
bad,Management and the high school teeny boppers are the reason i quit this job. They did not come through with the promises they made in the interview. I swear i dreaded having a day off to come back into work and notice non of the other workers did what they should have done. Its a MESS
bad,"you have 6 hours to do an at least 8 hour job every day. understaffed and overworked with horrible pay. the managers can treat you horribly it doesn't matter if you report it nothing happens. or worse you get your hours cut, like I did. they'll do anything they can to not give you a raise and play favorites. you want a steady schedule? that's a joke. "
bad,I have worked for this company twice now and both times the management was not good. The management expects the impossible. Lunches and breaks are rare.
bad,"I was forced to work 10 hour shifts without my appropriate breaks. I was expected to work the floor, cosmetic, photo and the cash register by myself while the managers do nothing. Then I get in trouble for not completing everything. I am only one person. There are only 3 associates, we desperately need people but they refuse to hire anyone. This company is draining my time and energy and it is so not worth the $9"
bad,"Management is extremely poor, even if you have awesome managers their hands are tied by corporate. You are expected to do the work of three people because corporate cuts hours leaving only one to two people at the store even on busy days."
bad,Didn’t really see why management can have someone do their dirty work and run it off on someone else so they don’t get in trouble is besides me. I just hope they don’t con you like they did me
bad,I does not recommend walgreens to anyone who like to grow up. First of all walgreens is only a company that gives important to people who dosen't talk and also race really does matter. I been a manager who ha the best review in town still i don't get promotion because of my race.
bad,Can be better to much drama the managers are very messy they let people get away with stealing they cut your hours on Kronos mAke the other people do all the work managers sit in the office all day in eat in gossip use there phone cuss out customers in get away with everything now if that was and team member they would’ve gotten wrote up or fired
bad,"As the company has expended throughout the years, they have continued to treat employs worse and worse every year. Taking away positions, making pay cuts to all departments, demoting any higher paying position and letting go of any employee that has worked with the company a long time and who makes more then new hires."
bad,"One of the Worst places in my opinion to work, Very very slim chance of any type of career advancement, the wages are not competitive for the type of job market nowadays. Just a very terrible experience."
bad,"To much favortism not enough rewarding for jobs well done no open door policy to much work thrown on certain people not enough on others. Certain people didnt have to do anything and others had to pick up all the slack. no open door policy anything you said in confidence never stayed that way management would not tell you you did a good job but if you did something by mistake they were right there to let you know,"
bad,"Receive, type, fill and file new prescriptions."
bad,Job was okay but the training sucked the person I was partnered with made me do all the work the first day. No one really taught me anything. You have to run both the regular register and do everything for customer service all while still getting paid minimum wage.
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here and you can do so if it's your only option. Management staff discriminate when it comes to advancement and employees are underpaid and overworked.
bad,Not everyone was treated equally. The managers picked or chose their favorites. Just overall not a fun or joyful job. Very stressful. I did not enjoy being treated unfairly by my managers.
bad,"Pharmacist are the worst people to work for. Yes you are working with medications, but they are totally impatient people, many of them were rude and offensive. $11.50 is a joke to the pharmacy techs. If I wold repeatedly ask the same questions to make sure I got it right they would act as If I was stupid. One of them yelled at me and I yelled back making me do all the work with big lines at drive threw and front counter. He wanted me to go faster and I was but he had no tact in approaching the crew. Yes pharmacist are trained professionals but got all the recognition from Management and customers. So any time I know of people I would strongly advise them not to work for Walgreen's. Its the one place where I felt the worst from all my jobs to the point that I wanted to commit suicide. so FORGET ALL WALGREEN PHARMACIST. PLUS I WONT EVEN GET MY PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED HEAR ANYMORE"
bad,Training is basic and basically no existent. Poor excuses for managers. No one follows any of the rules and make some up along the way if they don't like you. Forget ever getting a day off. They will schedule you outside of your availability and if you call out they'll write you up.
bad,While working there I noticed a lot of favoritism to patients as well as denies to patron fills for no reason while we indeed had the medications in stock.
bad,"Stressful, I learned that you have to be able to tolerate unhappy people.  Management there was horrible,  Everyone got along well.  Hardest part was totes everyday,"
bad,A typical day at Walgreen's is very stressful. I love each one of my customers and enjoy socializing with each and everyday i come into work. As far as management goes it is horrible and they will make you want to quit.
bad,Good for a long time and then one then time changes them and they no one will stand up for you. They put on a good front but they dont back up there employees.
bad,Was treated badly I have nothing good to say and don't really want to do this I have nothing to say when you have family situations going on they don't care the job is more important than your family
bad,The Walgreens where I worked was absolutely terrible. People were doing scandalous things including the managers. It was a terrible work environment where you had to kiss butt
bad,Nothing good to say about this job it's very low pay with insurance sold to you and at high cost. No problem if you need a side job during college. Quarter raises each year is nothing with the rest of inflation.
bad,Walgreens is a job where I enjoyed who I worked with but was frustrated with how the company handled the work load and the amount of staff on the clock. The pharmacy especially was never staffed enough to meet the quality customer service Walgreens expected and the training was not very well organized either. Most of what I learned I was forced to learn on the job itself. They also have little simple for health conditions or issues and abuse part-timers who cannot qualify for benefits but are worked the same hours. Some of the staff worked very hard but were never appreciated and it seemed the only way to really advance was to kiss up to the managers. Certain managers were great others only enjoyed dictating their tasks to others while hardly do anything themselves. Again they also picked a lot of favorites and adjusted their expectations based on who they liked the most. Work nor pay ever seemed equal or fair or sufficient enough.
bad,Think twice before you turn in your application. Worked there for 8 years at stores through the country. They are not the same company the used to be before they sold out to a European company.
bad,"Not much to get paid. Only hourly minimum wages by law. Never get a raise. Usually work on truck totes which is stocking most of the times. Facing, and other things to get done by manager whats been told .Its hard working, have to deal with customers about the products that you know or dont know, have to have explainations or lie about it so they can buy the products that its a good thing to use; ect. Its not easy to work at this job."
bad,"This environment and staff is poor at handling situations, you get paid way below the wages you should for the responsibilities that are put upon you, I do not recommend working for this company."
bad,"Terrible company to work for poor managements ( no heart and will push you to your breaking point ). Too many things to do, cutting the hours and benefits"
bad,Walgreens paid me about $8 an hour the full 3 years i was there. I got a 1% increase once a year. They make you work to the bone and give you barely any vacation time. They make you upsell candy and other various items or you get a write up. They do not trust you. Corporate greed at its finest.
bad,This company does shady things to advance people in undeserved positions all while ignoring all needs and concerns of the regular employees. Things are not run effectively and no one seems to be in control. Poor management and little pay
bad,"Overall, Walgreens is a good company to work for. Helping customers to be well is what it's about. Walgreens has a friendly environment and great people to work with."
bad,Care more about money making then customer care. Employees are disposable and they cut back payroll and force more work under stressful environments. There is no care or concern for employees or their work load. Just pushing numbers
bad,"You are expected to be at work no matter what! If a family member passes away you have to be back at work the day after the funeral. Doesnt matter if it is your child, spouse or who ever. They dont care about anyone. There is mandatory overtime that you will be told about as late as the day of. No time for life to happen. No benefits for 6 months. No sick time. No vacation time. Only PTO that they are reluctant to allow you to take. Oh and dont forget that doesnt start for 6 months!"
bad,"TheY cut your hours when it slow down and over work you with less team. TheY do not pay, I do not trust their payment system regardless hours I work, it is looks set amount I take home often and they..... The only pat PTO no vacation hours . Its just bad place to work simply. Like I will come to work for 2½ hours some days. The do not have a set schedule every day hours are different you will not plan any other things ....Oh its not a good place"
bad,go to work for your shift go home 
bad,"Told I was going to get a raise, more hours, and new position dropped out of school for it and never got any of it, instead they cut my hours and gave the position to someone else after I did all the training. Constantly changing the company policy and management."
bad,"Just No, Don't even. Bad company. Not as bad a CVS. Little to no care for employees. Many stores had no A/C during summer. The poor corporate structure allows under-educated and unqualified people to manger their most important assets that do 70% of their business."
bad,I promise you will hate working here.  Walgreens is the worst job I have ever had.  The pharmacy is a hard place to work and I dread going to work on a daily basis.  Very understaffed and drastically underpaid. Run as fast as you can! A grocery store clerk starts out making more than a Walgreens nationally certified pharmacy tech as well as a cashier at 7-11.  Dealing with rude people and the managers will never have your back - the customer is always right.
bad,The worst place to work ever. They treat you bad unless your kissing their but.  They could care less of your personal life and what your going thru. Walgreen's should always come first.
bad,"Morale, management, others assisting others, pay and poor clientele are all an issue."
bad,"- a typical day required me at the cashier by myself and the photo department by myself, stocking shelves, cleaning store, assist in shipments"
bad,Stressful work environment.  Demanding duties with limited staff to complete workload.  Salaried employees are taken advantaged of by working more hours.
bad,Working with Walgreens I was able to learn. However the entire time I was there I learned very little for what I should have learned. I would have to ask to know about anything in the store process. No matter what seemed like there was no advancing in the company. There are to much favoritium and judgment in the company: especially with management.
bad,"Started workday early. Help with the freight truck, unload, stock store with products. How to stock shelves. Manager for number of years was fair. Workplace culture was cut throat. Lifting heaving crates. Interacting with customers."
bad,Negative energy from everyone and everywhere in that place. Employees are overworked and still not appreciated. Managers are all worse than one another. Not a good place to be.
bad,"Very uncaring and cutthroat compared to CVS where I work now it is totally lacking in encouragement and overall good will.Horrible store managers immature and out of touch. Walgreens made me feel like a number where asCVS cared and accommodated"
bad,"Very unprofessional Manager that does not document anything so that he can change his story at the drop of a hat.  Allows employees to harass and falsely accuse other employees.  Despite having a doctor's note, I was repeatedly threatened to do tasks I could not do.  Manager does not allow you to choose your hours.  You are scheduled 6-8 days in a row with no say as to what hours you are working."
bad,Very poor work environment. Over the entirety of my time working there it was nothing but bad experiences with coworkers and customers. I would never recommend this job unless you obtain a job outside of a store.
bad,not a good place to work the managment is really bad.everyone comes in and doesnt even speak to each other .................................................
bad,"I worked overnight 10 pm- 7 am, 7 days on 7 days off for Walgreens. My duties primarily included working the register and stocking the store. My immediate supervisor was a delight to work with, as were the customers. The store manager was very rude and inconsiderate but came in around 5am. I attempted to move up within the company due to my great work as I ran the store alone over night but was repeatedly denied. I reported it. My hours were cut and I was accused of stealing which ultimately led to me being fired. I filed a suit and got unemployment for my name being slandered throughout the company. I understand every Walgreens may not operate in this fashion but this was my personal experience."
bad,"It's a great place to ""start"" getting some experience,but after a few years,things start to turn ugly. Once you get the training you need, leave. The staff was awful,the company undercuts their employees and values money over having a full staff to deal with the massive amounts of customers. In short, get trained by them,then look for better opportunities."
bad,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is by far the worst company to work for. Managers are lazy and MEAN!!! Managers take two hour lunches and stay in the office.
bad,"I wouldnt recommend, they are quicl to write you up but wont help with performance. Reluctant to give raises and when they do its on $.5-$.10 per year."
bad,The management lacked education and customer service skills. There was no room for improvement and general lack of interest for the employees. In the beginning it was good and then management did not utilize my experience and skills.
bad,"People who aren't trained in people management are running the stores as store managers.  The culture is not geared for an employee with a family.  The only thing that matters is the store, not the people."
bad,They do not have a set schedule and you are randomly placed on the schedule anytime between 8:30am-9:00pm and if they do not have the schedule out in time then you are unable to let your family know what your schedule is going to look like or what time you are supposed to be there the next day.  I was hired full time but never got over 28 hours per week while earning the minimum a CPhT would make.
bad,"Should have better trained employees, they were very nice a kind and patient with hard to deal with customers. Friendly and willing to help. Management was slow in responding to call for help"
bad,"Poor management and ZERO amount of job training. On day one of the job you're thrown as if into a lion's den to fend for yourself. I pity the fools that fall for the lackluster 'managers', as most are novices with few people skills. Treated as high schoolers during break times, minus the bells ringing and having to carry a hall pass to use the restroom. Awful place...be warned!"
bad,"This is one of the worst places I've worked at.  They do not care about the employees.  Management sucks, with the exception of a few decent supervisors.  The store manager was hated by everyone.  She was rude, obnoxious, undermining, belittling, and more.  They are constantly pushing sales goals at you for every postion in the store."
bad,When I first got hired I was promised full time. Well at first they hired too many extra people so knocked me down to part time . soon after I was made fult time but I realized how terrible this job was soon after I started nights. I was sexually harassed more than once and the owner didn't care. I told him how un safe I felt but all he could say was sorry. Sarcasticly. So I push it away and keep going in to work. Well I hurt myself on the job and needed to go to the hospital making it workers comp. I did all the paperwork and a week after my accident I was let go. And then I get a Bill in the mail for the hospital visit THEY should have paid for. I was fired so they didnt have to pay the workers comp. Sad excuse for management.
bad,"it was a very unorganized place to work, the staff always had an issue and there was always favoritism, The patients were always mad and you could not give them explanations."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Walgreens.  It was a part time job and I did not have any benefits.  I would not work for Walgreens again.  I did cashier job, stock items and opened boxes.  I didn't have set hours and that made it difficult to plan around my social life.  It was not a good place for me to work at."
bad,"This is a great place to work with great people....the company is a person devouring machine-no individuality."
bad,"Too much stress, that lead to health problems, and not enough coverage or hours. Constant change of management. No real leadership and everyone has a sour attitude."
bad,"Overwork there pharmacist, no lunch break, or any type of break what-so-ever. Poor management. Not treated as professional. Not a good company to work for as a pharmacist."
bad,"Super corporate company, Sales and profit are more important than taking care of the community and their family with medication. Always short staffed and the technicians that have a desire to learn more about pharmacy are discouraged and told they cannot even explain to the mom of a sick boy or an older gentleman how to take the medication. thus making the patient wait longer just to hear the same thing from a pharmacist (who basically taught said technician what to say) that the tech would of said."
bad,Horrible management I think that the managers need to re-evaluate themselves and treat everyone as they would want to be treated. I cried several times due to the disrespect they gave me.
bad,"The managers who I work with do not know how to handle the stress of a busy environment,not only that but when they are stressed they take it out on the employees. The stress level is insane and when your manager talks to you like your a child,I find it very disrespectful. Also, the place is freezing and it gives me allergies,the restrooms are always filthy,and I always see dust piling up. The vacuum is broken on the wheels so I have to literally carry it to where I need to vacuum,which hurts my back. They need to treat their  employees better. Management needs to be the better example for their employees. The ones I work with are majorly rude ."
bad,The environment isn't pleasant. The management was really bad that why i had to quit. They were not friendly to the customers at all and did not understand if you had classes or go to school
bad,"Terrible management, nobody cares about your personal life, no benefits, untrained staff, bosses are very useless, they they don't appreciate your work..."
bad,"Tech's don't get paid what they should here. We are over worked and over looked. You have to watch your back constantly. They don't care about the well-being off their employees, they only care about the money that they store makes."
bad,"Always short staffs."
bad,Fun at times but management was horrible. Pharmacy was great. It was organized and there was no drama. There are too many people being constantly switched from store to store. This causes chaos and disagreements between new transfers and people who had been there before
bad,I worked as a cosmetician and mainly handled all of the make up area. It was just a job until I found something better. I did enjoy working there but the hours were ruff and you were expected to work every holiday cause they did not close for any holiday. With two very small children I could not work at this job long because they simply did not understand. It would be a great job for someone that is single or a teenager that doesn't want to work in fast food.
bad,I did not learn anything. Typically is boring and hard work. It has very poor management. The workplace is not good for working. The hardest part of the job is going up and down. Assistance manager does not give any respect to the worker. He used his power too much cause of upper-level connection.
bad,"Awful place to work pharmacist we rude and didnt try to help you learn. Had a couple good pharmacists, extremely understaffed and over worked when working!"
bad,"I worked for a freight company who had a contract with Walgreens, i did not work directly for Walgreens.  The project was to obtain information on all their photo machines to swap out for a new machine to be coming into store."
bad,Unprofessional training company has no idea how to handle training . This experience has drained me emotionally and physically. They are not a good company and I went in foolish thinking they were .
bad,"The job expects way too much for the amount they are paying ,breaks were very short and never on time, the managers are very rude and not willing to work with you on things"
bad,I want to work for a company that instills principle and creates an environment that promotes growth and the desire to achieve results through individual and team building.
bad,"The worst, and always will be, place I have ever worked period. Horrendous management due to several factors. They only praised and listened to one employee because she was the ""store favorite"" they also belittled everyone else because they were not the ""favorite"". Moreover, the hours were not the best, a part-time sales associate would be working anywhere from five-seven days per week with the bad management. They told me I was going to receive a promotion with more pay, received the extra workload that came with the new title but no additional pay. In conclusion, Walgreen's is the absolute place to work, McDonald's would be a better place to work."
bad,Not a company I would recommend working for. Their is a lack of leadership at the store level as far as Chicago area flagships. Would never work for their comps again .
bad,"Awful work environment. Terrible management. Worst place I have ever worked. For a billion dollar company, they are amateurs.would advise all folks to avoid them at all cost"
bad,You had to be a kiss a*** to get anthing in the company and be popular to work in the pharmacy if you erre nether you had it hard no hours and worked every weekend management needs work
bad,Pharmacy is a fast food drive through experience with little automation and zero bandwidth.  Walgreen barely staffs enough technicians in the pharmacy to get by.
bad,"It seems once you become a store manager you forget how to work in your store. Once you become a district manager you forget how a store operates, and higher up forgets that customers exist. "
bad,"-the managers never have your back"
bad,Did not like retail. Policies and Procedures. The employees were great. I did not like all the shoplifting and drug use that was going on. Customers were rude and disrespectful
bad,A lot of back breaking work for very little pay. Never closed on holidays and they only close for stage 3 state of emergency's which in a nut shell means they do not care about their employees AT ALL.
bad,"Horrible company. They hide behind review scores to give you a raise and if you score to low you don't get a raise, or if you get a raise because when you started they payed this much then 6 months later they started to pay this much well that was your yearly  raise and you don't get another. The management is atrocious. No room for advancement from within."
bad,"Very stressful, never enough help, very busy, management keeps things in the dark. No positive comments given to employees, always "
bad,"They don't work around your schedule. I had a 2nd job and they literally schedule whenever and didn't care bout that job, no raises,short breaks, only hire as part time and if you want 40hrs, you have to work at more then one store. I hate walgreens."
bad,"Schedules change weekly based on the feeling of the manager. No preference given based on length of service. Be prepared to work nights, weekends, holidays, and don't expect any appreciation or encouragement. I've been there for 4 years and I only make 25 cents an hour more than the starting wage at Wal-Mart. Maternity leave is two weeks. Forget asking for time off. If you need to take off of work you better  find somebody that's wants to take your shift otherwise its unexcused."
bad,"bad place to work do not recommend at all. Manager are all the same, pay is not good. there are far more better places to work and do with your time then to work for walgreens."
bad,Overall it was a good experience I felt working there was a bit off. The employees were not family oriented basically everyone is there for a check. The store manager was rude and can never address someone properly.store manager always had an attitude.i would not recommend anyone to work there unless they really have no we're else to work.
bad,Bad work environment did not like working for the company. always short staffed and overworked. Got rid of many positions so alot of people had to take a pay cut
bad,"Never changed my schedule when I asked, hours were conflicting with school hours, never changed my position at work, I was always made to work on the registers even when I was scheduled not to."
bad,"Unless you desperately need money to support yourself, avoid working at Walgreens. The environment on its own is very depressing and management is very poor."
bad,"none. I have nothing to say about, for it was not suitable working environment, it might be suitable for some one who got connection in the company. that all i have to say."
bad,"I started working for this company in the cosmetic department and was quickly moved to the pharmacy. Which was great because that meant I went from part time to full and I would receive benefits, which I did. What I did not know was that I was also giving up both of my 15 minute breaks and my 30 minute lunch in doing so."
bad,"Typical work day is putting away merchandise, helping customers, and working on the cash registrar stations. Management is very friendly and helpful. The workplace culture is very friendly."
bad,Management was okay at best because they would tell you that they want to move you up but never do. Fairness in hours was also not there as well. EX: Every Saturday nigh ad tags for the week had to be taken down and new ones put up. The same people would be put on that duty every Saturday.
bad,"I have been with the company for 10 years and much has changed.  I feel the direction of the company and my personal direction are traveling in opposite directions.  The opportunity for advancement is very low once you get into my current role.  There is no growth in this area.  Staff budgets are cut down to very little.  More is expected from less people.  I can be moved to another location at any time of the year.  Most stores have not dealt with problem employees, but rather have allowed good employees to leave.  It is a headache.  I work at minimum 9 hours a day and very rarely receive more than a 30 minute lunch.  Male managers are required to wear ties and specific colored button shirts, where as female managers can pretty much wear what they want to."
bad,"I worked as a pharmacy tech for about 7 years and it was rwally stressful. I was really good at my job, so i ended up doing way more work than most other techs for no extra pay."
bad,Just don't do it.  It's difficult and stressful with no reward.  You will work countless hours and be yelled at by multiple patients throughout the day.  Not worth it.
bad,"The company decided to cap the pay of their employees back in 2013. You will never make beyond minimum wage, and even management employed for years had their pay cut drastically after the pay cap. I had a store owner give my public information to a co-worker, and HR's response was to intimidate me into silence."
bad,management is awful in the pharmacy. the techs that have been there a long time are disrespectful to new and training techs. pharmacists are careless about the techs they supervise and are too high and mighty to care about anything. i wouldn't recommend working here.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to communicate and help patient on a personal level. It is a challenging job and would definitely required skills of multi-tasking. The work day is pretty constant with phones calls to insurance companies, patients, and clinics. The hardest part of the job is trying to do everything when you are alone and are needed at multiple places."
bad,"Was told being hired for full-time, but got part-time instead, no change in foreseeable future.  Pay for certified position is really low compared to other industries."
bad,"I have been working for Walgreens for few years already.  I do not like this company at all.  They try to promote “bottom up” management meaning they want to listen to the ideas at the store level and make adjustments. However, when a concern is brought up, it’s being ignored.  Management assigns unreasonable amount of tasks to be completed in an limited amount of time.  Instead of training the right people for the right task, the tasks are given to the person who knows how to do it, not necessarily the correct person who should do it.  The more capable you are to work the more is being assigned to you.  There is no teamwork.  Work just get dumped onto the next person on duty."
bad,"sttressful, customers come first and law comes second but then law must come first and then how do you put the customer second. you dont get a chance to explain, impossible goals to reach"
bad,"The management was quite rude a majority of the time and the work hours were very hostile. On top of that, not a friendly work environment with little to NO TRAINING!"
bad,"Never again will i work for this company. It is absolutely terrible. Unless you find a great manager but other than that. Bad pay, bad managers, they take advantage of you."
bad,"Terrible, dishonest store management and poor corporate involvement on behalf of employees. Was hired as full time then told there were not enough hours to give me to qualify me as such. I felt I was hired under false circumstances. Very stressful work environment. The store I worked at was not staffed appropriately for the volume of proscriptions it was filling, thus leading to poor customer services and patients who were very angry, with every right to be such."
bad,Ther Store managers and higher positions do not care about employees of their work life balance if it requires them to do a little extra work. They treat employees unfairly and make them feel unimportant.
bad,"If you want to work for a company that does not care about it's employees than Walgreens is for you! As a store manger, upper management did not care about your work/life balance. I was told many time to separate my team members from the company. They politely called it ""Addition through Subtraction"". This was their way to fire who they didn't like! Walgreens only cares about the $$$. I did enjoy many of my employees, but that was it!"
bad,Horrible management... Long hours... Nobody came to work on Saturday... Stressful!! If there was an issue the issue would prolong before something was actually done about it. The lines were ALWAYS backed up which caused longer hour and the same not enough work to be done.
bad,"Walgreens does not officially pay anyone to stock their shelves. The ""Shift Leaders"" get that honor. Doubly so if you have the unfortunate task of being a shift leader for an overnight shift. Also, Walgreens has a terrible tract record for maintaining overnight help, so the overnight supervisor or ""shift lead"" is not only directly responsible for ensuring the entire truck winds up on the shelf, but running the register, and making sure people don't walk out of the store with hundreds of dollars of cosmetics in their pockets."
bad,Poor management and they do not provide lunch breaks.  I feel like they over work there pharmacist and treat them like janitors.  I also feel like they discriminate
bad,My chief complaint is there is little room for promotion  / advancement.  Bonus structure too dependent on Front end metrics.  Store mgr should NOT be in 'charge' of RXM
bad,You stay in the same spot all day instead of rotating. Too much pressure and not enough benefits. Problem with trouble shooting and inconsistent with ethics.
bad,"Couldn't get phones calls back, even from Corporate. Very unprofessional. You can't really right a review if you keep getting turned down for one. Some employees are nice."
bad,"I did say I got 6-9 days paid vacation but it was only after I hounded them for it. They promised it and never wanted to give it. Also the managers want you to be on the phone constantly while they stand and laugh, gossip, and act like they are a bar instead of at work. They don’t care anything for you. If you are truly sick and went to the hospital, they refuse to take a doctor excuse."
bad,I was a phone and chat customer service agent.  I had to maintain 2 chat sessions simultaneously.  This did not allow me to give either customer very good service.
bad,Retail. Over priced seasonal items. No holidays off. Several cliques that drove good workers out. Minimal room to grow. Not an ideal location to work.
bad,"Although I have to give credit to Walgreens for training me in the trade I choose for a career path, this was the absolute worst company I've ever worked for. Rarely ever did we have enough help for the workload put on the technicians. It was always a very hectic day in the pharmacy and keeping employees was a problem as well. To this day they have yet to fully staff the pharmacy. The managers of the store as well as the pharmacy it's self allowed the workload to take a toll on them as well, making it extremely hard for them to fulfill their job roles as a whole. There wasn't a day that we had enough help."
bad,this is a disturbution warehouse and your always fast pace  this has its up and downs about the place the managers are very crazy and like to have fun at times
bad,Please look elsewhere if you are planning to get a job through this company.  the people who works at the district when I was there were a bunch of joker especially the DM.
bad,Great job and a good place to work great people and a friendly environment. The people are fun to be around and the customer are amazing. All in all its a good job
bad,"this job is horrible, you hardly get any breaks and the pay terrible. I would not recommend this job to anyone ... that's how bad this job is not to mention the rude customers."
bad,I would not have minded Walgreen's but management changed so often so that made it difficult to adjust.  Also the turnover with employees was through the roof.
bad,As a cashier you are expected to greet every single customer.
bad,"It all depends on the store and the district as far as how things are at the company. They will work with any schedule you have, however the hours for full time are only 32 a week"
bad,A typical day starts off with co workers getting on your nerves being constantly watched over by managers short breaks and long hours a lot of employees call off so your stuck doing there jbs even when you are supposed to be doing other tasks
bad,I would never work at this establishment again.  The enviornment was very cut throat and unenjoyable.  Everyday that I worked here I was getting backstabbed.
bad,Stores should never allow people to lead others with horrible attitudes and ones that pick favorites!! When you’re made a “lead” or manager act like it!! Especially the women in this store! Pathetic!!! Don’t work in the Coventry store!! Getting paid biweekly is awful too!!! Also expected to do the job of more than one person on a shift. The shift are never shorter than 8 hrs. So exhausting!!!!
bad,the company saw me a a number not a person that bleed the colors I and the store manager maid a mistake and they fired me for it not him.The district manager was the only person that cared .
bad,"I have not worked here in about 5 years, so not sure if it has changed, but when I left it was getting worse. The management was horrible. I worked at about 15 different stores in Aurora/Denver over 10 years and they were all poor experiences. They over worked you and paid you little."
bad,"Store manager talked bad behind everyone's back. Always made me feel as if I wasn't a part of a team, made me feel stupid. Favored 2 other employees. She always made sure to give them the days off they wanted. I had to work every holiday even tho we were supposed to switch holidays to work. I always felt on edge whIle working there and I was always so stressed and worried she would get mad at me. Nothing I did was good enough. Worst store manager I have ever dealt with."
bad,"Management is a joke, employees are treated horribly, people are still making minimum wage after being there for 2 years, people who are newer are making more than someone who started before them. Good luck trying to advance your career with this company. When asked for help at the register, it either never comes or comes too late and everyone gives attitude when asked a simple question."
bad,.I was a member of management and I can tell you that the upper management couldnt care less about the employees. They are very rude and money focused
bad,upper management only chased numbers of productivity/profit.  at no time did I feel like upper management truly cared about employees and what their workflow decisions really meant with non-measurable metrics
bad,Not a good place. They want you to work your hours but if  you ever need to call in for personal reasons they will doc you which I understand but they will always call you to cover other shifts. There needs to be a balance.
bad,"I wasn't a fan of the ""favored nations"". Insiders got perks of being friends with the management. New hires had no chance to advance because of the cutt throat atmosphere and backstabbing mentality of ""management"""
bad,"Felt like i was in high school again, only no one respects anyone. The pay is insulting and what they expect of you is even worse.  They promote friends and outsiders before looking into those who deserve it."
bad,I would have enjoyed my working experience if my availability schedule was respected and if I was trained appropriately. I was not trained to do my job and was hired to their own scheduling needs instead of trying to come up with a reasonable schedule.
bad,"Management sucked, had you do meaningless tasks that weren't part of your job description. The best part about it was staying in the stockroom where you didn't have to worry about interacting with anyone"
bad,there is no room for growth at this location. i don't see why only one person can move up and be given a the rewards like other lag behind and don't receive the proper training.
bad,The title sums it up. I hate this place! Everything about it sucks from the management to the other employees.  The biggest slap in the face was when they changed the starting pay rate with out bothering to compensate their employees that had been there for years. So people walking in the door where making the same pay as me. I wasted 14 years with this place . I hope they bankrupt close the doors permanently.
bad,I hated my time at Walgreens.  I wanted to work in the pharmacy because at the time I was going to pharmacy school.  They said there was no space on the schedule for me in the pharmacy.  They then placed another girl in the pharm. as a tech.  I was then completely over working for Walgreens.  That was extremely rude and I saw it was blatant disrespect.
bad,i really didnt like working at walgreens it was the worst place to work. They wanted me to work overnights but i was unable t do that so when i denied them of that they tried to have me fired
bad,Poor place to work as well as a very unsafe plaes to be.The mannagers are knot understanding to the workers.The pharmacy is the slowest ever you have to wait for hours for your meds. They never answear the phone.
bad,Managers are inconsiderate and will envy you if you are a student. The store manager in my location has to be the worst human being in the universe. Will purposely do things to make your work shift impossible. A lot of favoritism. Unfair working conditions. Lacking communication and professionalism.
bad,"Scheduling can include short shifts, 10 hour shifts, part/full-time, turn-around shifts, mornings, evenings, weekends -- all in one week.  They expect a smile on your face all day long while you multi-task like a maniac -- answer the phone, wait on customers, get drive, enter, fill and sell the script -- there are not enough words to describe how chaotic it is. They cut your breaks and constantly work short-handed.  You go home exhausted mentally and physically.  You go home frustrated because none of the tools where you work WORK -- not the software, hardware, scales, cash registers, phones. The stores are dirty because they cut the cleaning budget and expect the employees to clean the bathrooms, floors, walk-off mats, etc.  The windows haven't been cleaned in 2 years.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
bad,The Store is overrun by homeless  people . Homeless people steal things. nothing regarding the People Stealing items. Management does nothing about it.
bad,"I never will either"
bad,".Poor management, poor compensation, no care or support for the employees. Lied to about signing bonuses, repeatedly slashed management bonuses, raised metrics at the very end of the fiscal year on stores in order to disqualify management from yearly bonuses. Denied yearly experience raises."
bad,"Terrible to work at,stressful and not worth the time and effort for a career advancement. Not fun to be there anymore,always bust your butt for everyone else.the company itself doesn’t care about anyone but the shareholders."
bad,Manager wasn’t the best she was hard to work with made my work days uncomfortable when she was there didn’t want to respect the fact I had s young child at home i couldn’t work late cause of
bad,walgreens does not care about there employees nor about there family the management is the worst that i have ever worked  nor are they trained properly they are the worst i have ever worked for in all my years and i felt like when i was in pre school
bad,"I had the most horrible experience at the store i was working in."
bad,"Extremely under staffed."
bad,"A typical day at work includes juggling customer service, stocking, facing, handling returns, cleaning, working registers, and photo machine operation at the same time. Employees are constantly running back and forth to appease all aspects of the job. Customers are often confused or dissatisfied by store policies, lack of inventory, and cryptic sale prices. Management is very hands off until something goes wrong. Hours are extremely inconsistent and difficult to plan around. I learned that shifts are perpetually understaffed, forcing employees to double or triple their work load for the same pay. There were no enjoyable parts of the job, it was very stressful at all times."
bad,"management team never worked with you, everyone had their favorites that the hours would go to, if walgreens didn't have any hours your hrs would be cut dramatically."
bad,Bad management!! They don’t care about there employees what so ever. Thought it’ll be great to work here but I was wrong. I should of asked more people about it
bad,"low salary, hostile workplace. do not work here, they will cut your hours and do not care, raises are miniscule, just go get a education and look for other employment"
bad,"Walgreens has a culture of quantity over quality. Making rate is the primary objective regardless of if the job is done correctly or accurately. Passing off responsibility or ignoring it completely is common practice to make rate. Cheating the numbers to make goal is more acceptable than doing a job correctly and coming in under goal. Changes to procedure that is working is constant while problems and long term barriers are ignored. Poor management decisions and obvious favoritism have destroyed employee morale. Benefits, perks, and programs have been rolled back over the years. Rising insurance rates usually cancel any cost of living income increase. There's no pride or enjoyment, just a pay check."
bad,I did not like the work environment. the manager expected me to be the security guard. the workplace did not promote culture. Co-workers did not communicate well among departments.
bad,Walgreens has really taken a turn for the worst in the past few years. They do not care about their employees or their patients. Its all about how fast you can churn out Rxs. Its become an unsafe work environment due to opioids and the skeleton staff they have working.
bad,"Nothing productive to say about this one, "
bad,This company does not give you hours unless you are a senior tech. Horrible customer service. Employee turnaround is very high. You have nothing but overworked nd underpaid employees.
bad,"They have no union."
bad,"Don't apply, I hated it. The staff was unorganized and the breaks were never on time. The management was not properly trained and called me an outright liar when I was sick with the stomach flu. The time I requested for vacation was used against me"
bad,"A company full of drama, favoritism, and gossip. No room to move up or grow unless your brown nosing. Woudn't recommend anyone to work here not even if the last job on earth."
bad,Walgreens has transitioned from a place that I absolutely loved to a place that I am glad to not be working for anymore. The job in itself became unbearable. Very stressful job. The most fulfilling part of my job there were the customers.
bad,"The lack of competent management coupled with a lack teamwork, lead to a very chaotic and hostile working environment. There was a complete disregard of company policy by management and it was not implemented equally to all."
bad,"The culture at my most recent stint with Walgreens was one I didn't really expect. My work relationship with my employees was fine, I never had an issue with any of them. The managers above me didn't always have the best interests of the employee at heart, they looked out for themselves and threw others under the bus."
bad,"The Job itself was not hard, and was very easy to do your job. Management was terrible, they did not care about the employees in any way. The employees that worked really hard were never recognized for their hard work, while the employees that did nothing would complain and receive praise for the work of others."
bad,"At first working at Walgreens is easy, but then once they see that you're able to do more they'll pile on more work along with manager's jobs, and other workers jobs. They are not flexible with hours, so if you have a family, second job, or  go to school they won't accommodate you at all."
bad,"Unfair pay and bad co-workers.Unfair management and playing favorites. Bad health insurance and low pay. No breaks, no time to train people. Terrible company to work for. Unappreciated. Favoritism."
bad,You will be lucky to get a break and if you have to use the bathroom you have to practically beg to be able to go. Manager was very rude and in some cases not nice to the customers
bad,I did not like working at this company. Not only were the employees treated unfairly from the customers but the management did nothing to stop it they didn't want to mess up their bonuses.
bad,"their do not back up their workers. the whole open on holidays thing is awful, just so people can buy last minute stuff thy should have planned for, you're stuck there while your family is home waiting on you to do xmas or thanksgiving. Forget traveling for holidays, period. So if your family is a few hours away? you'll miss them, so people can buy theatre candy and cigarettes"
bad,Not a place you would be willing to work at. Very stressful environment and the pay was not good enough for all the work you have to put in. I would not recommend working at Walgreens.
bad,"management is dishonest. job security; there is none.  You will find yourself working overtime for 5 months straight and when you begin to ask about benefits will be told that you are in the system as ""part-time"" and then receive 8 hours a week.  poor work culture and environment."
bad,"Management forced employees to hassle and haggle customers with pushing ""promotional"" sales, not allowing for the ""customer is right"" atmosphere, and lack of care for store presentation of cleanliness, stocked, and professionalism."
bad,Overworked in this company. Boss had me do administrative work without the title and just overall a very bad experience. It was a lot of work. Be prepared to work your butt off.
bad,"Walgreens cuts store hours during the summertime to save money. I went two weeks at a time without being placed on the schedule, and was told I had to call around to other stores to see if they had hours to give me. Managers kept their 50+hrs a week schedule while everyone else got their hours cut drastically. The pharmacist was a shrew. Was yelled at constantly and berated by the pharmacy manager in front of customers. Never was allowed to do required training for a pharmacy tech. Horrible people, horrible job."
bad,No upside to advancement. show favoritism. Hours are scarce. Working there gave me a hope to never work there again. At walgreens you are not seen as a real person just a pawn
bad,All they care about are the numbers in the store. They want wait times and customer surveys to be 100%. I had a complaint against a manager and now I feel I am starting to be retaliated against. When I complained to my pharmacy area health supervisor about the feelings I was having she called me paranoid. (Word for word).
bad,"unfair and deception team. A pharmacist had a racism case opened against her while i was working there for being unfair to an african american young female. also, they unfairly just stop scheduling people irrespective of why they may have called off a certain day. very nosy team on a personal level."
bad,"Walgreens was a pretty good company until they started to make changes to the management and Human Resources team and reduced the benefits making it a miserable place to work.   "
bad,"I was hired on as a Shift Lead, which is basically one step below an Assistant Manager. A couple months down the line, I get demoted because I hurt my back (on the job) and they don't think I'm a good fit for the job anymore. If I learned anything about this company, it's that they'll replace you without a second thought and, if you're not at 100% all the time, you're put behind a register and forgotten about until it's time for you to go home. If you try to ask for more hours or a pay raise or anything like that, Management will look you in the eyes and they'll ""work on it"", with no intentions of helping you. I would not advise anyone work for Walgreens."
bad,Manager felt he could change shifts after they were already posted.  They required us to work Christmas Day and Thanksgiving day.  Not a job for a single mom or one who is family oriented.
bad,i worked for walgreens for  3 years and found out that my job was being outsourced . I posted payments and reconciled insurance remits talked to patients on the phone regarding their bill. collected payments over the phone
bad,Management changes there policies ever month so if you think you have something down and can do it correctly next month it's wrong and you maybe fired for doing it the same old way
bad,"I come in and do whatever I'm told, cashier, stock person, or a beauty consultant. I loved the customers and co-workers but the company overall wasn't really good at managing."
bad,they overwork you and don't care about you they try to do events to say they care about the employee but they store stays open so you have to stay at the store so only some people can go have employee appreciation fun
bad,customers were very rude and the pharmacy customers were even more rude and very demanding. But it's a job and somebody has to do it and a check is a check.
bad,"They promised you one thing and you didn't get it.  They just keep you on the line for ever.  one day a week, maybe two a week, maybe  nothing. You just never knew."
bad,Individuals do not matter at Walgreens. They only care about numbers and their is a total lack of care for their team members. Their is inconsistency throughout their stores and the corporate hierarchy does not practice the values they coach store leadership to practice.
bad,"This was my first job in pharmacy. Poor management, poor structure. Overworked employees with making almost minimum wage. Very long hours sitting at a desk with minimum to no breaks and when breaks are taken its an issue. Management is a joke."
bad,"Walgreens used to be a good company to work for. A lot has changed and even more has changed since I left, for the worse. I would never work for Walgreens ever again. I had may friends that left the company. Walgreens does not support its employees. It looks for scapegoats and people to blame when the chips are down. Little to no room for advancement."
bad,Management would hold the techs as responsible for workflow issues. Work loads were dangerous and techs were severely underpaid. Walgreens is the Walmart of the pharmacy world. Avoid at all costs.
bad,Management lies to employees. Endless computer training with computers that do not work over half of the time. I would work 9 hours without a break. I would not recommend working here
bad,"Never reccommend this store. Didn't feel welcomed, was very busy and unorganized. Only worked for two week here. I didn't get to know management or any one further up the ladder."
bad,"I was very much taken advantage of and abused at Walgreens."
bad,They don't care about their employees. Undermine and don t listen to the staff. Manipulate their own policy to benefit them. For a 6 billion dollar company they think they can treat employees unfairly.
bad,"Well where should I start, Training is horrible (half-??? training) you basically self train & read over guidelines to figure out how to work a queue. The guidelines they want you to read make no sense what so ever, It tells you what the queue is but doesn't really explain how to work them. Parking is a joke! Oh but don't worry they give you a 2 minute grace period to walk across the street to the building and walk up the stairs to get to your desk on time (actually takes about 6-7min) Attendance policy sucks, they want at least 48hrs of notice but will deny it and tell you if you need time off you would have to call out and get the occurrence for unplanned call out.. They pick & choose who they like and who they want to nit pick on. They say they have a dress code but that only depends on who you are! In my eyes this place sets you up to fail!!!"
bad,Working here was my second job. not only did my personal life get invaded but was harrased by my manager! i took my complaints to cooperate and nothing was ever done so i quit and left for good!
bad,"This is the worst company I have worked for in my 40+ working years."
bad,"Walgreens as whole is a great store merchandise wise, but this specific walgreens has terrible management. They're known to treat you they way they want to, don't go by he book have favoritism and never report serious issues such as (workeplace harassment, sexist)."
bad,Especially if Kenya Williams and Monique Daniels are there. They lie and will micromanage you especially if they don't like you.  So Good luck and Alison Jones is the worst manager ever.
bad,Not a good place to work if you have a family they do not care about there employees family obligations. Management is bad and unreliable to keeping schedule flexibility with employees that have familys and small children
bad,Its Awful Managers never get the work done if they want it done at the last minute they demand one of the sales associates to do it while we have our daily jobs to do. Also no one goes the extra mile it always has to be me to do the hard work. I stand in the cooler and freezer for 2 straight hours filling and facing.
bad,"they except you to drop your personal life, emergencies to them are an inconvenience, as an employee with a disability, they cut hours til you are pretty much not making a check worth working for, its like the hire disabled people to just say the are equal opportunity."
bad,"The company used to be great, what is was has since melted away. It is all about justification of ones job, there is no advancement opportunities moving forward. All positions are hired from outside the company for regional roles. District manager role is the worst in the company followed by store manager. Glad I left first time in 10 years I've ever felt this happy."
bad,The position no longer exists. The company practices by management were highly suspect and unprofessional. Job duties were unfeasible and in some cases illegal.
bad,Management terrible ! Hours vary depending on how much the Manager liked you. Very unprofessional and pay not worth the amount of stress you go through.
bad,"I learned working at Walgreens that things don't work here like they do in the rest of the world. It is not a good work environment at all. Upper management tends to take employees for granted and then turn around and blame the employees when things do not go according to plan. Walgreens does not believe in teamwork, time management, and when an employee voices an opinion, they will stand against the employee. There is nothing enjoyable about working for this company. The pros do not outweigh the cons and I would advice those looking for a job, look here as a last resort."
bad,"Working here was a nightmare. Coworkers were the only thing that made it worth going to work. No security in a very sketchy part of town. You were expected to confront thieves despite the fact that Wlagreens' corporation does not want you to do that."
bad,The store manager I worked for was known to NOT promote from within the company. Instead they would rather go out and hire somebody with no experience rather that promote. But that's all based on who the store manager is.
bad,managers was always giving hours to people that wouldn't work and had her own personal problems and she would bring them to work. and the girls would date the store manager it was a mess. the cashier and customer were great.
bad,"44-hour work weeks, rotating schedule when there's no need for one. Pharmacy clients are terrible. Holiday schedule never out far enough to actually plan time ti see family for the holidays."
bad,"Management made fun and gossiped about the employees they supervised.  I recall the day I decided to put in my two weeks... a manager saw me buying K-cups, and said, ""You can afford a Keurig? That's something people get for weddings.""  I had other managers yell at me and tell me to quit, etc."
bad,"Walgreen,s has to be the worst place to work if you are looking for  job security. This place is a good place for a high school student, not someone who has a family to take care of"
bad,"Walgreens is a racist company whatever you do stay away. Management is horrible they're so childish all they do is bully the employees. It's a lot of favoritism, and if you aren't a certain race you're automatically disliked."
bad,Have to do way too much to have to be subject to a shirt and tie. They never care about your work life balance. You'll go in from 2-11 and be right back at work at 7:30 a.m. Violated rules. For example: weren't allowed to take breaks. Upper management does not even talk to us when they walk in the store.
bad,"A typical day at work starts with not enough help to take care of patients, phones ringing off the hook, and management that is completely absent until you don't meet a metric, then there are 4-5 management figures there to tell you what you did wrong. The culture at Walgreens is now; ""Do more with less"". If you are the type of person that loves to multitask while people are yelling at you, then you are set. Walgreens has slashed budgets to the point that even in busy stores there is no coverage. Walgreens does not care about its patients or patrons, and even less about its employees."
bad,I worked with a manager that was not a good manager. I only was put on the schedule for 5 hours per week. I not need to say more.I already knew my stuff and did my work on a timely matter. This company was not a good fit for me. I did work with other pharmacist that were very good. I feel that I had to train myself at this company.The most rewarding part of this job was the interaction with the customers.So keep in mind I only worked 5 hours per week and given the opportunity I would done very well.I was always ready to learn new things.
bad,"Don't work here. Bad company, bad management at my store and at every other store that I have had friends work at. Company does not care about you at all. Outdated hiring process and store systems. Treat you like garbage."
bad,Walgreens is a very non busy slow paced store. The pay is below average. It gets extremely boring most days and there is barley any interaction with customers.
bad,I did not like working for Walgreens not enough pay for the work I put in the customers were rude. not enough training. would not work for them again for all the money in the world
bad,"This is a very bad location to work in. Walgreens is a pretty boring store to work in. It isn't the best and it isn't the worst, but when you are in a bad area and the people you work with are shady it's time to go."
bad,"Nada que ver con la compañía de hace 10 años , se a convirtio en una empresa abusiva con su personal, la gerencia poco profesional abusan de su poder y juegan favoritismo "
bad,"It was a very stale environment. Not much fun into it, it was a lot of just standing around and doing nothing. Breaks weren't paid for, and they were very short."
bad,"Pay is not good, you do not feel appreciate there's no advancement, to much drama. There is no professionalism. You learn 10 positions and get payed nothing."
bad,"If you are looking for anything other then a part time job then avoid at all cost.  Low pay, No raises. Nothing worth anything being here other then a basic part time student looking to earn some pocket change"
bad,"If you are a temp they treat you like one and make you feel very unwelcome. You receive very little training, and if a manager doesn't like you they make it obvious. The rules for temps don't apply to regular employees. You learn from the full time employees but yet you get told your doing it wrong by the managers"
bad,"Nothing positive to say about this place. I thought it was a company that cared about their employees, until I was held at gunpoint and nothing was done, and they expected me to be back at work two days later."
bad,Worst job ever. Management was petty and there was no where to go in terms of going upwards but they have zero issue giving you their work responsibility with no raise and even lying to give you false hope.
bad,Learning experiences in various settings in the workplace based on personal growth and desire.  Each person's strengths are measured based on their knowledge and drive.
bad,Most of the techs were very rude and unwilling to work as a team. Hours got cut frequently. Not a good work environment. Extremely understaffed and that's how walgreens likes to cut cost by not hiring enough employees..
bad,The store was operated in a sub-par manner with management being responsible for most of the problems. Employees that made recurring mistakes did so because management failed to properly instruct them from when they were hired.
bad,The employees are nice and hard working but management needs some help. There were a lot of changes and not for the betterment of the company and patients.
bad,"The way they scheduled employees were based solely off how the manager personally feels about you. If she didn't like you, you wont b getting any extra hours or the hours you desire. And the work environment was uncomfortable, and drama filled."
bad,"A typical day at work involves calling patients on prescriptions that need to be picked up, managing inventory, data processing/filling prescriptions, selling prescriptions, insurance adjudication."
bad,It was a very unfulfilling experience.The management was very unsure as to how to properly run the store location and favoritism was unfortunately a common practice as far as company policies were concerned.
bad,"Hostile working environment, low pay, high expectations, gossips, needs more training on how to treat and speak to employees in the retail division. Employees are rushed to do PPLs and then thrown up to the front line on their own. Management plays the employees against the other managers. No one takes ownership of errors or mistakes, no one cleans their own messes and expects others to go behind them and finish their tasks."
bad,The people who you work with are great. As far as work productivity count the company expects a lot but unwilling to increase their employers salary.  A lot of micromanaging.
bad,"would never recommend anybody to work for them. The managers always had favorites, they didn't work hard in my opinion and always pointed fingers. never again"
bad,"Low wages, not willing to work with your schedule. Lack of proper training then writes you up for not performing to their standard. Not a good place to work or start a career. Devastated my life."
bad,Turn off Alarm  Safe Count Price Changes Markdowns Smart Counts Then start receiving vendors. The hardest part is the season isle with the big shelves that are hard to move.
bad,"My manager didn't believe I was being sexually harassed by a customer. A few workers, including myself, quit because of the manager. Even other stores know how horrible she is."
bad,"very high paced and stressful"
bad,"they don't allow you to take your 15 min breaks, store manager says breaks are a privilege and that they don't have to give them to us, customers are extremely rude just as the employees are. definitely don't recommend working here. no room for advancement and no benefits or proper training. made 11.50 an hour and with taxes working full time isn't worth what you put up with here from inside and out."
bad,Horrible manangement!   It is all in there heads. They dont train you very well and when they have you do something the demand it in a way that is unproffesional.
bad,"Walgreen's could care less about their employees despite their lip service.  Benefits are constantly cut. Productivity rates are raised to impossible number to ""weed out older employees , staffing levels are cut and goals/programs are ever shifting. Draconian."
bad,not a fun place to work nothing to learn. I wouldn't refer somebody to work there. Not good raises at all. Act like they are a good company but nooooooo.
bad,"It was horrible working here. It started off great. I felt that corporate really cared about me as an employee but as the years went on, it got worse. I finally was able to get put after 20 years."
bad,"always ask a lot and pay is bad, only minimal pay but they demand us to do pharmacy tech duties. We always get robed one every 3 months at gum point and management don't  do anything for our safety."
bad,"They dont care about their employees, they work you like a slave and 5ake away your off days just to fit their needs. You cant have a life outside of Walgreens. They under pay you, for all the work they make you do you should be making at least 16 they pay rate is only 11.74 although it's a little to better then minimum wage they treat you like they paying you minimum wage."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was being bullied and retaliated on when I received my promotion to Senior Certified Pharmacy Technician. That's when my job at Walgreen's started to spiral and I knew that it wasn't a fit place for me to be. "
bad,"worst job I've ever had. There is no training administered. Management does not give detailed instruction as to the job duties expected. The pay is terrible, especially in relation to the workload expected."
bad,Watch your back & trust no one!! People you thought were your friends they were not!!! Be careful what you say around others could comeback in your face!!!!
bad,"Maybe it was just my experience with Walgreens, but it was horrible. I understand and know what to expect with a customer service job, but Walgreens in particular was especially pitiful."
bad,"Monitored candidates answers to check knowledge of make up. If they knew enough, I would pass them along to the next phase and they would be presented to the hiring manager"
bad,"I was sexually assaulted, sexually harassed and harassed at this store. When I approached the store manager about it she blamed me and called me a liar. Terrible store. full of favoritism and unethical behavior . Full of managers that can't stay composed and calm. Very hot tempers and rude mannerisms. will shove down rules that are against policies and then they will fire you for it. Do not work here."
bad,"workplace culture, typical work day, some days are harder than others. different pharmacist make job more stable and manageable"
bad,Extreme turnover and inconsideratell management. Snakes in the grass. Everyone is in your business management does not keep employees business confidential
bad,"hard workers, very motivated , willing to work as a team, promote sales daily, learned patients , enjoyed the communication with the customers, enjoyed helping and learning"
bad,No sense of organization. Horrible staffer and very rude customers. Would find people doing drugs in bathroom. Expected to clean up after them
bad,"They don't care about their employees anymore. The district managers are breathing down the store managers necks with no concern about the bottom of the totem pole, and the store managers are typically the same way. It's rare to find good management. This company won't care about your personal time or your training at work. Breaks are a joke and lunches are a joke."
bad,Don't work here unless your in high school. Management is terrible they only care about themselves and will not help you and will always threaten your job.
bad,management is bad!!!! co worker don't care about you nor helping you they go and cry to the manager about every little thing they think they help the company but they don't the run away the good people
bad,"The main complaint I have is the short notice of work schedules.  Sometimes you wouldn't know what your schedule was until 2 days before.  Also, the amount of work required for the amount of pay was not equal.  "
bad,"From Management to HR, was the most horrible experience of my life. They do not care about their employees, only about themselves."
bad,There is no corporate culture. Leadership is F**k-all. I would not even wish my enemy get a job here. There is no room for thinking. Employees are treated like slaves. No respect for anyone.
bad,"I would never recommend this company to anyone, their turnover rate is high and they do not appreciate their employees and over work them with underpay."
bad,would not recommend this job to anyone.  Walgreens is greedy.  They treat employees like bad and pretend to care and they really dont
bad,"No real opportunity for advancement, unless you get in  with the right people. Even then it's next to impossible to move up in the company. Their health insurance is a joke as well."
bad,"Easy work, okay customers, bad management. They do not care about family. They won't accommodate schedules. Some advancement is possible."
bad,"began as a wonderful place "
bad,This is a horrible company to work for. Walgreens is not employee friendly nor are they customer friendly. Management is short sighted and obsessed with profits over customer service and especially over their employee's wellbeing and to make matters worse Walgreens treats their employees with disdain and as if their employees are expendable commodities.
bad,"Hated working here. They were always messing with my hours. Management is very unprofessional. I've been gone for quite a while (3 months) and I'm told by another walagreens employee (from a totally different location) that the employees there speak of me in a really bad manner in front of customers. The people I'd work with would always curse in front of customers and argue with one another. The benefits were horrible. No days off on the holidays. Walgreens should really fix that. Holidays are family time, only mangers get those days off."
bad,"When I first started at Walgreens, I had hope of one day advancing within the company. I kept that hope up until the new corportate take over, when I slowly started noticing changes. It went from being a company that helps promote and provide the staff with benefits and plenty of opportunities, to making it a competition amongst each other, and focusing on favoritism."
bad,"I wish that I could give a lower score for the number of stars. One star is more than they are worth. I am not going to say that they are all bad as I got paid real money. BUT they were very stingy with the wages for the amount of work that they want you to complete you would think that they would give you more time. I know that I would not want anyone who I know on a personal level to work there. Wishing you all the best though. But I am on to bigger and better things. "
bad,"district was mean to the store manger, it was so bad we had to call HR so many times, still they didn't do nothing about it  to a point the store left"
bad,"the pay is just above minimum wage and you have to keep busy which would be okay if there was a list of ligament work not just dusting where you have already dusted."
bad,"only care about the bottem line"
bad,I already experience stocker in walgreens and really learn alots stuffs. I really interesting what look like work future and future in my life. Its was great in work exoerience.
bad,"If you like to work really really hard and be under appreciated than this job is for you, Management only cares abut looking good for corporate that they cut corners and over work employees. They treat rookies like kings by not having any consequences for not completing work list and for excessive absence. New hires also seem to have a much easier time getting promoted apparently  all you need to do is breath and blink at the same time and BAM you get promoted. The people who actually do care about the future you even of the company and who have dedicated years to the company get taken advantage of the work load gets doubled down on them and when you even mention any desire of moving up you quickly get shut down or ignored. This company really is gong down hill fast way too much work for not enough pay"
bad,Unless you are willing to work until you are exhausted then consider a different retail setting. Managment helps during flu season to alleviate the workflow but the customers are the worst people ever.
bad,"was harassed and humiliated by managers. I enjoyed the customers because most of them were regulars, they treated me with the utmost respect. My co-workers were great, but the store manager and assistant managers were rude and hated their job."
bad,The management is horrible definitely needs more staff due to busy area  and being next to a school and freeway and the pharmacy needs help due to lack of staff
bad,"productive and fun work place with excellent people. it was so busy, however, managed the stress by helping each other with our team members. every day, learn new experiences"
bad,bad employer.  did not like the job. horrible benefits.  terrible management.  would not recommend to anyone who is looking for a long time career.  no opportunity for advancement.
bad,"SFLs don't get paid enough to do what they do. I often had to do my store manager's job as well as my own. I didn't get along well with the management team there. My team was amazing though, and I do miss them."
bad,"Management is completely disorganized, compensation is far too little for the amount of work and pace they demand. Unprofessional setting, total chaos at times. Need better management."
bad,worked in the pharmacy; horrible place to work. constantly cutting hours.my uncle died and they wouldn't stop calling me while i was at the funeral to see when i would be in. techs and rph are in and out of that place. just horrible
bad,"I work at Walgreens in Deerfield, I was very excited to get the job. Once I got here I was faced with the most racist environment ever, then there was supposed to be this great worklife balance that was nonexistent. You work literally sun up to sun down. The VP Jeff, stated he did not believe in work from home however, he praised his wife saying he could not do what he does if it wasn't for his spouse. We thought she was a stay home mom, we quickly found out she worked for Walgreens. The best part is that whole work from home he didn't believe in. Well guess what his wife worked from home. If you are non-white, trust me steer clear of this company and this executive."
bad,you can't help a customer without getting pulled away to go do something else that you are not required to do. you can't do anything right even when you do the exact thing they tell you to do
bad,"This company is going downhill for employees, Every year there are more rules that are enforced and retail level employees are treated like trash. If you are upper management expect your pay to be slashed, given a different job title, and expected to do more duties for less money. This has happened twice in the last 4 years."
bad,"Over worked, not a fun company to work for. This company is always looking for ways to fire people. They do not pay their ASMs. Their ASM WORK about 60 hours a week."
bad,"Don't waste your time with this company.. they will step all over you while saying they want to help you. "
bad,This company Isn't avoid company to work for. The reason I say that Is because they're t employees to come in for 8 Hours a week. They don't care about their employees . Their have been employees I'll & they didn't care  literally made them work. Their was employee that had diabetes issue when I was employed here & she never got her breaks regularly or her lunches. This was very Important with her medical Issue. She passed out at work one day due to the incident. So If you're asking me Of I would accept employment with this company again my answer would be no. Thank You
bad,Company says they care about their employees but really they want to work you like you are a nobody and not help you move up within the company.  A lot of back stabbing and fake managers.
bad,"Store managers are fake and only care about the bonuses that get at the end of the year. The staff gets replaced every 3-6 months,customers are disrespectful, 0 security (you are the security),sales goals are impossible and 90% of the entire staff has a ""I'm ready to go home"" attitude as soon as they come in the door and what do they get in return? 15% discount ....."
bad,"Help at home is a very interesting place to work for because you meet a lot of very interesting clients that will make you care about them so much, that your hourly salary does not matter. The clients become like family."
bad,Not enough labor hours to complete day to day operations. Results in longer lines and upset customers.  Management has little power to try and change problematic situations. Company morale is at an all time low. Forced pay cuts.  Little room for advancement.
bad,they do no care about their employees. management really treated us like nothing. i had come awesome co workers. GM only called you out for bad things and never did he ever appreciate the good on his employees.
bad,This is a great first job for a high school student. It was fun but I wouldn't want to work there any longer . The work day wasn't long but the company did not offer full time .
bad,"In the past few years, Walgreens has shifted from an employer that cares about their employees to a money hungry monster.  I used to be extremely loyal, now I can't wait to leave.  Hiding behind the mask of Extroadinary Customer Care, getting performance based raises is near impossible for lower level employees due to the strict competencies put in place.  Lower store level supervisors are over-worked and under paid.  As an assistant store manager, I am responsible for our entire front end, including sales, budget, hiring, training, etc. and yet I get paid less than my pharmacy technicians.  When minimum raise increased to $10 hourly in California, brand new employees were getting paid the same amount that older employees who had been with the company for a few years were getting, in a word, unfair.  Walgreens has tons of money to buy Rite Aid but insists on saving money by cutting benefits and payroll across the company.  I would no longer recommend this company as a suitable place to work for anyone."
bad,"I would not work for this company again, simply because the management was full of inconsiderate people. The managers were not only inconsiderate to elder customers, along with inconsiderate to the employees. Unfortunately i don't feel as though they were a good team"
bad,manager rude and prejudice and closed minded.  Made you work off the clock to keep your job.  Changed your Hours from work you work so you did not get paid over time.  Stole hours from you.
bad,I wouldn't offer this job to my worst enemy . clueless on the job can't figure out whats going on . Terrible Management with bad attitudes.
bad,The pay was bad and the work was ridiculous. they were not understanding and they do not care for their employees
bad,"I worked for walgreens for more than 18 years as a pharmacy technician.Tthere were many changes, most of them not good ideas.The company is very focused on profit at the expense of employee well-being. The co-workers I had were fine people. All but one of the store managers I worked with was fair and decent. Pay is not good and raises are very small.The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the decreased hours every summer. Apparently they think you should stop eating for 3 months.Also, upper management asks for your opinion, but they don't want to hear it.The most enjoyable part was meeting and getting to know the customers.I was at the same store all those 18 years. I was fired over something trivial because the manager wanted someone hired who was younger and cheaper. Work there if you must, but don't plan staying for very long."
bad,I was miserable working there and the pay is awful you don't get raises and they don't care if the work is affecting school life.
bad,The most enjoyable part o the job is making a positive difference helping patients and co-works. Management is good and so are co-workers.
bad,"would never work for this company again poor management they talk bad about every employee behind their back even about certain managers they don't like, you cant approach them about any problems you are having."
bad,No advancement - found that the managers are not good with workers or customers.  Work was done at night and without security
bad,"This company is always short staffed, and the company does not mind working one person as hard as two but paying less experienced workers work for the same price and minimum effort. The staff is amazing and the managers are wonderful, but the company will drain you for everything you've got then replace you with a fresh face."
bad,"im doing this review because im forced to by this website just to post a resume. walgreen sucks, big corporation that puts money in front of employees like other corporations."
bad,Breaks and lunches were given on time. I ran the register and stocked merchandise onto the store shelves. I worked as part of a team and the work was done in a timely manner.
bad,Walgreens suck... This is the worst company I ever worked for... Was there for 6 years.. you are way over worked and way under paid.... I wouldn't make this place as a career choice...
bad,"The walgreens I worked at was a horrible environment. They staff was unorganized, and unappreciative. They did not accommodate to anyones needs and left out members."
bad,"I ve worked for walgreens for about 7 years leaving there now for something better. If you think all your gonna be doing is selling make up think again you'll be doing other peoples jobs and positions depending on who called in or if the store has high turnover. pay is bad and management are just overpaid shelve stockers who just like to start drama which is all walgreens stores are DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA. If your new there have fun working all of the holidays for the next year, No opportunities for advancement unless you can kiss a*$ really well, I'd rather go dig ditches then ever go back and work at a walgreens. You don't get 40 hrs more like 36 so they don't have to pay you unemployment,which doesn't matter cause they'll fight it anyway there slowly adopting the Walmart business mentality I'd literally pay you not to work there it's so bad."
bad,I was a cashier and customer service personal. The job was unproductive because I was not able to grow within the business. I did not enjoy working there and I am grateful for the experience.
bad,"Doing the photo center was pretty awesome, to be honest."
bad,"Not so happy how the employees are treated by the Management. If you wanted to be treated fairly, this isn't the location to work. Your over worked and under paid."
bad,"By far the worse place to work for. There is alot of favoritism especially within the HR dept, office bullying and segregation. Poor work life balance, poor working environment, lack of professionalism from the HR staff to the director of the call center and even managers. You might want to double think before applying for this position."
bad,"Walgreens is an unfriendly work environment, and makes a normal work day miserable. The company does not care about its employees and does not treat them the way they should be treated."
bad,"Do not recommend. Lots of growing pains."
bad,"The company has changed too much. Too much work, low pay and no job security. The company used to be great to work for, but that hasn't been the case for the past 8 years."
bad,I have nothing to say...My mother always told me that if you have nothing nice to say...don't say anything at all. Happy to have moved on.
bad,"They want you to be able to take 50 calls a day while you are trying to do insurance verifications to explain why meds take two months to get to them. You cannot say ""got a new system that does not work and many have people left due to moving to a place that has horrible traffic and no public transportation and do jobs you were not hired for or trained for!. Seniors and supervisors yak and are on cell phones all the time and they look at you like you are an idiot if you have a question and they don't do not want to be ""interrupted"""
bad,You are just a number to the upper echelon of management outside of the stores.  They don't care about you at all no matter how hard or smart you work.  Work you to near death then ask for more.
bad,"Terrible management, zero support, I constantly felt taken advantage of as an employee.  Evil corporation.  Lots of criticism, no recognition.  Miserable place.  Days off were inundated by texts from my store manager about what was wrong, what needs to be improved, etc."
bad,"worst company ever.. to work for upper managemnt is such a joke . "
bad,Part Time job to just earn some money while going to school. Really nothing that needs to be said other than that I suppose.
bad,"I want to work in a pharmacy where I may develop relationships with my patients. I want to be able to devote time to helping my patients with insurance issues, understanding insurances, understanding medication and medication reactions and have an over all loyal and devoted customer relationship. At Walgreen's this is not attainable. I take pride in my job and I work very fast and very efficiently, because I am such a hard worker and take such pride in my job Walgreen's expects more from me. They expect me to do the job of 5 technicians for the same pay. They do not care about their customer's overall well being no matter how much they promote it. At the pharmacy I work at currently we are understaffed and over worked. We have new hires that are not given the proper training therefore we have high turn over rates and we are constantly having to hire new employees because it is such a harsh environment to work in. I love a fast pace work field, I have to be busy all the time but what I'm expected to do at my Walgreen's pharmacy as a technician is stressful and completely unethical. (not all Walgreen's pharmacies are this way, however the multiple ones I have worked at do operate this way.)"
bad,"You are basically an overpaid stocker. Being called management is laughable. My store manager would throw tantrums like a child. she even kicked the door in to the register. Ha Ha. Best thing I ever did was find another position. "
bad,"this was the worst place to ever work for. no time for children if you have any because they literally consume your entire life. they will not help you when you need to be off,."
bad,"Greedy, unfair, paid very poorly, worked you as hard as possible, and broke laws regularly. Management was unfair when they actually would show up and they gave no raises whatsoever. Most the employees I worked with never stopped complaining about this company. They changed there polices to make things harder on its employees and its customers almost every other week."
bad,"After 10 years of being a perfect employee, moving up in company I was terminated. This was done with a lot of effort through my store manager, Pharmacy Manager. They got together and wrote a lot off things that were not true about me! HR is a joke! This company is not the same as when I started 10 years ago. DO NOT  WASTE YOUR TIME IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD COMPANY !! They will not give you breaks or lunches unless you beg for one. Walgreens is "
bad,An okay entry level company but not for the long term. Can move forward in the company but benefits are not really great. It is a great first job or summer job.
bad,an great learning experience for me and my life helped teach me alot of responsibilites when i was so young and showed me good valuable lessons i can take with me for the rest of my lufe
bad,Lacks job promotions if you are not one of the chosen people. Employee moral is very low. They do not invest in their employees.
bad,"it was a summer job at which i pretty much just followed people around. I cant say it was here nor there because it was my first job. i enjoyed it , it was something new and fresh to me."
bad,if u work here all you really are is a slave for the pharmacy techs to boss around. worst workload to compensation ratio. oppressive corporaion.
bad,They try to be fun but very unprofessional and is just like Walmart. i recommend going to cvs when the open. They do not care about their employees they have nick names for all weird customers
bad,Fun work place with supportive management.not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Learning new martieral things as well.
bad,The pays to little for the amount of work given. its one thing to do whats right for the company but to treat employees bad is another
bad,Walgreens is an awful company that treats its employees like garbage. Our manager especially at the store at 2103 West Burnside is incompetent and cannot properly make a schedule. He also actively works to lower our wages and in once instance refused to pay an employee who got a promotion her new wage. There are better entry level jobs around this job especially the West Burnside store is absolutely not worth it.
bad,It was fun in the beginning but then we go new managers and things had to change and the company started taking away sick time and started pulling positions from people so they could save money and that's all they cared about was money and made you feel like the bottom of their shoes. and you didn't matter to the company.
bad,"Great experience, filled with people that love to serve others and leadership that strives to continuously educate their staff!"
bad,it was the worst experience in my life the manger was so mean and didn't have a heart she didn't care about employees or customes she was all for self and had a lot of personal issues
bad,"I have worked with Walgreens for 2 years to get me through college."
bad,"when i began this job it was for convenience. A typical day here consist of doing truck as a six month pregnant woman, taking short breaks, and working with unappreciative superiors."
bad,"A typical workday consists of doing the same thing and being blamed for things you didn't do. I have learned absolutely nothing working here. The store manager is a hater of ideas and people taking the initiative to start and complete projects. Some of my co-workers are allowed to steal company time by being on the clock taking 15 and 30 minute unauthorized breaks. The hardest part of my job is not being able to do what I was hired for. The most enjoyable part of my job is the wonderful people from around the world stopping by to purchase things giving me complements of my service to them. I actually met a wonderful lady from S. Africa last week and she was so impressed with my mannerism, she returned the next day with a cup of coffee. I was deeply touched. If only my store manager would do simple things like that to employees, we'd have the best place to work."
bad,"i try my hardest at work to give good customer service to individuals who need it my day consist of packaging, unpacking, stocking, and cleaning."
bad,"This company is placing ridiculous amounts of workload and pressure on lower management. over the years I have worked for walgreen's we have had to adjust to store closings, and pay cuts, and duty enhancements. Joke of a company out to simply supply for the shareholders. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
bad,took a long time to do my training before i could even start. i was treated horribly !! i will never work for them again!!!! the one on Beach & Westminster ugh what a waist of my time and effort!
bad,"Great and fun people to work"
bad,Management is severely lacking causing one store to have a complete turn over of employees three times in the span of a year and a half.
bad,"The environment is ok, start based salary is $7.25 l.e minimum wage. No room for advancement except you play your game right with the manager."
bad,"Horrible hours and horrible pay."
bad,"Walgreens was a good company to work for when I first started back in 2004.  Since then it has progressively been getting worse and it is no secret.  I am glad I left and I will never go back, I would rather be homeless."
bad,awful company with awful management. they make up their own rules and it varies from store to store. just don't work here.
bad,"I worked for them for four years and job security was always hanging over my head, despite that. My manager had an article hanging in her office that said, ""Hire Slow Fire Fast"", and went on to explain that workers are easily replaceable and it made myself and so many other people I worked with feel dispensable and under-appreciated. No matter what you did, no matter how hard you tried, no matter how good your work was, it was never enough. You'd be berated for little things and my last store manager Vivian Huang had an attitude problem with everyone- and that included the assistant manager Mr. Gayle. I don't mean she was in a bad mood I mean that she was a nasty, mean b**ch and she made employees and customers feel terrible on a regular basis. She's had complaints sent against her and corporate had to send in other managers to help her organize the store to their qualifications. So not only is she rude and horrible, she's stupid too. I hated that no matter what I did myself and my coworkers were always made to feel that we were going to lose our job, even when we met performance goals. Then there was the fact that they didn't pay well, at all, and there was no air conditioning in a 90 degree store and no heat in the colder months. I stayed because I couldn't find anything else and after awhile I got depressed because I thought I deserved to be there. It was so bad that I wound up in therapy because I was always so depressed, feeling hopeless and repressed in my job, not allowed to grow, not allowed to enjoy my hard earned money, feeling like I had no future. I left on the advice"
bad,"The Senior Management staff is very unprofessional, lack Knowledge, Integrative, Ethical values, do no communicate with the Management team and/or staff and is very unsupportive."
bad,"Horrible company to work for... zero patient care.  Very negative work environment.  Very low pay, bad benefits.  Many medication mistakes."
bad,"management was rude and didn't care about your personal needs "
bad,the worst job and now i see why it is so hard for them to keep employees. dirty location and always slacked on keeping up to date products in their coolers.
bad,The work day went by fast. I learned about the process of filling a prescription  and my co-workers were very nice and helpful during my 50 hour Internship! Great experience.
bad,This company does not care about its employees. The only thing they care about is money. After they bought Happy Harrys the pretended to care for awhile but we found out this was not true.
bad,"Avoid at all costs. It's not worth the time in this company, people are negative beyond comprehension, no one cares about learning, support or doing the right thing, Everyone I met at store level had nothing positive ti say."
bad,The best part of my day is helping customers find what they need. They worked with my school schedule while I was in college. I learned that it is who you  work with not the type of work you do that makes the work place a fun place to be.
bad,The company within itself does not value any of their employees. For all the work we do as employees we don't I repeat we don't get paid enough. hours are always getting cut. only reason why I am still part of this company is because I need the money to care of myself and pay bills
bad,"They have no loyalty to their employees who have been with the company for many years. They would rather phase out the old and bring in the new for a lot less pay. Too many changes happening at a corporate level, that also affects employees at store level, for the most part everyone (from their CEO'S to Pharmacists and Store Managers) either retired or jumped ship."
bad,"Variable hours, busy locations. Management isn't as involved as pharmacists, technicians are. Everyday is hard work but with the right team, the job gets done."
bad,"they have you work 12 hour shifts, and lift more than you are capable of , their job description does not match their job duties, even knowing i have a back issue they forced me to do truck lifting well over 50 pounds and when I couldn't walk and pulled muscles they still made me continue nightly to continue doing truck and stock. The store has no security for third shift and my life was threatened by a young teen who wanted to purchase cigarettes but had no ID to prove he was old enough. When management talked to me they blamed me for getting my life threatened even though I could have been fined, arrested, and fired if I had not refused the sale."
bad,"*Typical Day- Assist patients over the phones as a RPhT"
bad,"Management is poor, especially on developing new associates, high turnover.  Need of a better training program needs to be input.  All Management should be on a 5 day work week."
bad,Management communication skills are horrible.  Some people who are shift leads should not be. The employees are great. The pay is not worth working for. Walgreens does not care about their employees they on care about the money. If you are a college student I would not recommend you work here. If you are a citizen of the USA I would  recommend you to not work here. It's a waste of time. The pay and hours will not allow to survive the real world. But if you happen to work here make sure you have a plan B. Because Walgreens is closing some of their stores not caring about the people that worked for them.
bad,"I was there for 2 years and in those two years I thought about quitting every month.The management was horrible, customers were even worse. It was just a giant cesspool ."
bad,"I have held a variety of jobs over the years, this by far is the worst experience I have ever had. The hours are unstable, the pay is terrible, the management is horrific. The work environment in this store is the most unprofessional I have ever encountered. The store manager is lazy and vindictive and is interested in nothing other than his own promotion. Hard work is ignored and the laziest employees are the ones promoted. The CEO cares nothing for the customers and even less for the employees. Walgreens will quickly turn any hardworking individual into a mindless piece of a system that is crashing and burning. Overall, this has been a nightmarish experience."
bad,"working at sprouts was not enjoyable for me, I felt the environment was depressing, and the coworkers had a forced feeling about them, as in they forced themselves to be friendly"
bad,"I worked at Walgreens for 6 months and transferred to the WORST location EVER! A Team Leader did not know how to lead, but she knew how to gossip and flirt. I was harassed by not only a very disrespectful co-worker, but the Team Leader as well, and I talked to management SEVERAL times about their OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIORS!The environment was stressful and uncomfortable and they wanted you to do everything, but not pay you for the various hats worn. They hired ALOT of people under the age of 21 and their friends, that couldn't even sale liquor! Also, it was ALOT of company policies not followed by various co-workers, like no call no shows, personal calls by various women a co-worker was involved with, a Team Leader disappearing multiple times during the day."
bad,Too much favoritism with employee and don't expect to get t time off when you have an emergency. You get write up for the littlest thing especially fired. Management leaves work for 2 hours to get their hair done
bad,"I really enjoyed my time with Walgreens and the ability to learn something new and now atleast I am registered Pharmacy Tech, but due to the recent changes with Walgreens was unable to keep my position with them"
bad,"Terrible, dont work there. My experince there was miserable. New management is terrbile. Office coordinator is racist and they should not  be allowed to practice."
bad,"filled patients medications, checked patients in and cashed them out once their prescriptions were completed being filled."
bad,Continuously doing cutbacks which causes stress on current employees because we having to pull our own weight plus the weight of the people they fired or cut hours for.
bad,"1. Walgreens is a very cheap company"
bad,"Horrible work environment working for the greediest of greedy. Work anywhere else.Used to be a great place to work, now that the Walgreens family is no longer involved in the company its all about making money for the share holders and they'll do anything they can to do it."
bad,"you show up, you get paid. people show up sick to not get points, and then make other people sick. management doesn't care anything about you. you are just a seat filler until they find the next group of people needing a job. you're just a number and are not treated like a real person. personal matters, sickness, and even weather are not taken into account for you missing work. extremely stressful. if i could find anything else i would not be there."
bad,Loved it now it's to the point I dislike how everything is going manager doesn't address situations pharmacy looks good but underneath all of it it's a bunch of mess.
bad,THE WORST PLACE TO WORK.  Management does not care about the every day worker.  Was laid off with a severance package where they taxes 40% of everything you got.
bad,typical day was customer service and sales. I didn't enjoy the way the management and corp treated their long term employees.
bad,"This is the worst job I have ever had.  If you value your personal time and have any sort of life, DO NOT APPLY!  It is a nightmare being a pharmacist here.  Management is horrible and arrogant, will call you at all hours although you are not on call, no compensation for any overtime or being bothered by manager unless you are having to cover another facility that has been raided by the FDA.  They will tell you they will give you ""comp time"", yet in almost three months, I only got out on time once and never received ""comp time"".  Also, you are written off for calling in sick?  Really?  Most normal people don't know if they are going to be sick on a certain day.  Office manager is a very butch woman and if you do not meet her ""demands"", you are a subject of racial slurs and physically threatened.  In addition, pharmacy manager is an arrogant, horrible, little-man suffering, person who feels he can eavesdrop on all of your conversations, treat you like your an idiot, force you to do other peoples work, etc...You will do so many hours of overtime and WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED."
bad,"The typical day is full of confusion, and not understanding what needed to be done."
bad,Poor management in every department. NO standards are in place and employees do what they want. Hourly associates runs over the management team.
bad,Did my job and went home. Helped people when they were sick then i went on my lovely way back to my home. Good days and some bad days for me
bad,"As a shift lead, you are a glorified cashier that stocks everything and you do nothing that deals with any leadership at all.  You spend about 80% of your time running back and forth from the front to the pharmacy to answer calls that could be handled by the pharmacist or cashiers that had any common sense.  Some of the employees are great while most you have to watch for because they will backstab you as soon as talk to you.  Management plays favorites and pits people against each other, especially when they know you want to move up in the company.  When your shift is short handed, they say, ""oh well, deal with it"".  I spent the entire month of December (busiest time of the year) down two people while the manager's shift had 2 extra people on it."
bad,"In the course of my work at Walgreens, the staff was required to do a search after a bomb threat for ""mysterious items,"" the store was robbed multiple times and the management told the staff nothing (not even using it as a training opportunity), the shift leads are not allowed to clock out for lunches, management is aloof, harassment was repeatedly ignored, you may be expected to work until 10:30 at night and be reporting back in at as early as 6:00 the next morning (I'm not sure how scheduling works in the 24 hour stores....), and if you attempt to contact HR they will call you at the store when you are on the sales floor and ask for you by name. "
bad,"i waited two months for an ecommerce job with Walgreens.  They kept confirming availability, then a week before they confirmed schedules, and then a few days after that right before the start date they fired everybody in that class. Absolutely disgusting Walgreens!"
bad,not really a good company to work for. it is unfair that you have to work all holidays including christmas. no good benifits. pay is horrible
bad,"When I first started working for Walgreens back in 2006, I LOVED it! In the past 3 or 4 years, the tide has changed. They went through a restructuring of management, basically changed job titles around so they could employees pay. They company encouraged us to work as a team, but it was hard to being that they kept expecting us to do more and more with less and less, causing work morale to lower. "
bad,Worst job ever! Management and co-workers were always mad. There was never enough help. The customers never had their prescriptions out on time. They were treated poorly. I was treated poorly.
bad,"Walgreens is a horrible company that loves cutting pay. As a assistant manager I was started at 11.00 dollars a hour, a few years ago assistant managers started at 16.00 a hour and had no pay cap. The uppers in this company do not care about it's employees."
bad,WIRS was not a good employer to work for. The billing department was centralized and all of us biller lost our jobs.
bad,"no benefits, can be easily replaced or fired. no stable check or base salary."
bad,hardest part of job is you are expected to do alot while getting paid very little and never a holiday off.
bad,The overall job position is rewarding being able to provide patient's their medications when needed.
bad,All I really have to say is who you work for makes a huge impact on how you work. If you work with an uptight woman who treats her employees like dung then you will not get the best work from a worker or you will see those hard workers quit and leave for better experiences
bad,"The leadership will lie to get you to work for them. You will have to provide your own tools and will only pay 18.90/ hr starting out and takes 3 years to top out. Insurance is horrible. They will make you take a test over things you will not be performing. You will mainly be doing preventative maintenance on conveyors or fork trucks. If you want a job the requires a thought process this is not it. Also leaders in the maintenance department sit at a computer all shift and falsify company documents to make it look like they do something they will also try their hardest to find a reason to fire you because they are scared little boys in real life so the little power they have at work they exploit so be prepared for that. I still work there but am looking at other opportunities and a lot have quit already that's why there is openings. Good luck, but my advice is look elsewhere if at all possible. Also they only give 4% into your 401k almost everywhere else gives 6%."
bad,"They are undoubtfully the worst people to work for.  The owner, is very self centered and greedy.  They will stab you in the back.  They want you to work off the clock.  The pay is not worth the problems, back stabbing."
bad,"I really enjoyed working at Walgreens Pharmacy! The most enjoyable part of my job was acquiring knowledge about pharmacy practice. Walgreens played an intricate role with me becoming a certified pharmacy technician. Also Walgreens provides the necessary educational resources that a technician needs to excel in their field of providing customers with excellent customer service. However, because of poor management, working with a group of people that were not honest, and lacked integrity I experienced a biased attack on my career and dream of becoming a pharmacist. The hardest part of my job was having to endure working with people that put their personal feelings about me before the integrity of my job performance. Even though I knew that I wasn't favored by my co-workers and managers I still did my job with a smile. I put my heart into my work and treated everyone like they were the most important person on the face of the earth whether fellow employee or customer. Walgreens is a great pharmacy to thrive and climb the corporate ladder, but sometimes when a new management team comes in and you don't fit the mold its better to respectfully resign and find work elsewhere. The most important lesson I learned through this unfair experience is regardless of what never give up on your dreams. I count my work experience at Walgreens all joy because it was an important but harsh lesson learned."
bad,"Walgreens does not support a healthy work/ life balance. They do not support efforts for employees who choose to continue their education. The company does not have a fair promotion/merit  system. I have worked for stores in TX and FL. Walgreen's in Florida managment culture was by far the worst. Upper level management does not value employees, they openly discriminate based upon race and disability. The corporate culture is extremely corrupt. The DEA shut down several stores for improper filling of controlled substances, and Walgreens had to pay 80 million dollar settlement and had their DEA license revoked for supporting ""pill mills"" in 2013. Deplorable work environment, I was relieved when they did not have a store for me to transfer to when we moved to VA or I would probably still be in that miserable situation."
bad,I work in a pharmacy it has its days but over all we are understaffed and don't get paid what we deserve. Us as a family in the pharmacy get threw it day by day. yes its a struggle but if we had more help it would be smooth
bad,"A day at Walgreens Infusion is a day in the underworld."
bad,"this is the worst job i've ever had. store manager was a jerk, pharmacy manager was a jerk, a few of the techs in the rx were rude and not helpful when i was trying to learn. breaks short. a very high volume store/pharmacy with not enough staff/fte to support volumes. very stressful"
bad,"I watched this production facility grow from 1 shift to 3 shifts and then it slowly shrunk to only 1 shift.  Management said they had the wrong business model.  Production staff was reduced from 150 to 90 employees."
bad,Depending on the store manager your hours were never consistant. Schedule changed week by week and you never knew when you were going to work until a few days before.
bad,"Pressure cooker, unfair treatment. Stressful and over worked."
bad,Again. Its ok but i don't know if i would recommend working here unless you don't like your life
bad,They are all about big bonuses for themselves. That's all I can say.
bad,"The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.  In store leadership seems dissatisfied.  All in store supervisors are on a ""different page""."
bad,"Always understaffed and overworked. Very little training. Employees have habit of being late or not showing up at all.  Not a good work environment. One of the managers is very kind and helpful, but that doesn't make up for the other negatives of the store unfortunately."
bad,"This is the worst Job i had in the past 10 years, Manegement Makes it this way though! they will tell you if you dont like it Leave. No Empathy for customers at all."
bad,i was in my teen's years when i was working here so it was just a part time job for me
bad,Walgreen's is an OK place to work if you enjoy working someplace where Corporate cares little to none about you and makes decisions based on how much money it will make them.
bad,you make 11 dollars and hour to do a managers job while the rx techs make the same if not more starting.
bad,"Company promotes who they want to promote no matter how hard you work. They keep cutting hours but add more to my work load.  Then they complain when nothing gets done. They keep forcing us to increase sales but we really don't get any benefits of it. Very ungrateful.  I put my life at risk driving to work in horrible snow storms this past winter and there was always some complaint from store and no thank yous from store or district manager.  Store manager is a bully.  The company is horrible.  Two drastic pay cuts in the past 5 years. The health insurance keeps getting worse every year.  no bonus for me. Everyday I go to work, there is a new reason I need to find another job."
bad,"I didn't like working here. The technicians and pharmacists were rude. Every time I'd ask a question, I felt as though I was bothering someone. And the hours were terrible!"
bad,"learned that you have to do your work and when paired with others, might as well as go beyond your assignment because they do not measure up."
bad,"no room for job growth, not friendly and very bad management."
bad,Working for this company almost makes you wish you were unemployed. Its horrible
bad,"typical day of work was , you worked hard got pulled in every direction and told it was not good enough, I learned alot from my customers, management was no help by the store manger and the asm direction, the co workers are nice to your face but will throw you under the bus if there put on the spot, raises were small, insurance cost to much if you get a good management team you will be happy with walgreens"
bad,Lack of communication from management; managers talked down to employees.
bad,you will most likely work with adult children at every location iv been to. bad management on all levels
bad,Although I learned a lot in my 14 years here. I would not suggest working here.
bad,Open evenings weekends and holidays. Retail environment. Ability to move up after time.
bad,"The company is changing a lot. If you want to work in a fast past environment, you'll enjoy this company"
bad,This company tries to promote wellness for customers and patients but neglect to observe the needs and care needed for their employees.
bad,"I enjoyed the customers as well as the staff.  I was trained to operate the Baker cell, barcoding, input of customer information and prescriptions, inventory and stock, and also HIPPA laws."
bad,"Lots of illegal practices taking place, for such a large company.  They would not give me any breaks, and wouldn't pay me for overtime (by ""adjusting"" your punches).  Illegal preferential hiring practices in San Francisco, I'm not sure if it's like that everywhere.  Very hard work for little pay, and no appreciation.  They moved me to 5 different stores within a year, and I was treated extremely poorly by many of the managers, even though I was management myself."
bad,This company had several staff members on the management team that had no sympathy for the staff especially when emergencies or family crises occured.
bad,this company has terrible benefits and terrible pay. no chance of advancement and are ignored regularly. the atmosphere is depressing and boring.
bad,worked there 7 yrs. Last 5 yrs was not good. Stopped building stores and no opportuniteis. Worked long hours and no bonus.
bad,Management was horrible. Each manager had their favorites. those would be the ones to get the most hours.
bad,Depressing job. Management is really disapointing. My co-worker were lazy.
bad,"Poor Management with  lack of knowledge. Constant Changing environment lacking direction. Team Leads or Supervisors are ridiculously informal without knowledge and proper certifications to treat pharmacists ( non pharmacists supervisors leading pharmacists). Site Director is out of touch as well as managers. Expect to work mandatory over time without notice in peak seasons. Expect to be performance managed out the door if your supervisor or manager doesn't like you. Your opinion does not count, Strict policies and codes. Gossip in the production floor that makes your days longer and un comfort. Lack of professionalism all across the board starting with site director following by managers and team leads. Not an HR generalist suitable for the position, do not expect to be heard."
bad,"This was my first retail job, long hours, attention to work life balance is needed"
bad,"managers dont care, they worry about there owns jobs first, not any room for growth they worry about them selfves since they make salary and as soon as there shift is over they go home"
bad,Don't waste your time working for this company. It's going downhill.
bad,A typical day there is like you trying to help and do the right thing by the guest that come in your manager is tells you that they are tired and not to waste time with helping people. What I leaned is that you have to work hard to get hours but when you hard their not going to give you hours.
bad,"-There is too much drama"
bad,Terrible do not work for them period. I really dont have anything other then that to say. Its a waste of time look at your other options.
bad,"-Poor management"
bad,did literally everyones work. there'd be 4 assistant managers on the floor and 3 stockers while 3 of those assistant managers talked in the backroom and if they wasn't talking in the backroom youd have 4 of them telling you what to do while u were doing something for the other manager.
bad,"very descriminating company, high volume pharmacy horrible scheduling, when you tell management about issues going on they always say they will handle it and nothing ever gets resolved so problems continue to spiral out of control thus affecting the costumers."
bad,I really hated this job only because it was a very boring place and the work was very easy but they did give me the opportunity to handle cash and taught me to interact with all people
bad,"I worked for Walgreens since 2004 up until May of 2013. I started in Pico Rivera, Ca and loved it. Then moved around to central California, came back and worked in Glendora, Ca. I became a senior pharmacy technician prior to my injury. I was injured outside of work and left the company for two years and came back at the end of 2012. I was hired back at my first store in Pico Rivera, Ca with awful management. I new the system and hardly needed any training and I was back to my normal self and I knew the job well. My pharmacy manager was terrible. I was on time everyday. I was absolutely reliable, and I had excellent customer service. I was always receiving customer service awards and everything. My terrible boss, would always take my to the back of the pharmacy and tell me about how terrible I was doing. And to top it off, she would do it loud enough so that all of my fellow employees could hear. Additionally, she would tell me how my fellow employees were complaining about me too... The first time I ever heard that. I had an existing back injury and unfortunately could not work. She was always calling me and bugging me about how they needed me. I never came back because I did not want to work for a boss who treated me like trash and did not appreciate my hard work ethic."
bad,"This was one of my first job, it was a clothing store, I gained cashier experience and customer service experience. The parking lot was very dangerous at night"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is my fellow employee. The management is not understanding of any disabilities you may have and use favoritism. All they seem to care about is the numbers at the end of the day.
bad,"Enter patient's information into Data base, maintain and verify physician orders, handled payment method, take and place inbound and outbound calls in a pleasant professional manner, trained new employees, picked and pulled dispense medication and supplies, fax, scan, manage files, sent out all packages to patients."
bad,If I could describe a typical work day in one word it would be anxiety.
bad,"No room for advancement.  Benefits are lacking.  Work nights, weekends, and holidays."
bad,no comment. work here at your own risk. I juist want to finish the resume part of this. I have said enough about this company.
bad,"The morning of the Walgreens job, would include handling money from customers who purchased products from this Walgreen retail store. The use of great customer service skills were used, which I learned how to greet and handle specific concerns of the customers needs. Focusing on my time that was spend with customers and products being computed to the register, allowed me to have good managing of my time with customers and also my time management ."
bad,Walgreens was horrible. Management was dishonest. No Benefits. Overworked and Underpaid. Not worth it.
bad,overworked underpaid never compensated no room for growth
bad,I filled prescriptions and input data in the computer. I learned abt insurance. the management was nice and helpful. the people that worked there was nice. the math was the hardest part of the job. none of it was enjoyable
bad,very short staffed almost all the time and workload is crazy not enough pay!!!!!
bad,"*cashier, pharmacy tech, photo tech..."
bad,"Serving , keeping customers happy and coming back.Unloading trucks with teammates. Keeping aisles clean and presentable to customers."
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with the public and my coworkers. I learned how to operate a P.O.S. register, a digital photo lab, stocking the shelves and serving the customer in a happy way."
bad,Too much corporate change on a day to day basis. Hard to provide good customer with minimum employees and staff.
bad,"fill pt rx's mail order "
bad,"You don't learn any aspect of leadership or management from this company. Its all hard labor, unloading and loading packages from the truck and merchandising the floor. Company use to give you alot of OT but now they have cut hours and assistant managers pay."
bad,This guy was horrible fired 23 managers in 4 years...horrible management.
bad,Promote inexperienced managers that do not provide guidance and growth.  The company does not appreciate employees and people try to throw you under the bus to get promoted.
bad,Everyday was different and it was not fun working on stock day.
bad,I have been at three different stores with Walgreens and Feel the last one I was at was not a very well ran store
bad,good place to work. pays very well. very clean inside. work is very good.
bad,"operating 2 - 3 registers, prescription intake, input, filling, filiing, cleaning, customer service, insurance adjudications, overrides, etc..."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked, no wonder they closed the place down."
bad,"Horrible place to work! Management is bad, customers were ok, but overall the company don't care about employees. Highest turnover."
bad,Worts company I have ever worked for. No hours and alot of BS. Managers are abusive
bad,"Management is sub-par. No room for advancement. Either to little or to many hours. Non-competitive wages. They enforce branded company slogans that you are required to say to ""each and EVERY person or you could be written up and terminated. Customers absolutely hate it, and don't want to repeatedly hear it. However the company does not care how you get treated for getting ""their message"" acrossed. Over the last year Walgreens as a company has gone through a lot of changes and its made the employee moral drop."
bad,"customer service, working with large amounts of beauty products, counting money, stocking shelves."
bad,There is no opportunity to grow for young black men or women. I worked here for five years and wanted to be a manager. They promoted a white guy over me who had less education and experience. If your looking to grow in a company donot work at walgreens!!!!!
bad,"well this company use to be a good company to work for back when they cared about employees now all they care is profit, they cut our benefits gave us insurance that doesn't cover anything, they took our holiday pay if the holiday is part of your 40 hrs you get regular rate. Is bad enough that they make you work every weekend and holiday and now we cant even look forward to holiday pay, they took away the only lil bonus we got at christmas which was a $25 dollar Walgreens gift card. now seniority doesn't count with the new pto program everyone starts with 0 vacation starting in 2014. they eliminated our position and created a new one with same responsibilities but less pay, in my case it was a 5 dollar an hour pay cut. everyday there's a 2 page list that needs to be done thats on top of customer service and calls and assisting pharmacy and day to day operations of the store, they constantly have unreachable goals and deadlines that they want. theres never enough staff to help you carry out your shift. theres days that you go with out breaks. the only thing i enjoyed is the people i work with regardless of how stressful the work was. expect to spend your 8-10 hours standing."
bad,"When I first started working for Walgreens, I enjoyed my work.  I enjoyed helping people, coaching and motivating employees.  I loved my job and the responsibilities.  I do not like the direction the company is headed.  They seem to be cutting corners everywhere. Although there is an ""open door"" policy it is highly discouraged.  Politics is heavy and procedure is out the window when it is convenient.  I have put many hard-working years into this company and it seems they absolutely do not care.  I am tired, broken and nor longer motivated with what I do.  It is a shame, because I actually care about my job and the people who work under me."
bad,Not a very good company I stayed there until school started but couldn't waste time with people with no morals. Employess cars have gotten stolen from there along with my truck getting broken into after a customer on July 4th and managers said stay please we have no help and you should be fine with just a broken window and Ipad missing... Too many sad stories to talk about!!!!!!
bad,"My overall experience was really well, I learned a lot and meet successful humble people. I started working at Crescent right out of school with no experience I was so afraid that I would not do well or fit in , but as time went by and I started gaining my experience and my confidence grew as well . I was assigned to the Medicare team along with a grate supervisor who taught me everything I needed to know  along with the guidance to become a good collector.Everyday  I learned something new about my assigned payer. My daily work day would be downloading EOMBs,inputting notes pertaining to patients accounts, redeterminations, reopening, rebilling 20 percent to secondary ins. submitting adjustments, recoupments , I would have to say the hardest part of my job would be the troublesome past due accounts as it would be more difficult to collect but when reimbursed it was well wroth the effort."
bad,"Selling cigarettes, alcohol, and gimmicky, useless products - primarily to crack heads. Two customers who I could tell didn't even know what they were looking for told me they were trying to buy a particular vitamin in order to cut drugs with it. The place was robbed twice during my time there - I was not present either time. The main focus of the job was, by default, loss prevention, as a strikingly large percentage of customers (especially regulars) frequently stole products of every variety. Pay was minimum wage and despite sharing an apartment with a roommate (who was a delivery driver for Pizza Hut) we often had to borrow money from family just to cover our living costs. The hours were unpredictable and employees often had to work a late shift and come in just a few hours later. I eventually quit because my sleep cycle was in shambles, I was depressed, and highly stressed. Despite voicing these concerns to management they had no sympathy and I decided it was better for my health to take a break and look for a better job."
bad,Never got the chance to move up with company and after thirteen years of my career with company im glad im gone.
bad,started off ok. switched my job code without telling me. went away for military duty and got hrs cut and never got them back. always got my schedule wrong. Didn't show up on a day i was not supposed to be scheduled and got taken off the schedule for it and eventually let go. not a good place to be if your supporting a family. the pay is not adequate to support a family and pay bills.
bad,If you catch people you do the paperwork but some stores mgrs will let them go and some will say give the paper work to the police
bad,"Very hard and time consuming job, very demanding and hard to balance everything out that they want done"
bad,good place to work if you are looking for any entry level job. gave me the experience i needed to start working.
bad,"A typical day at work would include being a cashier and also over seeing the cosmetic department. Doing a lot of running around the store. Cleaning and organizing and putting up stock. "
bad,"managers were power hungry, don't give you the raises youre entitled to and they expect you to put your job before your family"
bad,"Walgreens is a horrible place to work and I would not suggest anyone to work there.  They are very unethical in everything they do and one of their district managers is a liar.  He will tell you everything in your store is fine one day and then tell you he will write you up the next time he comes in.  Also the company says they ""care"" about their people which is another lie.  If they truly cared about their employees they wouldn't be open on Christmas and other major holidays and let their pharmacies close.  "
bad,Not a good place to work. Low pay. Very inexperienced management. Bad overall culture.  
bad,"Walgreens central hub in Orlando (John Young area)."
bad,i hate it point blank period. i hate it i hate it. low pay horrible shifts. no help over worked over paayed
bad,The work I did was loading trucks and also we had to hand stack the trucks from time to time.
bad,"They say they care about their people, but this is a big fat lie. Just when you think you're about to get off work, they pull mandatory overtime on you. Then a few days later they try to get you to go home early so they don't have to pay you overtime.  The people that have been there the longest are mostly lazy and manipulate the newcomers. They have orientation classes so often because they cannot keep anyone. They give 2-20 minute breaks & it starts when they pick the time you need a break & it takes 5 minutes to walk to a break room then you have to fight everyone for microwave/vending machine, then you get 10 minutes actually because it takes another 5 to get back to your slave station. They have fundraising on a weekly basis. Always raising money for some cause, but the problem is how they do it. They expect you to cook for these fundraisers but then almost always it gets tossed in trash. What a waste. I would never recommend anyone even shopping at Walgreen's, especially food items. Warehouse rates are so high that that person filling them totes don't clean them out, & most are nasty. I have smelled urine in a few. This is the worst job I've ever worked at & it's definitely turned me off of shopping at Walgreen's. "
bad,"I operate a register, stock products, and help customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the customers."
bad,I would not work for walgreens ever again. I was not treated  unfairly at this company. There is a lot of favoritism at the store I worked at and the store manager needs to recognize whats going on in his store. I loved my job and for the most I loved working with everyone. I worked very hard and would go over the limit for this company.
bad,"This company thinks you have 10 arms, the workload is tremendous, your expected to be the cashier, photo clerk, cosmetics advisor all at the same time. Management is lazy, constant write ups. HORRIBLE"
bad,"Management is biased. Coworkers are generally good, with a few exceptions."
bad,"This place seems great until you actually start working there. The turnover is so high that it's hard to keep track of who works there. They are constantly understaffed and expect everyone to pick up the slack of those who don't want to work. Goals are near impossible to be met and the phones ring constantly. Lack of training, management not being supportive, and hostile work environment makes this the worst place I've ever worked."
bad,"The location I worked at was in a rough area but I did enjoy getting to know a few regular customers. The management was extremely bad and buddy buddy with a few choice employees . The management does nothing but gossip about eachother as well as lower level staff. I had an incident that I reported to loss prevention and I had to sign a document stating that I would not discuss it, funny thing is, the entire store knew about the reported incident by the very next day. One by one most of my coworkers turned on me which im guessing was thanks to the gossiping management. I held in until I was wrongfully terminated . What they fired me for made me ineligible to receive unemployment..yet I got it my first try as well as went to the EEOC. Walgreens is a decent company they just have some extremely unprofessional management . Poor management seems to be the trend with this company. Don't even get me started on the security company they have a contract with (weed smoking thugs who sleep in the breakroom)..."
bad,Constant changing schedule made it hard to make dr appointments for my child.
bad,really dont have much to say just that this was a part time job
bad,Management was very unprofessional.Very busy pharmacy. Expect alot out of you with no compensation
bad,"Its typical retail. You either have a great boss or a poor boss. Great bosses are not necessarily friendly but they are at least fair and efficient. Poor bosses, like the one I had, are always in a mood and want you to complete a list of duties that cannot possibly be completed in the allotted time. For example, if you work the front cashier when closing, you have to face, or organize, aisles 3 through 7, varies on store, clean the windows, play messages over speaker frequently, gather all the carts outside, organize that entire row of batteries and electronics next to your register, take out the garbage, clean the bathroom, and never leave a customer unattended. Considering there is always at least one customer, all the responsibilities I listed have to completed in the hour after the store closes and before you have to punch out. This does not include the random extra activities such holidays or absent coworkers or displays you have to set up. If you feel that this challenge is for you, then I highly suggest working for Walgreens. If you think I am exaggerating, please work for Walgreens. Either way, good luck."
bad,"Come in and under staffed, have to do what maybe three people would do in another location. Hours are constantly being cut so you never get consistant hours just barely to give you what is considered ""full time"" which is 30 hours not 40 hours. A lot of back biting and low morale, everyone will climb over everyone to get the hours and get someone fired or hours cut. If you have a valid complaint and go to management they don't appear to take it seriously so we are left to ""figure it out"" ourselves which creates a lot of confusion and mistakes. I just go in do my job and leave, I do not talk to co-workers unless it is about a patient and I always leave notes and keep a personal journal about issues to cover my step. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I clock out and go home. Dread going in every day. Employees will gossip and complain about management and district management in front of customers, provide terrible customer service. Employees will argue back with the customers to the point where they will get mad and leave and conduct their business elsewhere."
bad,"Confused management staff, frequent staff call in and no show, very inprompt on posting of weekly schedules, some co-workers slow and lazy, unorganized and not very knowledgeable of store merchadise locations. Hardest part of job trying to get assigned tasks done, without having additional tasks not pertaining to original tasks, heaped on top, then getting berated for not completing original task list. The most enjoyable doing resets and seeing completed results."
bad,Hated everything about this place. The only way to succeed here is to kiss the behinds of upper management.
bad,Management care for product and monetary value more than customers or the employees.
bad,"In one day, I had to work 4 different jobs within the store, pharmacy tech, head photo, cashier, and stocker. Management was very unpersonable, very rude to customers and employees. Co-workers did not care about their jobs or treating the customers with respect. The hardest part of the job was having to fix others mistakes in the pharmacy when peoples lives are at risk there is no room for errors and co-workers did not care."
bad,"dont care about people, managers steal and get away with it and treat other bad"
bad,Will never recomend working for this company...Doesnt care about there employees
bad,"I was a cashier at Walgreens. Did not really learn anything, the management was very unprofessional. most of the co-workers were stealing most the merchandise in the store. There were no hard days at walgreens."
bad,"not enough hours, no job security,i had many obstacles to overcome, and having to work late nights"
bad,"If you like name calling, deer in headlight responses, constant reminders that you are not valued, and no help from your managment team(because they are constantly having to re-attend management skill classes for idiots)than this is an ideal place of employment for you."
bad,This company is hard to work for and I had an extremely bad experience
bad,Bad place to work and shop. Its all top down and if the economy is bad you are just a number. Never had my district manager return any emails
bad,Worked as a customer service clerk as well as bookkeeper. Maintained the financial records for payroll and store performance.
bad,"I mainly do the stores resets and merchandising, the management is not the best, my co-workers are the best! The hardest part of the job is dealing with the people who steal! I love doing all the resets and merchandising, it is my favorite thing to do"
bad,"Management is very poor! And pay is bad too! Only two 20 minute breaks. Hours change all the time, last minute noticed. Supervisors and Manager are Not easy to work with."
bad,I work over night in the hard of the city. My boss did not care when i call him out the office to tell him someone is trying to steel he tells me to handle it .
bad,"There were 3 of in the office, I was the only female, so there were some diffcult situtions to deal with at times. Dealing with the clients on a personal basis was a joy, being able to meet the person that called on a regular basis was a positive for me."
bad,This is a company based on who you know rather than what is right . If you rub elbows and buy lunch for the gm's you will do fine here . But if you are a great employee and your work speaks for itself you can forget it
bad,"Stay unemployed , money stinks, and they think there is something"
bad,"This place sucks to work at. If you aren't buddy-buddy with all of the managers, you will be treated like dirt."
bad,"unloading trucks doing a little photo lab not much, my co worker didnt really get to no them well, management could have been better, this job was not hard at all"
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the day is punching out, knowing you have survived another day. They want you to scrub the shelves as you ring up customers, do it all with a smile because you will be written up if you don't. Co-workers are encouraged to rat each other out to management and there is so much back-stabbing there you might want to wear your armor and still watch your back!"
bad,The Company is not what it used to be the growth withn the Company
bad,"In my believe my daily rutine was just typical,I learned some customer service not much,managment were continuesly changing,co-workers didn't really comunicated with each other,the hardest part was not feeling comfortable,and the most enjoyable part was being able to provide for my family at the time."
bad,They treat you like unfair. No work life balance. You are worked every holiday and given an unreal deadline to progress forward with no opportunity to complete the tasks.
bad,"A typical day of working as a pharmacy tech at Walgreens is like working as a slave! You answer phones, help customers at the front, mop floors/vacuum, take out the trash, wipe counters, count cash drawers at the end of the shift, type prescriptions, fill medications, get attitude from customers and pharmacists, beg to go on breaks( even to the bathroom sometimes). Pharmacists for the most part do not want to do anything out of their job description( verify prescriptions, counsel patients), all the other lower level jobs are for techs. This job is ok for someone going to school and needing a job that has flexible hours. If you are thinking of making this your career, good luck!"
bad,"Working for Walgreens gave me the retail experience with cash, customers constantly. I learned how to deal with the different attitudes with staff, management and customers."
bad,Company is out of control. Upper management is greedy and out for themselves.
bad,"Walgreen's is just not a great company to work for. The higher ups do not seem to have any desire to care for the employees in regards to communication tone, demands and expected standards. I really like the infrastructure, but have loads of disdain for the decision makers. Plus, I'm pretty sure they play the same 15 terrible songs all day everyday over the intercom system."
bad,"I didn't like working for Walgreens because it had very little training by most of the employees, especially since it was my first pharmacy tech position. I was expected to KNOW everything right off the bat and also remember how they operate from just minimal verbal interaction. Most of the co-workers were good, but there was favoritism at the store where I worked, which I didn't care for. It was the worst company I have ever worked for and I had no idea Walgreens treated their employees that poorly."
bad,Greet customers and fill prescriptions. Assists customers in the front of the store in order to find products.
bad,"There is no opportunity for advancement. The pay is not enough for a single person to survive on. The schedule is not flexable enough to get a second job. The training amounts to reading an email, and being expected to know what is to he done. Mgr. has no desire or drive. The benefits are no longer any good. Employees use to get a Christmas bonus but that was taken away. The 401 plan -the company use to put in extra money for every dollar. Now a person has to put in 4% of their pay before the company will put in extra. I have worked at several stores and found it to be clickish and lots of drama . Overall unprofessional, not much training on how to act at work. Most customers are enjoyable. The job is jot turf."
bad,"you are constantly being watched,"
bad,"This company cuts budgets by about half and then expects employees to do twice as much work with half the amount of staff. They will not listen to their employees, and only care about the corporation and the money that the people at the top will make. They promise raises if certain criteria are met, but once they are met, they will add new criteria and raises never actually happen anymore because the company is becoming greedier by the day and only care about the corporate employees who are already making a lot of money. They humiliate you and talk down to you, but if you ask questions or bring up shortcomings of your supervisor/manager, prepare to be ignored or disciplined. Management (in general) does not treat employees as human beings who are working as fast and hard as they can, instead they treat them as slaves who need to be punished and humiliated at all costs. I worked as a pharmacy technician and would not recommend this company to anyone unless they are masochistic."
bad,In my opinion Walgreens does not treat their employees right. We are underpaid and overworked. It's all about money to them and that leaves no room for customer service... I can probably count on one hand how many times I have taken a lunch break and I have been there going on 2 years
bad,under paid managers who are not allowed to have a life. The company was great before all the changes
bad,"I do not recomend this job.From managment to the work atmosphere to the work schedule you will not like,or have time to yourself in life. Schedule is constantly up and down no room to plan a life especially if you have kids."
bad,There are two types of pharmacy technicians. Retail and hospital. Home infusion is the happy medium. You just have to find out which one works better for you.
bad,They have changed everything and are going in the wrong direction as a company. pay is not good any more and they have cut hours everywhere.
bad,"As a former Walgreen's employee, I can honestly say that I have become COMPLETELY disenfranchised with this company. When I started working for Walgreen's, the customer as a valued individual was the focus. However, in the last 3 years, policies and practices are being enforced that emphasize profit over customers and employees."
bad,this company will use you when they have the hours and dump you like garbage when the census is low for any reason they can come up with!
bad,"When I was first hired I was promised at least 30 hours a week plus possible overtime.  The manager who hired me was quickly replaced from her position the new management that came in immediately reduced my working hours to 6 1/2 to 7 hours per week!  I cannot live off of that at all  I requested through the work app as well as the manager for approval to work in other stores however this was never approved   The newly hired pharmacy manager was extremely rude to me, belittled me in front of customers and over all created a hostile work environment  I dedicated to myself to the company and often did not take breaks in order to get the lines down   We are supposed to rotate from filling to running the front  no one wanted to run the front so I was forced to be a glorified cashier every single day  Some staff did help me learn new things which was grateful appreciated  in conclusion I did not feel welcomed there at all  my hours were cut massively without warning and the new pharmacy manager treats new employees unprofessionally and rudely including doing so in front of customers  I have no problem with constructive criticism but talk with me one on one not do not belittle me in front of customers!  We are all human we make mistakes treat people with respect"
bad,This company does not support or appreciate their employees. The systems they used are outdated and stuff in the store is constantly going down breaking or just doesnt work.
bad,"Managers were lazy, totally unorganized and unprofessional. Regular employees would do the managers work because they were do lazy. They were never understand of family and time needed off."
bad,"Stressful and upper management doesn't care except for metrics. They play favorites and the district manager I worked for had a favoritism for male pharmacists - it was really unfair and she made sure the female floater pharmacists she didn't like were never placed in a permanent store, or would make sure to place them in a bad store with inadequate support. Even a male floater pharmacist who made tons of mistakes got a staff position at a nice store (everyone was really confused about this). Really disgusting! Work itself is more stressful for newer people while people who've been at the company for a long time are extremely lazy and don't do much work. Culture is cliquey and immature - everyone is talking behind someone's back."
bad,"It was my first and still my worst job I've ever had. Despite still being in High School at the time, my managers would constantly demand me work more hours or try to call me in when I'm still in classes. Head store manager and some shift leads would make racist, sexist, and LGTBQ+ phobic remarks about customers and coworkers. There even was some unwanted contact between the manager and several other employees, including myself. There was a lot of favoritism between the main retail staff. Taking off of work for being sick was nearly impossible, I'd get accused of lying despite them having a medical record from me. There was usually an option to promote to shift lead, but people were always dropping out of that position. Every day felt like a nightmare, but I met two really enjoyable people out of it at least."
bad,"they cut and cut and cut hours then the CEO gets a huge raise.  and if the CEO every shows up at a store, they have all hands on deck for 2 weeks straight to give the false illusion that the stores actually look like what he sees. terrible place to work, great place to spiral into a depression."
bad,"Beware, if your a manager they will treat you like dirt...all other employees are treated like they are incompetent.Worked for them for 15 yrs, got sick , made a miscall and ended up getting assaulted by a customer. Never talked to me , instead, they fired me. Just beware...they have no dedication to their employees."
bad,"My personal experience at Walgreens was not a good one in the slightest. After my interview and finding out that their starting pay was far higher than most of the other jobs that I applied for, I was relieved and eager to start. However, I soon after realized that the work experience is not at all worth the money. I was not properly trained in the slightest in photo, but I was still assigned to work in the lab with no idea as to how. It was humiliating, especially when customers looked to me, an employee, for help and I could only stand there dumbfounded because I had not been trained. Management is absolutely horrible and only wants to make an actual effort on their own convenient times. The Balance Rewards system is constantly crashing and has so many issues which employees take the heat for from rude customers. Store employees never catch a break. On the other hand, Pharmacy receives most all holidays off, serves no help to the rest of the store, while the rest of the store must come to a complete halt for them. It's absolutely ridiculous and unfair. My managers did not listen to me in the slightest and I constantly got the short end of the stick. I would only recommend a store job for someone that is looking for a job to suck up all of their time and provide walking around money."
bad,"Company cut back a lot of hours and forced employees to work stressful shifts. Volume of work was higher than employees can handle. Mgt would step in to help cover long lines and would be in the pharmacy for hours at a time leaving their front store duties unattended.  One of the most stressful jobs I’ve ever had. Walgreens don’t care about their ppl, they care about the $2 dollars they saved tho."
bad,"Underappreciated, over-worked and under-paid.  Old School thinking and nepotism.  Don't work here.  Region is extremely bad. Company only cares about making money"
bad,I helped people a lot and love. But management considered us beast of burden. Management showed contempt for workers. Poor workers were rewarded and good workers punished. They were too stupid to understand their work policy’s were counter productive for the company.
bad,There is t a lot of room for advancement. They are a who you know company and they aren’t understanding when life hits you to them you are a number and they will replace you
bad,Bad company to work for. Close stores without informing employees early. Give shortest time notice. Less than 3 weeks notice. Walgreens only think about the people at top.don't care about the people at bottom. Lots of discrimination.
bad,"Hated every second of it. Just thought I couldn't find anything better, but jeez I was wrong. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from ever working in such a horrible place"
bad,"I worked as a Beauty Consultant. Not only did they not care, they treated me and my peers as if we didn't know what we were doing, like children! "
bad,This job is great for people without children! Management doesn't work with you if you need to take time off. The work load is ridiculous. Management is difficult to get along with and it's hard to advance to the next level. Just dont look forward to working here long term.
bad,"If you're considering working here, RUN. Run away as far as you can. This goes for any large pharmacy chain. They do not care about the well being of you OR their patients. You are made to treat patients like numbers. No personalized care. Breaks are short if you get them at all. No work life balance. PTO accrual is slow not that you could ever get time off to use it. Absolutely the worst place I have ever worked. On the up side if you mess up or have terrible customer service they wont fire you, they never fire anyone unless they steal or commit some kind of crime."
bad,Terrible unless you are a man and in the “ boys club”. All they care about is pharmacy and pharmacy numbers. Terrible schedule and terrible managers don’t waste your time.
bad,Overwork and underpaid. The experience is terrible by doing hard labor work. It's worst job ever. I'm getting another job with benefits and leave the company.
bad,Walgreens never followed thru training for departments. Was supposed to open door policy but does not. Managers play favoritisms. I think managers need more training to communicate with their employees and follow thru with policies and treat all employees the same
bad,Worst place I have worked. I was hired for photos tech and couldn’t work one day for religious views and family time then when new manager came in he said I wouldn’t get hours if I didn’t work the day I put that I was unavailable to work even though he knew it was for religious reasons and then he said the position I was hired for didn’t exist for two years. Leads also gossip about employees
bad,It was okay. Sometimes there is favoritism but the job isnt too bad itself however it isnt a job someone would think of being stuck in their whole life.
bad,Wouldn’t recommend working there. Hours are inconsistent and sometimes it was hard to even make sure I had enough hours to pay bills. Theft always occurred and there was never security to protect employees
bad,Training nonexistent . Leads no help .unorganized and BEYOND LIES AFTER LIES . This company is fabricated and nobody cares to train you are forced to learn everything on your own
bad,Run as far as you can never look back this place is awful from the employees to the management I wouldn’t recommend this place to any one or anything ever
bad,I worked for Walgreens for 4 years. I enjoyed my time with them and was able to keep up with the high volume of customers. Changed districts then the store began to fall.  I worked my tail off to become a Sr tech when i came back from maternity leave it took only 2 weeks for the people who loved to create drama finally get to me and made several inaccurate complaints against me. I Immediately quit that job it started making me ill trying to watch my own back every single moment when i was just trying to work and complete my daily tasks. new store manager does not know how to run a store. she just likes to feed off of the drama. so many people who have worked there for years are leaving and getting out of the new toxic hostile work place Walgreens has become. sad to see such a loved store for so many years go up in flames due to improper upper level management. If you call HR they are just as bad and do not care at all on what happens.
bad,The work is really easy but managers do not know what they are doing they do not reward new hires that work hard they don't care about there employees its basically the typical warehouse experience your just a number! There are better warehouses to work that being said with way better culture!
bad,"Work environment was horrible, unsafe due to multiple robberies. I was a Customer Service Associate but that means cashier, and mostly cigarette seller. Pay was minimum wage.  Walgreens let cig smokers take breaks every 10 minutes but if you don't smoke I had to wait until my lunch break (4 hours) , I would often work past my shift because the shift manager was off smoking a cig and wasn't around for me to leave."
bad,No time with family. Seems like you give your life to them. You close then will open the next morning. Maybe its my location I am not sure. Also to get promoted its whatever your manager thinks. So if your manager doesn't like you good luck.
bad,Don’t have a family and snitch on your coworkers if you wanna work here. It’s ridiculous how they treat you when they systems tell you to say something then suddenly your in trouble for snitching.
bad,Would not recommend this place was very political and people played favorites. Never enough help and management didn’t support team members at all. This place is terrible.
bad,"Depends who you work for.. This company has great deals for customers. Employees only get 15% off, or walgreen brand 20%... Seniors once a month get 25% lol"
bad,Only work here if you're desperate. In my honest opinion. Some stores are nice and some are a toxic workplace. With all the cuts they make at store level it really feels like they don't care about you at all. Especially because you don't get any benefits at all if you work part time.
bad,"This company s--cks. They don't give a s--t about you or your family. They work you like a dog and threaten  you if you DARE complain. They also discriminate on hiring older pharmacist, especially white males."
bad,"The worst job ever. If like no weekends or holiday off, working until midnight during Christmas, even on Christmas Eve then is this place for you. Manager expected the same work done even with call outs. Run the store with just two people ridiculous.."
bad,Walgreens is way too stressful. The amount of work they ask out of you and the pace is utterly ridiculous! They should be ashamed of themselves. The corporate people that come up with the amount and kind of work that has to be completed throughout the day between customers ought to spend at least a month or two back in the pharmacy working all positions before considering what is doable? Pharmacist and technicians can't even get away to go to the bathroom for God's sake!  The percentage of customers that state we should get more help is VERY high.
bad,"It's like any retail store but I believe the company has lost a lot of its values. You can be hired full time but hours will fluctuate often depending on your performance and managers who make the schedule, holidays play a role too."
bad,"the company is going downhill. I’m not sure what’s happening but they have cut hours for everyone except managers. If you are not a manager they will only give you 15-20 hours a week, and the manager are the only ones who get 30-40 hours. If you need to live, do no work at Walgreens. You’ll be working for pretty much nothing."
bad,"One of the worst jobs that I have ever held in my entire life, I would rather split wood on a 95 degree day then ever work here again."
bad,"Walgreen's culture across the entire company, does not reflect today's society."
bad,"I stayed for 6 months & each month was honestly a headache. I'm sure every store manager isn't crooked so I'm only speaking on the location that I worked at. My store managers would only interact with the staff members that they liked (staff members who hung out in the office all day to gossip, talk about things unrelated to the job & did no real work). If you weren't in their ""work clique"", you went unnoticed every day. No matter how much work you got done, it was never enough. I was also doing other people's jobs on top of my own, because they were allowed to get away with not finishing their workload as long as they were close with the managers. The manager doesn't do too much of anything, just sits in the office all day on her personal phone & doesn't like to be bothered to do actual work or resolve any work-related issues."
bad,They pay ok but don’t treat you very well. Not enough hours. Constantly making budget cuts. Have one person work the jobs of two people. They do not support your family life nor do they care to help you find balance.
bad,I worked for Walgreens for 3 years and well my co workers were great the fact that walgreens doesnt care about their employees is very transparent they are taking away from befits they are constantly cutting hours and still expecting things to get done they offer no on site Security for their trouble areas working their
bad,It is very stressful with constant freezing of computers and overbearing management. Consistently unskilled workers and no training given for harder job positions
bad,Working as a cashier is horrible. You can have multiple customers that can be very difficult. You'll get initial promises of advancements or help but that never happens. There are alot of broken promises. Work loads are not distributed fairly between employees.
bad,this company continues to cut hours while expecting the numbers to be 100%. And if the numbers are not met the managers get scolded and nothing gets solved
bad,"A lot of stress, learned the pharmacy procedures, management for the most part were fine. The culture of the workplace is very stressful, the hardest part was having to deal with was negative people. I loved the customers sometimes they were impossible to deal with, but for the most part customers were great."
bad,"I worked for Walgreens Pharmacy less than 2 months before I voluntarily quit."
bad,"They always spoke about how the employees mattered, but it was all a lie. When we spoke about things that should be changed, they always said it was out of their hands, or it was something that couldn't be fixed. To move on from that situation. They begun to be greedy and cutting back hours."
bad,This company is the number one opioid distributor in the nation.  New District and store manager do not follow corporate stated values the finding leaders and promoting the hiring the prior military personnel in Alaska they have aggressively driven all prior military out of their stores.  The Wasilla store had the lowest turnover rate company-wide until the recent placement have the new district manager and store manager.
bad,Been with company over 20 yrs. Now feel like have target on back. Horrible management I believe only thing needed to qualify is arrogance. Took away good health care. No longer have good 401k. Took away all reasons to stay including vacation you want to take. Switched to pto which basically stole a yrs vacation already earned. They seem to be purposely trying to make bldg fail. 5 yrs ago picking 500k lines and people could still leave early. But then switched to 4 10s and made 2nd into 3rd shift which everyone knows is not a shift you count on since least wanted. And 340k is now 12hrs and try saying that is max for bldg ha. Management is horrible they chased out all that knew what doing. Because they told plans would not work. Basically you are a # complain and will hear if don't like quit. HR manager told HR not here to help people just to make them work. Safety is not cared about it is pushed in slow times but told to ignore when busy.
bad,Not a good place to work they dont care about their employees only about the dollar bill and too much favortism with management they all snakes.that company is bad news to work for
bad,Working at Walgreens literally increased my anxiety and stress levels. I had a panic attack and chest pains which lead to having 911 called. I don't recommend this workplace to anyone. They don't care about the employees at all. They ONLY care about reaching numbers. They hound you about it.
bad,"This used to be a great company to work for, but with a new ceo change they have made it impossible to effectively do your job with budget and payroll cuts."
bad,Culture here has changed from a feeling of family to everyone being a number. Leadership no longer cares about people. Everything is about numbers and people do not matter.
bad,"This company may have lofty goals, but the people running things on the ground are heavily dialed into the numbers. There are rarely enough people working to ensure quality patient care amd compensation for techs is problematic."
bad,This is a company that does not care about their team members. The company is a face less organization that does not provide the resources to be successful.
bad,"Company is sinking fast! Corporate has no ability or interest in organically growing the business. This company DOES NOT care about its customers or its employees. Customers and employees alike are fleeing at alarming rates. Talented managers and associates are leaving the company daily due to constant cuts to employee benefits, pay, and sub humane treatment from corporate managers. The only solution corporate can come up with to offset rapidly declining sales and profits is to buy pharmacy volume by buying out the competition and simultaneously cutting budgets and other costs to meet stockholder expectations.  Unless you are desperate and starving, avoid working for this company. You will receive no support from your superiors, nothing you do will ever be good enough, and your years of hard work and dedication will not be appreciated. You can be hitting 999 out the 1000 metrics that corporate tracks religiously and you will be threatened with write ups and termination daily for the one metric you’re not hitting. This is all while half of your equipment will be broken for months at a time and corporate ignores the issue to cut costs. There have been numerous occasions where broken/inadequate equipment was the reason managers couldn’t hit their metrics, and managers were written up or fired for not hitting their numbers.  Employees and customers alike are just a number working at Walgreens. Stay away from this pathetic excuse of a company that is a shell of what it once was."
bad,"Currently working in Lynchburg, VA area. Managers and district managers do not care about their employees. They care only about meaningless metrics. Every day I work there, I feel my job is on the line. "
bad,This place worked on of the managers to death literally. Pay sucked. The worked us 40 hours a week and kept us part time so they didn't have to give us benefits. And the employees were lazy so I was doing all of the work.
bad,"Company has created brutal sweatshop job for most of its pharmacists - less and less pharm tech help. Discontinued bonuses long ago, discontinued Christmas parties, discontinued CE reimbursement, discontinued overtime pay, discontinued overtime work whatsoever for technicians, has horrible turnover rate for its pharmacy managers, etc..."
bad,"only able to work register or drive through most of the day,no breaks besides lunch,very stressful,only super techs allowed to fill prescriptions,employers don't really care about employees or clients"
bad,A typical day working at Walgreens is stressful. The managers on site that have been there for over 20 years are so closed minded. The world around us has changed and they haven't realized that since they have been stuck there for decades. Too many chiefs that run the show and work-life balance aren't there.
bad,This is by far the worst most stressful place to work. Where I worked the management team was horrible and no respect for the hard work you put into the company. I wouldn’t recommend this company to my worst enemy. Within this company it’s not about how hard you work it’s about getting upper management to like you so that you can be promoted. This company is very cut throat so if you ever think about working here just simply go to CVS
bad,"Poor workplace culture due to corporate demand, new initiatives/services constantly added to with hours/support being taken away and leading to very overworked, frustrated, and exhausted staff. Due to fast paced work environment, severe understaffing and exhaustion, patient safety and costumer care put at risk."
bad,when i started working there the shift manager was mean and some of the employees was also. They throw you in there and expect you to know everything. They dont show you how to do the job at all . And there unorganized. It’s a place full of drama
bad,"Walgreens is not someplace with any actual potential unless you are in the pharmacy department. its really boring, doesn't require much skill at all and will not teach you too much more than the basics for customer service."
bad,"Worked for this company for over 13 years. They constantly allow customers to walk all over you for any reason. Management, depending on who they are, will walk over you as well. Very strict on if you get sick, you only get a couple times you can call out, then they will write you up a couple times till you are fired. Low pay in the company. Will NOT work with you on hours. This company used to be great, now they dont care. They keep taking things away from employees (vacation days, job positions, etc). There are never enough employees in the store at one given time, so customers get antsy because of the lack of help. Corporate keeps cutting hours."
bad,"Worked there 22 years I was put on suspension for using a wrong code that was directed by a DM, then I received a phone call a week later, just to inform me that I was going to be separated from the company and that my last check was going to be mailed. Funny that it all happened right before bonuses hit. It’s not about the employees anymore it’s how much they could cut to pay off the buyouts or to say pay the company who bought Walgreens. Horrible place to work for."
bad,I learned that if you want to progress in your career as a pharmacy technician Walgreens is not the place. Walgreens may be good for a short term goal as a pharmacy technician but not long term.
bad,"I recommend this position if you enjoy retail and learning how to troubleshoot insurance claims with the public; either on the phone and or in person. However, the fact they expect you to become certified within the 5 classroom lectures that you have to fit into your loaded work schedule. The fact that they will let you go if you do not pass the quizzes; but are doing excellent on the job; does not make sense.. If there was an opportunity to accumulate all of this information through actual practice and teaching and not creating a focal point on speed and insurance claims; people would not have a problem getting certified.. The pharmacy staff at the main street and millbranch location; are completely immature; condescending bunch; whom if you do not know the answer; they will not just excuse themselves into the assisting you; they will literally move you to the side and speak over you. very  very  rude to customers and talk to down to the managers."
bad,"I worked that this company for 15 years. In the beginning the company and the work culture was great. As the years went on it became high school. The people who should be promoted, never got promoted. It was the managers favorites who got the position. People who work there the longest did not make the most money. They would hired some new who would make more money than you. You do get healthcare but it is so expensive you may not have enough money left to pay your bills to take care of your family."
bad,"There's are not enough people working in the store so it looks like the store is going out of business. I've never worked at a company where there are so much negativity and the managers really don't seem to care that the store is going downhill. "
bad,"Enjoyed interacting with customers, however the hours a store manager works are a little excessive.  Compensation used to be good, but the salary structure and bonus structure were changed.  Upper management was always super critical, and all they did was make cuts in payroll and good personnel."
bad,A great place to work for at first and after time you see major favortism and adult workers thrived on gossiping. Schedules are always changed and your whole shift and schedules can change last minute with no explanation. Over all poor managment skills and lack of communication. Store manager has no real respect in general! Judges without personally know all the employees that are working there also even customers that come in are falsely judged and has no apperciation as seeing employees as primary asset. That's why they come and go because they put in the hard work and realize how bad it is with all of the above and plus some. I would recommend to not put forth the time on this specific location. Also not all Walgreens locations are like this but this store is!
bad,"to many changes and reduced hours  to  much favoritism, lack of communication, supervisors  make their own schedules and leave the floor often ,needs better training"
bad,"I have learned a lot during the almost 5 years at this company, but every year this company goes further down the drain. Does not have good management. Management acts like they own company. Do not want to promote or compensate employees, so in return good employees leave the company. No incentive to stay. Gets greedier every year. Cuts budget and hours for employees, yet wants employees to do more work with less hours and time to finish. Focuses too much on measures, instead of patient care. Overall not a good company to work for. Not worth someones time and effort. If I could give zero stars, I would."
bad,"Horrible company with horrible policies and values. Walgreens doesn’t care about their employees, I don’t even have the energy to explain why I say that. Just don’t work here! Poor management team throughout the entire district. Worst job I’ve ever committed to!"
bad,"If you have kids, don't work there.  Unreasonable expectations.  Many of the Lead people are unfair and sit in the bathroom on the phone while we work.  It is difficult to get a break.  Some of the managers refuse to listen to your concerns."
bad,"Walgreen's once upon a time long ago used to be a respected company.  They no longer invest in their employees and only care about money. They have eliminated almost every aspect of why they were once a great company. Push out the long time employees and replace them with new fresh faced, minimum wage employees. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you are no longer respected as an good working employee, Thieves are treated better. The most enjoyable part of the job is hoping to get a different job before you get fired."
bad,"Employees were expected to have completely open availability. Management hired from outside company and treated poorly, made to move stores every six months. Not much else to say. Working hard makes you a work horse to this company and little else."
bad,"when I 1st started at Walgreen it was a great place to work, but when I left the the company employees were just a number that was easily replaced or the company thought"
bad,"They never trained me and then they got mad because I was moving slow. They said they would work around my schooling during the interview, but refused to after I accepted the job. Never got a break. Worked me like a dog with minimum pay."
bad,"Walk in to any walgreen, the place has no staff. Lines are long, the pharmacists and full staff are managed by graduates of ""some college"". "
bad,"There is a bad store manager at the Walgreens I work at. He is not here hardly at all. He is unfair with the schedule. He doesn't have a back bone. He hired someone and this person was a no call no show first 2 days, this person is still on schedule. The people are great , store manager not so much."
bad,"Walgreens is not the greatest company to work for. The management is entitled. There is no fair scheduling. Management and corporate does not have our backs when customers are constantly unruly. Long hours. No real time for family. High stress level job, low salary."
bad,after 18 years of working for Walgreens I was terminated without a defined reason. I was never given paperwork or asked to sign anything.I gave 50 plus hours every week to them. I made the stores I was given shine. My last store I was at made 10% sales growth for each of the three years I was there. I feel betrayed by them.
bad,Recently WBA became a part of the DOW 30. They replaced GE. They did this on the backs of their employees. They demand more for less every day. Great employees are leaving as fast as they can to get away from this nightmare the management has made.
bad,"Everyone is very stressed, not enough staff, customers constantly complaining,  some staff does not carry his/her share of work load, lots of work are left behind for other team member of the next shift"
bad,"Started out full time as a cashier, was having some health problems and missed a few days of work over 5 month period, hours were cut to part time. Pointed out non-working employees and how their hours weren't cut. It was pointed out to me that that was a separate issue. Yet nothing was ever done. The store manager basically left the assistant manager to interact with the employees, but liked to get on your case about things even though she didn't have all of the information. Poor pay."
bad,Working at Walgreens pharmacy was the most stressful job that I have ever had.   I couldn't sleep at night the stress was getting so badly.   They need more then one Walgreens.
bad,"It's an awful company. Management does whatever they want, and they're all friends so you can't even go above their heads. The only thing even remotely good about this job is if you're lucky, you'll meet some pretty nice people as co-workers."
bad,"The only way to get ""full time"" is the have open availability and then your lucky to get over 30 hours but are still working 5 to 6 days a week and have no time for your life since it's odd hours in the middle of the day. And the budget is constantly getting cut but they hire new people anyway."
bad,If you do not mind being forced into overtime all the time and poor management this job would be for you. If you have no life and no children this job is for you. If you do not care how the company treats and talk down to you this job is for you. If you are looking to be continuously be bullied and lied to from management this is the job for you.
bad,"When I started, this company closed early on major holidays.  You got to see your family. After new companies started getting involved the company lost track itself. The hours got worse, you were expected to do more work with less time and help. The management was so reckless, and unhelpful it was sad. This company may have been great 7-8 years ago, but now, I wouldn't stick around."
bad,Constantly dealing with meth heads and drunks with no backup from management or corporate. Saw a few managers fired for dealing with situations the same way every person would. Management didn’t care about you or your health but if you messed their day up it was the worst thing to ever happen on the face of the earth. 0/10 would recommend working here. 0/10 would recommend shopping here. They don’t care about anyone. Quote from my manager “buy your s*** and get out” said to a few customers while I was there.
bad,I did not have a good experience at Walgreens due to the fact that the general manager had a severe personality disorder which reflected in her treatment of myself and others. There were no signs of advancement so I decided it was time for me to resign and focus on my education by returning to school to get my bachelor's degree.
bad,"Double standards run rampant and training is up to you to figure out.  If you ask management for help, you will be blamed for not knowing.  Your world is to revolve around the company and if it doesn't your world will be made miserable."
bad,Repeat complaints about workplace harassment went unanswered and there was no real recourse to correct or bring about actual change. Staff was toxic and gossipy.
bad,"I have never in my life worked for a company who has no training.  No handbook.  Its a free for all.  I started out on the reg.   Then went to cos.  After only being with Walgreens for 3 months i was offered a shift lead position.  Thankful for the opportunity.  But really all it was was a little more pay with responsibility out the wazoo.  You are the only leadership there but have 0 authority.  People walk  out in the middle of their shift and still have a job.  Cuss out leadership and nothing happens.  No call no show, still have a job.  No formal training in pharmacy but required to go back and help.  Its up there with the worst company I have worked for.  Cares nothing about its employees but says they are about customer service.  Favoritism is big.  No accountability.  Overall not a good work environment."
bad,What they are asking of a person as a apa is just not adding up to what they are paying. This job is just not worth it at all. Trust me I am a Walgreens employee now
bad,Walgreen's is a great company i believe the general managers should be more hands on with there employees and customers.Profit and money will come but in any company customer service should be the ultimate focus.
bad,"management was terrible, i had no hours some weeks, and other weeks i had little to no hours. The management team hired more employees without the regard for others that have been there."
bad,"Shift leads and managers will sit and eat in the office while you are working. No consistency between managers, multiple answers for the same question.You won't get a raise or recognition for the work you do.Also managers pay more attention and concern for certain workers they favor over you."
bad,i wasn't treated fairly by my management and i tried to have conversations with him about and he still wouldn't care if i could provide for my family or not and at that time i knew it was time for me to go.
bad,"Incredibility poor management to say the least. The job itself was easy. The pressure and stress from management was insane, the shadiness and fake people throughout the company was pathetic."
bad,To be promoted is all politics has nothing to do with work performance just who you know and are friends with. Which leads to managers that have no clue how to run a store or work with people. Very corporate and all they care about is profits going up and cutting hours to make that happen.
bad,"Limited room for advancement low cap out for ceiling pay. Of course when dealing with the public you will be under some degree of stress. But the way the company sends down for how procedures and protocol should be executed in the work place is not feasible in addition of all of the basic things you have to do on a daily basis. You are just a pawn. When you get sick/ have a baby/ family emergency/ cancer,  your managers will be blowing you up to see just how soon can you return to work. No regard for the  time you need to be home with your family nor your personal life or own health outside of the work place whatsoever."
bad,they dont protect their employees. Its an easy job but communication is a problem there. Maybe it was just my location but I wont go to another walgreens again.
bad,"When I started at Walgreens they were customer oriented.  Keep the customer whatever you have to do.  When I left Walgreens they were money oriented.  There will be another customer come through the door.  We had to complete all these special tasks like choosing Medicare Part D Plans, immunizations, healthcare screenings without letting the pharmacy suffer; of course there was only one pharmacist."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had. They play favorites and if your not a favorite you get pushed out. My grandpa died and I didn't even get an ""I'm sorry"" just when is the funeral? On your day off great we won't have to find anyone to cover you. You get stuck in the pharmacy your whole shift and then get yelled at if you don't get your stuff done. They also don't tell you that you don't get any breaks at all. I worked there 7 months and never got a break."
bad,Management was just inconsistent with each other and extremely rude. Wouldn't allow me to leave my shift 15 min. early when my little sister got into a bad car accident down the road. Told me to wait and then following day told me what a terrible job I did stocking items. (I was crying while stocking that night)
bad,"Always asking for more and giving less. 401k match has decreased yearly for a few years, pay freezes announced recently, hour cuts for pharmacy employees, no interest in helping employees advance."
bad,"Walgreens will work the life out of you for 9.00 Not worth it!! Managers slack basically cashier's do everything stock shelves do truck that needs to be done by the time 1st shift is over so if its you and another worker and their on the register for the day, guess who's responsible for truck you! Employees can't pull together to get the job done worst retail job ever. They only get serious when dm is visiting the area"
bad,"Dislike how they run the place, favoritism. They way you can apply for another position is not how I expect. Coworkers are not how you typically would have in another job."
bad,working at Walgreen's was much fun and i learned a lot that had to do with my vocational trade is marketing and business technology which us intertwined with customer service. The management was poor along with the treatment to the employees. The most enjoyable part of working at Walgreen was always making sure the customer was always satisfied.
bad,Sometimes fun and easy and other times awful. Can be very productive and exciting. Challenging too. Different departments were interesting. Helping c customers were reward enough especially when you've helped them in their time of need
bad,"No work/life balance. Had to beg to get days off. No more advancements. Have to work holidays and swing shifts sometimes working late til 11, then coming in next morning at 3."
bad,"This company does not believe in work-life balance."
bad,Compensation/benefits were poor. I guess if you work at the right store and have better management and better coworkers it would be ok. Never told you are doing a good job.
bad,"Ever since Walgreens has merged with boots and alliance the company has gone so downhill. The employees that work there are amazing hard working people who deserve way more than they will ever receive. The company does not provide you will the resources needed to complete a job, you work for the equivalent of 4 people and are expected to have outstanding results. You are treated like some worthless person but expect you to make them profits. Every person I have worked with in the pharmacy feels like it is slave work. I used to really love my job there and would speak so highly of the company, and now.... its nothing but such a disappointment and great sadness to lose the job I very much so loved."
bad,To stressful. Not flexible. Lack of staffing. Poor management. Horrible scheduling. Definitely wouldn’t recommend anyone to work at Walgreens.........
bad,"A new boss came in and fired almost everyone. Changed a lot of things and if you didn't brown nose her,then your time was limited. Likes to throw you to the pharmacy wolves with no experience."
bad,"This is the absolute worst place I have ever worked! The manager has no clue of how to run the store. I was constantly left with only 1 or 2 employees to run the store. That means everyone is over stressed and miserable. The employee moral is -100! This causes constant conflicts between employees and no one can wait for their shift to end. Don't even bother to ask the manager for any assistance, you will not get it."
bad,"Required to work 6 days a week averaging 52 hours, only get paid and acrure PTO for 40 hours per week.  Have no control over employee wages and cannot obtain good talent at minimum wage.  Expectation of direct reports is not justified in their pay rate."
bad,A typical day at walgreens would be having your boss yell at you while trying to do your job. The store manager would always yell at you for anything.
bad,"Upper management has lost touch with what it is like to work in stores, They offer no help and no other type of support. The Care Win and Inspire leadership model is a bad joke that they do not even understand"
bad,Management is terrible. They don't care about their employees. There's a lot of favoritism and cliques in that store. The new employees get treated like slaves and a heavy workload.
bad,"Senior Tech duties, retail pharmacy order entry, filling, customer service, inventory, order the warehouse order and cardinal order, charge backs, do the schedule, attend meetings, etc"
bad,Management only cared about the bottom line did not care about the employees at all. Upper management very disconnected with the field and did not listen to the mid management team. They did not want to hear any ideas not a good culture. Let many folks go due to downsizing now very thin and needing to do extra work without compensation.
bad,"When I was there, the store manager was not very nice. She wanted to sit in the office all of the time and make us work more then we should be. The corporate aspect is all about the money. How can they have more money in their pockets rather than help the people that are making them money. Cutting the hours constantly. Making the store team leads work harder for less pay."
bad,"Customers were great and were the only good thing about this position.  Management was not only unapproachable, but often hateful, spiteful and unpleasant to deal with."
bad,We were always short staffed in a very busy tier 4 pharmacy with little to help from the front end and management. We would get scolded for asking for help when they were supposed to or when things couldn't get done due to busyness and lack of staff. Constantly got yelled at by customers with no management to have your back. Extremely degrading.
bad,"The overall workplace was overshadowed by managers in power,  whose overall concern was the numbers the store produces while neglecting their employees."
bad,"I was glad that I made the decision to end my employment with this company"
bad,"When I first started out at Walgreens I over it. I was getting trained all over the store, but then they changed everything. And to top it off wouldn't handle ""executive assistants"" when they were totally out of control. I thought the company had my back that's was until I got hurt and lost everything. It works for a stepping stone but do t plan to make a career. You get written up for not selling enough of he suggested sales."
bad,Walgreens is a terrible place to work with lots of added stress due to gossip. Upper management does nothing to stop this due to the fact they think they are finding out what goes on when they are not there. This is not the case most stories that fly around the store are exaggerated stories or just out right lies. Most the time these stories are told to management by poor performing employees in order to make themselves look better. Most of the work falls on the very few high performing employees in the store allowing the others to get away with doing nothing. Benefits seem to be getting cut thinner and thinner every year as well. God bless anyone that can deal with this kind of work environment.
bad,Worked for a year while going to school. Management played favorites and would pick and choose who got tasks to do and who was only allowed to stand at the front.
bad,fast paced work environment with little to no acknowledgement from the store manager. High turnover rate and many employees dissatisfied with management.
bad,"If you have options, don't make this one of them. Not a place you will be happy, overworked underpaid and terrible customers. I also happened to have a new manager who was not promoted for her skills, and could not run a crew without causing conflict constantly."
bad,This place was very stressful and at times very dangerous for employees. Managers are concerned more about about making their bonuses then the treatment of employees below them.
bad,"management at the store needs to learn how to talk to their employees, and properly train them better. they need to stop bringing personal problems to work. management needs to be re-trained"
bad,"The best thing I learned at Walgreens was customer service and how to manage a variety of people. Other than that I would not recommend this job to anyone. Very face paced, very stressful, and very poor management."
bad,You will just have to work here for yourself to get the hang of things at walgreens. I been there too long to feel like I'm not being treated there so i just rather leave than to stay where I'm not respected for my hard work.
bad,Walgreens had an extensive amount of requirements for employees to complete but do not pay much. They were short on staff so people were definitely overworked.
bad,Management does not care about you. They look for any reason to fire you and give you no warning when they do. I am happy to not be working there any longer. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"my store manager was a horrible micro-manager who kept giving you jobs to do when you didn't finish the first task. You needed to know all departments in the store but there was no pay advance for knowing everything. The whole company and the higher ups, did not care about the regular employees. I worked their for over 7 years and made less than a $2 raise the whole time."
bad,"They treat employees like cattle.  Happy to fire long term staff to replace with new employees at a lower pay rate. No job security, over worked, stay away."
bad,This was the worst job I ever had. It has given me nothing but anxiety and was the worst place to ever be in. Customers are awful to work with especially at this location.
bad,"Typically I played pharmacist and technician.  As such I was responsible for counting in cash drawer, stocking the pharmacy order and counting out the cash drawer."
bad,some workerd were mean and did not want to help you when needed and was a very disorganized place. my typical day at work was awful i hated it and didn't learn a thing.
bad,"I applied as a Beauty Adviser and was hired as one, a few months into this job they started putting me at the front counter for the rest of my time spent as an employee here, before putting in my 2 weeks. The managers are extremely childish and cruel. I have management experience and was paid minimum wage ($9.00) to cashier, stock, work odd hours (clock out at 10pm be back at 6am), sweep, wash, and vacuum the store (because their cleaners from an outside company, quit and they found they saved money by having us do it), clean bathrooms, scan products, throw perfectly fine merchandise into their special dumpster that compacts the trash, and annoy customers about daily deals that aren't really deals. There is no holiday pay and I worked every holiday since my hire date. Also, all the managers hire their families first before other applicants. All the women managers have their daughters working there, at the same facility, and one of the women even have her husband at another store."
bad,The people that work there seem like they are always walking on thin ice that's ready to break. You are not allowed to speak and when you do managers and team leads are listening ready to report you to HR.
bad,Too few employees and a lot of work. I worked myself to the point that I couldn't anymore. worked the same position for years and never moved up. I was way more qualified for multiple higher positions and was never given the opportunity. always worked overtime even when called in. worked 6 days sometimes 7 days a week with 50 plus hours a week no significant raise or promotion
bad,"understaffed. lies. underpaid. unfair. s**t hours. not family oriented. the ONLY the enjoyable part of the job were the customers I got to know and serve, the hardest part was leaving them in that half a**ed s**t hole with no one to give a f**k about them."
bad,I like what I did and enjoyed serving the public but there were certain things that the management staff did that I didn't agree with. But overall I liked working there
bad,"Very bad experience, horrible management that doesn't know much about computer systems.. Company culture is just as old as the company (100+ years), Horrible Work/Life balance with End of Day deadlines being midnight that day.."
bad,Excellent place to work with great benefits. Very professional atmosphere and the people are very nice. I worked in Spit Cae picking and Outbound Prep.
bad,"Unfortunately they don't allow them to provide the customer service they are capable of, because of their staffing guidelines. It is not the employees fault, but the employers fault.The company does not appreciate experience in the profession either, unless it was achieved in their company.Most companies reward experience and compensate accordingly.The Pharmacy industry is a very customer service intensive industry, Walgreens could be great if they provided the staff to achieve the goal.They have some Great Pharmacists and Technicians but they aren't allowed to shine because they are always under the pressure of not having enough staff to accomplish all of the tasks at hand."
bad,"Never be a pharmacist here!!!! We are overworked, work 12 hour shifts with no lunch or break. I feel stressed and miserable on 90 percent of my shifts. Management is more focused on cutting hours and squeezing every bit of life out of pharmacists than patient care. I've seen so many mistakes because of how overworked both techs and pharmacists are. Eventually there's going to be a lawsuit and Walgreens will wake up. Taking vacation is a joke. Also they require you to spend days doing required training for them and WILL NOT pay you for it."
bad,"Walgreens is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. it was such a stressful and horrible, unhealthy environment.It was always cold and plenty of drama within coworkers and patients."
bad,"Terrible place to work. Managers expect you to leave your house at a drop of a hat for work. I was pregnant when I worked here and they refused to allow me to have my doctors ordered weight lifting restrictions."
bad,they fired me because I refuse to fight a customer for stealing while I was a student. they write you up for things that's not true
bad,"Never able to move up in a different position, had been working there for 8 yesrs +. The new hired employees that had not even been their not even a year is the ones who move up, because of being friends with the manager."
bad,"The pay is horrible, no room for advancement unless you know management or work here for 20yrs.. This was the most boring job I ever had and had to pretend I was busy all the time the management sucks. They will cut your hours if you work more than a minute over 30hrs..."
bad,I would not recommend Walgreens to anyone. Walgreens does not care about it's customers or it's employees. I would prefer to not say anything else.
bad,"First job and worst job. I absolutely despise working here. Management lacks communication skills and empathy, store manager that is. Ast. Manager lacks emotionally control and has unrealistic expectation. Working here is both physically and emotionally draining. There is no team work. Everyone is out for themselves and many employees do not care about customers or fellow coworkers. Often times people are in trouble for actually doing their job description or for things that are very minute, i.e. accidentally leaving a box behind photo at the end of the night. Many times we are forced to feel under pressure, this job is stressful beyond normal means. We are tired of being yelled at, tired of the negative space and tired of being made to feel like we are ants to be stepped on. There are too many personal attachments and many times only people who lick the boots of the manager progress to higher positions. If you are not absolutely perfect at you job at all times, you are scum. End of Story."
bad,"Typical every other day at work for an SFL consists of you being loaded with the same tasks as your assistant manager.  As an SFL I did learn a lot about management.  When you get hired you get the speech that you are not really a member of management, but oh by the way you are expected to actually manage the store just like a manager or ASM. Its basically Walgreens way of having another member of management without having to pay them a management wage.  - Hardest part of the job would be being expected to perform miracles with how understaffed you are."
bad,"productive workplace, always busying, friendly environment. Decent amount of hours. The same routine duties everyday plus extra work on top of that."
bad,"worse place anyone could work, the lady managers there suck. i only got along with only one of them. so glad im out of there its disgusting and petty. wouldnt be suprised if it closed down in a few months"
bad,"loads of favoritism, fraternizing and conflicts of interest, very low pay, back breaking work, pushy managers to hit sales goals, no growth opportunity, only promotes favorites,outside favors to management plays a part in who is promoted. lots of gossip,perversion,crooked and underhanded things going on at this company, if i could give zero stars i would"
bad,"Much more is assigned than can be accomplished; Shift Leads are expected to not take any kind of breaks; Pay is disgustingly less than what it should be; Expect to have no personal life- schedule is all over the map and never the same twice in a year of working; Management members are basically hall monitors- giving work, doing nothing, and complaining when you don't do enough. The problem is at the store level- managers are allowed nearly free reign within their store, so each store has a different set of expectations and operating procedures."
bad,High turn over rate. If you like shift bids and working odd hours with little sleep and no paid time off then this would be a perfect fit.
bad,"Walgreens is a company that will give you a job- if no one else will.  I would indeed call that a benefit, at first, but once you get sucked in, it's all the will power inside of you that keeps you from walking out and quitting. The pay is very low for what the expect you to do on a daily basis.  Walgreen's main priority will always be the customer because the customer is paying the Big Guy's check.  Not yours- management starts out at $3 more than minimum wage- but expects you to run the entire store. Then when you do well, score as high as you can on the performance reviews, they give you a standard raise of $0.25.  Nothing really based on how good of a worker you are.  Room for advancement?  They would much rather higher an outsider to start out in a higher position than promote from within.  Why promote your best cashier when chances are you aren't going to find someone so dedicated to not calling off, even though they close every weekend. Work life balance? No such thing.  If you do not eat, sleep, breathe, and live Walgreens, then you are not a dedicated and respectworthy employee. Walgreens needs to be your life.  The most enjoyable thing about this job is if you are struggling to find a full time job, they will be there for you.  Just do not expect to get paid what you deserve for all the hard work you put into this job.  Afterall, it is a super, life-saving, important job.  You work at a convenience store."
bad,Just a terrible place. Youre one person doing every job that place has for minimum wage. Probably one of the worst retail jobs ayone an ever have.
bad,"Walgreens is a ""stepping stone"" type job. It is not a place that you should be for the rest of your life. I have seen pharmacists who have gotten kidney infections from holding their bladders too long. It's so much expected and to have the nerve to cap the salary! District is so far removed form working in the stores that it is super easy to say what should be done until 5 pm when they can go home and enjoy their families. Taking vacation is a joke. They don't put qualified people in management positions. I had a pharmacy manager straight out of pharmacy school. She didn't know how to be a pharmacist let alone a manager! Bottom line, it's not a fun place to work for. It's evolved into a real medical focused place rather than pharmacy/"
bad,"There is hope. These employees need a voice. I hope these changes will look out for the front line employee."
bad,"The customers at my store were amazing. On any given day when I walked into the store, there were customers waiting on my arrival. Many would request me or wait so I could develop their photos and help them with their editing. When I would work the beauty counter, I had the highest sales in the state. Customers were the main reason I stayed at this job for 5 years."
bad,A typical day at work is long hard work. you will learn about insurance verification prior authorization. learned how to get along with others.
bad,very low pay for all that you are required to do.  management is the only part corporate cares about.  it takes years to gain any ground or advancement and you do not get raises or awards unless you are management.  you work your tail off for minimum wage.
bad,"Meet lots of good customers and new faces each day. "
bad,"This was by FAR the WORST job I have ever had. I worked as a Certified Pharmacy Technician E-Commerce Specialist with this company at their mail order facility located in Tempe Arizona. First of all, the manager of this department is extremely inept with his job and yet he still feels the need to have his underlings (shift supervisors) do all his dirty work for him. He runs the place as a dictatorship; micro-managing every little thing that you do. And not to mention this place is extremely gossipy. It's like going back to high school all over again. There are certain clicks within this department and all of them are two-faced. They are always looking to make you look bad no matter what it takes to try and gain status with the higher-ups. Your job will constantly be on the line here because of that. Sadly, the group you would have to watch out for the most are your trainers and coaches. These are extremely gossipy women who would not hesitate to run you over with their car if it meant getting praise. While I worked there, I constantly had a target on my back since I continuously was the highest performer. They automatically assume you are cheating if you do your job well and will spy on you from their computers just to see if they can get you in trouble. I religiously followed the task list and when they could not find errors in my work habits suddenly there would be rumors spread about you. And sadly again, management would believe them. In this department, opinions on how to improve the workflow are neglected and/or looked down upon. ""Their way"" was the only way. There is"
bad,"I have worked for Walgreens for 9 1/2 years and I truly loved working there. In the past year we had a new pharmacy and store manager at our store, since then everything in the whole store went downhill."
bad,a typical day is working in the front as a cashier and saying welcome to walgreens and be well an they dont never say anything back to you.the management is cool a little. co worker seems to think there the manager when there not. the hardest part about my job nothing i love customer service work
bad,"The store manager was lovely, all the other management was awful. What I was promised when I was hired, and what I actually experienced working for the company unfortunately were not the same."
bad,Poor overall attitude of employees. No motivation for 8.00 an hr employees. District manager aloof and unapproachable.Set you up for failure not sucess.
bad,For a 500 to 700 prescriptios a day Pharmacy with a high volume of calls there was always short people . This company always wants to ear more money with less staff who is over work and not compensated correctly.
bad,This company is not loyal to their employees or customers. Management and district managers all micro manage. No one takes accountability for there actions and you see a lot of finger pointing.
bad,I've worked there for almost 7yrs. Was told last year that that was going to be my last raise. Store stays open extra hours for holidays and they don't even send a merry Christmas email to the stores. The management is horrible and they barely promote inside the company. They would rather hire someone outside the company. The work is never ending because they are always short staffed and we do not get paid NEARLY enough for the work we do. Dead end job! Walgreens does not care about their employees. All they care about is money.
bad,"typical teller related employment, worked with good coworkers and management"
bad,"I worked at Walgreens for exactly 5 months. I was treated unfairly the entire time by the employees that have been there for years I guess because they were used to the people who have always been there.  I had to beg my manager to train me because no one else wanted to. And after seeing how hard I would work, I would only get scheduled to work only on truck days and order days and I would only get 6-8 hours a week for a month.  And the only time I would get more hours would be if someone went on vacation.  And then I found out I was pregnant. That is when things got even worse. I would be given the tasks of re-organizing the freezer (I have asthma) and doing entire orders by myself,  carrying heavy boxes and organizing top shelves on bays and then got called into the office because I ""wasn't doing everything I was assigned to do"". I gave them a doctor's note the following week instructing me to take it easy and not climb ladders and lift over 20lbs and all that stuff. So my hours got cut again. Next thing I know I'm fired for not complying with the walgreens culture by taking 2 breaks longer than 30min and them calling it ""theft"" and that I will be sent a letter saying I owe them $24. Screw Walgreens. Don't work there at all."
bad,"Only half decent thing is the employee discount."
bad,"The typical day at work is a very busy to steady one. As a shift lead , you are responsible for more than you get paid for. I got paid $11.00 an hour with a whole heap of responsibilities. You personally have to do the same work of an ASM, ASM-T, or an higher ranking manager for less the pay. Management come down on you if the money isn't accurate on paper but spot on in funds. Also if employees on your shift doesn't complete an assignment it falls on you. You have no authority and can't discipline anyone. You are just basically a keyholder with a headache of responsibilities. The store manager will have you close after 3 days to a week of training no matter if you got it or not. They expect you to master it in 90 days if you haven't got it they put you on a 90 day probation which would instantly kill your chances at the ASM-T promotion that comes around once a year. There is a slim chance that you will get accepted into this program. If you don't get accepted you will have to go for it the next time around and continue with the same pay. Not to mention you literally have to WORK, this no sit on your butt management job. Your going to WORK 95% of the time of your shift. You have a list of assignments by the store manager that you have to delegate to your employees including assignments for you to do. While doing this you have to get change, do customer refunds, handle customer complaints, and make sure the store is in tip top condition. It's all tough to do when your store is a busy one. If you are a college student like me, this is not for you. They do not care about your school"
bad,They find more and more ways to get rid of employees and less ways in how to help the people who work for them to give better working conditions.
bad,"walgreens only cares about walgreens, the co-workers are nice and enjoyable but they don't last long, maybe 2 years TOPS"
bad,"If you are new at Walgreens you are taken advantage of. I have put my time, money, and life into the company for over three years and because I'm the floater for my district, I travel a ton to the stores that are doing bad and have under 415 hours for about two dozen worker, and I'm always the new guy at a store I end up getting my hours cut to where I don't work for a week or two. "
bad,This company doesn't care about its employees. They just want people to work for them and don't cater to employees needs.
bad,What a waste of time...They love playing favorites. So if your not one of the favorites you can forget about advancing~~~
bad,"I have learned a lot about cash handling, customer service, how to build displays and how to improvise, time management, and product knowledge. On a typical day at work, I help customers, maintain my area and the stockroom, pull the bay, build displays, sort boxes and totes of new material, and count my till every night. My store manager is languid in his duties and prefers to sit in his office all day, gossip about employee's and is seldom positive. Most of my coworkers work very hard, while others do not, this has taught me how to work with a wide variety of people. The hardest part of my job is dealing with costumers who can be rude and curse at you. The most enjoyable part is learning about the new products."
bad,"At the time I was working here, there was a pending lawsuit against them for the lack of advancement to the African-American workers. I did not follow up on the outcome, but I am sure anyone wondering can just Google it to find it. This was a HORRIBLE experience; one that has truly left me scarred. It is sad what I had to deal with. I was a young single mother working two sometimes three jobs and the management team treated me different than the other workers. I had a hard time being happy while I was at work. I felt they took advantage of their authority. They were not understanding toward the fact that I was a mother at all (this meant nothing to them). I would never ever work at another Walgreens in my life. I have only bad memories from this company. I learned how strong I was and how real racism is."
bad,"need to fix upper management, and the quality of family life is non-existed"
bad,"The management is based on who you know not how hard you've worked. The training is zero, I thought it was a joke. They had people doing pharmacy technician work even though we where not certified. A lot and I cannot stress enough a lot of unprofessionalism everywhere you turn. The work is repetative rather easy but the people and the environment suck. Not a place you want to be long term."
bad,Walgreens is horrible to its lower-level employees. They barely train you and then expect you to know what you're doing within 20 minutes of working there. The hours are sometimes unbearable and you are forced to work long hours and holidays if you are one of the new hires. Managers seem to disappear when you need them and more experienced employees are rude and unable to help. Request-offs and call-offs (even for valid reasons) are frowned upon.
bad,"I don't really have much to say, other than I don't want to work here anymore. I am very unhappy here."
bad,I have learned a lot in the pharmacy about medications. The hardest part of the job is rejecting patient their medication due to insurance.
bad,"Last minute schedule changes all the time,no respect from superiors, no respect for employees personal life. The same employees are depended on while others are not doing their jobs and have nothing said to them. Good employees get fired for minor mistakes and those that continually under perform get to keep their jobs so that thee is a ""warm body"" there."
bad,"Walgreens management doesn't care that you have anything to do outside of work. Your family, church, school cease to exist when you say yes to working here. You are expected to work 60+ hours a week as an exempt employee and to be available 24 hours a day on call, even if you're not an on call employee. They use 10 year old computer equipment and expect you to be productive with it. And whatever you do don't complain to senior leadership because they'll get rid of you faster than you can call foul."
bad,Increasing amount of workload added to pharmacists but with decreasing supportive personnel. Poor communications between employees and management.
bad,If you didn’t have depression before you will definitely have it after working here. I have never dreaded going to a job more than I have at Walgreens.
bad,"Management is horrible and the store organization is appalling, all day was a problem for nothing and many gossip  it wasn’t t an environment in which you feel confident working also there was discrimination I don’t t recommend it"
bad,They are not at all understanding only care about themselves. My girlfriend had high risk pregnancy and we had many appointments that I gave them and told them the times I could work and when they scheduled me at a time I needed to be at the appointment they told me if I didn't come I would be written up or even loose my job. Not flexible at all.
bad,I’m looking for pharmacy that I can feel proud to be apart of that won’t take me for granted.  Everyday here feels like I’m clocking in just to yearn to make it to the end of the day.
bad,"In this line of business, unless you are developing a career with the company in pharmacy, this wouldn't be for you.  There are time constraints with the stats and quotas that you have to succeed and/or accomplish."
bad,"Your just a somebody! They don’t treat you well, don’t train you, overworked and very underpaid. The management is the worst by far I’ve had at any company! Definitely wouldn’t recommend this place to work at."
bad,"Was hired on with the promise of at least 24 hours a week, only to regularly receive ten or less hours at a dollar less than what I was also promised. Had next to no training and was consistently yelled at and verbally abused for not knowing how the system works. Was not given any opportunities to learn and instead was left on the drive thru window with no breaks and no help when I ran into an issue. Management is flippant and belittling, and patients were given the same treatment as I was."
bad,The constant lack of staff due to company greed makes it hard to get all of the tasks done. The staff i work with is fun but the stress on everyone makes it a high turnaround rate.
bad,"patrono no considerado, no valora los sacrificios que como empleado se hace diario para poder brindar el mejor servicio posible."
bad,"At first I really liked the job and felt I fit in well.  When I was hired on, I made sure and informed them though I didn't have to, that I have R.R.M.S. It doesn't fully dibilitate me, but it can at times put me in the hospital.  When I got hospitalized in the beginning of December, it was a trial.  To even get the assistant store manager to listen to me about the need to go to the ER, i had to talk to the Pharmacist on duty.  I had my doctor on my phone at the time, and she got them to listen.  I was out for 6 days and the very day I came back, i was asked to step down for, in their words, ""for my health"".  This was upsetting all in its own, but then the next day when i came back, was again talked to, and they came up with many reasons why i should step down.  Which...at this point, i was under the impression i was doing a decent job as, i was never spoken to beyond the first week of training.  I felt ashamed, felt useless, and so ended my employment with them.  Still waiting to hear back from HR about my complaint i put in about this situation."
bad,"You will be overworked and underpaid. Corporate only cares about money. Your immediate managers will make or break your time with the company, so if you begin to like your managers, then great. If not, you will hate your job."
bad,"I worked at the Walgreens on 28th, in Pine Bluff,AR for only 3 months. I wasn’t fully trained to begin with, But i was definitely underpaid, and I was ALWAYS, the only one working the front register. I had to do FedEx inventory, customer photos, check out customers, assist people doing Western Union all by myself, while the store leads would be in the stockroom not doing anything!"
bad,Non professional management doesn’t keep certain things between higher management. Everyone know everyone’s business it’s really messy. They don’t teach you much but if you mess up you get in trouble so to learn what not to do you have to make the mistake. Makes you work in the front of the store when pharmacy isn’t open or if they don’t have hours but you want more hours no breaks just a 30 minute. If you work the front store you get two 15 minutes and a lunch break treated unjustly
bad,The money is good but they really don't care about their employees. Human Resources takes years to hear back from and the conversion process is a complete disaster.
bad,"Terrible company terrible ppl senior techs suck! In fair scheduling dumb rules Always under staffed not"
bad,"I spent 15 years pouring my soul into this company just to be forced out because of my age. This company used to value it's employees but now they are doing everything they can to get rid of them. They used to invest alot of money into technology and store maintenance, but now it's embarrassing how run-down they've allowed their stores to become. They have developed an attitude that the customers are a nuisance and need to be shuffled through as fast as possible. If a patient needs a little extra attention then they just need to go. We are no longer encouraged to be problem-solvers. Management is no longer made up of healthcare professionals so the needs of the patients are not appreciated, understood, or considered important. The only thing that matters is meeting those metrics. It's very sad that a once great company has fallen like this. They no longer care about being the best. They eliminate the competition by buying them out. They place such demands on they pharmacy teams that it has become a dangerous place to fill prescriptions."
bad,"The company doesn’t really have an understanding of what it’s like to work at the store level. They roll out these ideas for the pharmacy to do, but don’t give an adequate budget to support the amount of work that is to be done. Work more with less is the motto. Most if not all full time employees can not get 40 hours a week. Most are between 34 and 38 hours a week. There is a lot that’s wrong with the company."
bad,"Hours were kept at a bare minimum of 12 hours a week. Poor and rude management. Overloaded employees, too much for one person. Advancement opportunities were only available if management liked the employee. Lots of favoritism."
bad,"Over worked. "
bad,"Management was terrible, they never listened to their workers, the store was falling apart, understaffed, under paid for the amount of work they expect you to do. The only plus are your coworkers, they help you get through a shift and you meet some pretty wonderful people."
bad,Minimal support staff scheduled for help in pharmacy and front store due to lack of profits. Pharmacy staff expected to meet company metrics and provide excellent customer service with bare-bone support .
bad,"A company managed by whites with blacks doing most of the real work"
bad,"Promotes work/home balance but, once hired that is not the case. Sometimes you work 7-8 days straight with 1 day off then it's back to work. Also, open on Christmas day and you only get 1 major holiday off and they include new years eve and day as major holidays. They cut hours in the pharmacy and front end so there is never enough people to work and get things done. Shift leads, assistant managers, pharmacy managers do not get breaks, managers point fingers for blame, most managers do not stand up for associates when they are following a rule ( ex: my manager set only 4 products per household per day on sale items. Had a lady get mad when I told her she could not buy the entire shelf of product. My manager apologized to her in front of me and let her do it anyway leaving me looking like a fool to the customer. Or one time a lady's 20% coupon was expired. I told her we could not take it bc it was expired. He called her the next day apologized for my ""decision"" and gave her a $20.00 walgreens gift card.) They are so concerned with reviews and receipt surveys they go against rules. Wishy washy management in all 3 stores I have worked in. I would not recommend walgreens to my worst enemy as employment."
bad,"Constantly telling you to do more with less help. Goals are adjusted near the end of the third quarter, so they don't have to pay bonuses. I would suggest not using a retail pharmacy, they are all overworked and underpaid. Pharmacist are doing the entire process, so there's no one to check for accuracy."
bad,"Managers are unprofessional , some of them are racist , did not feel comfortable working there at this location . scheduling was terrible never posted on time always changing last minute . would highly NOT recommend this location to anyone . resigned happily"
bad,"Staffing exodus led to new management.  A constant revolving door led qualified customer service associates to be pressured into working in the pharmacy (the real focus) while the front is left with elderly, underage, or pariahs to hold a store together.  Promotion of leadership from without leads to leaders clueless about the company and their jobs as a whole."
bad,"Management is passive aggressive and does not give employees the time of day, unhealthy environment towards mental health, pay isn’t worth all the responsibilities, way too stressful, customers are extremely rude"
bad,"The laziest people are protected by management. If you show any initiative to work you get taken advantage of and are a bad person when you question how not everyone is treated the same. "
bad,Walgreens was a great place to work in the past as far as salary matching work. They are currently not forward thinking. They want you to have a degree for the assistant manager trainee program pay is low. They drive employee “engagement and development”  to cover for the lack of pay based on duties assigned. The work load for employees whom start at minimum wage is ridiculous. Very few hours to give in comparison to work load. Makes it hard to lead and manage. Employees see that this company is trying to get the max work out of them for minimum pay
bad,"The remote stores need to be visited by the DM's more frequently without notice. Management acts differently when they know someone is coming.  They need to get a grip on bullying & retaliation from upper management. Especially if they are singling out team members."
bad,"The managers and district  managers could care less about the functionality of the stores. Most stores are under staffed. The shift leads and ASM's have to fill in for cashiers and stock people all  the time. There is high external thieft and corporate refuses to supply security.This company is constantly buying other pharmacy chains, yet will not fix the problems of their current stores."
bad,"I worked for Walgreens for about a year, I don’t know how I lasted that long, they schedule you for 10+ hours a day and only give you a 30 min break and 15 min breaks aren’t allowed, you’re not allowed to sit down, it’s okay for customers to swear at you, very bad environment, you have to do 20 things in a minute, very stressful, pharmacists want the technician to do everything and they get crabby when it gets busy"
bad,I worked as a Pharmacist for Walgreens both in New Mexico and Texas and each location had the worst Pharmacy Managers in my entire Work experience ever! Their female managers acted like black witches beating down their technicians into low self esteem and despair as well as forcing their Pharmacists to put up with all of their tantrums and
bad,"In 2011,was an AWESOME PLACE TO WORK!Fair wages,flexible hours,excellent benefits.Now promotions in management R based solely on the EOE. UNDESERVED!!"
bad,"Seriously, just don't do it. Between store leadership, customers, and corporate, you're lied to more than... i don't even have a good analogy for it. The fact is, they don't even need to. it just makes your job harder when they do. Policies for store employees are bordering on criminal to the point of legal contracts that let them fire you for anything more than complaining about it and me ,legally, from going into detail about how evil they are."
bad,"I am very sad to see the direction Walgreens has taken. They do not value their customers or employees. During meetings with senior management, I would often hear them refer to our customers in very demeaning ways. As far as they are concerned the employees are all disposable. They do not want long-term employees. Their opinion is that someone else can be hired cheaper. Your experience is not valued. They are actively trying to force out anyone over the age of 35 (especially pharmacists)."
bad,"Pharmacist reimbursement rates are at catastrophic lows and the corporation does not fight for its pharmacists or technicians. Hours are always being cut, creating dangerous working environments for our patients. The company pushes dumb metrics that are always unattainable all while cutting hours and not giving enough help to get the work done."
bad,"Most of management (from the overall store manager to the pharmacy manager) are truly lacking. They enjoy playing favorites and if you’re not one of them you’re treated as if you don’t exist or matter. It makes for a poor work environment when you don’t truly feel apart of the team although they stress so much on teamwork. Always a group of coworkers divided by and worried about petty drama instead of coming together to get the job done. It was definitely like attending high school most of the time where you have your teachers pets and mean girls!"
bad,"10 years there, and after 8, was injured on the job, and had doctors orders for light duty. The wanna be managers (known as shift leads) didn't adhere to my doctors orders, and have had neck and back problems ever since. After awhile, my performance wasn't what it once was, because of the injury, so they found things, after being a dedicated, decorated, employee, to get me terminated.. Worst place to work."
bad,"Does not follow their own policy, tell you one thing do another, overwork you as far as task and other employees never have to but you was expected to do it"
bad,"Really did not like working for Walgreens. Workload and expectations are very high. Customer service representative must be able to multitask. Management expects you to cashier sometimes working multiple desks, stock, and answer phone all at the same time and if long lines at the register keep you from a mountain of boxes prepare to be reprimanded. Don't forget opening and closing duties as well."
bad,I worked for Walgreens for almost 2 years. I was hired full time. On my 1 year anniversary i was called into office congratulated one being with company a year and they looked forward to more years with me. Then i was told there was budget cuts and i needed to find a new store that had hours for me or i didn't have a job. I transferred vut tgen had a long drive. My new store fired me because i carded people for tobacco and the Same date showed up twice. People do have same birthday or make more then one purchase. Ots funny because the managers dont card people which is policy. They dont follow any polices but i got fired for following them. They also let manager's work in pharmacy with out red card
bad,Lack of management always trying to write you up for stuff you didn't do HR is on their side not your side which its Human Resources it's supposed to be for you just a horrible place to work a mandatory days that you have to work and only give you one day off not all the time but it happens not a healthy place to work
bad,"Pharmacy manager is very arrogant and does not care about his pharmacy technicians that goes over and beyond. When voicing your concerns he doesn't try to change the situation. He doesn't care about the weekend technician hours that work mid-shift from 10- 8. He doesn't rotate the hours, I worked that shift for 2 years and a new person come along and he gives her the morning shift"
bad,The manager doesn’t do his job he sits in his office till it’s time for him to go. No one else does there job either people come into work and clock in and sit and talk in the back for 30 minutes and have to be called upfront to actually work and supervisors Don’t even care. Everyone is a little “family” so no one is strict on anyone except the new people cause you’re not in their group. Supervisors have favorites. Only good thing about working here was that the pay was decent but you had to do a lot of extra stuff . Don’t work here. I could only tolerate it for a couple months
bad,"Was hired to be pharmacy manager but then middle level managers ""reassigned "" and store manager and only pharmacist put their heads together and and made me staff pharmacist and kept putting me on unattainable pips"
bad,"I feel that I was deceived about my role at Walgreens from the beginning.  First, the guy who did my initial technical questions, forgot to tell me that there was a compatibility issue with Spectrum and I3 soft phone they use.  So now every day, I struggle with I3 issues. My supervisor is not a technical person at all. Her advise is unplug the dial pad and restart everything. This does not resolve much if anything.  I cannot switch Internet providers.  I've been asked if Spectrum is ViOP and the answer is NO!  It's digital phone line, like every other provider out there. As I said, these are not technical people.  Even their helpdesk is only able to put in a ticket for software issues. Their helpdesk is mainly there for hardware - if our thin client, keyboard, mouse, or dial pad has issues.  "
bad,The manager that was there was only focused on helping one certain individual to succeed. The one person had positions held for them when there were other associates who were more competent. There were several associates who quit due to the management. Reports were made by several associates but the dm and management covered it up
bad,From day one the store is always a total mess. Employees don’t care and why should they if they aren’t getting any hours or paid enough to care. Same with management. Management is always clashing heads with other managers and end up doing more harm in the store than others. Not to mention higher up management like district managers and whatnot. With the constant hours getting cut to the consistent hiring of under experienced management it’s all a huge mess
bad,"Due to financial constraints, Walgreens has a minimal staffing budget, which leads to the store being poorly staffed. High turnover and low pay has lead to an inconsistent culture that's reflected in all areas of the organization."
bad,The job is not terribly hard with restocking or helping out customers. The real issue is who your co-workers might be. The shift leads did what they could to help however the Store managers were always terrible.
bad,They will definitely promise you one thing and then they switch up on and go back on everything they say and are willing to promote people that don’t know as much as you do when it comes to Instore knowledge and no one communicates at all.
bad,"never work at Walgreens. there is no future there. management is terrible. work schedules are very biased, lots of confusion. no real training, yet you are expected to know what, how and when."
bad,"I am sure some Walgreens are better than others but the one I worked at in Tulsa at 71st and Lewis was ridiculous.  Zero advancement opportunities, management rarely got out of their ivory palace to help, and the assistant managers lacked any type of business acumen or educational background that would remotely qualify them.  The store manager was actually a good guy.  dothink"
bad,Easy work once you've figured out what is expected of you.  Management offered little assistance with training. Management also picks favorites and treats employees very unfairly.  Supervisor treated me with extreme disrespect and made me do other's assigned duties while allowing favorite employees to have unlimited breaks on the clock and talk on their phones constantly. No support from management at all. No room for advancement.
bad,One day everything changed because of some changes in ownership of the company. The way we ran the store changed which had a negative affect on the customers and employees.
bad,No longer care about their employees.  I made twice the salary of new management.  Was told I was a legacy manager and company was looking to get rid of long term managers.  Current company I work for praises long term managers and sees their value.  Used to be part of community supporting local non-profit events but no longer care.  Its all about the money.
bad,"The pharmacy in which I worked was a toxic work environment.  Pharmacists were often rude to techs  and pushed off customers as quickly as possible since it was so busy.  The big wigs in corporate refused to allow our manager to hire more staff.  Extremely high stress all of the time because workload wasn't manageable.  Everyone working there was miserable.  Managment was either non existant, or consisted of you getting berated publicly in front of customers and coworkers.  Concerns and new ideas were pushed off by management.  No time to take bathroom breaks except on your lunch/dinner break, which could be 8 hours into a 10 hour shift.  Computer based training provided for pharmacy software and medication information, but beyond that and being shown how to use the register, it's all learn as you go.  You're on your own - everyone else is running around like chickens with their heads cut off and literally doesn't have time to help you or train you.  I didn't feel comfortable being so rushed with prescriptions, and witnessed many errors made due to insufficient staffing.  Schedule would be released a day before the week started, giving you no time you plan your week.  Customers were very rude and even abusive at times - however, seeing what they consistently had to deal with, it wasn't surprising.  I've worked at many other companies in my life, and this was by far my worst experience ever."
bad,"The department I work in is called, “Save a trip refill”. I COLD CALL patients, some whom have not used Walgreens in years, to enroll them into a program that, really is no different than the auto refill program. If the patients do answer, more than half will decline your offer, most will straight up hang up on you, some will curse you out accusing you of scamming them OR the select few may enroll. Per Management, there are no “quotas” however, you have a weekly performance evaluation and every week they make you listen to calls you made to “critic” you, which is fine, however, When supervisors and management don’t know their own S.O.P’s and mark you wrong when you were correct OR mark you wrong for something you did weeks ago, even after the S.O.P’s changed, that’s a issue. You are pressured into “Getting enrollments.” You are required to have so many calls go through, even if the patient hangs up, it’s still your fault. If the patient very politely declines your offer for the free program, you are required to offer a rebuttal. Personally, It’s a awful feeling having to back someone into a corner. I was making 700-900 calls a week (5 days, 8/ 1/2 hour days) and it still was not good enough. Some employees falsely sign patients up just to hit their numbers so they won’t lose their job. That tends to back fire when we call to confirm the patients medication pick up date and they become irate. The job should not be this stressful. However, management makes it that way. Supervisors get attitudes if you question anything that doesn’t make sense. Two weeks my system was not working"
bad,11 years with Walgreens and the mission has changed from that of being a pillar in the community to that of take everything from the community you can.  The past 3 years have been miserable
bad,"If you are into a sad and bleak work environment, then this is for you. I am sure that some Walgreens locations are okay, but the one I worked at was just the worst."
bad,"Everyday was a cycle of standing on your feet for 7 hours, checking people out and then doing it all over again. They play the same three songs over and over. It was a living nightmare, especially around xmas time."
bad,"This company was one way when I first started there; now with this new company from Europe taking over it's another. Management isn't responsible and doesn't help on floor like they should. Their encouraged not to help with floor work. Depends store to store on what you may experience, but know on a whole this isn't the greatest place to work. They need way more security in their store's with the amount of theft that's going on. They as to much of the shift leads and regular employees most of the time. This just isn't the greatest place to work now."
bad,"Do not recommend. The management is a joke and they treat you like garbage and get away with it. If you are looking for a job with morning shift available this is not for you, people who have been there the longest get in the morning shift and newer people are pushed to nightside which is also the busiest time of the day but there are no workers there because hire up management leaves early and they don’t schedule very many people at night. Pay is alright but not worth it for how you are treated. Tons of drama and lots of talking behind peoples back especially by management. Pharmacy is always hire up on the totem pole and by that I mean they get better pay and treated better and also have most of the major holidays off . They are by no means flexible with hours if they don’t have them expect to be cut especially in the summer season. Put in many availability changes and not a single one of them was listened to and if you ask for a day off it’s most likely you won’t get it. In the winter season you are opened later and when there is an emergency travel only in progress they will not let you get home early or close early so you can get home safely. You can get pto after 6 months of working there which starts at 30 hours and you can’t have anything over 40"
bad,Low pay and not many hours. Need to hire more people. They expect too much for one person to do in a 5 or less hours shift. The pharmacy needs more help too. The company needs to stop being tight and pay better and give more in raises 15 or 25 cents is not a raise that's a slap in the face!
bad,"All management staff is extremely bias and if you don't fit into their click,  they will find a way to get rid of you. In the year I worked there, I saw a very high turnover. Terrible, terrible place to work. I would never ever recommend this place for employment. We won't even shop there ever again either."
bad,"As a 5 year loyal employee, the company has done nothing but continue to cut hour, take away help, take away benefits, and continues to make the job more difficult with less help. Absolute terrible place to work."
bad,"Overall Walgreen's may not be that bad of a company to work for, but my particular district had terrible management and they just do not care about the employee."
bad,The customers aren't exactly always the friendliest bunch (most are very elderly and sick). The management can be hit or miss in my experience. Sometimes you get lucky and have great manger other times  you get shafted by a manager that doesn't do anything.
bad,I was originally supposed to work one day a week as I’m in school however the manager kept scheduling me to work almost every day and when I told him that I wouldn’t be able to work some days he threatened to fire me.
bad,I quit working at Walgreens yesterday. I felt increasingly unsafe there every day. The dregs of society were allowed to run around the store like animals and we were powerless to do anything to control them. Our manager was a clueless idiot. It is an absolutely soul sucking place to work and I strongly urge anyone not to apply there for a job. You will regret it.
bad,hardest part of this job was been understaffed and overworked. The uncertain schedules not good for a person with children. good things were they were closed on most holidays and they offered classes for you become nationally certified. if sick or family member was sick it was still considered inexcusable no matter the circumstances
bad,"The Management was great, The corporate idiots kept changing policies on us. One week we do this, next week we cant do this, we have to do that. It was VERY annoying. Bg caters to college kids, that is very annoying as well. However,.. The store manager is amazing! He went out of his way to help me, and so did the District manager, She was extremely friendly. The 1st shift manger was really down to earth, if you had any questions he would definitely explain in detail what to do, he was there for 12 years."
bad,I would never work for this company again.  They pay managers for 40 hours a week.  You were told you need to work the hours needed.  Most weeks that was 50 or more
bad,Too busy to feel you have the safety of your patients under control. Always afraid of losing my pharmacy license from overwork due to understaffing. Good benefits but not worth the safety risk.
bad,"This company is all about the pitch. They make sure everything sounds wonderful but in reality , you arent given the tools you need to do your jobs properly. The stores are understaffed and the shift leads are a bunch of do nothings that pass the buck off on the associates. The pharmacy techs are over worked and the pharmacists get all the compensation. we're promised 2 fifteen minute breaks and a half hour lunch by the company but expected not to take the breaks at all by store leadership. District management is a joke."
bad,"Poor Management: Able to yell at you and belittle you, even in front of customers."
bad,"I am a current employee, planning on leaving. Been here 3 1/2 years. Never moved up in the company, barely cross trained in other departments, and people who started AFTER me have been fully cross trained and promoted. You would think seniority would apply to this company. WRONG. I'm still stuck in the same place as I was when I started, despite talking to management about my issues."
bad,"It isn't anything special it is retail, you take care of your customers as well as the store. Rain or shine they never close, never change their hours on holidays either. I do not feel they care about their employees, they only care about the corporation."
bad,"Very hostile work environment "
bad,"When I worked there they were in process of finding a new GM. In the mean time the assistant manager was in charge along with other supervisors. Uhm this place was awful. They will take advantage of you if you let them. I'm talking about shift assignments, like I was supposed to be a stocker some days and others I was cashier. Every day you come in there is a sheet you read to see your assigned position for the day, check it off and go to your station. Most of the time, while there was no GM, I was told that I would have to cashier instead of whatever station I was assigned to. It was only when a certain girl with wild colored hair cut super short and overweight would complain and say she wasn't feeling well. So her best friend, which was the closing supervisor, would tell me to switch. So me being nice and understanding would say yes without hesitation. It was until I realized one day she was faking, once I passed by her and she was laughing and having the time of her life despite saying she was nauseous and couldn't cashier. Anyways, this store sucks, the management sucks, there was only 2 co-workers that were actually honest and nice to me, the location sucks crazy people come in all the time, it's super hot and humid by the doorway during the summer's when you cashier, mosquitos everywhere, and it sucks."
bad,Not a great place to work. Never much opportunity for job advancement and they do in fact hire from outside the company. Could just be the store that I worked at
bad,"I found there was an opportunity to work for this company I thought it was the best opportunity for me. I was hired as a ASMT. This title includes training in their LEAP program. The first 4 months of working at my first store, the team there were not trainers and they would not teach you anything. They just show me things to get by. I was transferred to another store by the summer. Working at this store for about 3 months, I had a better chance in learning. I worked more closely with this store manager and was given better training. Things were good until the District decided to move me again. Moving is what they think is best for you but it isn't. Moving from store to store doesn't increase your knowledge because every store operations differently. The time you spend at one store increases your knowledge. I moved 3 more times and finally ended up at my current store. I have been in 8 stores over 1 year. Almost every store manager is unpleasant. The 5 months at my current store was where I improved myself the most. The lack of company support for the front end staff drove me. I never got a lunch break, had to work long work hours because of work demand, I was not allowed to get overtime even though you can not get a break and the lack of constant training. You are required to take ppl's that hold you liable for anything you do wrong. They always double work you on task. The way the district manager, store manager and regional manager would talk about people is awful. Pharmacy is their bread and butter, yet retail is not their concern. They would say, the front door is a revolving"
bad,"if you dont have sick days they will fired you the company doesnt care about their employ or famliy ,Dont promte from with in the company the would hire an outside the company"
bad,"Awful work environment, very stressful and very low pay. Benefits are terrible. Corporate likes to cut staff and increase expectations and demands which only increases the chances for errors but management does not care."
bad,"I worked for Walgreens in Bryson City for a total of 3 days. I am an experienced Pharmacy Technician with an associate's degree in pharmaceutical science. Going into the position I was told that I would have adequate training and I would be shadowing someone for my first week. Walgreen's has a terrible computer system and it was very difficult to navigate. I was used to working with Connexus at Walmart, so I desperately needed time to learn Walgreens' system. Instead on my first day I had to learn the system on my own without ANY guidance. I worked both the drive-thru and the front register on my own without guidance or training. Customers were very angry at me and I received no help unless I begged. This particular pharmacy is grossly understaffed. I was hired for a mere $11 and hour WITH A DEGREE. They wanted me to work full-time hours but retain part-time status so as to prevent me from gaining full benefits (average national pay for a pharmacy technician is $15 to $16/hr). On top of all of this - on my second day I asked if I could go on lunch and I inquired about breaks. The lead tech looked at me, smirked, and said that we are not allotted any lunch breaks, even when working 8+ hours per day! She said if I wanted to eat, I could eat while working in the pharmacy... I guess sandwich in one hand, counting pills in another...? That has to be against OSHA/State regulation and guidelines. North Carolina has state law dictates that anyone who works up to 6 hours must be awarded a 30 minute lunch; anything over 8 hours awards an hour lunch. Full time hours also awards (2) 15"
bad,"My experience w/Walgreens has made me physically I'll because of the constant stress induced by mgmt.  The have unrealistic expectations for their SFL's.  We are glorified stockers, truck unloaders as well as baby sitters to the front end. Example, on Saturday's I arrive at 2pm.  I do my regular duties until 6:30, at which time I have to take down ad tags.  Then I have to close drawers.  Done with that and at 7:30 pm I finally get to start putting up ad tags.  I work on those for 1-1/2 hours before I have to stop to face and do the rest of my job duties.  Now mind you, there are hundreds of ad tags you have to put up, so of course I never get them all done and always get in trouble for it.  This is done w/ myself, one cashier and one photo person. We also in that time also need to make sure store is faced, duplicates filled, sweeping, mopping, and go backs.  It's the most stress I have ever insured.  I am currently looking for another job.  I have never been so miserable in a job.  They pay real well, but I'd gladly take a less paying job than endure anymore from this place.  It is just pure stress from the time you walk in until the time you leave."
bad,"The typical day at work for my location is as follows: Clock in early because that's what the managers/shift leads want. Cover any breaks for the cashier or relieve them so they can go home. Deal with ridiculous customers and long lines that no one can cover. Wait to see if the person you're covering the register for shows back up. Maybe get a break if lucky. Either stock the shelves, do counts, or get stuck in the photo department for the rest of the shift. Leave several minutes late because no one came on time to relieve you. Repeat."
bad,There’s no room for advancement and very sporadic scheduling. It’s your basic retail pharmacy job but it helps you learn how to work in a very stressful environment
bad,"I worked there for 6 years and could not wait to expand . They do not treat everyone with respect and professionalism. We are not a team there.  The managers have their favorites and certain people have certain rules . You get written up if you do something wrong,(which I didn’t do because it wasn’t fair), while others do it and it’s ok.  I want teamwork, respect and professionalism. I give it and expect it I am a happy person and I never leave a job until my work is completely done and I am a fast leaner.  I always have my notebook ready. Please just give me a chance not like Walgreens. I am a human and we do make mistakes.   Thank you"
bad,"This job was only a start up to further my career, nothing really special about this place. Like any other company more concern about the numbers....."
bad,"New management is not vested in the employees. They are however very vested in their shareholders interest. "
bad,"This company always wanted more work with less help. Pharmacists are penalized for not keeping up with ""Goals"", but want more. Answer the phone, verify scripts, give immunizations, counsel patients."
bad,"This was an second job to make ends meet. Had 20+ years of customer service experience, but was only making minimum wage. Even after 3 years had never received a raise. Managers in the evening would spend hours in the cash up room reading magazines or playing on their phones, that is when they weren't pulled to help in the pharmacy. The store was always short staffed. Many evenings on tag day, which is Saturday, it was just the cashier & manager. Then the manager would stay in pharmacy & it was hard to get them to help the cashier when they needed help. When certain management would give instructions it was like I hadn't been doing this job for the last 3 years. When other people screwed things up I got blamed & got talked to even though I wasn't even working that day. And even after management would tell me what not to do, when someone else messed it up I got the lecture again."
bad,"they don't give stores enough budget to distribute to all team members. team members that use to get 40 hours per week are now down to 24 hours (3 days) a week. which leaves one team member doing the job of 3 team members and on top of that, get chewed out for not completing tasks."
bad,"There is no support from corporate and the expectations are unrealistic for the the staff to accomplish. Constantly changing schedule and the benefits are the same if you got them outside of the company. Do more with less is the culture. The company's values are not consistant with there actions. Raises are performance based, however it is impossible to get above minimum wage without getting a promotion, and the wages are less than industry's standards."
bad,"Manager doesn’t care, not enough hours needed each week, very few managers would listen when a problem occurred, short staffed working the evening shift which means things that need to get done don’t get done."
bad,The customers drive me absolutely nuts. They are whiny and rude. I’m so stressed out by this job. My fiancé just died and no one cares. The managers are pathetic. My co workers are inept.
bad,"Lack of well-trained management and HR is not very helpful. Family relations everywhere. All about family, but not always in a good way. Guys act like they've never seen a female in their life. Good luck !"
bad,"I worked there for 4 years, starting out as a photo tech specialist and cashier.  When the company moved to dry (non chemical) labs they eliminated the department manager position (for which I was up for promotion). I lived within 5 minutes of the store and whenever they were short handed they would call me in on my day off/vacation time, etc. and then turn around and cut the overtime.   They would also cut hours storewide and then rely on a short staff to pick up the slack, hurting the overall customer service experience."
bad,"I have been the company for two years now and have still never been fully trained. I just found out that any raise I may receive will take at least 5 months before it goes into affect! The phones, Computers, and Registers always go out when there's rain and the operating system is very slow and always ""times out"" and kicks u out of your session forcing you to take 5 minutes to log back in, even if you're in the middle of working. WORST PLACE EVER!"
bad,"Only work here if you are desperate. I worked for a year and a half and never received a raise or any of the benefits I was promised. The management was okay and mostly understanding of my disabilities, but also did not stand up for us to corporate or customers and occasionally would make bigoted jokes."
bad,"Basically I felt that I work for and with good people at store level, but beyond that the company didn't seem to care much at all for employees needs."
bad,a LEAD is basically to unload trucks and other horrible jobs.. Turn over is horrible. 1 cashier with 7 people in line. The Lead position pay is horrible. I highly recommend you do not go to this company. The pay is way too cheap!
bad,"worked there for 1 year, every single day I couldn't wait to get out. Very stressful, no one likes being there. NOt recommended. "
bad,"I was told management was possible if I proved myself worthy of working hard enough but it was a lie they only wanted to fill there vacant overnight position and the manager in charge of me had no manager training what so ever thus I was never able to be trained to there ""standard"" and was yelled at on a bi weekly basis by the store manager since I didn't meet his standard by a lack of proper training/guidance."
bad,"Poor management. You can never get a day off. Overworked, underpaid, under staffed and it just sucks here. Nothing enjoyable about working here. Makes you enjoy nothing."
bad,"The company is going down from when started. Less and costly benefits in ratio to pay. Little advancement in the company. The training is almost non-extant. The less you do the more promotable you become. Walgreens as a work place has little standards on how work is to be executed it depends on the management on duty, must know who is responsible person in charge to know what is expected for that day. Harassment of employees tolerated.Bias toward older employees."
bad,"Horrible place, crosby ave  ride/Walgreens pharmacy racist, they dont trust you, if you're not part of the clique you are doomed, very bad experience."
bad,"My review of Walgreens is that you are not recognized for a job well done.  Instead you are singled out if you do something wrong.  I was passed over for promotion opportunities many times for reasons that are unknown.    There were only a few jobs that I didn't know how to do (ie store manager, shift lead, pharmacy tech).  However, I was able to use my common sense and answer a shift lead's inquiry.  The pay was not suitable for the cost of living in this community.  My hours fluctuated from week to week.  Was not able to budget due to this."
bad,"This was a very stressful job. Everyday we had a meeting to discuss the items we were supposed to push for an extra few cents on our paychecks, then told to get a certain number or it looks bad for us. I think this was to promote a team spirit, but at minimum wage, it comes out being a more do this, do that, yay team moment. You can earn sodas for free if you earn a positive review or someone in management thinks you found a way to do enough to deserve it."
bad,"no loyalty, new owners make it a very difficult place to work . you never know what to expect every day and every boss( District manager and higher) hates his or her job. So that demoralizes the work staff."
bad,Walgreens is not a place I would recommend to anyone. Unless I hated them. Then I would say it's the best place in the world.It does have air conditioning though. So there is that.
bad,It’s a horrible work environment and horrible employees. The only plus side is excellent benefits. The amount of work and hours you do is not worth the pay . They take advantage of the employees
bad,I worked for Walgreen's for 12 years.  The company has opted to do away with full time employees and take away all of our benefits.  They care nothing about the workers who have dedicated themselves to their stores.  They have cut hours forcing the employees who do work not to get breaks or assistance on the sales floor. The company no longer cares about the customer. Walgreen's believes convenience will keep the customers returning.  Once a wonderful place to work not so anymore. They are forcing out the senior employees cutting hours and giving those hours to the younger employees who earn less.
bad,"The store was very busy . The staff had been leaving slowly over the last year or so and the newer people were just not trained properly. They were given the time to learn but never really seemed to pick it up, so the workload fell on everyone else"
bad,"Working hard is not enough since Boots Alliance took over the company. A saturated market with too many pharmacy schools has reduced our value. Management has made it clear that we are easily replaceable with a line of new graduates wrapped around the building. These graduates find themselves unable to get a full time position with the new Walgreens. "
bad,"Days where they expect you to work a 9 hour shift until 12am, and come into work for ANOTHER 9 hour shift 7am that same morning. Managers were nice, but very strict. Coupon system was impossible to understand as well as the points system. Dont work here unless you hate yourself"
bad,"If you can get in on nepotism than this place is for you. You can be untouchable by HR, and regular TM’s  Walgreens management team does not recognize good hard working people. They recognize anyone who is will to throw people under the buss at their discretion."
bad,It sucks here... Manegment is horrible i dont know the feeling that they have to go early and go back to work i really don't like this job the pay is Ridiculous
bad,I worked there for a year was promised promotion after promotion didnt get them. it was a way for them to hold my position over my head and continue me to keep working as hard as i was. i felt like i worked in highschool there is way too much drama and too many favorites. it nots worth the hard work and little pay.
bad,But then there are others that have no business working with the public. I saw some exceedingly sneaky and unsavory acts go on there and have seen an entire store’s management team be as shady as I’ve ever witnessed in a job but there were other managers that taught you a lot and really lead by example and that was nice to see. Walgreens Corporate could careless for you though and will pay you accordingly. Lowest paying company in almost every position.
bad,A lot of things to learn everything fast pace management needs work on working together as a team and communication time management is definitely needed
bad,"When Walgreens started a different forcus. For teams members there was a lot of cuts in budget, made work difficult to keep up with our daily task and meet all of our metrics."
bad,In two years I lost four directors that quit do to the working conditions and unreasonable demands.  Most of the time we are threatened about losing our jobs for not meeting numbers then told to just do the best we can.
bad,"I like to keep my opinion to myself. The company 9 years ago was better. Discrimination was high, it was like high school, if you fit in the group, great, and if you do not, you are in the black list."
bad,They do not allow employees to get overtime and they want a lot from you for very low wages. They fire you if you get 40 hours per week it just does not make any sense to me.
bad,The hours are retail hours and the company does not close for the holidays. The compensation is the lowest pay rate in the state of Georgia and not in alignment with the required level of work.
bad,"Several problems with this company, including: extremely busy with low staff hours, disengaged management, very low team morale, non-pharmacy personnel dictating pharmacists duties with very little knowledge of pharmacy practice laws. Management does not care about employees. The emphasis is on customer pacification and the almighty dollar. Work culture frequently demonstrates employees being thrown under the bus. Waste is excruciatingly high due to unnecessary emphasis on ""customer satisfaction"".  Quotas are demanded, with constant threat of job termination. The ""me"" mentality that management encompasses makes working a nightmare. There are exceptions to this, but overall stay away from this company if at all possible. You will not be treated like respected employee. You will quickly learn that you are a tiny replaceable cog in the machine that is Walgreens. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. Beware."
bad,"Doing everything the pharmacist does and more but till getting paid pennies."
bad,Started off a great place. Horrible raises must have friends in high places to advance. It's like being in high school. Don't complain they  don't care nor listen.
bad,Working at Walgreens has become a real nightmare. Management don’t care about their employees. They only want you to work more and more with less help. Metrics are impossible to reach since its been increase every year and you have no time to focus on everything they want you to. Their expectations are extremely high while the help is extremely low. Employees are scared to talk because they don’t want to loose the job. ALL my co workers feel the same way but are terrified to talk since we all know you can be fired. It’s really sad because the company wasn’t like this many years ago.
bad,"Moving along within the company takes years and your bonus is $1.50. this job is not a career, it's a job you get while you're in high school. They take advantage of your gender and age, and as a 19 year old well built man I was stuck with dirty, heavy jobs no one else wants to do. Sexism is a large role as well in what the will assign you to do"
bad,"Store management does not work with people who have children or elderly parents they are taking care of. If you need a specific day it is not given to you for whatever reason. I was in the cosmetic department and constantly hounded over sales and getting make overs even though i was number one in district but no less than 3rd. I was doing up to 4 makeovers a day or more but that was never good enough. The store manager kept telling me customers were complaining but corporate said i had nothing but great surveys, no complaints. I'm hearing impaired and the store manager kept telling me i was using this as an excuse to be rude and ignore him. Getting your breaks is a challenge as well. I did enjoy working with my customers and most of my co-workers. The only drama involved was in management."
bad,"I like the company benefits, but what I do not like is that everything is by senor there is no opportunity for new people."
bad,"Its not bad, its okay. The team usually works together as a team. The only thing that would be annoying would be the customers. But its no that bad. Its okay."
bad,"Below-average pay...Corporate cares nothing about the ""small"" people working down in the retails stores. Constantly cutting hours from much needed areas, like pharmacy. Customers complain there isn't enough staff but...guess what, corporate doesn't care because they don't have to deal with the complaining customers directly. overall I HATED working there, but loved my co-workers."
bad,"It's in the hood, people hit on you, disrespect you and it isn't a beneficial job. The employees hit on you and when you file a complaint, nothing much happens."
bad,"This was my first ever job at 16 years old. I learned a lot over the 4 years I worked for Walgreens. I moved around a lot in the store as well. As a minor, I worked in Cosmetics which was great because I loved makeup and hair products. I would often be placed on the main register and the floor to do stocking. After I turned 18, I was able to be put into the Photo Lab which I loved a lot. Photo was very laid back and I loved developing pictures. I never got a raise for was able to move into a management position due to college commitments, but this job taught me a lot about retail and customer service."
bad,"Since Boots and Walgreens merged, corporate shows no care or appreciation for the store employees. No support from store personnel, nothing but new tasks required every day and admonishment about not being fast enough or capable of accomplishing dozens of tasks simultaneously. No loyalty, and no longer anything about the company to inspire loyalty. Bottom line, it's retail. Walgreens went from the best retail to work for, more like a family than a job,  to just like everybody else, where the employees are just cogs that can be replaced at the drop of a hat."
bad,Political environment with a lack of both recognition and accountability. The clientele in itself presents challenges as it is a beacon for drugs and crime combined with a lack of support and training.
bad,"It's like a rotation door for managers and workers. The management comes to work with two mindsets:  How can I get promoted, and how lazy can I be with out risking a raise or promotion. If the work environment doesn't get to you, the joke they call a paycheck will. Most hourly employees and lower management depend on the Bridge Card for survival. It's very sad. There is no reward for seniority, or loyalty, or for coming in early and staying late. Don't waste your time!"
bad,Worst  place to work management treatment was awful . Upper management does not seem to care.  Lower pay for new shift leads. Very much a who you.know place for advancement
bad,"There's a line in the drive-thru, a line half way down the aisle, a bunch on the counter to fill, they won't give you enough hours to hire enough people in order to help all the customers or fill all the prescriptions, the boss comes in & tells you that you need to do more flu shots, why didn't you flavor more prescriptions yesterday, but they want you to feel good about yourself! They want you to be engaged and feel good about what your co-workers are doing! YOU GO GIRL, YOU'VE GOT THIS!"
bad,Walgreen's stores vary depending on management. My experience was with a manager that couldn't care less about his employees. We were nothing but a face behind a register to him.
bad,"Walgreens puts patients and employees at risk especially in the Pharmacy due to the fact that they are understaffed and rushed to fill so many prescriptions in short amounts of time.  Its a timed thing instead of putting patient safety first.  Low pay, horrible DM.  Just an unsafe place, I would not get my prescriptions filled there. not because of the staff....but because of the pressure they are under to fill so many in such little time that I would be concerned of an inevitable mistake."
bad,great relationship with shift supervisors but overall management sucks and didn't care to like or help employees grow or become better. seems as though they would like you to be as miserable as them.
bad,"I'm not trying to talk bad about this company but the experience that I have had honestly isn't good. I wasn't trained properly to be a pharmacy tech and they weren't even paying me what I was promised. I had relocated from California to Chicago and the min wage is different. They were paying me California min wage, and since I was a tech not a cashier the pay is suppose to be higher as well. Mine was not though. "
bad,"The company needs to listen to employees feedback more. It has the potential to be a great place to work, there is just alot of unprofessional managers that like to discuss their employees to people from other stores."
bad,do not work in this place.  The work load was incredibly heavy with an incredibly high turn over rate.  Management was extremely slow in replacing staff. Plus the staff that were being hired were often untrained and unexperienced in the work.
bad,"It is very hard to move up in the company. budget cuts causing stress on the pharmacy department and expectation is still high to maintain verified by promise time, wait times."
bad,Having been with Walgreen's I have seen it go from a great and just place to work to a skeleton crew of a pharmacy expected to produce more than ever. It is truly dangerous to the patients and your licence to practice pharmacy
bad,Been with Walgreens for 17 years and every year this company gets even worst. I put a vacation day in and they still call me to come in. No one helps you. Just terrible company to work for.
bad,"rules changed weekly as did management. Lowest pay in industry in this area. Late hours with early morning, rude customers with no management backing. Catty coworkers."
bad,I tried to hang in there for 6 mo I still did not understand my job and was expected to reach unreachable production numbers.  Very stressful although there was training it was a joke and I sat at my desk everyday not knowing how to do my job efficiently.   I finally took a stress leave it was too much the most stressful job I have ever had.
bad,walgreens used to be good. now you have to bend over backwards to get a 50 cent raise. always cutting hours and wondering why we cant meet certain goals.
bad,"I worked for Walgreens for 11 yrs, started as Sfl and ended as Asst Mgr. I was treated like dirt and transferred several times despite excellent evaluations. The pay was good but not worth the stress of always having low store budgets, poor staffing in the front of stores and Pharmacy. Walgreens simply does not give enough budget hours to properly give the customer service they expect. The amount of task that must be done in a day to meet their KPIs is unrealistic to say the least. Very little support from corporate level accept when they come in to criticize or cut budgets. Very poor training for any new systems they continue to roll out for managers. Constant change over of employees and managers due to stress volume and unhappy employees .If you work hard and get good evaluations, you end up capped for pay which leaves no motivation. Would not recommend this company as a Asst Mgr for anyone. The hours were long and extensive with a poor schedule before they put all asst mgrs. on hourly from salary now they except you to do same work load in less hours."
bad,No proper training. No teamwork. Everyone is out for themselves. Many grey areas go missed on a daily basis. A majority of people there are lazy. Management does not keep to their word. Too many chiefs and not enough indians.
bad,"After 15 years of working for WAG, their policies became biased and completely random.  Watch your back no one else will!  Especially if your a seasoned veteran of the company, they'll find ways to fire you.  Incomprehensible training posters, maps and theories presented to you to follow in the hopes it'll help you do more work in less time.  It's not rocket science, but they've made it like it is ... Bitter? Yes.  I worked my butt off and was rewarded by getting kicked to the curb."
bad,"Es un trabajo limpio, estable, pero no tiene reconocimiento, muy bajos salarios, no estan presentes nunca el ambito personal, para walgreens primero la empresa, despues el empleado"
bad,I started out good at that job got bumped up a position but things started going on with my child at home which got me written up then i told them im getting surgery and they started treating me differently and finding ways to get rid of me finally they did by accusing me of stealing when i didnt mean to or remember leaving store with the item
bad,"The company views you as replaceable, they do not care about their employees. They do not have your back when it comes to problems with customers. They pay poorly and have poor employee relations. They want expect employees to do the work of 5 people by themselves. There are days that you dont get breaks."
bad,This job was incredibly stressful when handling sensitive information on faulty computer systems. A good number of patients I spoke with we're in critical need along with several accounts getting screwed up by the doctor or the doctor's secretary in the patient not getting the medications on time or sent to different walgreens.
bad,Do not believe anything anyone in upper management says.  Always get everything in writing.  Despite how much they assure you and how genuine it may be.  It surely is not.
bad,"25 years ago when I first started it was a good place to work. After a few years the management started to become more cutthroat and self-serving then the benefits started to disappear and health insurance, all insurance got to be worthless but forced myself to stay because I had put so many years in at this point. Walgreens DC decided to shut down and four hundred people lost their jobs because the DC was getting old. In a very good way  I was relieved but then realized no one wanted  to hire an older woman, should have left a long time ago!"
bad,"If you enjoy a job where you are doing minimal work for little pay, this job is for you. You spend the majority of your day at the cash register ringing and you also stock and front shelves as well. Its easy work, but very repetitive and boring after so long."
bad,"Working for Walgreens can be a great experience depending on who the management is and how well they run the store. Typically employees are underpaid, and the company has a HIGH turnover rate for employees because of this."
bad,"Management is one of the biggest failures of Walgreens, the so called benefits are far from benefits. Mainly a part time job and far from a career to grow in."
bad,Fast past stress full environment dealing with patients with chronic diseases. No opportunity for advancement especially if you have education. Management lacked professionalism.
bad,"I can only speak as a pharmacy technician. But If you're a father with young kids, you'll probably hardly have time to see them. Since they will make you close the store as many nights a week as they can, meanwhile the single mothers get off at 3 or 4pm. And Im left all alone with a stressed out pharmacist until 9:30, doing the work of three people. Totally sexist. They also will add a 6th day to your schedule with only days notice. And expect you to come in even if its supposed to be your day off. And if you complain, they view you as a trouble maker."
bad,Extremely stressful and overworked. short staffed literally every day. hired employees aren't the smartest making your job even harder. Company is downsizing and cutting hours left and right. This is literally a last resort company to work for now. 8 years ago it was a different story.
bad,"A typical day included having much more than is humanly possible to accomplish, babysitting and cleaning up after adult children, and  a nonstop apologizing procession for corporate mismanagement. "
bad,"All stores are very busy,  none are given enough tech help (support staff) and there is never time for a break or breath of fresh air.   Management only wants young people who want to get promoted."
bad,As a tech you work like a slave and do mostly everything. there was never any help while the pharmacy manager seems like he can not handle the job being there.The pay is awful. you are expected to get everything done on time with only one tech. no advancement in that position. full time is only 32 hours and the company cut back hours to the point i was getting 16 hrs a week.  But the old Pharmacy manager was fantastic and was really helpful and knew how to work the pharmacy. Too bad she got transferred.
bad,"Managers only care about  those who brown nose with them.  Long term employees who do most of the work and are more knowledge. able are disrespected and get no raises when you reach their ""cap "".Worked for over 35 years, the last 8 years without a raise."
bad,"I worked here for 2 years, I was the best that I could be and always willing to learn and improve my career, I worked the register, photo, cosmetics, stock and pharmacy. I enjoyed my job until we got new management and I went from 28+ hours a week to 12. I worked to hard to quit, treated unfairly and lied to.. if anywhere I wouldn't suggest try to make a career of it in mayfield, Ky. Great peers tho enjoyed working with them it's the store manager and Asst. manager that ""tried"" there best for me, so I quit. Really wanted to make a career, but then I realized I ain't gonna go know where and get nun with 12 hours a week!"
bad,the company likes to cut hours and increase workloads you get into trouble if you dont provide great customer service but often there are not enough workers in the store to do this and complete your other tasks they are inconsistent in their policies you could do something one day and not get into trouble do the same thing the next and they write you up
bad,Company only cares about making money. Employees don't matter. Extreme con: open all day Christmas Day. 7am to 10pm. Go figure. Hours are cut without notice.
bad,"I worked here 11 years and at first it was nice, but it got worse and worse each year. The workload is ridiculous for the pay. I absolutely loved most of my customers. I was awesome at what I did and had fun doing it most of the time. Management was horrible. They are not flexible."
bad,I wish they had training available for new people. Also more growth opportunities in this company. Pay is low compared to other places. Goals are never clear and always changing.
bad,"The problem was management. The higher you go up, the more cryptic and devious people are. People are good for covering for each other and the employees are forced to quit or conform. For a company that believes in equality and fairness, the manager just don't practice it. Oh and once your out, your out. District managers are usually buddy buddy with store managers and make sure you are not hired for another Walgreens!"
bad,Constant change in management. I had 4 managers in 2 years. They are always advertising my position and the management position as well. They don't promote people internally. They will hire someone externally for promotional opportunities. They allowed a hostile work environment and harassment from my manager with ignorant racist statements. High Turn Over Rate.
bad,"Unfortunately, Walgreens has gone down hill in the last ten years. I say it has gone down hill from an employee view. They continually expect you to run on the bare essentials. The customers you help can be pleasant, but are mostly hateful. Never in my life have I been more talked down to. You are yelled at on a daily basis by customers. This is customer service in most places, but add insurance, money and medications into the mix and I promise it is worse. Walgreens does not back their employees and allows/ rewards customers poor behavior and lack of respect towards all employees."
bad,"Walgreen's was a great place for me to get m foot in the door. They paid for my certification, uniforms, licensure, ect. However retail is retail and if you are worried about of health and peace of mind I wouldn't recommend staying long."
bad,"manager lied in the interview about advancement opportunity and full time hours."
bad,"Working in Walgreens is stressful, is impossible to gain time of unless you worked at least 10 years, environment extremely demanding (365 days open) ridiculous compensation etch etc"
bad,"Worked for Walgreens distribution  for almost 13 years. The first 10 years were not horribly bad, not great either then they sold out to another company they partnered with and every aspect of the company changed it felt like I worked for the devil. I've never seen so many unhappy faces in one place, and I've never seen so many people that's had to have surgery or gimped around from the repetitive work. Horrible management that had no idea what they where doing. Every morning I walked into the place made me want to puke. Found another job making the same amount and had to bounce was such a relief like getting a fat girl off your shoulders"
bad,"for the duties required for this postion, the pay did not compensate.Very stressful atomeshere. Some Pharmacy techs certified, while others were not."
bad,Management is so unorganized. We were given our schedule one day at a time. No one got raises at my store. We rotated through all new employees at a monthly rate. Terrible managers that let customers walk all over employees. Let customers treat employees however they wanted. Let customers that got caught stealing back into the store.
bad,Management was the worst of the worst on top of bad customer attitudes in the area. Was not worth the over a year of work I put into the company. Would not recommend if looking to move up unless applying to a bigger Walgreens.
bad,"I was literally told, ""If you can be a Walgreens Tech, you can work anywhere"". Understaffed, training less than adequate. Too much drama and lack of management professionalism."
bad,"I typically stood around for 8hrs not allowing to go anywhere in the store except for 2 certain isles. I learned how to print photos from the photo lab. Management had favorites and were hypocrites. The hardest part of the job was finding something to keep you busy. Half the time the work they gave you, you could finish within 20mins so you would have to drag it out. I really enjoyed doing the photo lab and making canvases."
bad,"Typical work day was stocking and standing at the counter. Checking customers out at the register, giving change. Cleaning."
bad,Started at Walgreens in 2003 as a service clerk and worked my way up to store manager.  The company was basically taken over by a european company and ever since then it sucks to work there.  Everyone is out for themselves.  Expectations are unreal
bad,"Started off with as a typical day at work, I really did not learn anything new other than their cashiers system. Management were not trustworthy. Nothing about the job was difficult and nothing was enjoyable. Co-workers were professional and nice but that's about it."
bad,"no respect for employees,when they run out of work they send people home even if the eight hours have not been worked. you only have two twenty minutes breaks and you are required to eat lunch during that time."
bad,"Walgreens is all bout its money. Over years they have cut jobs, hours but increase workload with over the top demands of certain greetings, rules and demands on sales. Day of work is full of stress and headaches."
bad,"The management is horrible. Once they do not like you, they will do anything they can to get rid of you. They allow good employees go due to their unprofessionalism."
bad,"The manager for this business is terrible and  unfortunately is destroying the ability of this business to survive.  "
bad,"I enjoyed this job although, it takes a little time to Adjest to the long work days. I seen myself at this job permanently until I noticed the difference in the way they treated their permanent workers, verses the way they treat them Temp To Hire Workers, I honestly motivated me to want to find another job, I'm not used to working as hard as a Permanet  worker and going unnoticed for my good work."
bad,"loyalty to the company does not seem matter. everyone i worked with was great, but it doesn't matter if the corporate supervisors are making judgment calls without really caring about your input."
bad,This company does not care about the feeling if there employers. They chose a few people they like and then they get treated totally different than the rest of us. The store manager is the laziest person I met she will sit in the office all day and then tell someone they aren't working hard enough.
bad,"Typical day at work is having your manager tell you what to do because he thinks you're too stupid to know."
bad,Managers are very unorganized and disrespectful. a typical day at work includes lots of customer service and assistance. stocking and also facing. Also a little cleaning. You really don't associate with your co workers only managers.
bad,"I enjoy the work I do, however pay rate is low for the volume of work.Turnover rate is very high. No Job Work/Life Balance."
bad,"Work life balance is terrible, advancement seems to be based totally off friendship and brown nosing."
bad,"This company was amazing when I first started!  The management cared about you and any problems that were going on within the store.  The company merged with another big company and everything went down hill.  The employees were treated terribly and and talked about.  "
bad,"I can not speak for all Walgreens, but the Walgreens location that I currently work at is not people friendly. The management ""team"" sucks and there is no team effort here!"
bad,"long hours, weekends and holidays are required. Quality of support staff has been lowered. Pharmacy is not the priority of the company. Experienced help is hard to find and keep. Only enjoyable part of the job are the regular customers."
bad,Everything is based on their profit which in business is expected but they don't value their employees to expect them to have family life and reasonable hours overtime is constant poor shift selections to work management is most the time lost poor decisions being made from upper management. The Mount Vernon DC has definitely lost personal care for all their employees morale is completely gone. All they care about is what more we can do for them as they take more and more from us vacations that we had earned from years ago are now gone they are now talking about removing all or holidays.
bad,"WBA is undergoing a deep transition into a new culture.  $1.5 billion must be cut by 2017 which includes human resource assets.  The technology requires updating both at corporate and at the retail stores/pharmacy.  The pharmacy technology architecture can no longer handle the daily demands of the high volume prescriptions.  Many business areas do not use advanced technology to monitor trending of potential issues, monitor finances across the organization, and communicate issues quickly to each other.  There are changes being implemented but changing a culture takes more than just learning new terms and buzz culture words.  Speaking the terms does not translate into a culture change.  It will likely be another 5 years before WBA becomes stable."
bad,Hard work with no reward. They favor a lot of people and it seems like it is impossible to grow with the company. I would never go back.
bad,"Poor management, no room for to grow. Plus: finally stopped having to say ""be well, how can I help u be well, are you well"" not very good when backing up techs"
bad,"This is the worst company to work for period.  Their new labor model is to work you dead then replace you. The pay is not that great and they continue to cut pay by renaming job titles and taking away benefits. There are constant programs, directives and projects forced upon you at a pace that cannot be managed effectively. Labor budget gets cut more and more. You begin to see managers around you and around the region slowly lose it before being fired. They make sure there is always a reason to get rid of anyone.  If you are not working at least 60 hours a week you are bullied and asked if you even want to move up in the company. Advancement depends much more on physical appearance rather then skill which is apparent pretty quickly. People are leaving in droves for a reason,  Don't be the next victim."
bad,VERY little to no job advancement. Management is extremely inconsistent. Delegation is horrible. Communication between ANY employee is lacking or non existent. Hours are inconsistent and management won't work with you on it.
bad,"Not a place I enjoyed, felt like they tried to take advantage of me, especially management. These managers don't care abut their employees!!"
bad,"I would have to say that I love the company however I don't love the Management they have working in the company, They are very ruled and don't like to help others, Have been trying to move up in that company for the whole four years I worked with the company and I have never received the position."
bad,clock in at scheduled and start my daily work. No enough staff and job is too stressful with short staffed. There always one problem or the other in the pharmacy. It is not well organized.
bad,"Worked with company for 2 years, have some great co workers, but management likes to bring you down. Sometimes very uncomfortable working environment, stressful work place, pharmacists talk down to you. Not so much of a bad job just highly stressful at times and some co-workers don't work well under pressure. Not a good career choice for a pharmacy technician unless you enjoy retail."
bad,"Unorganized, terrible management, terrible culture. No growth, no promotions. 9 people fired within the year, people with tenure. No training, or instruction, no wms system, all manual. Small team, of 5, expected to do jobs worth teams of 20 or more."
bad,"I would be busy all the time"
bad,"Whoever managers like are usually the workers that move ahead in company. Co-workers are lazy and unhelpful. not a place i could work for, for more than a couple months. they also are not good with working with your schooling."
bad,"The wages are terrible considering the stress the managers puts on their employees. The company expects you to work like new age, when their systems & equipment are vintage.  Be prepared to do manual work on everything with the expectation for everything to be done in less than a week. The training provided to new employees is bad. When asking questions on how items should be billed, posted, or paid, it feels as though management doesn't know how to bill or how we should get paid for their products.  When asking questions they always say to ask someone else and you end up back with nothing.  It feels like the company is not investing in improving their systems and  equipment since they were bought out. If you really want to work for this company pick anything else outside of Collections/Billing/Cash.  There's no real room for advancement.  All an illusion dont be fooled."
bad,This company only cares about the bottom line. the work environment was dangerous to say the least. you are at the mercy of your immediate supervisor. If he /she doesn't like you they can and will make your life a living nightmare.
bad,"Be aware that Walgreens is no longer a family owned business and their latest spin-off; Optioncare is not much better. The written job descriptions read well, but the actual positions are supported by unqualified supervisors and it doesn't take long to realize that the supervisors qualifications and style are a reflection of the managers; it's a trickled down effect. Neither Optioncare nor Walgreens have a training program that is successful. The HR department lacks any type of accessible employee relations and there is no formal orientation given for new employees; orientation consists of a supervisor sending emails to your inbox for about 30 days; definitely not what one would expect."
bad,"Company is currently going through lay-off, due to reduction in work force.  Company does not care about their employees.  No team environment."
bad,"I was in charge of picking, inbound, and outbound. I installed a new training program and a safety program. We worked 6 days a week for 12 hours a day. Then we were expected to have a meeting on Sunday mornings."
bad,"Was told to ""use my brains"" by a supevisor, in front of customers. Had manager tell me to choose one job or the other rather than work with me for scheduling conflicts. Should probably stop using a condescending tone with your employees and maybe they won't quit so much!"
bad,"I worked for Walgreens for 3 years. I was a HR Generalist at a Distribution Center. The pay was great and the benefits (health, dental, vision) were decent, but everything else was horrendous. I had a tremendous amount of responsibilities and pressure and was treated poorly by the upper management. The Distribution Center Manager was very hard to work with, not understanding, and not willing to listen. The hardest part of my job was trying to please the upper management while still effectively doing my job for the Team Members at the location. I would not recommend working at Walgreens to anyone. The pay was what kept me there for as long as I worked there."
bad,I worked for Walgreens part time. The management at Walgreens is the worst and unprofessional that I have ever dealt with in 30 years of retail.
bad,Do not start working for this company if you would like to move up in a company. It wont happen!
bad,We keep busy at walgreens within our given departments and where we are at for the day. The management is ok but not the best as we don't have a team atmosphere or open communication. My ideal place would be somewhere where you are respected and treated as part of a team and can give feedback without fear of retaliation.
bad,"walgreens is a company that is all about profit, and bonuses for the higher ups. If the people in the d.c get a raise its a punch in the gut..... this year was a .13 raise. that doesnt even begin to cover higher cost of living, or the increase in insurace costs. i worked there for 8 years and all i can say "
bad,"My headline explains what Walgreens is today.  Profit over people,  employees are barely able to afford to live off their salary except for management and pharmacists.   Corporate doesnt care about their employees like this used to.   The store are always working with skeleton crews."
bad,"The management were very unorganzied, and the staff consisted of cliques, and if you did not fit in to these cliques, your work-life would be miserable. I would not recommend working here if you are looking for a mature and pleasant work-environment."
bad,The terms of my severance agreement do not permit any comments about this employer.
bad,Regular job. Pay sucks but sadly it's not their fault as 7.25 is minimum wage so 8.50 is treated as if your salaried.
bad,"thought this was a company that would provide room for growth, I was wrong."
bad,at walgreens management isn't exactly the best. you also do not get promoted or receive a raise in a timely manner.
bad,"Health Benefits are terrible HUGE DEDUCTIBLE"
bad,"CPC logistics. Walgreens mt Vernon, iL"
bad,"In this job it is in a retail management environment, Management is in charge of making schedules, inventory, training, opening and closing store, counting registers, and customer service to every consumer that walks in the store."
bad,"Bad schedule, poor benefits, hard to have a social life.  I worked there for 2 years in this area and several years outside the area.  I worked just about every holiday. God forbid I get sick because calling out was frowned upon and management made me feel bad for taking care of myself.  Management is expected to take the world on their shoulders while lower level employees do simple tasks rather than balance tasks out.  Unless you don't have a family, like working for low pay with high expectations and little resources to help you perform your job then I would say avoid working for Walgreens.  I finally quit because I could not take the diminishing benefits and schedule."
bad,Worked there for 12+ years. Great in the beginning then sucked later on mostly due to poor and incompetent management. Forced to load 2 sometimes 3 trucks at once. Impossible to keep up. Sore back everyday. Best thing that happened was company closed due to relocating allowing us to get a severance and paid vacation time before they took that away too.
bad,This place is not for people with a family. Walgreens poicy is that your family is comes second to them.
bad,Working in the corporate reimbursement department was awful. The management team were bullies and there was absolutely no room for advancement. They hardly hired from within even with 10+ positions open.
bad,Change ast mgt pos pay to 14.50 how am i to live on that. No equal promotion  all politics
bad,"Billings Walgreens Infusion Services office has had a very hard time keeping clinical staff.  The local office manager is completely unqualified and abusive to say the least.  The Bozeman nurse manager is difficult to work with as well. "
bad,Consistently bad management caused mistakes to be made on a daily basis.The same mistakes over and over caused unnecessary work and overtime and employee mistrust of management.Management would play favorites with some of the workers and let them take days off without penalty of being fired while the workers with less seniority had to do all the work including overtime which was mandatory.Some of the co-workers had no productivity and others that were not friendly to management would get written up.The operations manager would post a job and then a month later eliminate it causing people to get bumped out of there job because of seniority.The insurance was good but every year it would change to worse coverage costing the worker more money out of his pocket.The hardest part of the job was the constant increase of productivity expected of you.The company invested little money in new equipment to help workers make the unreasonable productivity rates.The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving for the day but the bad part was knowing you had to go back the next day and deal with more problems.
bad,"This is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. The balance between work and life is non existent because you are always at work. Management is ruthless and does not value the employee. The only thing that matters is the bottom line. Managers will lie, steal, and cheat to cover their behinds and throw innocent employees under the bus as a means to retaining their titles. The job culture is very unethical and indifferent regarding employee well-being. The front-line employees are given no holidays to share with family, work year round, and are poorly compensated while corporate employees are given extensive time off, bonuses, and perks out of the wazoo."
bad,"The manager was racist , never guide me through properly.I worked really hard and was thinking as an entry to get into corporate side of the company . If there would be some other manager who would be qualified enough would have understand but this manager was biased and  rqather then being a mentor for my managerial skills he made me work like donkeys on the floor and not respecting the differences in opinion and religion."
bad,"-A typical day at work, standing at the cash register helping customers. Going up and down aisles facing and fixing products, stocking if needed. "
bad,"Poor management, stressful work environment. Hours are given and taken away at the drop of a hat. Work/Life balance is poor because of inconsistent scheduling and demands. Workers are called in on their vacation days because they lack adequate coverage due to tight budget; so scheduling a vacation is no guarantee of actually being able to take a vacation. Advancement is not based on merit or hard work but a system of favoritism. Employees are encouraged by merit to relay gossip and spy on other employees."
bad,"My job title was in the books as pharmacy tech receiving 12/hr. Worked for a few months and was only placed on front register at minimum wage. New managers that were hired were very unethical, unprofessional and just rude."
bad,Typical work day was shadowing different workers in the different departments of the pharmacy from 9am-5pm everyday.
bad,"The pay is tremendously low compared to the amount of work that is expected. There are no breaks, and only thirty minute lunches. The benefits are very poor."
bad,"I worked my way up the ladder to management, put in 50+ hours a week killing myself for some recognition. Granted I did get that from certain people higher up but the majority tends not to care a thing about what you do or who you are. They state they are a family company, that family means everything. If they mean themselves, then yes that's the case. Never got ANY holidays off for family, pay was pretty low for each position they had considering the work load. If the economy tanks be prepared for a corporate e-mail saying there will be no layoffs, but they will bring loss prevention in to scrutinize everything shortly after to terminate over any small discrepancy in anything. My old district was wiped clean of management and employees within 2 weeks from this. Be very weary of them... you are a number and a statistic of cost..."
bad,The communication between corporate and those actually in the stores is atrocious.
bad,"I enjoyed my co-workers and working with the public, the discount was nice. The management was borderline opressive, unrelenting and unappreciative. I never left work feeling good about the quilaity of work I tried to perform, it was all for naught. Corporate made decisions that just had basis for saving labor or money. They did not listen nor care to any staff. I still say it was the worst run retail organization I ever worked at."
bad,"There was no room for advancement, they Micro manage and do not care about there employees. They only allow 15 minutes a week for you to use the restroom, they do not want you to talk to one another..even if your not on a call. The managers and supervisor all chit chat, text and gossip on company, but try to write everyone else for it."
bad,"Room for advancement, low pay. too much phone work, made new friends"
bad,Extremely high paced and unfriendly place to work. Zero security placing managers in perilous confrontations. Good opportunity for financila development with accounts and vendors. Hardest part of job was manager was in charge of doing all the function. Employees were allowed to work in a fashion without fear of repraisals. Confusing multiple computer systems and zero assistance from store upper management.
bad,she likes to embarass her emploers. I enjoy most of the peopole I work with and the other managers are awesome.
bad,"I was an employee for 3 years at Walgreens. Initially, it was a great company to work for, and then they decided to lay off more than 50% of their management staff, cut hours in the pharmacy. They thought that they could cut hours in the pharmacy if they could get all of their patients to switch to 90 day supply prescriptions. Essentially, they were offering a ""NEW"" service in order to eliminate jobs. If you decide to work for them, watch out for ANYTHING and EVERYTHING you sign. I was disabled, and taking Vicodin, which clouded my judgement, and they got me to sign a confession that the coached me into writing, and then fired me."
bad,"Just like the headline reads, outside of your store no one cares about you or your story.  You are just a number and can and will be easily replaced.  The store management team does its best to help but even they are overworked and extremely underpaid, thus resulting in low morale throughout the store."
bad,"For a CSA this is not a bad job. You do your work and go home. For management however, you get belittled to the point of feeling like a failure. When your store hits all metrics, it is for nothing since bonuses are a thing of the past. Payroll is cut so much that basic tasks are borderline impossible, and even just meeting customer demands on a daily basis is difficult with the amount of employees we have."
bad,"This is a company that needs major restructuring at the management level. Never in my career have I ever found such disregard for patient care; this company places the bottom dollar over patients care and patient support. Walgreens is an organization that literally abuses its talent without regard for the people who work for them. Pharmacists are required to extrem distances for shifts, they make travel in excess of six hours to fulfill a 12 hr shift after working a 12 hr shift. And its constant."
bad,"Company can care less about the concerns of the employees. Always understaffed, and hours continue to get worst. Often times management is not trust worthy and will tend to the customer despite the fact the customer is often wrong. Most of the staff is overworked given unattainable goals."
bad,"This job is completely trash. It takes every single fiber in your body. Don’t work here. They are always understaff leading you to work longer hours and stressing. Walgreeens is too cheap to put out any money for more employees or benefits. But the stores makes 20,000 a day just from the front end. Company is basura"
bad,"This job was good job for me to have as a new Vegas resident but I feel overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated.   I am actively looking for another job."
bad,"It was my 1st job and I regret working there. Maybe it was my location, but my coworkers and managers sucked. Pay was awful. The hours that I was given did not allow me to have a social life whatsoever and you couldnt leave after closing the store down until your manager was done closing their draw. There were some nice customers and some that were RUDE and hard to deal with. I quit only after 2 months because it was a waste of my time when there are MUCH BETTER paying jobs and jobs overall. Like I said it could be my location but overall it was the worst work experience I've ever had."
bad,"You're expected to hit 100% production for every 2 weeks if you do not make 100% you get wrote up. 3 write ups and you're fired. Very miserable stressful place to work, would not recommend for anybody."
bad,The company has really changed since merging with Boots.  Numbers driven with no support.  Work culture is horrible.  The company no longer respects the profession of pharmacy.  Its all about profit not care driven.
bad,I’ve worked as a resolution specialist for many years working from home. Management is nice but know less than the people they supervise. Most years give no raises and when they do it is .5 to .15 cents. Next to impossible for upward mobility for work at home employees. Over the past 10 years since I’ve started the company has tripled its net worth and in that time my pay has raised 12%. The wages become worse every year. Not a place I recommend
bad,After applying on indeed where the schedule was listed as Monday through Friday I was hired in September and began training in November. After training we were blind sided with bidding for shifts not only will they not work to get you shift that works for your outside life they also don’t have a strong sense for the fact that employees have families that need to come first it’s all about what you can do for them I don’t think I could work for Walgreens ever just on principle.
bad,"I worked for Walgreens for 2 years for the convenience of it's location. I was the Ottawa IL store first ever Beauty consultant. I am also a licensed esthetician and an accredited certified makeup artist. The wage was severely underpaid for a licensed professional. And though the position doesn't have to have a professional license. Then they should definitely not advertise for one in their hiring post. Not only for this location but the company in its entirety. No Beauty professional educates themselves, receives a state license and student loan debt for this. Now i work for a well known luxury beauty brand near Chicago's northwest suburbs at 3x's these earnings. I am happy to no longer be with the company."
bad,"its a power struggle with this company the manager of the store treats you like you are not worthy   no matter how hard you work you get no where."
bad,"Loved my regular customers, liked SOME of my fellow employees but truly couldn't stand manager. He had no respect for his employees, especially me and the other managers. He would yell at me on the sales floor, whether customers could hear him or not. He never appreciated anything and never gave praise for something done well. He had been with the company over 20 years and he just needs to go ahead and retire and let them hire a new store manager who would treat employees fairly and respectfully and would treat employees right!!!"
bad,I think if you look at the company as a whole you have a lot of men as store managers and they hire all these young girls that will giggle at everything they say and the store manager that I worked for all he did was follow the ASM around like a dog in heat he was worthless in my opinion. It was a lot better when we was Rite Aid
bad,"The objectives and mission statements of this company are highly convoluted by incompetent management, employees have no power when it comes to ideas. Management will fix the schedule in favor of themselves.  Incentives to work for Walgreens are minuscule other than a pay check."
bad,The leads are extended to the breaking point. Schedules change week to week. No stable work-life balance. Store manager operates mentally at a very fast pace and expects others to do the same.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Work life balance is extremely poor. Based on scheduling you only get ond say off per week."
bad,Corporation that doesn't care at all about the individual. Work environment is one where no one is happy and people are encouraged to report on each other.
bad,"Hire you saying they will train you to be pharmacy tech.  No training just a call center job.  Low pay 13.50 per hour "
bad,"Walgreens is a very unhealthy environment in which to work. There is no structure in management and those line leads are very rude, self absorbed and verbally abusive to everyone, but their friends. The job itself requires you fulfill your daily rate and sadly, that can be and often is determined on who is working by you and how they pick the product. If it is not met, you will ultimately be terminated after appropriate coaching time  Also, the benefits are ridiculously expensive"
bad,"Previous management team was good, but after re-district new management was very bad. No support and like to point finger and blame someone else for mistakes."
bad,"The bottom line is, Walgreens doesn’t want to expend the money on a budget that would allow it’s stores to be functional. Until they give their stores the budget hours and the actual money to run their stores, NPS scores and employee retainment rates are going to keep tanking."
bad,"I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy, I gave them a 2 week notice, before my last day my supervisor told me that I was more than welcome to come back if I wanted to. I tried to come back at a later time, I reapplied numerous times I had Interviews never was rehired."
bad,"Started working there at the graveyard shift to make some more money and then when I started classes I moved to another location where I could work during the day. Every single Shift Lead expected way too much of me. They would expect me to watch the front for customers (I was a cashier) and then be down the hall and around the corner stocking/facing items at the same time. Not only that but they would get mad if I wasn't taking care of a customer that I didn't know was ready to check out, even if I was already on my way up to the front. Being expected to do two things at once is ridiculous."
bad,"No overtime.... B-pay with $5 more per hour.  How do they get away with it legally?  District manager that is not a healthcare provider your boss, and you also report to the store manager.  Little to no overlap, no breaks, no lunch unless you're in a state that mandates a lunch for a pharmacist.  Your hours get cut based on volume, have to travel to other stores and scramble to get hours if you don't have seniority.  If you stay over, you better get the RxM to make them pay you for your time, or they'll never acknowledge or pay you for it.  Must be BLS certified with cardio-partners... likely a company owed by Walgreens, or you can't work independently or immunize.  Company will bend over backwards to get customers to keep coming back, but you're a throw-away as an employee.  Rarely get time to complete online learning assignments & your district mgr can make them due much earlier than corporate & WILL threaten you with suspension from work... not the register, if not done on his/her timeline.  They push for 40% waiter volume... this can be dangerous. They are also making a huge push for 90 day scripts, so that will mean they will cut associate and pharmacist hours as monthly refill volume decreases.... guaranteed.  Corporate will believe a customer or patient over an employee any day...  gotta have that dollar!  Insurance and parental leave benefits are the only thing good about the company"
bad,basically the company overall is ok but the dm allows the store manger to treat employees how ever they want and its not fair at all especially when the store manager has had problems with others and all the company does is move that person to another store
bad,The place is a joke  hiring  no back round  checks  management  is joke people  just  standing  around  doing nothing   make  you  work mandatory  Overtime  came  back  from  Medical  Leave  day came back  got fired  If I where you  I look for another  job
bad,"Once you get a job at Walgreens, expect to have no life, work when THEY want you to work, get cussed out by customers, always feel like there’s so much to do but never enough times. Depressing work place."
bad,Worked there for many years. Culture changed dramatically in that time. Management doesn't care and offers no guidance. Opioid policy is basically figure it out and we will throw you under the bus if we can. Politics are dirty. It all depends on who you know. Good work gets you nowhere. Training is poor.
bad,"I was hired as a Pharmacy Tech and every other area in the store. The management was AWFUL. The manager was a narcissist. He talked to his employees like garbage, and took advantage of them. They made my hours different without my acknowledgment. I was suppose to be FT M-F 10AM-5PM. Then they changed PT whenever they want."
bad,"Store managers get away with verbal abuse and harassment in the work place. I had to go above my district manager because she did nothing. Once HR contacted her she had to do something about it. After investigation clearly proved my report and the managers were never fired, instead I got retaliated against until I quit. I worked for them for 20 years. This all started once I moved to Florida’s in 2006. I started with Walgreens in Wisconsin in 1994. They used to be a good company."
bad,"Walgreen Continues to cut budget hours while expecting to cover dept, give great customer service, complete resets/out dates, stock and if cross trained to help in pharmacy all in a day. Its a flexible scheduling systems so your shifts very every week. They are open 365 days a year and regular store hours. You can see teams members are getting overwhelmed and stressed out daily. No room for advancements!"
bad,this company is going downhill. The only thing I liked was my manager and team leads . The bigger bosses didn’t care about anyone and it’s stressful. they cut hours but could have found other ways to cut without taking hours away:
bad,Turnover rate is ridiculous. Every time i turn around there's a new face and not worth the pay to train new ppl. Management team is so petty. Too many personal problems in store.
bad,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would. This place was absolutely the worst company I’ve ever worked for. The benefits are very poor and don’t cover anything. The management is super inconsistent and there is a lot of drama and miscommunication. Want to move up? Forget it. It’s never gonna happen unless you’re a favorite. I was harassed for months on end, and asked Walgreens if I could video tape it for the police, and they said I could, but it “might affect my career, and they don’t recommend it”. That was said to me by the general manager"
bad,"Overall, management was the WORST. They changed out managers every month, I kid you not. Every one of these managers seemed like they ""owned"" Walgreens and in reality every time the District manager came through they ripped them a new one for all the things that were not done right. If anything was done right, it was definitely not done by managers but rather them harassing their employees to do something in such a certain way that it had to be done more than once. I was here for a long time but I dreaded every time i walked through those doors. I was someone in which the managers relied on a lot. A LOT. I honestly did more work than the managers themselves did. I got a new job and helped on the weekends but it turned out everything they did not want to do during the week was saved for me. I ended up leaving and I thank god for my new job that i ABSOLUTELY love Out of this job I can say that I have learned time management and organizational skill because these things are crucial for surviving here."
bad,Was with the company for two years very bad place to work. From the beginning I notice everybody hated their jobs complained about working there. At first I didn't believe them but then it started to become true. Management is awful training is very lackluster and there is a constant understaffing problem no matter how busy your store is. Very bad stressful and depressing work environment I suggest you stay away from working here at all costs. Lots of bias and animosity will come your way people playing games and gossip trying to take you out and making your life miserable. You will hate your life if you work at Walgreens.
bad,"I stayed for 3 years & each day was honestly a headache. I'm sure every store manager isn't crooked so I'm only speaking on the location that I worked at. My store managers would only interact with the staff members who hung out in the office all day to gossip, talk about things unrelated to the job & did no real work. If you weren't in their ""work clique"", you went unnoticed every day,minus a hello, No matter how much work you did. I was let go or fired instead of them following policy of a written warning. It was easier for the manager to FORCE my pharmacist to fire me( she told me THAT) instead of deal with my emotional situation. They don't treat us equal . The store i worked has a poor store manager who fakes his caring games to get you to comply and do everything he wants. All of the other store managers agree with me( they've told me so)  but need there jobs so can't say anything."
bad,"If you survive the abusive management, enraged customers, and ridiculous hours for more than a month, you can become a manager.  Then you get to yell at the associates for any little stupid thing!  That's how they motivate you to work harder for little money and no breaks."
bad,I work at walgreens the company itself is going downhill. The pay is no good this job should be for highschool students. We don't have alot of peoples work there and alot of theft going on at my store. Hopefully I get a better job. The managers is okay at my store but the shift leaders are so disrespectful.
bad,Walgreens is your typical company that doesn’t care about its employees. I will never recommend anyone to work for this company. If you need some extra money it’s good. The stores are dirty And outdated
bad,"No overtime, hours cut from 38-40 to 28 to 30.  You can't have another job or you won't be able to get insurance or more than 2 or less days.  Schedule changes after it posts to co app, get in trouble when people don't fill out surveys"
bad,"So if you think Walgreens is a great place to work its not. I worked there for almost 3 years, being a single mom of 3, I busted my tail for their company, went above and beyond what was expected. They expect you to be perfect, to do no wrong, and the second you do something unintentional, that was an accident, and you shift leader was the one that override it, they fire you and not them. There care and protect program is a not what they preach. They see dollar signs, they have no respect for their employees, When I first started working there I loved it, I actually looked forward to working there, and then stuff changed which made it un-enjoyable to work there. I used to get up in the morning and say yes I get to go to work today, after the change, I would hate having to even walk in the door, I used to say yeah, i get to go to horrible work today. So my advice to you, is don't work for Walgreens, management doesn't care about you, unless you have a manager that is actually human, and had your back through everything. But when you have a manager that doesn't know you, and is younger then you are and is still wet behind the ears, and an ASM that wants to take credit for your hard work and make you look like a fool, and they lie about everything, then get out while you can, Walgreens has no care for their employees, they have no respect for their employees, they don't give a anything about you as an employee. It is a shame what the world is coming to, how you have to bend yourself into a pretzel to get any credit and even then it doesn't work out, and you work your tail off,"
bad,"Walgreens used to be an enjoyable place to work. Now, not so much. A lot has changed in the past few years and none of it has been for the better. Budget cuts, cuts to store programs, lack of maintenance, etc."
bad,"Great company plans and drive however when it comes to overall execution efficiency and enforcement it falls extremely short. "
bad,"Management straight up told me that they didn't like me and kept scheduling me for days that I told them that I was unavailable and had blocked off on my availability. The pay was minimum wage and bimonthly, but other than that it was ok to work there. Maybe it was just my location."
bad,brown nosers and 'yes' men  - ridicules people been there so long at the distribution center that really do absolutely nothing to benefit the company but they stay employed.  management is a joke
bad,"Their phrase ""We Care"" is only extended to customers and not to their employees.  Hence the reason fallout is more present and growing every year.  You would think they would extend the same courtesy.  I wish they would genuinely listen to what their employees are telling them and not disregard their suggestions to help the company grow."
bad,"The people are fun to work with but at the end of the day they pay people that been with the company for years the same as they pay a person with 0 experience and knows nothing about the business. There is no compensation for longevity, seniority, or knowledge about the business. Seniority should be an asset not a liability."
bad,The company only cares about profit. It seems like the people in charge of making decisions have never worked the job or even in the industry. Any job that would replace you in a week isn't worth stressing out about.
bad,"I was hired under the understanding that I can work 40 hours, I could not work nights at the time i just moved to Cypress, tx and it was just me and my kids and i refuse to work  on Sundays because of my religon beliefs and as the years we it all changed."
bad,"You spend over half your day with the people you work with. Not everyday is going to peaches & cream. I quit working at Walgreens because of the chaos and disrespect from employees. I started having butterflies in stomach before I had to be at work and shortly after that, anxiety/ panic attacks. It was not good for my health. Horrible!"
bad,"No one can have an opinion of how to do things without being put down. Most aren't even heard. We are worked harder than is realistic and there is nearly no recognition or if we are recognized, it is to point out all the things that we are doing wrong. I was told that I would be advancing rapidly, but have thus far been stuck in the same position. Manager is abysmal and knows absolutely nothing about what it takes to actually keep the store running. Would rather staff focus more on tasks than the actual customer care that we are supposed to be well known for."
bad,"•Most unorganized pharmacy that I have ever worked in."
bad,"THE poorest management I have ever seen. Only a couple SFL new how to actually do their job. Whereas the store manager only knows how to be your friend, and not your actual boss. If you're not in the circle, watch out. On numerous occasions I've listened to staff mingle to try and figure out how they can get others fired. I've listened to people bully, and degrade staff behind their backs. The ONLY good thing about this store is their DM. They pay decent for the area. Benefits are zilch if you aren't 30+ hours. Paid time off is terrible, good lucking getting your requests. Work+Life balance is terrible. The never ending policy changes, and rules, is atrocious. Some aren't even good. They just screw you over even worse. I sincerely applaud anyone that even works for Walgreens. I never would again. It isn't worth it. You are literally treated like gum of the bottom of the management's shoe if your not tenured or a favorite."
bad,Management is a joke and the culture is a joke. The Company does not care about its employees well being and their happiness. You get vacation time but you are not allowed to use it. DO NOT WORK FOR WALGREENS
bad,"Awful place to work, I worked there for 5 years before I left. I admit it was a college job, but seeing their degrading company culture and lack of concern for employees cemented my desire to not make Walgreens a career Choice after graduation. They literally expect you to work on all of the biggest holidays while their upper executives spend time with family and having fun.  If you won't work holidays, you might as well quit, I regret so willingly giving my most valuable time to a company that craps on employees at every opportunity they are able.  They even started cutting the pay for store managers and began cutting opportunities around the time I left. They are also extremely cheap, they used to give employees a gift card for Christmas, but cut that to a paltry friend's and family discount (the same as the employee discount, which could be extended to friends and family without the supposed special gesture, which is actually their way of going cheap on employees). From conversations with employees still there, things haven't improved either. They are cutting benefits that folks about to retire counted on for years as something to help make retirement more manageable, these are employees that dedicated the best years of their lives to the company.  This is not to mention other policy changes that make life at work increasingly unbearable. Don't let yourself be mistreated by this company, it will be your biggest regret."
bad,"The work there is easy, however they ask alot. Most stores will have you doing everything, but only pay you $10. For example, I would work at the register while unloading truck, and sometimes i have to also run the photo department. Managers are not understanding of obligations (Family & Student). The company itself cherry picks what offenses are enough for termination or not."
bad,"Doesn't pay enough to deal with the customers"
bad,"When I started working at Walgreens almost ten years ago, it was actually a great place to work.  The CEO was a wonderful person and actually seemed to care about the people that made the company, his employees."
bad,This company is good for short term only if you give it any time or loyalty they will use and abuse you!  No budget to get task done. Or run the store how it should be ran. Tons of side projects and pulse or frontier meetings that do not help anything and favoritism is huge within the company
bad,"I have been with this store for nearly a year now and  In all honesty the store that I am working for has poor management,  putting down people  never gives  encouragement on  a good job that they are doing who were working extremely hard. I think this store is going down fast. And the complaints from the shift lead  towards the management only add to the stress.   Having said that the manager of the store  is bias regarding employees . Due to the condescending comments and scrutiny that I have endured under the manager I have decided to resign"
bad,I was a shift lead for Walgreens and  the management was just awful and treated everyone that wasn’t  their favorite like salves. They expect you to get 50 tasks in 8 hours. And you’re lucky if you have 3 people on the floor for you . Sometimes they schedule you with just a cashier and still expect those 50 things to be done . And if they aren’t you hear about it the next day you work again and they are rude about it. Not only is it low pay but the favorites are already making more than a shift lead. They don’t give you the chance to grow within the company unless you are their favorite.
bad,My manager fired me and the three pharmacist before me because I'm (we) a man. The district manager didn't mind this behavior. Corporate backed the store decision and also stole my paid time off
bad,"Just do your work & be a team player "
bad,Not enough help. Only two work at night. If a truck comes I'm up front by myself trying to manage everything. Hardly no breaks. Management is terrible. Schedule terrible. Worse job ever.
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. They do not pay well at all and on top of that, they take advantage of the hardworking employees by giving them even more tasks without compensating their work. The management is poor, mind you, I've been to 2 different location, and currently am at HQ store. Now, one would think it would be a bit better, but no, it's still bad. I would not recommend anyone, let alone, my friends to work for Walgreens. Would not want to put them through this stressful job."
bad,"Working for Walgreens helped me become a better career oriented person but it also taught me the mind consumption of working in retail."
bad,"If you get hired, always and I mean always allow thieves to do any and everything they want to do. If you speak up, be prepared to be terminated. If you're not oart of the in crowd, be prepared to be on the outside looking in. Store manager was awesome, and all the former managers were great. New assistant manager was a joke, who played favoritism, your work ethic, didn't count."
bad,Feels like a company that is going out of business. Do more with less attitude. Unsupportive upper management unrealistic expectations. Nobody wants to work there because the staff is underpaid for what they are expected to do
bad,"Honestly wouldn't work for them ever again, Not even the company as a whole. If a manager doesn't like you for personal reason they can basically do whatever they want with your schedule. Even the HR department is lacking. The company's management  is know for  doing sketchy things to there employees and treating them unfairly so watch your back, and look up the law if you work here know your rights as a employee"
bad,"Walgreens used to be a great place to work, but has gone downhill. They have drastically cut all benefits within the last 5 years. Now, it's all about chasing numbers for sales rather than building employees up. Raises are maybe .25 annually,  if you havent capped out. If you've been there too long, making too much, upper management will find ways to force you out, even if they have to fabricate charges against you. They mostly want part time employees so that they dont have to pay benefits. I know because I was high up in management."
bad,"Not a good place to work for good family schedules. Most shifts are odd times of day. Weekends off is a plus, the place is not ran very well and management competes between departments and tries to through each other under the bus to make their numbers for the day. No communication, decent pay for the job and area. The morale is extremely low"
bad,"Walgreens' continues to ask more and more of their pharmacists and technicians, despite providing less or equal help to achieve these goals.  Walgreens' does not provide opportunities for breaks of any kind.  Walgreens' will not allow their overnight pharmacists to be scheduled for more than 72 hours, and will not allow their overnight pharmacists to have any help.  Overnight pharmacists work alone for 10-plus hours 7 nights straight, and then if we want to get 80 hours per pay period we must seek an additional shift on our ""week off.""  Walgreens' closed several 24-hour pharmacy locations overnight, creating a massive influx of patients to my location...yet I have received no additional help to compensate for this.  Walgreens' bought out Rite Aid & Fred's pharmacies, yet they have provided no additional help to our staff to compensate for the increased prescription counts.  Walgreens' is creating an unsafe environment for their employees, and in turn creating an unsafe environment for their patients.  Walgreens' store managers and district managers always have an excuse for everything and never offer any solutions or help.   I used to enjoy working overnights because of the freedom the schedule provided me, but it's not worth the stress anymore.  The workload is too great for any one human being to accomplish in a 10 hour shift.  Plus, I am getting griped out on a consistent basis because of the shortcomings of the day staff.  However, there is only so much the day staff can do because of being short-staffed constantly.  Walgreens' should be ashamed of themselves for how they"
bad,"Work life balance is not there at all. The company use to be great for employees but cuts in hours and benefits makes it unbearable. The people you work with day-to-day are the only saving grace, but with all the changes and cuts the best people are leaving for greener pastures."
bad,I absolutely hated working for this company! I was the low man on the pole and was treated so bad. I was given the late late night hours even after asking to not always having to close due to having class first thing in the morning. when I put my 2 weeks in for a better job I was treated even worse so I just quit the next day. I would never work for the pharmacy of the company ever again. my front of the house experience was the complete opposite. they changed my hours when I requested it due to school. was treated fairly. I would defiantly come back to work in the front of the store
bad,"Management  tells you they have this set of expectations, but do not provide access to the tools in order to learn the procedures."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the job itself and helping some good customers. The hardest part of the job is when the systems go down and you can't help no one, it makes you feel helpless"
bad,"Walgreens professes to have moved from task orientated to people orientated, but it is a lie. After working with 4 different store managers with one of them being a superstar that treated her employees and customers dignity and respect, the other 3 ruled with threats, harassment and intimidation."
bad,"They only care about money and allow businessmen to run a pharmacy over a pharmacist. Unreasonable things would occur, on one occasion a patient followed me home. When I reported it to management, they disregarded the issue. I quit shortly after"
bad,"Ok place to work if you need a pay check, but not planning to make a career out of it. Cause this place sucks really bad. They ask too much from you and want to much from you with little pay."
bad,"Great place to move up the ladder, however, there is a lot of politics and favoritism that comes into play as far as management goes. If the shift leads like you, the store manager likes you and vice versa."
bad,"Hours went to those that didn't deserve it."
bad,Walgreens overall was not a fair workplace. The pay is lower than it should be for the tasks being done. Management has favorites. Noone tries to make  employees feel appreciated.
bad,Small to no rise. Manger pressures college student to work more hours than they can which leads to a high turn over rate. Manger does not acknowledge staff suggestion to improve store. Employees are not held accountable when calling out leading to staffing issues. the manger is a micro manger and harasses employees constantly.
bad,"I thought I was signing up for a great job but I quickly realized that I was along for a ride. I had 2 days a week  7 hours a day 9 dollars per hour and I had to live on this job for a year. "
bad,"Raises are based on performance evaluations, lots of favoritism, unfair scheduling, micromanaging from corporate, only care about numbers not actually what happens in the store, always short staffed."
bad,Management its really bad and working hours are worse. Customers are really rude. Been stuck to this job 12 years and I have very little. Opportunity growth its very slim unless your friends with your manager and question any of his decisions.
bad,"Too many changes and programs happening at once. The leaders have no clue what they are doing and it produces multiple layers of confusion among field leaders. "
bad,A typical day at work is extremely busy there's too much going on with customers as well as staff. Management can be more hands-on training if they had the time to just not enough because of how busy it is on an everyday base.
bad,The lead pharmacy tech refused to allow any new technicians learn the way their pharmacy works. She constantly belittled other techs and pulled us away from a patient that we were working with. She made other techs seem as if they could not do the job by not allowing us to follow through. Instead she would have us take over what she was already in the middle of working on.
bad,"split case pic sucks! it is a very boring job. The rate is really high, & you must meet it or lose your job. They claim to pride themselves on hiring people that have disabilities, but they have to make a high rate, if they do not, your fired! your breaks make you behind on rate, I do not think that should count against you, but it does. You have to try super hard to make up your rate if you take a break."
bad,"If you are looking at applying to Walgreens, only do so as a last resort.  They treat their pharmacy technicians like Gods and don't care about any other position, even thought the store could not run without a Store Manager or Assistant Store Manager.  Do not do it.  Ever.  Unless absolutely necessary."
bad,"Never a clear job description. Only got feed back when you didn't do what you were supposed to. Never knew what was expected. Seriously met good friend, job sucked."
bad,Employees have no voice when it came to management abuse.  Human resource dept.  doesn't  not resolve issues fairly.  I would not recommend company to anyone I know.
bad,"I was only here while I was in college overall the job is stressful and you do not get paid enough. Some of the supervisors were okay but they were only given so much to do, no recognition or nothing. Micromanaged"
bad,"Too ""white"" not nearly enough diversity. It's  majority white male. Managers flirt with cashiers which is very inappropriate. "
bad,"Everyone was expecting me to know how to do everything around the store. Management  wasn't good, there was about an hour when we didn't have a manager around. I excelled at my job duties, and my co-workers still expected me to do more then what i was already doing."
bad,"Every stereotypically evil aspect of every corporation is manifested in Walgreens. Poor hours, negligent pay, unfair PTO rates, outdated technology, obsolete software, the whole nine yards. Absolutely NOT a company worth working for, in any regard. The only good thing is the employee discount."
bad,The new executives are only interested in cutting costs and do not worry about the negative impact on team members. Cost cutting is not a good way to run any business long term. There is a lot of uncertainty with Walgreens at this point. I would never recommend working for Walgreens and I spent 16 years with the company.
bad,"I worked at several locations and the environment that is supported within stores and by local corporate is toxic. Communication is not valued or appreciated. Autonomy is seen as a threat to those in management as they micro-manage instead of properly manage. This is mostly due to a severe lack of training on all levels leading management to project their own ignorance on their staff and distrust their capabilities. A lot of work cannot be completed and frustration is prevalent. Very inefficient."
bad,Being there as long as I was and no pay raise was very unacceptable. Management would treat you differently if you left to go elsewhere and make more money. Work you to death never corrected hours for payroll. Couldn’t live off $500 every two weeks with a family and your the only provider.
bad,"I do not have anything nice to say. I learned alot about being a pharmacy tech.   I also learned a lot about favoritism and management that expects you to be a team player, but are not themselves."
bad,No work growth opportunities. Minimal pay. No anual raises. They require choirs from only associates. Includes scrubbing toilets. This place is the most unsanitary place to be.
bad,Unsafe place to work because we don’t have security and the company care more about money then employees and I feel like I do my best do multi skills and work hard and I don’t get recognized
bad,"Poorly managed. Schedule was handled poorly and obviously favored certain employees and the manager did nothing to fix the situation. Manager demanded so much of you, but then when you say no treated you badly as if you'd never done anything to help the team. Corporate could care less about the day to day operations and only care about survey number and other stats."
bad,"They show no appreciation to hard working employees and reward those who slack in there job duties. Most managers pass on there job duties to the assistant and shift managers, they are rarely make appearances at locations."
bad,"The local Walgreens was often a nightmare to work for. While your fellow employees were general nice and well spirited, customers would often be drunk or scary in the closing hours. No security, often alone up front with cigarettes, constant theft and confrontation, and I couldn't do it anymore. Not for minimum wage."
bad,"The workplace environment was stressful not only because of inhumane workload requirements, but the workplace culture was severely biased and bigoted."
bad,I loved what I did at Walgreens and most of my coworkers but the management there was awful. My job was outsourced to India for cheaper labor. I would not recommend this company to my worse enemy.
bad,Upper management does not consider the everyday stresses when budgeting. Stress is out of control. I sometimes feel they set people up to fail in their positions
bad,"Complete lack of communication; poor management of employees, low morale amongst employees "
bad,Upper management not forthcoming on position and store/pharmacy condition.  Quick to try to punish for company's lack of training of incoming pharmacy interns/pharmacists. Company lack of knowledge of projected influx of business and not giving enough tech hours to compensate for influx.  Lack of trust in seniority pharmacist capability.  Company bit off more than could chew with Alliance Boots merger and now Rite Aid.  Had to liquidate too many stores to acquire another company.  Not good business tactics but only to line pockets of upper echelons.   WAS a great company to work for but the customer is no longer a priority.
bad,"If you respect yourself and wish to achieve great things in life, this would be a very poor company to side with.  Expect to be treated the same as the worst worker in your department.  Walgreens will never care about you, your family, or your long term goals.  They wish to have a weak minded group of people that will only say yes instead of standing for what is right.  They preach about being happy and healthy all the time. However, when it is time for them to actually have a reason to thank their employees, all you can expect is a cheap, burnt hamburger and hot dog and feel lucky if you get any cheese."
bad,".Very Stressful "
bad,"Manager has a poor management skills. Only cares about the job, but not its employees. Employees are exhausted, attendance policy is ridiculous 5 day absence in one year! which is 365 days. Ridiculous!!"
bad,"The job itself really wouldn't have been bad, it was mainly a managerial issue at hand. There would be employees who did not do their job (stood around all day, played on their phones, avoided responsibility). Management did NOTHING about these employees, there were absolutely no consequences. Instead, all of the hardworking employees were expected to pick up the slack. There were only a few of us actually doing our jobs so it was extremely overwhelming to go into work everyday because I knew that I would be stuck doing too many things in such a short amount of time. Also, they refused to work around my schedule, which is ultimately why I quit. Also, training was not good and I was essentially thrown onto the photo counter in the middle of the Christmas rush last year. Ever since I left, everyone I have come into contact with says that ""I'm lucky I left when I did, because it's gotten even worse."""
bad,"With all the work you have to do and not having enough staff, it can get very stressful. It also doesn't help that the company continues to cut hours while adding in more work. The changes that are happening really don't make any sense."
bad,They your opinion count. Your opinion do not count the rate is too high. One minute late your an hour late. 20 min. Break starts when the call for break your late after no minute. You can’t leave the building
bad,The company's direction had taken a turn for the worse and lost its culture and care for the people they employ.It was a solid company years ago but now it is headed in the wrong direction.
bad,"When I first started at Walgreens, the management style and benefits were decent. Now xx years later, not so much."
bad,"stressful enviroment, untrustworthy leadership. they only care about the stock holder. employees are underpaid and overworked. very dishonest bonus program looks for any way to take money out of their managers pockets."
bad,Apart from my manager that I learned a lot from. Advancement was nearly impossible scheduling was fairly random. The pay was very low and not reasonable for the expected workload.
bad,The store I worked at was horrible. The manager couldn't set up a schedule that worked for anyone. It was always sporadic when i would work. I would also get called in constantly.
bad,The company itself is a good company to work for BUT the managers are awful to work for. they sucked the life out of me. The pay is not worth the stress and weight they put on you. I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy.
bad,"Bad management, always understaffed, expect to do the work of 3 employees but get paid minimum wage."
bad,"incompetent managers and product owners, huge ego issues and bossy attitude made life diificult for workers. No professionalism at all and no appreciation for work."
bad,"They were very unprofessional at the walgreens I worked at, the managers always showed favoritism to some of the other managers that worked there plus the pharmacy staff. ALWAYS UNDERSTAFFED. Never gave enough hours to the people who actually wanted and need them"
bad,I was the only man who could lift heavy boxes. I also was suppose to run the photo lab. Manager never could be found. When finally tracked down acted like busy when sleeping or smoking cigarettes. Always was walking on eggshells.
bad,"When I first started working at Walgreens the company was amazing I was happy with my pay and benefits. Then everything started to decline they started eliminating management positions and paying them less for the same amount of work. The for first 5 years of being with this company upper management was knowledgeable and I very much respected them, unfortunately in  the last few years this very much declined I was having to teach skills to people who where above me but what else should Walgreens expect when they don't pay their employees enough"
bad,"lack of staff, very poor management, way to much work, extremely little pay, customers think that just cause you work in a pharmacy automatically you are a doctor or pharmacist."
bad,The particular Walgreens I worked for had an OCD antisocial Pharmacy Manager.  He was harsh to the customers and would freak outs on employees constantly.
bad,"The pharmacists are wonderful and would do anything to help you succeed. Unfortunately, they do not have the support of the store manager to make logical and beneficial decisions. They are all about cutting costs whether it hurts their employees or not."
bad,"This company no longer values hard work and loyalty. They  take hours and expect more work. They get rid of people who have pride and loyalty, so they can pay less wages."
bad,This is not the company that it used to be. If you plan on retiring from the company you need not worry about it because they will get rid of you before you can make a good salary and start collecting any of your benefits. Upper management does not care who goes as long as their pay check keeps coming.
bad,"The store manager makes all the difference. I've worked in multiple stores, the ones where I didn't dread work had good managers. They used to be a better company to work for but in the 10 years I was there, they lowered all benefits and capped pay for hourly (and possibly salary) employees."
bad,Well I would say this was the easiest job I work for about 6 months . But they have no direct management or enforcement they don't know what they are doing 95% of the time and choose to hold the employees back and accountable when something goes wrong
bad,Worked there at various locations for a year and some of them are good to work at you just have to have a good location.  Some of the locations I worked at were worthless.
bad,"This was the most soul-sucking job I ever had.  The management both in the stores and from corporate were awful.  Every year, more and more benefits were taken away yet we were expected to do more with less and smile about it.  Horrible place to work."
bad,A typical day at work consists of filling prescriptions in a fast paced environment. There is a lot of micromanagement and you can't make decisions on your own.
bad,"Walgreens is not a very good place to work, they are constantly changing their rules, trying to get you to ""multi task"" and ""manage your time"", while not understanding that you are but one person. i can not sit there, and take care of customers, while i am trying to clean the back room, take care of photo, and whatever nonsense they have me doing that day, it's the work of two or three people and they want you to do it all some how when you have a line of customers constantly at your register, and wonder why you didn't get any of your tasks done, but then have the nerve to go and say ""wow, we were really busy today"" once we close...I don't understand these people, why not hire more employees to lift some of the burden off of everyone else. $9.25 an hour is not enough for this place, i recommend avoiding this place entirely, because once you are in, they will play you for a fool, promising promotion and better pay, work you to the bone, then wait for you to quit, they won't even fire you because they don't want to have to pay for any of the unemployment you might try to get, and instead keep making things harder on you until you walk out."
bad,Learned a lot working here. Management was horrible. Customers were often great. Coworkers were awesome still great friends with a few. Other than the lack of basic management skills its a wonderful job.
bad,"The company is not what it used to be!  There is no longer any support for management.  It was once a great company, but that time has passed!!!   It is no longer what you know, but how good you can kiss the right behind!"
bad,I was with this company for less than a year because I couldn't bear even for a day. There is no corporate culture. No scope for learning. It is like a dictatorship kind of environment.
bad,"became a certified pharmacy technician before applying to Walgreens Pharmacy. the Pharmacy manager  was hostile and extremely disrespectful of race and culture, denied me the required training. Even after an HR meeting, nothing changed."
bad,"Poor work environment , haphazard staffing, inconsistent support for pharmacy needs, poor management, high rate of turnover. High volume with sweat shop like conditions. Lots of room for advancement because lots of people leaving."
bad,"They treat people terribly, have no respect for their employees, outside of decent pay I would never tell anyone I know to apply to work for Walgreens. People of color aren't always treated fairly."
bad,"They ask you to perform as if your getting paid $20 per hr. In other words, they want you to work as if you are two employees working the same shift..."
bad,"waited on customers, sold them their medications. Data entry, spoke to patients and insurance companies on a daily basis. Checked in medication orders and stocked them. Typed prescriptions and filled them. Worked the drive-thru window."
bad,This company has gone down hill since when i first started working here. Will do anything to screw you over and not pay you what your worth. I hate coming to this place everyday. Doesnt care about its employees. Its a greedy greedy company that always find ways to cut costs. Even at the expenses of the employees. Dont work here. Unless you have to. This company is a joke. Be ware
bad,"Lots of turnover. Lots of transfers. You can be moved from 1 location to the next at the drop of a hat. Worked for 5 different managers and 5 different DMs in the last 2.5 years.Zero job security. Company is moving from a older more experienced workforce to a younger, cheaper version."
bad,"Liked how this job worked with my home life but the cost of that was ridiculous. Management was unreachable. Direct supervisor was moody, addicted to prescription medication and plotted to make comment(s) to upper management which led to my unemployment. This job is only for people who need a paycheck, not worth the hassle and definitely would not recommend this job for people who work hard and expect it to get them somewhere."
bad,Don't apply at walgreens in Butte mt terrible management Good company to work for has Good photo department management is worthless
bad,"High-paced fast environment, keeps you from getting bored. Learned a lot of foundational pharmacy skills. But current management (my location in particular)- is AWFUL, which is why I'm leaving. Very unorganized and leads to chaotic days. Schedule comes out day before week stars, and is only made one week at a time. Can never plan around for anything on advanced notice- is always last minute. Co-worked (excluding management) are fine, easy to work with. "
bad,"I worked there for close to 6 months, and I'm honestly surprised that I was able to last that long. The managers could care less about your life outside of work, as long as they had a body to work in one of the departments. There were times where I would work for 14+ days straight with no day off, even after talking to a manager about it. After two months of working there I got promoted to the Pharmacy, which I was originally excited about... until I learned the reality of really being back there. The pharmacists were rude, and so were the other techs. They all openly talked about how much they hated their jobs, which made working back there even worse. I honestly working back in the pharmacy being a liability for myself, because there were a lot of illegal things that occurred that could DEFINITELY cause you to lose your job, license, and get some jail time. Overall, I wouldn't suggest this company to anyone who is looking for employment. There are many other places to choose from that will be much better for you, I guarantee that."
bad,"Over the 5 years I have been with the company I have seen it gone down hill. I use to enjoy my job, but it seems like they expect more out of the floor employees and just let the managers sit in the office and do no work. I can only speak for my store and the few I have helped cover shifts around the area, but it is not a ""lead by example"" environment. "
bad,"They do not care if you have any medical issues, physical or mental, even if you have Doctor recommendations or notes.  Their primary concern is how many prescriptions you can pump out in a days work. "
bad,cant raise a family on tech salary.   hours are horrible and so are the customers.  keep cutting hours and expect as much work if not more from employees.
bad,"Had to be at work for 3:00 pm until 10:30-11:00 pm. I hated that part of the job. I would fill prescriptions,answer phones and give good customer service."
bad,The hours they want you to work are not accomodating for family life.  Poor management within the company.  Also the policies that need to be followed are ridiculous.
bad,"Worked as an Assistant Manager for almost 10 years.  As an Assistant manager we were expected to work crazy schedules rain, snow, sleet or shine.  Don't get sick, have a family emergency or just wanna rest, its like World War III if you call out as a manager.  The stores are open 365 days a year, and schedules change constantly.  Not ideal for anyone with young children or with a life.  I got so frustrated I actually quit because of the strain the position put on me mentally and physically.  I can say I learned a lot in the position, but towards the end began to truly hate the company because they wanted us to do more work for less pay and dwindling benefits."
bad,Walgreen's doesn't care about it's employees at all.  They use each employee until there is nothing left.  There is very little chance of moving up without making best friends with management.  Working hard and doing the job correctly don't matter in promotions.  They want the ones who are doing the best job to stay in that position to do all the work.
bad,"The Walgreens call center (CPO) was a very stressful and unhealthy work environment. There were so much expectations from the pharmacists and technicians, but there were very little or no trainings at all. The whole environment was very unprofessional. The schedules are unstable and does not provide a healthy work/ life balance. Some of the technicians were uncertified and they were also allowed to supervise pharmacists, which is totally against the Florida Law.  There is a very unfair attendance policy which is getting a lot of pharmacist and technicians fired for no reasons. There are no opportunities for growth. Walgreens need to do better with this call center."
bad,This companies management ethics seem to neglect employee moral and cause a general anxiety and disapproval through poorly maintained expectations in correlation to working environment. Counter productive hypocrisy towards employee well-being.
bad,"You are managed and ranked by metrics you have no control over. Your supervisors talk down to you and make you feel beneath them. Every other month there is rumor that they are closing the department, which they finally did."
bad,Work all year long. No more opportunities use to be much better
bad,"Walgreens managers are blatantly RUDE, CONNIVING, and manipulative. they talk to you like you ar a speck and mean nothing to them or the company. but to the customers, this is all hidden. when complaints are filed, managers retaliate.. and HR turns a blind eye. ive seen it for many years. if you are leaving a company with a good culture, i urge you to reconsider... and RUN AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. it is the greatest career mistake ive ever made."
bad,"I like working at Walgreens I enjoy  having employment, A typical day is stocking cigarettes and ringing up customers. sometimes I work at the cosmetic area where I sale beauty products to customers."
bad,"A typical work day can be anywhere from 8 to 11 hours a day and includes a minimum of 2 week ends per month. On week days, providers are expected to work until 8 or 9pm based on company needs. "
bad,Walgreens does not treat their employees well at all. The pharmacist are very overworked and the management does not care. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with the work flow with minimal help and decreased staffing. The coworkers I had were awesome but very frustrated with the lack of staffing and budget cuts.
bad,"Imagine going to work where nobody cares about deadlines, nobody cares about being backed up, and the managers don't care than none of the employees underneath them care. The managers were in the entry cubicles at one point, and they didn't seem to try to change how things worked."
bad,The pay is ok but that is the only thing. You will run around and push tubs and totes all day while the maintenance managers chosen few buddies do what ever they like when ever they want. If you didn't grow up with the maintenance manager or work with him at his old BASF plant that shut down then don't apply the highest paying positions are numbered and filled by his friends while they hire new work horse's like you to do all the work.
bad,"Work in a photo lab. I run film through a (fuji/noritsu) machine (we have also had a greytag machine). The machine processes film then a film scanner converts it to digital. From there we edit photo on a computer using the walgreens software. We also take in digital orders and just about any digital device that store photos including phones. On top of running and keeping the machines up with maintenance, I also work as a part of the walgreens team, which includes some manual labor of moving things on the sales floor, and customer service (as well as being a cashier)."
bad,"Very poor place to work. This place is constantly hiring and firing incompetent people to work. If you have half a brain, be prepared to have all your hours cut because they're going to hire your replacement. Management does not properly train employees, but throws them out there to fend for themselves, and complains when tasks are still not done properly (because the employee didn't know how). Job advancement is a slow process, and really depends on how much management likes you, not your abilities/accomplishments. The hours are tough too, don't be surprised to get off at midnight and be expected to pull a double the next day at 7 am. Nothing is personal, you're just a another number and management doesn't care about you or your will to achieve."
bad,People in this place will literally work work work and in lunch time will mostly keep to themselves. It was so depressing working here. This company is known to hire herds of employees from agencies as temp-to-hire and fire nearly 80% of them give or take before it is their time to make them full time and give them benefits. The Pay to Procure department is the most boring work you will do in the company and management in that department is a joke.
bad,Will show you no loyalty regardless of what you do for them. I was an assistant manager for them for seven years and leaving them was the best decision I ever made. They will stab you in the back to suit their purposes. Only thing that is portent at Walgreens is the big wigs at the top. 
bad,"Working in North Houston area."
bad,Walgreens Pharmacy is emerging in retail setting. Yet there is limited room for advancement.
bad,"The management staff at store level is being taken advantage of. Recently they docked pay and job titles, but didn't take away from the work load. The employees (such as cashiers and photo techs) are barely given enough training to do their jobs. In addition to that most of the training is from the 80's."
bad,"Taking orders, answering telephone, inventory,customer complaints, scheduling"
bad,But for my review on the job I'll give it a f because they more concern on they average handling time then making sure their patients happy an satisfty
bad,Eliminating assistant manager position to put them in a lower one so they can pay them less money.
bad,very stressful....lots of cuts.....support personnel very thinly distributed.....company wants more and more and more with less and less help..only interested in numbers and how many rx's can be done in limited period of time not how many customers/pts can be helped.....totally on pins and needles when at work....very fearful of mistake/misfill.....
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers. On a typical day various assignments are delegated out , which is an important task in order to get everything done."
bad,New structure make it harder for advancement. Keep cutting wages while maintaining the same level or responsibility.
bad,"I have been with this company for 3 years, and watched 6 other managers either get fired or leave due to our DC manager. Some of these managers were veterans with the company. We have had the company look into the high leadership turnover, and the 41% employee turnover. Our DC manager is very retaliatory, and all the remaining managers there fear for their jobs everyday. Most of the managers would leave if they could. The employees are always treated like garbage, and the worst is always assumed. Stay away from the Pendergrass DC in GA."
bad,when the Walgreen family was still in charge it was great. After the last one left the company seemed to lose their focus.
bad,"Seriously, don’t subject yourself to the corporate corruption. The company claims to care about their employees, but really all that they care about is the bottom line."
bad,I was at Walgreen for 4 months before I decided they were not making me feel like i was apart of a team. I got hired as a Pharmacist and ended up working as a CSA. I didn't get trained appropriately.
bad,"This company was terribly unorganized, employee hostile, and could not keep good employees. I was expected to work over my shift. I was stuck on the drive through for hours with no break. Technicians were allowed to fill on my employee number. We were always under staffed."
bad,"This company doesn't care about work/home balance, they take advantage of their employees, and there is alot of repercussions if you have a problem with anything. They don't train thier employees properly or fully. Not a very good company to work for."
bad,"This company cares fantastically about it's customers, but it's employees are treated like absolute garbage. One of the worst places I have ever been a manager."
bad,Walgreen shut down our store . then offered employees to work hours away from their homes. I wouldn't recommend to work for this company.. They don't care about their staff
bad,"If the store manager likes you, you may succeed. Its clear that she wants to run the show. If you don't like her show, they will find every reason to set you up for failure and push you out. They will even send you a pharmacist not properly trained to be your partner to increase your chances of failure. You will be behind all the time and expected to finish all kinds of tasks with no manager support. In fact, she tells her staff not to help the pharmacy.  No TEAMwork at this location. Avoid if you can so long as this store manager is still in place"
bad,I make the same wage the new hires make. The new store manager i have doesn't help the employees. We don't have enough hours to have an extra person on in the morning. The customer's get mad they need to get to work and i am only 1 person..
bad,"This was the worst place I’ve ever worked at. No compassion from co-workers and management, they work you like a dog, don’t follow rules with safety, rude customers (because everyone that works there has an attitude problem)."
bad,"The company works us like dogs under terrible conditions. Not eveough help, and expect us to do more and more for not enough money. The pharmacist try their best stay way beyond the hours scheduled without getting paid just so we can survive."
bad,"Don't expect to go anywhere here. You will never get anywhere and will always be payed the minimum no matter how long you work there. If you are young you WILL work the worst shifts and if you ever call in sick there will ALWAYS be backlash. Management will sit in the office while the ""young"" kids do all the work. The job isnt safe you will be harassed by homeless men and they will get in your face and no one will be there to help you. They also have no problem letting a young girl working til 12:30am while the store is closed alone with the male co-workers, It is insane what they do there."
bad,"Gave this company 15 years of my life. Last 4-5 years I, personally, was pretty unhappy- working under lots of pressure with a skeleton crew. Came early and left late without being compensated for my time. Did not get a raise or a bonus in the last 4 years. I currently am working at a dispensary and am very happy. Just the thought of going back to retail chain gives me major anxiety."
bad,Corporate leadership has been poor for at least 10 years. Currently stores are understaffed and corporate leadership is absent. Employees are not given the minimum tools needed to succeed.
bad,"Working for the company was painful as a pharmacy tech at the west chester store on Bradford. Management would not help pharmacy, Refused to come back to relieve for breaks. Sometimes you didnt get any breaks. No communication. Spiteful remarks to staff. Racist remarks towards Spanish speaking customers. The pharmacy manager works hard but the management treats her horribly and she should sue them."
bad,"I worked at ""one of the good stores"" but the place was just a dang mess. Corporate is an utter useless cancer sucking the life out of the workers. The new CEO is burning the candle at both ends. The minimum wage is half decent but do not ever expect much if anything of a raise. I was treated as a scapegoat for hours. "
bad,STAT AWAY from here. Management is a joke. Wages are good but they treat employees bad. You never know from one minute to another if you can leave even if your shift is over. They will tell you 10 minutes before you are to leave that you have to stay up to 12 or more hours.
bad,This company as a whole is not a bad company. They do provide many benefits and offer a decent pay. But at my particular location the work expierence was horrible. I had a store manager who refused to leave the office and participate in any of the duties that were important in keeping the location running well. If it wasnt for the assistant the store more than likley wouldn't even have a chance.
bad,"Walgreens does not really care much about their workers mental health, at least the walgreens I worked at did not. I would never work back at walgreens, I was bullied by two of my shift leaders for quite some time. They paid good, that's the ONLY reason I stayed as long as I did."
bad,"The general manager was hostile. The job itself was perfect and so was compensation but dealing with the general manager was impossible because of his rudeness, manipulation, and attitude/behavior towards employees."
bad,Walgreen Company is Where I served faithfully for 12 years without ever being promoted and barely received any bonuses incentives or raises. I also learned Spanish from rapport built with Hispanic clientele.
bad,I worked here as a frontline manager for just a year.  The employees are compensated well but the frontline managers like me had to jump through hoops each day trying to get all the assigned tasks that were given to us daily.  The upper managers had no idea how to take care of employees and how to reward or encourage good workers.  They kept trying to make the employees do more and never seemed to appreciate good hard work.  Us frontline managers were micro managed daily and told to do stuff that we knew would not be successful due to our day to day work knowledge.  But it did not matter to the upper management folks.  They kept coming up with stupid ideas that did not work and only made our jobs harder to do.  When we tried to talk to them we were told to shut up and do as we were told.  They never listened to our suggestions or ideas.  They kept coming up with ways to make us jump through hoops for no apparent reason.  I will never recommend this company to any mid level managers that are considering working here.
bad,"They pay okay , and have some benefits. After that.... they are horrible awful humans running a meat grinder. They don’t care about anyone and encourage getting rid of fully vested employees. They work you like a slave and don’t care! It’s a huge company with zero compassion for people with families and will work you 12 hours plus. Only a good  job for someone with a strong back and needs the $$$!  needs the $$$!"
bad,"Walgreens is a terrible terrible company to work for. The pay is below most of their competitors. Senior management sets unrealistic expectations, especially considering they have cut store budget hours in half in the last 2-3 years. Stressful environment. They expect perfection when it comes to customer service yet the employees are not given the support they need to achieve this. Walgreens cares about $$$$, not about their employees"
bad,I hated working here.  I gave them 18 yrs and was treated like you’re nothing.  They make you work all the time and have no life with your kids.  They don’t train and leave you to figure it out on your own.  Don’t work here
bad,The morale is depressing and even being a positive person it gets to you. Everyday you feel beaten down because of the work hours and the never ending quarterly raising of rates. It’s hard to watch older people who were there since the beginning struggle to make the rate and sad because their benefits were suddenly taken away. If you want to wish away every week day this might be the job for you.e totes that food went in were at times disgusting. The coworkers were great and the only reason that I made it through the day. Some managers are good while others had no business being promoted. However they have no real power to create the changes the company needs There are far better places and far better jobs than this one.
bad,"Management was not only incompetent, one manager named Ernest took a picture of me and printed it in order to write me up. The environment was super hostile, and the hours were poor, communication was non existent, and the store itself is falling apart. "
bad,"When i started at Walgreens, the company cared about its employees and customers. Recently (past 7-8 years) all focus is placed on making shareholders happy. Walgreens keeps you distracted by forcing you to have excessive meetings and tasks.  If you raise a concern,  you are labeled as disengaged and pressured to quit or you are simply fired for very minor offenses."
bad,"Poor management, full of gossip. Managers talk poorly about employees to other employees. Conversations that should be held behind closed doors are talked about on the sales floor. Walgreens is sinking like the Titanic, either jump off or sink with it."
bad,"Working closing shifts and opening shifts together. Managers that watch cameras and micromanage you. Treating you terrible. Working Christmas Day just to hear everyone say, “I’m sorry you’re working.” The best thing I’ve done for myself is to leave that company and I would not recommend them."
bad,"This was once a great company to work for until they sold it. I have wonderful coworkers. The clientele is good, the management is not so good. People call in alot and nothing gets done about it"
bad,"The Company does not care it's Employees or their Safety. In a location where there are more unstable and high Theft rate the Company refuses to get Security, making Employees really unease and stress."
bad,"The company only cares about themselves. Never the employee!! My store was one of the worst of all, my store manager ignored every problem that she approached. For example, if two coworkers were arguing, she sat there and did nothing."
bad,i found this place to be dull and boring. my manager was always complaining he hardly had nothing positive to say. he was in charge of writing the schedules and hardly ever gave me the weekends off and found this to be unfair. he hired a new girl and started her pay higher than what i was getting even though i had been there for over 4 years.
bad,Incredible boring work with very little advancement. Strong corporate presence putting making money over employee happiness or mental health. Increasing duties while wages are stagnant
bad,They’ll run you into the ground. Get far away. It’s a company that wants results on the cheap. You’ll work every holiday so someone can get cigs. Nope
bad,"Upper management will do and say anything to help some and not others.  Popularity contest, only care about the numbers not you.  Seasoned employees being weeded out to leverage payroll and start over with new staff at lower rate."
bad,worked for Walgreens for 10years & each year they cut hours but as more services/task & expect the same amount of work done this isnt good businessssz
bad,This company has no care for their employees no matter how long you’ve been with them. I was mistreated by a manager and they didn’t care at all even tho I had been with them for 15 years and that manager less than a year. They only take care of upper management the ones who actually do ALL the work are pushed to the side.
bad,Tienen un excelente programa que involucra a todo los empleados pero la reduccion de horas en las tiendas hacen de este programa un gran obstaculo al tener que realizar con tan pocas horas y personal.
bad,"Hours are ALWAYS getting cut almost every week. I am fulltime and I have been getting way under what full time should be. I changed my availability and I still get scheduled the same hours, which is most nights. I have requested more hours and different shifts and nothing has changed. Part-time employees are getting more hours than I am. They expect you to get so much done with almost no employees. I've been here for 3 years and have had 3 store managers. No shift lead is the same person since I started. There are about 3 other employees that are still the same since I started working. There are new rules about a lot of stuff and so much is changing. PTO rules have changed which I think is stupid. I have had the same amount for about a month now."
bad,The people who they have hired due to needing people so bad has went down hill so therefore the company is suffering. Never a set schedule it changes everyday.
bad,"An awful experience from day one.  Unorganized, understaffed, just a circus most every day!  Finally looking up a bit after 7 months when I quit.  Definitely worse job experience I’ve had due to miscommunication or lack of it."
bad,Senority non existent. Friends in upper positions forced out. HR a joke. Had issues . They made me out to be crazy. I was forced out. CRW1 aghast. I’m sure spinning in his grave. The Walgreen family not in charge was catastrophic for this company. Pity
bad,I got fired for counting down a register that was short. So with that my final answer is walgreens sucks. I did manage to get them in trouble with the Texas Board of Pharmacy for unlicensed people working in the pharmacy.. Karma will get you especially to Walgreens in Galveston Texas on 61st Street..
bad,I gave Walgreens seven years of my life. I relocated to a store that was a forty-five minute commute one way. They then made me reinterview for the job I’d been doing for seven years. They decided I wasn’t qualified for it any longer and offered me a pay cut of over $6.00 an hour and a lower position or a severance package. I took the severance and never looked back. Getting let go by Walgreens was the best thing that ever happened to me career wise.
bad,Poor upper management. They don’t care about employees or customers. They just want you to agree with them and there are clear favorites. There is no consistency in treatment of employees. Nothing happens to District Managers that harass and discriminate.
bad,They could be a lot better to many changes that don’t benefit the employees only the company. They’re eliminated to many benefit and increasing work load
bad,"Walgreens used to be a decent company to work for. Unfortunately, with the onset of new corporate management in that last two years hours have been drastically cut and workloads haven't truly been reduced. Unless you have a good manager, raises are almost impossible. You will be lucky to get 25c in a year. "
bad,"I worked at Walgreens for almost 9 years. The company was a good place to work as far as retail goes up until a couple years ago. Then the company made a lot of changes to policies, procedures, and the direction the company's going. Now they want you to work more with less. No overtime, low hourly budgets, no focus on customer shrink, and no incentive to move up. They took basic services away to help maintain the store such as security guards, parking lot cleaning, landscaping, and bathroom cleaning so now all of this is put on the employees on top of getting daily tasks and priority tasks done. The only reason I would still recommend working at Walgreens is to get experience to move on to something better as soon as you've learned the tricks of the trade."
bad,Walgreens drains you. My coworkers are lovely and we're truly a pharmily but in all honestly the company does not care about their employees. They take hours from your store but then give you more tasks to do.
bad,I have been with the company for a while now I started at minimum wage with 30 plus years experience SBA got eliminated now I am cashier it is wrong I know more than most managers
bad,"I worked for Walgreen back in 2013. The management at that time was horrible and unfair. The expected you to do things in a timely fashion with little time to work with. One manager got upset with me, saying that I didn't pick up a greeting card off the floor. I was working in Health and beauty aides. I asked how I would know that this item was on the floor while working another dept. He said I should have seen it when I went on break. One of the night managers actually threw me out of the store because he said I called him over the speaker too loud. I went in the next day and told the day manager what happened.They had me file a report. They didn't fire him so I quit.If they want people to stay with the company they would treat the help better.They didn't understand why I was quitting and said I was such a good worker."
bad,When working in Walgreens there is already a set up in certain districts the district I worked in was no room for growth because for the next 10 years pretty much the company had everything set up as far as moving up in the company . No matter if you are more qualified or not .
bad,I worked for the company for over 10years because of my child. The only reason was the flexibility to my schedule. I was NOT paid well at all. For the amount of work I had to do and the stress. For a first time job it will teach you a lot and is well worth it if you work for a good manager. But long term NO. If anything go to the pharmacy and work back there. Do not be a front end employee. Oh and they cap their employees pay. So if your front end you get capped at $12. You will not get a raise. Use them as a steppingstone and leave. The company as whole don't care about the front end employee cause you're a dime a dozen.
bad,"Don’t get into retail if you can, it just wears you out and you end up forgetting why you got into healthcare in the first place. Walgreens is so profit-driven right now that it lost its mission and doesn’t provide enough support for its employees."
bad,"Horrific Work/Life Balance. Never saw my family. Work staff was very difficult to train, even at the basic levels of understanding. I did my best with what I had to work with."
bad,"Inconsistent scheduling, 7+ day work weeks, typical retail h*ll. Not intellectually challenging, but emotionally and psychologically draining. So, again, regular retail h*ll. You're expected to suffer through making this place your entire life for the oh-so-promising honeypot of becoming a store manager. Girl, bye."
bad,"Extremely stressful and demanding not enough help during busy time - the instruction on entry level was not enough-- in a lower store volume, thr traing was much improved"
bad,"I love being a Store Manager but with the company culture quickly changing and people not getting rewarded for over exceeding corporate targets set in place, it has been a company that I no longer want to work for.  Walgreens continually cuts your budgets and does not reward you for to hard work that you put in. They also fire managers that have been with the company for a very long time for ridiculous reasons when the real reason is because they make too much money and would rather pay an inexperienced manager much less. Your annual bonus is also nothing now even if you work hard to make all of your targets because of poor decisions that the company made that had nothing to do with you. It is sad that a company that I used to believe in has turned into a money hungry business that does not care about their devoted people."
bad,Walgreens is on a quick ride downhill. Took away all our benefits and continue destroying employee morale on a daily basis. Cut hours repeatedly and trying to force out long term employees.
bad,"I frequently had nightmares about saying ""welcome to Walgreens"" everybody hated working there, the management never let me leave the register. I never got to talk to anybody, not even the customers. the extent of my conversations were ""hi did you find everything"" ""yes I'm not an idiot"" ""ok have a nice day"" ""yeah"" and then on to the next customer."
bad,"Working at Walgreen's is a double edge sword, you'll meet some nice people working there, but everything else will be quite lack luster. Its a good first job for young kids but that's about it."
bad,"Everyday it’s something different going on. Most of the time it’s always stressful, whether you’re getting yelled at by customers cause their coupons won’t go through or it’s because a team member didn’t get their break on time. Always coming back late from lunch and break. Randomly leave to go get their kids from school. Some managers and employees sit in th back on their phones and sit and talk and eat for hours on end. Always talking bad about one another. When you ask for your break you got yelled at. Vendors are very rude sometimes, working with warehouse is horrible. I’m  very short. I had to lift 65-70 pound totes up and over me to stack them up. Had to put 30-50 cases of water up all by myself. You have to stock the cooler  and freezer. Overall it’s just an emotionally and physically draining place to work."
bad,"Walgreens used to be a fun place to work at, when I thought the sky was the limit in climbing the corporate ladder. I was hired having never worked in a pharmacy before. I started as a technician-in-training. Kind of got thrown to the wolves actually. The store I applied to was a busy one and so they told me to drive an hour south to get to a less busy store to be trained in at. However, all I was doing was filling scripts there, no one really taught me how to do my job. Then I came back to my original pharmacy after 2 weeks and they found out I hadn't learned anything other than filling. Instead of teaching me or sending me back for training, they expect me to somehow know how to do everything! Shaking my head, anyway, fast forward a year after I self-teach myself all the basics.... I take the exam. Walgreens pays for you to take the Pharmacy Technician Certification exam, which is nice as it is like a hundred bucks or something... Anyway, I pass the test and am to get a promotion!! Because I am certified now! I was promised a dollar raise but instead I get a measely 25 cents?!!? Wow. Shaking my head. All this time though it is super stressful at work, Walgreens keeps buying out new pharmacies and so the customer volume increases. Rather than giving us more hours to work, corporate cuts our hours!!!! Because somehow they expect our workload to ... go down??? After they just bought out a drugstore close by??? Man I am just ranting.... Anyway, managers keep promising us that it will get better. It's been 2 years after I passed my certification test... And let me tell you, it"
bad,"Walgreens teaches you many things from making sure all the medicine and food are not expired, how to order things for customers, how to price the items correctly. I have learned a lot working at Walgreens."
bad,Worst job I’ve ever had management talk about employees and create drama. I applied for a part time job and was juggling high school while working 40 hours when I clearly said part time. The manager would tell me when we hire someone new we’ll give you less hours she’s hired up to 10 employees I still had the same hours. I was never trained EVER I stayed at the register while everyone else did totes or photo I never did anything. I called corporate and she hired new people to try and replace me. I worked there since February and left in September we had like 11 people who left including me 12 it’s a horrible job. One person quit after a day and another after 2 weeks.
bad,"Been promised a job promotion only to have the manager rescind the offer because he didn't actually have the job available as it turned out."
bad,"This place is going under fast. They changed to 4 10 hour days to cut costs and then call mandatory overtime and calling you in on your day off. A typical week is 60 hours. The management is clueless. The place in understaffed and people who know what they are doing are quitting left and right. I can't stress enough how much this place sucks. For a company that promotes happy and healthy- they could care less about the health of their employees. Also, they went to a locked down campus. I can't even grab lunch or go relax in my car or outside during breaks. They LOCK YOU IN. I would highly recommend anyone not working here."
bad,"The job could be a little strenuous at time but the team member made it bearable by making you feel at home, but the General Manger had poor people skills, and took out any frustration on any crew members."
bad,"Too much micromanaging and employee meeting instead of giving freedom to make decisions appropriate with your position within the company. If you get hurt on the job, forget about ever getting it taken care of. They care more about numbers than they do their employees."
bad,very difficult place to work especially in recent years. they cut our tech hours and increased our workload dramatically with flu shots and other immunizations. no salary increases in 2 years. seem to care much less about their employees than they used to when I first started working for them.
bad,"I would never work for this cheap non promoting, non yearly raise giving, only concerned with profit company again. They will fire you for eating a candy bar weather you have sugar diabetes or not, that's how petty the company really is."
bad,"Sometimes we would be busy, other times we would be slow. Felt like I was always stocking an others barley did anything. Poor follow up with store manager, horrible hours! The only 2 things I liked was the discounts an the everyday customers"
bad,"Walgreens expects more and more each day, with less and less pay and hours. Every week there are more budget cuts. Walgreens prides itself on customer service yet the store never has enough staff/hours to properly maintain that. Corporate suits that have never set foot in a store develope programs that fail misserably. We are bullied into following along until it does finally fail. Does anyone remember ""Be Well"" we had daily meetings, and management would hide and listen to see if you said it. If you didn't say ""Be Well"" you got in trouble."
bad,Walgreens has become a very stressful place to work.  They are constantly cutting the payroll hours and expecting to keep the high level of customer service when they keep cutting our hours so we have no employees there to help customers.
bad,Upper management makes all the money. Raises (if you’re entitled to 1) are less than $0.50. Want so much and give so little in return. It’s stressful.
bad,Did externship it was very busy but overall I learned a lot and people was very nice and patient I was offered a job after my externship but was never called back.
bad,"I worked at the Ottawa Il. location as a shift lead. I did not receive lunch breaks for about half of my shifts due to no other manager being scheduled to cover. Was also scheduled to work 9 days in a row. Both of those examples break Illinois labor laws. This seemed commonplace and accepted at this location."
bad,"It okay. Usaually, I scan items for customers and put them in bags. So, the customers can be on there way out. Also, if they want to return a product that they don't want or got the wrong product, I handle returns as well. I scan the rfn code on the receipt nad then scan the product. Returning their money back in moneyor debit and credit. Also, I clean my area as well."
bad,"There is hardly any allowed days off for being sick. If you miss 5 days or more you are at risk of being fired, and that includes when you have notes from doctors."
bad,"If you want to stuck in an entry position making 10 cent raise once a year, this is the job for you. They don't care about the little people. I served this company for 6 years. I quit because after all my raises I only got paid 8,99"
bad,"Shift Lead/Assistant Manager/ Store Manager positions are extremely stressful.  Labor Hours are continually cut and standards must be maintained with less help.  Way too many responsibilities and tasks for the help provided.  Middle/upper management have little/no respect or empathy for frontline team members at store level and foster an environment that provides very little positive feedback or support. Basically, suck it up and get it done. Other than that.... store manager salary is pretty good, benefits and insurance are great and 401k matches 1-1."
bad,Would not work here again. No benefit worth the working for this company. Walgreens is no longer the standard for pahrmacy care in America. Wont even shop there anymore.
bad,"Walgreens is a very poorly managed working place. The worst one is the one located in Downtown Milwaukee, WI in the Grand Avenue Mall. This was the first job I ever obtained. I feel like the store has went down the drain. They have no respect for their employees and when there’s someone who’s sick or hurting, they will brush it off like nothing. They would also say the rudest comments like, “Do you want a bucket?” If you asked to leave because you felt very nauseous. This in fact was said to me and in a nasty manner. I did not take comfort in that and it was well understood. Also, if anyone was to say something about their scheduling it was as if they weren’t heard. They would have to hound the managers to correct the scheduling or even be understanding. Most of the time the managers would have the Customer Service Associates working on their tasks and jobs while they go and sit down. When they were confronted on it, they would lie and say it was our task. I feel this is a very unfair workplace to deal with, on top of the ride and disturbing customers. All of this was just to much to handle for me."
bad,"When I first started the job, the assistant manager was great, and so was the store manager, I was hired on the spot. I was very excited because they suposedly do a lot of community service work, they do not. The store is always busy so there is little down time to complete the tasks they ask you to do. We did work well as a team and every one was willing to help each other out when needed."
bad,Work load is too much and not enough staff to finish work load. Hard work is not recognized or at all appreciated. Pharmacy is always dealing with verbally disrespectful people and no support from mangers in keeping these people out. Customers also can get threatening and we no longer feel safe.
bad,"Too much drama with employees and management, management needs to be trained more. Need better security, working there you can be hurt by the people that’s stealing. Nothing is free, you get nothing for all your hard work."
bad,bad management in a horrible neighborhood i worked hard every day all day and its a sexist job. people or employees especially are unfair and rude. the store i worked at needs help.
bad,"New bosses since company got bought out by Boots. All the Bosses hate there jobs, most go to corporate or leave the company. They are not about taking care of there employees"
bad,the store employees don't have specific roles any more and management tries to make you do their work for them without pay raise.not enough money for the stress of company paper work .
bad,very busy store - not enough employees for the amount of rx filled- patient care is impacted and errors are made simply because of unachieveable expecations by corporate - local store and pharmacy managers are very humble  - its out of their hands
bad,"Started as a shift lead but stepped down instantly. Worse management ever! Manager was beyond lazy, assistant ran the store along with the associates. Pharmacy made all the money yet pharmacist is left alone on the weekends from 2pm-6pm due to budget cuts, what a joke. No pay raises especially if minimum wage goes up that year. Lots of cleaning and busy work given. Very boring, no real perks. Open 365, pharmacy is closed all major Holidays yet store stays open SMH."
bad,"The management expects so much of you, and can be extremely rude and personal with insults. Extremely long hours every day. It’s dangerous to work for 24/7 stores because you’ll get homeless people and drug addicts stealing. We constantly had to call the cops. You’re expected to basically run the store on such low pay. You can only take days off with a minimum of 2-3 months in advance."
bad,"There are very few positive aspects of this job, it's mostly stocking and getting yelled at by customers or bosses. It's usually either burning up in the store or freezing cold depending on the temperature outside."
bad,Talk on phone with representatives from md offices and insurance companies all day. May type rx's all day with no interaction from co-workers all day.
bad,"Usually busy from the time we opened to closing. Technicians at some sites were great and at others poor.  Administered vaccinations, answered questions, called physicians, insurance companies , filled and checked prescriptions in a timely manner.  How to multi-task and get things done quickly.  Hardest part was dealing with and helping irate customers by trying to resolve issues that had been presented."
bad,"*I learned how to be a great manager"
bad,"Very hectic environment with little trained support staff . Management was horrible and never got a break working 10 to 12 hour shifts. The best part of the job was when it was closing time! The quality of the pharmaceuticals has diminished since buying the cheap global products from sub par manufacturers in places like India, Czech Republic and Croatia."
bad,Not enough people to work  so I had to coverall the hours too many expectations that were not achieveable not enough people to Schedule and the customers are too rude
bad,Everyone was looking out for themselves and for new jobs. The pay is VERY low for the amount of work and responsibilities. The manager isn't respected and all the employees are looking for new jobs.
bad,if you are a people’s person and like being around others working in a call center I would not recommend. Very strict job almost unbelievable 10 minutes per week for restroom breaks
bad,"•	Engaging Customers in conversation to make them comfortable with the medication and insurance issues"
bad,My grandmother passed and while I was laying her to rest a coworker called to tell me they fired me. I was mourning so I didn't even care to argue about it over the phone. When I came back sure enough I had been fired over a miscommunication on their part.
bad,"Lack of budget, all the time. Not much to look forward to. Hardly much staff on any shifts. It be nice to have enough employees especially when 90% of the job is customer service."
bad,Management will not take you seriously. They don't pay well. Everything is a joke. You don't get paid days off or sick time. They don't care about their employees.
bad,A typical day at work was at least 5 hours of meetings.  Everyday you are asked how you engaged with your team members and then told by upper management how unsuccessful you were.  The hardest part of the job was never knowing if you were doing the right thing. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team.
bad,Learned a lot from Walgreens but they overwork you typical corporation and retail pharmacy. All about scripts count and money.Work is easy honestly we just don't have enough workers.
bad,"Employees there were great, but management is unprofessional and is always complaining. They never congratulate employees for doing good, they always have five minute meetings telling employees what they're not doing, no one wants to work to be told their not doing enough. Management their are ungrateful and doesn't lead by example."
bad,"Corporate does not care. No raises this year. Past raises were about 1%. Not even close to cost of living. Insurance costs are horrible. Over $100 for any dr visit. $2500-$3000 deductible. Hours cut to 32 from 40. ""But it's not a pay cut"" If hours worked go down, so does a paycheck, therefore it's a decrease in pay. "
bad,"I haven’t worked at another big retail chain besides Walgreens, however by other RPh accounts it is probably very similar to other large retail chains...high volume, not enough employees, extremely stressful."
bad,Poor management. No overtime pay. Poor staffing. Pay is not sufficient for the work load. Inconsistent policies that are not inforced. Lack of support for management. Overall company is good for consumers but not employees.
bad,"Minimal tech help, even at peak times. RPh often works alone, taking care of drive-thru, in-window, cashiering, counseling and flu shots. Coverage from front end is not guaranteed and sometimes useless."
bad,"Working at walgreens was a nightmare for me. My shift leaders would tease me for the way that I speak, which was to proper for them, and they would bully me for being liked so much by customers."
bad,It was hard to work here for as long as i did because its a corporate company. They care more about their customers then their employees. Just be cautious.
bad,Walgreens does not care about their employees. They are money hungry and that is it. If you are good at your job then you get 10 more thrown on top of you. Customers scream in your face and I have found multiple people overdosed in the parking lot. The money is not worth the work.
bad,"Company offers great benefits and pay.  Unfortunately, alot is expected of you.  Patient care is not their top priority.  Fast food chain business model does not wok in pharmacy."
bad,"I enjoyed working with this company when I first started. As the years have gone by and the company has changed hands it has become increasingly difficult to work here. There are less hours, less technicians and more responsibility. We are unfairly treated and not appreciated. It's time to move on and I hope to find better opportunities elsewhere. Sadly, I would not recommend this company to prospective employees."
bad,"Day at work was extremely high paced, never a chance to sit and breathe. Never acknowledged for your work, no bonuses, management was a joke, and my co workers were the only joy."
bad,"My co-workers were fun people to be around but the managers made me want to quit everyday. The managers were very unprofessional, they gossiped to each other and their employees about other people that worked their, they were too lazy to do their jobs so they would give their work to cashiers and assume we didn't need any type of training to do  THEIR WORK, throw little insults at us, and they would lie about something to try to fire you. The only time they were professional was when corporate came for a visit and discussing. They're very unfair and show favoritism. The only way I would go back is if all the managers left. Everybody wanted to quit!"
bad,"Initially, this was a ok place to work, however this soon changed, due to management. I stayed as long as I did, because I had goals that I set for myself,  which included me working my way to the pharmacy. Now, with what I obtained,  I am able to take anywhere. To me, this is and was very much, worth it. On to bigger and better things now."
bad,They are a horrible company to work for they need to hire DM managers and Store Managers and Assistant Manager's that will communicate and care about their team members and actually listen and want to help you grow within the company and acknowledge the good work you you do and point out all the bad stuff tbat they can write you up for! I wouldnt recommend this company to anyone wanting a job i would rather work at McDonald's where they care about you
bad,There are a lot of fun and interesting people that work at Walgreen's. It's not worth it. You have to suck up to your customers to get recognized by management for raises. They removed incentive opportunities in photo and up front. They are slow to cross train people.
bad,Company changes makes it very hard to maintain a work life balance. The number of hours a manager works is unbelievable for the pay. The bonus doesn't make up for the time missed with loved ones.
bad,Working as a technician at walgreens was unprofessional. One technician was expected to work a four person job. They were understaffed every shift I worked.
bad,"Work at Walgreens 14 years, was a hard worker. Over the years the benefits dwindled. If you are a lazy person this is the job for you. The management and Human resources departments are not accountable. Check out the latest terminations of management at the Windsor Distribution Center. Also find out why so many employees quit in recent months, Walgreens has good cultural beliefs, but there management only talks the talk they don't walk the walk. Shop at CVS they treat there employees good."
bad,"Walgreens is a good place to work if you're in the medical field, if not then its not for you.Very strict workplace.Pharmacy would be the best place to work"
bad,"They are continuing to cut hours but expecting the same service levels to exist. They claim to ""take care"" of their employee, but that is just not true any longer. They continue to eliminate positions, or change team member codes to be able to pay them less money."
bad,managemant attitude was non motivating. stressful with a lot of hard work less pay and hours. no team work was being preformed. not a very health enviorment
bad,if you're a manager and want to get promoted it's all about who you know and has nothing to do with work ethic or knowledge. District manager only promotes who he / she wants.
bad,No loyalty here like there seemed to be even a year ago.  Seems to be going downhill quickly. But its still got the walgreens name.  What I always loved about the business no longer exist.
bad,"Absolutely horrible. Once this company switched owners, they have just become power and money hungry. They cut positions left and right. They expect the few hard working employees to pick up the slack of the incompetent employees. You are COMPLETELY underpaid for what they expect from you. Upper management is a JOKE! They are paid BANK to do absolutely nothing but walk around and bark orders, while the rest of us slave away to keep the store up and running."
bad,Learned how operations and management takes place at Walgreens. I was in charge of running the store and making sure I was guiding all employees.
bad,Great job for people who have another job.. They are willing to work around your schedule.... It's a part time  job that offers low compensation. You only allowed one 30 minutes lunch and no 15 minutes break.  No matter how long you work..
bad,Scheduling and staffing is a great opportunity to improve the work life in this company. I would not recommend Walgreens as employment.
bad,Management was of little help.would not hire enough help.I was told I got paid the same weather the customer was happy or not when I voiced concerns over customer complaints. I gave my 2 weeks notice on the spot!
bad,"No room for advancement, worked as a temp for a year and half before leaving.  Joining the actually Walgreen's staff wasn't ever possible.  Unrealistic expectations and never felt like I was listened to."
bad,"Walgreens pays very little, but they demand odd hours and make everyone work on holidays. I requested not to work the evening shift, and they scheduled me for every single evening shift. While working here, I was having a very hard time paying my bills and barely had money for food. The only reason I worked here so long was because I was told I was likely to get promoted very quickly to Pharmacy Tech, which would pay more. However, after working here a few months and training in the pharmacy once a week, they hired someone else for the tech position that didn't previously work there. I decided I needed to quit. The managers were all very kind though. I made a lot of really great friends there, but other than that it was a complete waste of time."
bad,"The longer I work for them the more they take. They just removed the asm bonus and put us back to hourly rate to avoid the new overtime law, I now make .78 cents more per hour they when I started 7 years ago."
bad,"i wouldn't recommend this place to any teens. Sure the hours are flexible and its an ok environment but overall there is a lot of drama between employees , constant call-offs, and zero determination there."
bad,"You are micromanaged all day. If you are a cashier and you're standing at the cash register and you don't have a customer at that time, the store manager watches you on camera in the office then calls you on the phone and tells you to go to another isle and straighten -- just as you walk away from the register, here comes a customer, then you have to walk back and forth from the register to the isle  you're working in or get chewed out. I was told by the manager that other people work faster than me. I didn't get a raise because I'm not as productive as the other associates. Those remarks made me look for other work. Which I got and quit here. The district manager would come in and look at you in a disgusting way. Like you're a piece of garbage. There is a high turnover in this company."
bad,"- great management "
bad,"Walgreen's used be an OK place to work, but it just keeps getting worse and worse.  The company is now like a totalitarian regime; micromanaging every single tiny detail.  They even tell you what to think!  We were forced to memorize ridiculous mantras and cultural beliefs and recite them when asked.  If you don't say ""welcome to Walgreens,"" and ""thanks and be well"" to every single customer, you are at risk for disciplinary action.  As a pharmacist, I worked very long and hard in school to get my license, only to have to operate a cash register much of the day (and be forced to ring up people who are not even getting a prescription) and report to the store manager who knows NOTHING about pharmacy.  And many of them only became store managers through cronyism and favoritism.  Even the most frivolous, unfair, stupid customer complaint can lead to a write up, and chances are, you will be given no opportunity to defend yourself until the decision to write you up has already been made.  If you're a pharmacist (especially at a slower store), you will not like your schedule; one day morning, one day evening, one day 6 hours, another day 8 hours, another day 12 hours, all with no break!  And now, they want you to work (forced volunteering) on your days off too!  You might have to give up 1 of your 2 weekends off per month to give flu shots and blood pressure readings at a community fair or senior center.  And they want you to do 1 such event every month!  I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  If you are an intelligent, ambitious pharmacist who is proud of your profession, Walgreens"
bad,This company is the worst I've ever worked for. There is no teamwork ever. They don't train anybody right and if you don't know what to do they write you up. Management is not fair EVER. Management can do all this shady stuff and then make up lies. HORRIBLE PLACE.
bad,"Working for this company was a miserable experience. From Management down to my entry-level cashiering job, it seemed like everyone hated their lives because of their job at Walgreens. Even with a Bachelor's degree from an accredited state university, my starting pay was $7.75. Also, when you make mistakes, they like to call you back to the office, making you think you're about to be fired. I would never want to work for this company or anything like it again."
bad,the mangers played favorites. the chain of command was not respected. there is a large turn over rate at this particular location. treated employees as though they were disposable. not a nice place to work. everyone was not held to the same standard. they are open on every holiday
bad,"Walgreens itself is a fabulous company to shop at, but I have to be honest while working there I could never get 80 hours they considered me full time but never could give me full time hours.  I have a family and I had to call other stores just to try and make a full pay check.  I am a person of integrity, and while I hate to speak badly about them I just had to be honest. They have great staff members, but we all had that same complaint we could never get any hours at our home store we all had to call around to get hours."
bad,"As a walgreens employee I feel devalued by the company, and although I've worked hard for the company for several years I've barely seen an increase in my hourly wage, and although I now have two bachlor's degrees and a masters degree I see no upward mobility  for me in the company. Further more being a pharmacy technician at walgreens for as long as I have been has really restricted my ability to change fields. One of the worst mistakes I've ever made in life is accepting a position for a retail company that views it's employees as nothing more than replaceable parts."
bad,Not enough pharmacists to allow you to use vacation (PTO) time.  They require that you trade days.  Micromanagement by non-pharmacists
bad,Do not even apply if you want to enjoy your job. There is no future unless you are the biggest kiss up in the world. Its the crabs in a barrel mentality they encourage you to snitch and backstab each other.
bad,"Its a basic job. Its not fun, there's not much challenge. Great  for learning customer service skills. Management has gotten worse over the years."
bad,"Has poor work life balance and underpaid. It really is what you make it. If management would not overwork and underpay, then it may be an enjoyable work place."
bad,"Its your retail pharmacy job. Not much to be expected from here, long hours, horrible pay. Undertrained staff due to volume and you are expected to work in stressful situations."
bad,"What used to be an amazing company to work for, is rapidly becoming a company to stay away from. Walgreens used to be one of the few employers that actually cared about it's employees. With great benefits, job security, and potential for advancement, people used to be proud to work there. Now it's hard to find anybody that enjoys being there. Too much has changed over the past few years, and unfortunately the majority of the changes were to benefit corporate at the expense of it's employees."
bad,"Where do I begin? First of all, I had NO problems with customers. They were fantastic and I had lots of regulars. Of course, as with any retail job, you do get those occasional ""gems"" who throw tantrums over expired coupons and the inability to read a sales flyer. For the most part, though, the customers were not an issue. Even most of the ""extreme couponers"" were awesome."
bad,PTO we can never seem to get approved to use.  Everyone has different answers about how things should be done. So your expected to get things right when no one really knows what is right. Held accountable for things never properly advised about.
bad,"Walgreens was a good pharmacy several years ago, but it has become too corporate that it is becoming more like CVS. As a pharmacist, your main job is to get many prescriptions on time and top of many other tasks that are given. "
bad,"Worked for Walgreen's for over 14 years.  Was able to advance to MGT after first 8 months.  With the experience that I have, I was pretty much able to do what needed to be done without being told.  I enjoyed working with the other employees and helping them with their projects, but at times, didn't feel that I had the support of the store manager."
bad,"Overall-not good. It's always understaffed, and corporate only cuts hours, which makes it even harder for the employees to get their work done and aggravating to the customers when they can't be waited on."
bad,this company is garbage they do not value employees you are treated like trash and we all know what we do with trash we throw it out when done.
bad,"Very fast paced work environment, with minimal staff.  I enjoy the people that I work with, but the company doesn't provide adequate or extra staff needed for state required  breaks and employees are lucky to get there  lunches.  The busy environment doesn't bother me I like the constant flow, but it would be nice to have a break during the day, especially when we pull 9 hour days."
bad,a good company to work for overall the culture is for a young person a college student starting out
bad,A typical day at Walgreens is to answer complaints the full shift. I learned a lot working for this company. Management is awful.  I loved my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is trying your hardest and not being appreciated for it. I enjoyed assisting the customers to the best of my abilities.
bad,favortism is big here not that good of a company. very hard to advance within the stores
bad,A typical day at work was help customers and photo tech I learned how to do pharmacy The management was good as well as the co-workers
bad,Great place to learn workflow and teamwork. I worked four ten hour days. Management was weak they allowed employees to do what they wanted. I learned how to work under pressure.
bad,"Opened a new clinic. Nothing was ready. No support from above. No answers to e-mails, or worse conflicting answers, to daily operation questions that resulted in care being given to pt's that were not to be on PRG. Appropriate staff not in place. Ran place single handedly for a 1 1/2 months before I realized no one was coming. My managered lied about many things from day one. The e-mails received were that I was not meeting vaccination and chronic illness ""quotas"" monthly. Contests for vaccination numbers or more pt numbers, contests? Really? Do you NP's out there really think the back of a drug store is where chronic illness should be managed? I feel this is pure greed, there is enough acute illness, sports and work physicals, and wellness exams to profit. There is no answering service for these people to call, like a PMD office, after hours when these people have problems with the meds you started in the clinic for their BP or DM II. They will go to the ED and this will have a negative rebound effect on these clinics. There are so many other areas where this type of health care could expand. It is YOUR license and I find it VERY hard to believe you are all experts in pediatrics, geriatrics, and now chronic health. No thanks. Seen enough."
bad,"Absolutely love the patient care, met some incredible fellow nurses and really enjoy a select few coworkers. The management is SO bad, directly responsible for the HIGH turnover of clinical staff at this Billings office. The local office manager is completely unqualified and abusive to say the least. The nurse manager in Bozeman is very difficult to work with as well.  Several complaints made to upper management have failed to improve conditions. Would NOT recommend this job to anyone!!!"
bad,"Horrible company to work for, stay away."
bad, 
bad,"A typical day at work would be doing resets and revisions,and customer service in whatever department. What i learn is how to multi-task. Management is horrible, they allow some co-workers to do what they want. My co-workers are  good workers but the work is not appreciated. The hardest part of the job is to go everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers and making sure they are happy when they depart."
bad,Very stressful...Not enough employees to help make the job a faster and less stressful place. Management is pretty easy going but the job is stressful because it always seems like there is a lot to do but your getting called here and there and then nothing can get done. 
bad,"it is no longer a good company to work for. the benefits are no good, advancement is almost impossible if you dont have a dregree."
bad,"Walgreens is very busy, there is always work to do so there is no time to even look at the clock. Before you know it it's lunch time, then you look up again and its time to go home. I am a service clerk at Walgreens so there are a few things that I do, which includes cashier, stocking shelves and keeping the shelves filled with merchandise, assisting customers with any help that they may need, meeting suggestive sales quota."
bad,"This place was a joke, and I stuck it out as long as I could."
bad,"Very easy work cool enviorment, but that is what a teenager would say. As an adult great job if your an manager."
bad,"Although Walgreens wasn't my best working experience there were enjoyable times. The employees, customers, and some of the managers made the day go swell. The hours were good and negotiable it was never an issue to pick up shift."
bad,"AS Take CAre the colleagues were terrific, the more the retail culture from Walgreens ""took over"" the more deceitful and scary it became. THere is little to no integrity in the management and communication let alone respect for people. It is a difficult place to maintain motivation and positive attitude so the client is effected by high turnover and people that don't know the business...."
bad,Work everyday in the sun. No days off. Not fit for a college student. Management was great but shifts were all over the place. Worked in different pools. No benefits.
bad,I was warned not to take this job and I should have listened. I trained for five weeks with them and got let go because of AHT was 123 and I was lowering it but they enjoy letting people go. They have a very high turnover rate.
bad,Hr is useless. They    don't work through your schedule. too much work on you. Unfair pay. YOU WILL CHASE THE HOURS BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAKE EXCUSES!!!!
bad,I'm a shift lead and I regret accepting the position every day I get yelled at and written up by upper management. they say their trying to help you but in one way they are they're helping me to fail
bad,Basically Walgreens only cares about the customer not the employee putting customers before employees in every aspect of a little problem that might occur in the workplace they do not give the employee benefit of the doubt they are automatically side with the customer and you are an expendable part of their program.
bad,"Honestly I thought Walgreens was a great company to work for. Management is terrible though. I constantly feel like I’m being belittled and bullied by my store manager. They all talk about you behind your back and will discuss personal issues that only the store manager should know. Work like balance is fine, just be prepared to close a lot. They are opened every single day of the year and you only get holiday pay if you have been there more than 6 months. The pay is decent but I am on the higher end."
bad,If you get along well with managers you’ll be favored get to do whatever get your good raise and what not if you don’t you’ll be left in the dust and get no raise or shorty raise. Almost 2 years of working there I got no raise. I did my job worked hard and went home even did the infinity and beyond for the company and never was noticed for hard work. Like I said be besties with management and you’ll be good
bad,"horrible company to work for, managers give hours to favs. not good training . customerare beyond rude, would rather work at starbucks, also the pay is low"
bad,"Good training time.  The pharmacists and technicians were great.  The company is horrible, all about metrics. Their staffing model is absolutely unrealistic and in my opinion unsafe.  How can a pharmacist safely fill prescriptions while working the drive through, the register, and answering phones by themselves?  The scheduling was terrible for floaters in my district - I had to check the calendar each morning to see if I was working that day!"
bad,I have worked at Walgreens for almost 20 years I was a good employee I worked at hard always I was loved by lots of customers I got along with all my co-workers the only problem I had was I got into incident with another employee I was fired from my job that I love so much I felt like I should have been transferred to another store but I guess the store manager didn't really like me pretend it all the time congratulated me all the time but still fired me
bad,"Hours have been slashed, they expect the same amount of work done. We have to keep the NPS score up when we have less resources to help as well. We get in trouble if we dont keep the score up"
bad,"All Walgreens care about is their numbers. They let customers talk to you anyway they want, racial slurs even. Management is terrible and you get little to no training on your position."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Store management May be fine, but it’s district management that terrible. Corporate does not care for employees or customers, or else they’d open up the budget more. You’d be lucky to have a manager/supervisor and maybe one or two employees on the sales floor, for the amount of business they can have. On top of completing projects."
bad,The company is sucks and don't care about nobody. The company put too much work on everybody. They put too much work on the employees. Do not apply for this company.
bad,"An overall good company to work for. But the Walgreens I worked at no one wanted to help me learn anything, mind you I was a new grad just out of school. The job was very stressful would often dread to go to work the next day."
bad,"I've never hated my job as a pharmacist until I worked for Walgreens.  I don't want to wake up in the morning, and I cry when I return home at night.  I'd be lying if I said I haven't cried in front of customers (several times).  Walgreens has made me regret becoming a pharmacist."
bad,working at Walgreen's has opened so many more opportunities for me. with this job i have been here almost two years and I dont regret a day. i really  like working here.
bad,The workplace culture is terrible because you are left to your own demise in the pharmacy. The company does not care to step in by adding incentives to stay or even bothering to back up employees. There is a high turnover rate due to lack of company and management involvement. The pay and benefits are terrible and it does help that customers treat everything as your fault.
bad,"I really enjoy working for the Company Walgreen's, they have a great mission and core ethic's. "
bad,"When opening the store, the cashier is the only one working in the front. They're expected to run back and forth from the photo department to the check out line in a timely manner, while also stocking the shelves, printing and sorting photos, and cleaning the store. Don't forget, that is all on top of helping and greeting every single customer. I had a specific supervisor be very unprofessional with the workers. He would talk to the workers about graphic subjects and dated an employee from his store. He cherry picked when to be professional towards the workers, causing confusion. Then, would get employees in trouble if they were unprofessional during the time he decided to be professional. Management is not very understanding towards their workers. If you call out or request time off for a family matter, it's often met with rejection or persuasion to come in. For a tired, broke college student, the hours are ridiculous and inconsistent. One week, all you do is work, sleep and school. The next, you're barely working, which means a smaller paycheck. The biggest upside to working there had to be the regular customers. Most are very friendly and you build a relationship with them quickly!"
bad,"Store management is terrible"
bad,"Unfortunately, this company is tanking quickly. They're paying for the massive lawsuits with employee hours. Every fulltime employee at my store has dropped below 30 hrs. If we don't use our vacation time, we are going to lose our insurance. We already cannot pay our bills. Most of us are trying to find second jobs. They're more worried about corporate lawsuits than dedicated employees. "
bad,Work for the company for almost three years didn't take a sick day or vacation time and now I find out that my hours being cut let me lose my benefits.  There's no job security with us corporation and III corporation doesn't look out for the employees or put the most effort.
bad,"Once upon a time it was a good company , now it's Ok company better then Dollar stores but Pay less and expect more culture. Not even a single holiday off !"
bad,"BEWARE!!!!The pharmacists are jerks, rude. They are very power hungry, as if someone is taking  their last meal and drink from their hands. They are super controlling and they have little to no communication skills.Very disrespectful to employees. They aren't capable of training anyone, because they don't want to. it's as if they are always in pain or hungry"
bad,"I've worked for the company for 12 years . At first it was the best job . Now you have to look for your hours . Traveling far , since your home store got cut. That's why you see less staff on the floor ."
bad,"The mangers were rude don't know how to communicate with their employees, very slow paced too much down time not ever really any work can't really speak with management about the situation cause they are part of it"
bad,They want you to give up your entire life for their store. You have no family time nor do they care about your well being. Since the buyout Walgreens has become a terrible place to work.
bad,This job used to be fun. But they move management around so much that they don't care about connecting with employees. They'd rather hire externally than help current employees who are qualified with advancement.
bad,Under paid cut hrs. Management Frustrated with Attitude most of the time employee cant get the proper training thats needed to succeed. Company with a high turnaround rate  lack of structure within...
bad,They look for excuses to fire long term employees .no chance for advancement past store manager.  Coorprate leader have no clue what it really takes to run a store.
bad,"I worked in The Villages,FL  for Walgreens for over ten years. I made more money in my first two years then my last five years? I never had any issue with my team members or the dozens of store managers I worked for. The problem is at the corporate level and higher. "
bad,"I liked my co workers, but management cared nothing about the employees. Walgreens is diverse, however, the district and higher up authorities care nothing for the lower scaled employees."
bad,"If you choose to have a career at Walgreens, it will be a huge mistake. Associates, shift leads and asm/asmt will have no life due to schedules. It will be nice if  you have a supportive manager which I had before but they transferred her to a higher volume store. Years of service and dedication will be nothing for a manager who doesn't know proper management and planning. She will write you up and hussle you with you schedule. Shift leads who she tried to write up didn't sign or acknowledge went fine. Hard working employees work harder and lazy ones will be more lazy. If you have hypertension, leave.. else you will die in this store. The store manager will then terminate you after you die."
bad,"My managers were awful, the worst. They would manipulate and lie to cause drama. They would say one thing and then turn around and claim they said something completely different. They made me feel like I was going crazy. Just don't do it..."
bad,"If you were ever harassed during work hours by crazy customers, all you can do is take the harassment and walk away since Walgreens will always find a way to make it look like its your fault. It is very hard to speak up."
bad,"The job I applied for was inbound customer care work from home. I didn't find out til after I started training that I was going to be doing outbound calls promoting a new refill service.... aka sales. I would have never accepted the position had I known that. On top of that... 90% of your benefits don't start til after 6 months. You can't take any planned time off prior to 6 months without getting a ding on your record. no paid holidays, no paid time off, no paid disability for 6 months. The only thing you can get is insurance. That starts at 3 months. "
bad,"poor communication between leadership and staff"
bad,"It is disappointing that Pharmacy closes for every holiday but when it comes to the holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving etc... The store part also has to work. People like being with their family during this time of year and the retail employees are told it is mandatory we have to work. If pharmacy is able to close then the whole store should be able to it is unfair to the other employees who are not in the pharmacy. People have children and family that is out of town they want to spend that time with but not able to. Even CVS closes for christmas. Walgreen's Pharmacy and retail store is the same company so if one part of the store is closed then the whole store should be closed or at least close early."
bad,"it was really bad, management was unfair, and dont care about you a typical day management was rude. In my opinion dont work there that all i have to say about it"
bad,It's not a very good working environment. No mentorship. Left to find out things on your own. Not enough training time. Not told exactly what kind of certification needed.
bad,doesn't like to promote and has really low salaries especially on shift lead level working in the photo department you have to do a wide variety of tasks on top of running a lab
bad,Complete lack of respect for employees. Managers were very unprofessional and would do anything to get the job done including disregarding safety rules and guidelines.
bad,I would never recommend Walgreens to anyone as a company to work for.  They couldn't care less about their employees and taking care of them.  They are expected to do the work of 2 or 3 people at very little pay.
bad,"Walgreens is great if you intend to work their temporarily part time. However as someone who has worked their 2 and a half years full time, it's not the greatest company to wok for."
bad,The job it'self was alright for a retail position. It keeps you busy as it's constantly growing. The only bad thing was the management. Very arrogant and noncompasionate towards staff.
bad,"Layed back management, and favoritism amongst the employees. Whenever a item would be in need a of replacing ex. Vacuum cleaner/ dustbin would need replacing it would take months for a them to act on. I would not recomend working at walgreens . This is my expirience ."
bad,I worked for this company for 15 years. Benefits were amazing and the company was tolerable back in 2003. There are no longer any incentives for technicians. They cap your pay and if you transfer to a different store seniority is out the door for you even if you have more accumulated time. Favoritism is HUGE at many stores. Fraternization is prohibited between management and staff but it happens regularly. I loved being a pharmacy technician but the longer I stayed with Walgreens the more I realized I chose the wrong company. Good luck!
bad,"this company used to be very productive and rewarding place, but recent was merged with another pharmacy. they may have bit off more than they can chew."
bad,Corporate finds new ways to add tasks to the stores continuously. They create an environment that is very task focused and then criticise you for being too task focused.
bad,"Has horrible communication practises,  training of employees is not good.  Pay was reasonable and benefits are ok.  Not a lot of opportunity to move up. Would not recommend this company to anyone.  Not interested in working here again. To many bosses compared to associates"
bad,They want you to work every night on the weekends. they think you have nothing to do. On the holiday pay is based on your average day you work. If  you are a student and only work 20 hours a week due to your school.  based on the holidays that is mandatory for you to work you only get paid (4 hours holiday pay) even tho you probably will end up working 9 hours cuz you are not in school.
bad,Work here makes you not like the  customer service world and the  management  is not so great and not a lot of clear leadership. The amount of work does not match the pay
bad,"The Chattanooga Walgreens is very poorly managed and workers at every level are treated as just another cog in the machine.  Pay is above minimum wage, but hard workers are treated poorly."
bad,It depends on who the manager is whether or not if this is great workplace. its very physical job you are always looking out for thieves always having to call the police never having enough crew members managers dont care if people call off you still have to get the work done so you're always stressed out
bad,"Very stressful place to work.  12 hrs shift without any  break at all - that's typical. You lucky if you get to use the restroom !  Now - they keep closing more stores, so the job it's getting absolutely tragic !  maybe working on the floor ( in the cosmetic area or photo department) would be different, but the Pharmacy is getting really unacceptable !    And it was such a wonderful place to work 17 years ago when I was hired !"
bad,Terrible hours. Open 365 days a year. Poor management and unrealistic expectations of employees. I would rather work for minimum wage somewhere else. Upper management cares so little for work life balance. Not to mention the pharmacy customers are rude.
bad,working at the walker walgreens was horrible i hated everyday the manager that worked under rebecca rochelle was immature and unprofessional to her co workers...she would throw anybody under the bus if there is a mistake found to make herself seem like she was apart of the problem there. she would  take her stress out on her co workers and put the team under pressure so the whole performance  of the pharmacy would go down
bad,This company used to be great now it is changing for the worst. The uper management is out to get people to save their jobs. I loved this company after 4 years good bye.
bad,"the hardest part of the job is trying to please customers all the time, not all customers are going to like you and the ones that don't often call the store to complain about you.  they interpret your body language wrongly."
bad,"The specific walgreens that I worked at was just a temporary job while I was at school. It was stressful because it was a high volume/high theft rate at this store. There were definitely cliques, and management favored people for sure."
bad,"Retail is a boring work environment anyways but throw in that the store never closes on holidays and goes beyond that and stays open later on holidays. This company doesn't care about it's employees, only it's upper management. Vacation time can't be taken from November to January. You are expected to do nearly all of upper managements' work while they talk on their cell phone to thier friends all day."
bad,poor taste in my mouth bad managers and customers are rude and sometimes hard to deal with i just need a new job so i can have a piece of mind that's all
bad,"Untrained, immature managers. A typical day is getting there and realizing at least 2 people called out and you must pick up their slack and do your job as well. Seniority takes precedent even when they are in the wrong to such a degree they need to reprimanded multiple times within a short time span and again you must pick up your co-workers slack. The customer is always right... which leads to the customers cursing out the pharmacy employees and other workers. Hostile work environment"
bad,if you love customer service as a cashier . this would be the perfect job for you. as an employee the management was good and gave small raises when deserved. loved my coworkers could not live off the pay working part time
bad,"Some days can be really busy and some days can be extremely slow. Most of the customers I get everyday are very rude and impatient. There are a lot of questions we are required to ask them at the register which probably contributes to their bad mood. My store manager expected me to do difficult tasks that I had little training for. I learned a lot and therefore am very grateful for the experience; however, it was overall an awful job that added to my stress. When people come in asking if we are hiring, I want to tell them to run as fast and as far as they can."
bad,"busy during the winter, hours cut during the summer. When I was there, they changed store manager several times as well as in pharmacy.  Had issues with payroll being accurate every pay period."
bad,I had a rough expirience when I externed for Walgreens. I always felt that I was a bother to the workers just by being there everyday and eventually I didnt want to continue my hours at this location so I found Pharmerica.
bad,You are on your own as a MGT trainee.  There is no structure to this organization.  You may be the best at your job but if you are not liked by upper management then you can kiss a promotion Bye-Bye!
bad,Management at walgreens is taught by corporate that every employee is replaceable so the managers show that. Work days are not satisfying as there is never much work given to be done.
bad,Management doesn't care when you tell them about issues. I've been sexually harassed by many customers and management didn't do much when I told them about it.
bad,"I like where I am working, but it can not afford my bills. I am looking for a better job that can help me with my bills. It is hard to work at Walgreens specially when season coming. As a matter of fact I know how to deal with customer, I learn a lot while working at Walgreens because there is good and bad day. I was always have good time with my co-workers because I am a respectful person. To conclude, the hardest part in my job is when a customer needs help for something while am helping another person that makes me sad."
bad,i externed at walgreens pharmacy for a short period of time but i can honestly say the pharmacy staff have no manners and no sense of humor i do not recommend it. the hardest part of the job is that they do not wish to train you well and still expect the most out of you.
bad,I enjoyed working here for four consecutive years until I encountered problems with the management.  It showed Walgreens had no compassion for their workers.  I feel your job should care about you as much as you care about it.
bad,"Never on the same page.  Disorganized and not planned out the day well. District manager does more negative than positive, not supportive at all."
bad,"I truly enjoyed working at Walgreens for about the first 4 months, but that changed. A typical day at work included greeting customers, ringing orders, stocking merchandise, helping customers, keeping the store clean, etc. When hired, I was promised room for advancement, and given praise from a lady who was training management saying ""She saw me emerging as a leader within the company"". I really believed her, but the management at my store were determined to not let that happen. The company as a whole really needs to get their moral values in line, because (at my particular store at least) it was horrible. Now, the most enjoyable part of my job was all my co-workers and the customers. We all got along, the customers gave me praise reports, my store manager bragged on my performance to all his bosses including HR, the district manager, and the vice president of marketing; but the assistant manager however did not like me whatsoever and I never understood why, because I was one of the nicest and easiest people to get along with in the store and, in my opinion, the hardest worker. She made the job absolutely miserable for me and I began to wake up everyday when I had to work with her, miserable and stressed out, whereas I used to be happy and jubilant every day before work. After a while, Walgreens started putting more and more meaningless tasks on the customer service associates, and the wage didn't go up at all. What started off as a good experience and a place I wanted to stay for a long time, turned into a horrible experience and I had to quit the job because of the daily verbal"
bad,"this is the worse company to work for if you have no life this is the company for you if you are sick or your child is sick they will not care you have to come to work or they will call and harasse you they will make you get off your lunch break to work,b do managments work. the management is very very very lazy they want you to do their work while they sit in the office and micromanage. they have really good benefits but thats it they expose you to very hazardas work conditions. baton rouge region is the worse"
bad,"Worked in management for this distribution center for over a decade.  I truly believe that the stores are good places to work, but the center in Woodland is a bad place to be a manager.  Promotions are only given to those who are friends with the DC Manager.  As are the good assignments in good departments.  The best managers are rewarded with the worst departments that require long hours and big responsibilities.  The weaker managers are rewarded with easier departments, because it is all they can handle.  The pay is very good.  In many cases too good, because this leads to abuse from the upper management.  They feel that they can mistreat the Function Managers, because they can't afford to leave.  The shifts are terrible.  Graveyards and coming in the middle of the night to start.  They have staggered shifts for your crew with a total shift time of up to 16 hours.  It's actually not a bad place to be an hourly employee.  I liked the people who worked for me and they were very good people.  I feel bad for my peers I left behind when I quit.  I took a pay cut with a new company to get out of that dysfunctional place.  The building is obsessed with endless meetings and busy work. As an example, I had to supply management summaries of my confidential conversations I had with my hourly employees every week.  We were subjected to public dress downs by the Manager of Operations in weekly meetings.  Most unprofessional environment I have ever worked in.  Not to mention that everyday is somehow a crisis.  If you come to work here, you will regret it.  I certainly do and wish I had"
bad,"management gangs up on people. talks behind backs, and acts like high schoolers."
bad,Walgreens requires techs. to have varied hours from 7:30 am-10pm. Everyone routes. Hard to have a life outside of work
bad,"I worked for this company for four years. I have worked in two stores. It kept getting worse and worse as time went by and honestly, I saw a lot of people walk out and not come back. I know managers that walked out and didn't come back. I personally do not like having to say a scripted paragraph each time I ring up a customer. You have to try and push ""item of the month"" each time you ring up a customer and it is usually candy. I don't want to push candy on people, especially when some of them say ""I'm diabetic or I'm on a diet"". It makes you feel bad. Not only that but I ended up working in the Beauty Department and I had to make $500 worth of sales on the one cosmetic register. Keep in mind, the store makes the same amount of money whether they ring up in the Beauty Department or up front. That meant constantly harassing the customers to ring up. People are just browsing and I am supposed to ask them to ring up. I am not aloud to just stand behind the register either so when the customer is ready, I am working on putting away truck or doing a reset. I don't want to follow people around waiting for them to be ready to ring up. "
bad,"I started out working as a Patient Care Coordinator. That job was okay, a bit mindless and repetitive, glued to the phone. Then I moved to the Insurance Verification Department. Biggest mistake of my life. Firstly, the Patient Services Manager/supervisor/Team Leads are all childish and completely unprofessional. They've convinced themselves that they are the ""cool"" kids in the junior high school and they run the place. I went to Human Resources to tell them of my issues with my leadership, and he did NOTHING. He sat in meetings with me and the Manager and sided with her. Said nothing when she cut me off and did not give me a chance to speak. Secondly, they set unrealistic goals for employees and then hold that employee accountable for those said unrealistic goals, without taking it into account that those goals aren't realistic if you want the work to be complete, accurate, and delivered on time."
bad,Walgreens is actually a great company with the strategy and innovation.  There were some instances that made my mind change in regards to the culture at the Woodland Walgreens Distribution Center.  There is too much to illustrate here but one is the training on shipping certain materials via air was limited to a certain few and the individuals that received the training were not performing the task when some of the materials were found by Fed Ex and the FAA.  This was swept under the rug and the people responsible for this were not charged with consequences.  I only see this problem is going to escalate to in other areas.  To hide these issues walgreens eliminated a shift and overloaded two shifts with volume and hours to give the impression that business was going well.
bad,"A typical day at Walgreens for me was going in and cleaning, organizing, waiting on customers, help unload truck on truck load days, stock, "
bad,Wagreens started off as a good company to work for but with all the new changes that they are making and the things that you have to go through just to keep your job position is just not worth it especially if you have been in the same position since have started or have advanced up too if management likes you or have become buddy buddy with you.
bad,I haven't enjoyed my time at Walgreens. It's a place where I feel like your best effort is not good enough. Every day you come to work wondering what you will get fussed at about.
bad,"Where to start. Worked there for 6 years. Finally escaped. After 6 years and having worked in every department pay was less than $10/hour. Also after 6 years did not get all my vacation paid out because they prorated it. Have a total disregard for employees and long as the big guys are making the big money. Changing management positions and essentially forcing thousands if employees into either positions they don't want or far less pay than was their previous wage. Constantly changing tasks and adding more for the same pay and if you fail to meet their standards in any of these it will go against your raise, which is minimal to begin with. Cannot support a family on what they pay, even after many years of service. Also I was the head of my department and worked hard everyday. My customers loved me and I have some that will not go back now that I'm gone. How's that for customer service! Would not recommend this company to anyone. I was one of many that left my store in the last few months."
bad,"Management is horrible, but it was easy money. You don't do much since it is a slow store. The only thing I hated about the job was dealing with my store manager who didn't care about the employee's feelings."
bad,"Work day is always hectick, always!"
bad,"Company was being taken over by an offshore affiliate, so there was much management taking place"
bad,"Very fast paced workplace 98%of the people were great and hard working,management not consistent with all employees"
bad,Its good for the work experience but other than that the place is a competition to see who's the favorite so you can get more hours. Managers will cut your hours if they don't like you.
bad,"Walgreens was close to my heart, loved the store,and coworkers, I worked very very hard,so that I could get into the pharmacy,I even went to clc to do the course,so when they needed a pharmacy technician,they would offer me the job,as i was a designated hitter, long story short,they overlooked me, (discrimination) they would tell you differently.God knows my heart,he knows I was treated badly,,I truly wish them well for the sake of all the great employees that need their job.they missed out on an loyal employee."
bad,Walgreens is a big box pharmacy and is interested only in money. I have worked for them for many years and have seen the decline in their attitude towards patient and employee alike. They consider both as disposable and easily replaced
bad,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens when I was promoted to store manager. At that time, team members were rewarded for independent thinking, driving sales by creating displays, hard work, and the ability to respond to your store's numbers. Now, 'managers' just go into work and do exactly what the computer tells you to do. It's no fun and it's no challenge and there is no reward."
bad,All about exception reporting and criticism.  Expectations are unattainable.  Support for work/life balance is not there.  District managers are pick out store managers and make their jobs even more difficult by consistently telling them what they are doing wrong instead of providing recognition. Pharmacy management is difficult as well.
bad,"To be perfectly honest the job sucked I dedicated 6yrs of my life to a company that didn't allow me room to move up, their management treated me like trash,and when it's all said and done it was just a total waste of time"
bad,"When I first worked at Walgreens I was working at the one in Long Beach on Redondo and Anaheim doing graveyard; soon the next year my first location stopped doing graveyard & I decided to get transferred to the Walgreens in Lakewood on Carson and Woodruff. I regret getting transferred now, I was blamed for missing items, one of the managers there is rude & was written up for not selling enough items during promo we had."
bad,"There were a few good things that came out of my experience at Walgreens, but Ingot really sick and had to go on disability for a couple months and they didnt accept it."
bad,I have given over twenty four years of my life to this company.  You can make money here if you sell your soul.  This place is for teens and the retired.
bad,WalgreenS is killing itself. They dont care about their employees. They keep cutting back on hours. Want you to do more work without the increase in pay. They are not giving me the tools to finish jobs.
bad,If you are a customer service friendly kind of person this job is not for you. It is all about numbers and surveys and quotas. While I realize it is a business it is not a job where it appreciates its employees. They will cut hours in a heartbeat for the people in the stores while lining the pockets of its executives. Currently closing 200 stores and got forbid you make a mistake they will cut you where you stand if you do.
bad,I worked at the store level and let me tell you that there's a disconnect between corporate and stores... Corporate tries to trick people with ad tags and they also cut man-hours without regard for how that affects customers service and the lives of the employees that rely on this job.
bad,Get ready to get spit. Im serious.I've had scissors thrown at me cus she didn't like my name. Spit on me cus I didn't give him MY I.D. I asked for more hours. They gave me more hours in another department they never trained me or showed me the correct keys to have. Pharmacy techs also don't get any kind of breaks.
bad,I worked for them but couldn’t take the lack of management and communication any longer so I found another job gave my 2 week notice! I will miss a few of my team members but I had to better myself! They rarely recognize you for the good you do but always notice if something wasn’t done.  As to in my 2 week notice time I got one of my shifts covered due to being sick as the store manager called and notified me by voicemail that I wouldn’t be needed anymore they got my 2 weeks covered and appreciated my notice!! It’s a lot  of cons over the pros working for that location! If I ever returned I definitely would go to another location
bad,Over all they try to work with you but in all reality Walgreens only cares if it benefits them... I was out on leave for 6 months and when I came back i was supposed to be on light duty yet they didn't make accommodations for me.
bad,I’ve been working here for 3 years. I will never come back once I leave. I love my coworkers and manager. Corp sucks. They do not care about us at all. They continue to implement pointless required tasks and make it more difficult for us to do our job and for the customers to obtain their meds. And guess who gets cursed out about it? Us. Offer corporate to come fill a prescription or perform a test run on what they want us to do and they refuse. Nothing but LAZY trash.
bad,"Just wasn’t the place for me maybe if my manager would have let me change locations I would still have my job, they over work you it’s hard to get help they promote you just to leave u looking stupid not really knowing anything  & maybe if upper managers would hold every one to what they do instead of acting in race then the work place would have been  excellent really wish I could have got out of that store it just ruin my whole experience for all walgreen!!"
bad,"Unfortunately, the stores are going through major transformations with new employee engagement programs ""frontier"". These programs are disengaging the teams and making daily operations nearly impossible to complete. Budget cuts happen almost weekly leaving you unable to complete anything."
bad,"My first manager at walgreens made my experience more fun, but unfortunately the way the job worked, I didnt actually get a chance to talk to/communicate with my coworkers, making the only ppl to talk to be the customers, which obviously wasn't that fun.  In my first 3 months my first manager promoted me to ""designated hitter"" which is the same thing as a pharmacy assistant.  Unfortunately after he was promoted to another store, my 2nd manager didnt care that i was only ever at the front cash register for 8 hours every day, she didnt even consider that i was supposed to be in the pharmacy sometimes.  So that combined with the fact that I didnt like the environment at walgreens already, I just left.  Corporations like this feel no obligations to you."
bad,"My first manager was an amazing one. He did everything in his power to help me and train me. I went from a cashier at what should have been a temporary job to being an assistant store manager. As time went on though, the store had half of its staff fired or leave of their own will. Someone transferred in as an assistant store manager trainee and had a view that he understood more than we all could possibly know, even trying to tell the new manager that the way she did things wasn't the best way. This incompetence as leadership lead to two people quitting and his insistence on being a heavy-handed micromanager lead to me leaving as well. Of course, the company responds to the halving of our staff by cutting hours as the store ""is getting along with fewer and fewer people."" Its disregard for its employees, coupled with the extremely low wages per position (cashiers at local grocery stores make $0.50/hr less than I do), and other factors are why I would recommend anyone away from Walgreens."
bad,"I like structure, rules, and following procedures.....big joke here.....DM was unprofessional disgrace!!!   I'd never fill an rx there again!!!  Sets you up for failure!!!  The only people who succeed in the long run are people who don’t care about right and wrong!!!!"
bad,"The pay is there is very low! Can’t make a living off of Walgreens unless you probably worked in the corporate office otherwise you were out of luck!!!"
bad,"You never know your hour call till you get to work. They paid you better than most place so they can keep you away from your family and life events. You feel like a number and they aren't afraid to walk you out. Lots of changes for the company and not for their workers. Lots of micromanagement and playing favorites. Once you punch in, you're not allowed to leave the facility and yes that includes going to your car in the parking lot. The rates just keep going up and no real achievable rate. Very hard to get the days you need off. Don't always have the answers but, know how to write people up."
bad,"Walgreens used to be a great company to work for 14 years ago. Amazing health insurance and 401k plan with lots of staff to fulfill customer and business needs."
bad,"Suggestions to Upper are ignored. They believe all of their pharmacies are exactly alike.  What's good for one store may not be good for another due to the number of prescriptions processed in a day."
bad,Very rude people pushed work on u when there very short time do not know how to talk to people at all.... if your not buddies with the pharmacist they don't like u
bad,Don’t stand by their standards. They treat their inside staff as they know nothing. By hiring outside and never giving the inside employee an opportunity. If you don’t fit in the crowd and won’t make it.
bad,The job security for pharmacist has declined at Walgreens.  Management structure at the store level is not aligned with best interest of all employees.
bad,Management would clock in and leave and was poorly dressed. Shift lead would yell at employees. Employees would argue over special events that the company would hold or who would work holidays.
bad,"Most locations I worked work chronically understaffed, paid just above minimum wage, high stress, high expectation, and as a manager, you have rotating shifts all 7 days of the week between opening and closing with some graveyard. Had a mix of good and bad managers. Semi-professional environment among managers. Pharmacy staff was always top notch and great to work with no matter the location."
bad,"Walgreens has terrible customers, and they take horrible care or employees they fire all of the good kind hearted management and pharmacists that have worked their for 15+ years so that they don’t reach the 20 year mark. Once you reach a certain pay at Walgreens and you’re getting close to the cap for you job Walgreens will look to get rid of you in anyway possible."
bad,Very uneven work flow and poor management.  Have never left a job without having another one.  Had to do it here because I was miserable.  The training was not adequate also.
bad,"The worst job I have ever had. Very poor management that did not have the ability to motivate or inspire. The back room talk seemed like I was working in a high school, even though half of the employees were older than 35."
bad,"The district manager made life miserable. There was unrealistic expectations and zero work life balance. I learned a lot from my peers and enjoyed the knowledge I obtained in the pharmacy. I absolutely learned what kind of Manager I want to be, or not want to be."
bad,"Staff turnover is just constant, always new faces. They cant seem to keep anyone, and eliminate jobs yearly, forcing seasoned employees to become cashiers. Management changes constantly and have little to no experience in retail."
bad,"My immediate supervisor was great, and I enjoyed the job a great deal. However, gossip was rampant within the department. I was called into the Department Director's office where he flat out asked me if I had PTSD, yes I do. Within the week I was directed by my company not to return."
bad,"One of the best paying companies  in the area. But other then that one of the worse. Poor management, lack of communication, and your opinions do not matter."
bad,"breath in lots of dust everyday, don't get hurt on the job or youll get treated like a second class person. HR staff is uninterested in being helpful if you have a problem."
bad,The worst place I ever worked at the managers were very rude and not helpful in situation they favored other workers where they didn’t have to do their job and complained about everything I do even if other people weren’t doing anything and coworkers were awful as well not a friendly company to work with
bad,Worked for this company for 14+ years recently left due to changes made by new CEOs. They do not care about their employees anymore and demand better service with less help. I used to spend time with my patients and take them to the item in the isle continuing the conversation with the patient and being able to provide the kind of care that should be delivered to our patients. Now there is NO time for that. You need an extremely strong team in order to operate the pharmacy with the budget that is given. Problem is that the stress is so high that techs are leaving the company as fast as the good pharmacists. When you ask your district manager for help they tell you to utilize help from the front end team members... sounds great except the turnover rate for front end employees is worse than the pharmacy. Want to see a cashier from the front end explain a prior auth? This company has turned into a joke. “Trusted since 1901”?? They seem to not care about their patients even though they claim to. They will keep cutting hours until a terrible error is made and someone is killed.
bad,Not the place to start a career. They promote from witihing and at a fast pace if qualified making it a good stepping stone. Benefits are severly lacking and the constant shifting work hours are brutal.
bad,Walgreens can be a great place to work at when you have an amazing team. My employees were hard works but overall company made things very difficult for us and set unreasonable dead lines. A lot of Walgreens ideas went down hill and made the work place more stressful. I think they need more compassion for not only their customers but their employees as well. As a manager I rarely ever receive my 15 min break and I didn’t even get a lunch. I had to snack on a string cheese while multitasking and I would sometimes work 12+ hour shifts. It was hard to stay motivated and focused on my work on an empty stomach.
bad,"Customers are super rude, employees are extremely lazy and management just doesnt care. they will give you the bad hours based off your seniority. Just got told I'm working Christmas Eve from an employee cuss none of the other managers are willing to tell me. People always call off and expect you to come in no matter what."
bad,"I left back in 2014. At the time, the store manager and assistant manager were horrible managers. Thankfully they have relocated. I loved my coworkers and all of the regular customers who would come in to shop."
bad,My opinion the company as a whole is very poorly run. Supervisor/asst.supervisor/shift leads shouldn't be in position their in. NOT just in the store I worked in but in other stores as well! They have stores in other states where people are not given breaks or lunches! Hrs. are cut in summer and stores are ran with 2-3 people on floor including supervisor sometimes less on evenings which isn't save! Company wants surveys but they are too long customers don't want to take them. Also higher ups don't care what we on the floor have to say. All about $$$$
bad,"My immediate supervisor was sexually inappropriate all the time. Other pharmacists created a hostile work environment for me. All my co-workers were over worked and crabby all the time. Workers were rude to patients, mean to each other. My store manager knew of the poor work conditions and did nothing."
bad,"•Was written up for making a mistake once then twice without discussing on improving"
bad,"While working here, they want more and more from you and provide little help. They expect you to be on your feet for 11 hours straight without taking a break every single day."
bad,"Given a large part of my life and very Loyal.  I was discharged because I believe more in supporting my people and my team, then I do about hitting numbers or making sure something is cleaned.  Was termed because I refused to write up and fire team members who could not hit the ""numbers"" on weekends when I was not their because staffing called out, and they focused on customer service.  Even another DM said that the discharge shouldnt have been done.  Walgreens cares more about making a buck, then they do about employees, and those who have been around for a long time. I loved Walgreens and was very Loyal.  I had a huge customer base, that actually followed me store to store.  But, I stand by my decision.  I do not believe they should have bee at fault, if if wasnt under their control.  I was told to file suit against the DM and the company."
bad,"depending on what area at Walgreen that you work in, in a day the work can be very stressful. management helps out very little, the hardest part of the job is working with upset customers and not having management help you out. the most enjoyable part of the job is going home"
bad,They hired me to be a pharmacy technician but only had me at the front check out getting paid as a technician... They didn't even give me a chance to show my skills... Poor management... Not saying that all Walgreen's are that bad but just that location
bad,This company very stressful environment. I had to leave after a couple of years. The work load is a lot to handle . Management sucks.
bad,"You literally will break yourself not only physically but mentally as well... The rate they expect you to be at in 45 days (your probation period...) is ludicrous, there was NO main manager for the department just a floor leader who wasn't helpful at all and didn't help on the floor either just stayed by the computer... Specifically PMOD and working graveyards here it was nothing but drama and I was only there for 40 days before I couldn't take it anymore. All they care about is 100% making rate and finding out who's sleeping with who. At first I loved it then I realized how EASY the other departments were and that you could ACTUALLY have a quick conversation with a co-worker. In P-Mod if you talked for more then 5 seconds, your rate is dropping and if you don't make rate -- you're out. THEY SET YOU UP FOR FAILURE. I thought the bruises on my legs were normal at first...Guess you'll have to see for yourself."
bad,"I feel honesty and trust is very important when you are dealing with your upper management, but when you lack that trust it will never work. i seen several good people leave because of the unnecessary unfair treatment, and it's not a bad place to work I loved working with the employees and customer's"
bad,"helping customers, co-workers were awesome,unable to finish tasks on time, meeting new people. Management was mess up when I first started working there. Now they have improved due to 2 of them. One male manager, and one who transfered back from where she was transfered to to begin with. Trying not to use names but they know who they are."
bad,I truly enjoyed working at Walgreens. I was truly happy that I was given the opportunity to work there. It had its good days and its bad days but the customers were a joy to work with.
bad,Never knew what location I would be sent too. No advance warning just a email or being told when you walked in to clock in. Worst job I ever had the pay was the only thing I liked but it was not worth the other issues.
bad,Crazy. In order to be a good leader you must be also a good flollower. Not the best. Some co-workers were okay. The hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone. Meeting new people.
bad,"Co workers were great and tried to do their best in a confusing environment set by the store manager.  Store Management was terrible and most shift leadership were looking for other employment due to the negative and poor treatment by the store manager.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and co workers.  Hardest part of the job was running and working your tail off only to get a condescending, ungrateful attitude from the store manager and to be paged by manager several times during a task just for a status update every 20 mins.  Inconsiderate scheduling was the norm with quick turn around shifts close and open on a regular basis when it was not necessary and  another temp scheduler proved how it could easily be done otherwise.  Communication and training was non existent. Employees would be strictly told one thing and managers would never be communicated with on the change.  Tasks would be done one day and completely changed the next and the next day with much wasted productivity time doing so.  Community leader had no people skills (employee or customer) seriously lacked merchandising skills.   Pharmacy was severely understaffed for the amount of customers coming in.  The Health care offered was expensive and left only a fraction of your check after."
bad,"Whatever ""position "" you are hired for, all you are and will ever be is a slave on the cash register.  Taking the money from the public as fast as you can is all the company cares about. You are required to RUN to the register every time there are bells going off, this goes on about every 4 minutes or so , so forget about feeling any self worth, I was severely reprimanded and a few times even yelled    at because I didn't run fast enough , even though on several occasions I was assisting a customer, which they brag and sing about on those stupid radio adds that are playing on a recorded sound track  in the store over and over and over ALL day.  Its like subliminal brain washing and they  about their customer  service yada yada yada they use  this technique of dehumanization to keep everyone in line and afraid that they will lose their job.  I saw management speaking horribly to employees who I knew did mot have ability that allowed them to be selective in their career choices..  It was really disgusting. The management within the company structure are driven and obsessed with financial goals and care nothing about anything else.  The thing is,  this company has these signs plastered all over the employee areas. begging them to ""share"" their problems with cooperate with these phone hot line numbers and going on and on about how they care so much about what their employees  feel and all this BS. and the truth is all of the people I worked with were openly terrified within the closed doors of the lunchroom but would not dare to ever call or complain to anyone.   The company also"
bad,"Typical day for an ASM would be coming into work, counting the safe and writing daily tasks notes for your staff.  After working in retail for the last eight years I have learned more about what motivates people, being able to play on those motivations not only will make you a better manager but it will also make your people work harder for you."
bad,the company has cut all bonuses for lower level employees and management destroying moral and changing titles to pay you less to do the same job
bad,"Walgreen's Pharmacy does not hold the same standards as other corporations. I experience poor management, and unprofessional team leaders. This may not reflect the corporation as a whole, but it does speak volume on how their stores are mismanaged."
bad,"I worked for this company while I attended college. The manager had an extremely high turnover rate, and wasn't a people person. I liked my co-workers very much and worked great along side them. There was nothing hard about this job."
bad,"Unless your working in the pharmacy you are started off at around minimum wage, your pay raise is so slow that the next year minimum pay wage catches up and becomes your raise. Management is always taking out there frustration on employees. Employees are overworked and understaffed. for the amount of work they gave me wasnt nearly worth the pay I was givin and I would know considering I've had many jobs in my young lifetime 7 to be exact. Walgreens didnt use to be such a horriable place to work when it was family owned but now that its no longer family owned people started to be treated like a mcdolalds emplyee the higher ups dont give a crud about you all they care about is how much money can they squeeze out of everone. All I have to say is don't look at this play as a longterm job unless your going to work pharmcy, this hell hole inspired me to go back to school to get a real job."
bad,I have learned if you aren't in the management filed you aren't no one important.
bad,"A typical work day consists of promptly filling multiple patient prescriptions. In my time as a retail pharmacy technician, I have greatly enhanced my ability to communicate with customers/patients. My co-workers are experiencing low morale due to the internal organizational trends that have minimized the quality of ""worklife"" for Walgreens employees. The hardest part of the job is adequately accommodating the needs of our public while juggling a host of new corporate initiatives that are camouflaged attempts to capture revenue that was lost at the hands of our corporate decision makers during negotiations with a major pharmacy benefits manager (PBM); which was unsuccessful. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to serve people in need on a daily basis."
bad,"Easy job but it’s very boring. The day passes by slow. On slow days managers come up with dumbest task list and have you doing useless stuff like scrubbing the walls so the store looks good for visits. They hire literally anyone so you’re working with very odd people. Management is a joke, they aren’t professional at all. Work environment is toxic and immature. Everyone always has something t say about someone."
bad,"A typical day at Walgreens consists of constantly going back and forth between tasks, customers, and assisting other employees. Almost daily there was no time for a break (which was suppose to be two 15 minute and one 30 minute per 8 hour shift). They do not give you every other holiday off like promised, customers are allowed to verbally degrade you and threaten you, there is also no security. On top of the mayhem and chaos; management, asset protections, district managers, and even peers treat you with suspicion of thievery from the workplace. Store managers are mandated to look through employees belongings at the end of every shift."
bad,A typical day at work was coming in early before the store opened to read emails and sort out the different tasks that's due for the day/week.  Going through compass making sure all tasks are completed on or before the due date. Assigning tasks to team members for the day .  I loved working with the team members and assisting customers finding what they needed.
bad,"They say you're family but in the in you're just another person that can be replaced. I worked every Thanksgiving and Christmas for 11 years straight and when I finally asked for a Christmas off, they threw a tantrum about it."
bad,I didn’t feel safe at Walgreens it was a very slow store. I was unhappy with customers  the benefit was not that great that’s why I wanted a new job Volunteering  at Walgreens was a learning experience for me .
bad,"The job isn’t worth the pay. So much stuff to do for little pay and little acknowledgement. Management pushes everything onto the csa’s. The “frontier” program is said to get the other employees other than management more involved, but in reality, they’re doing it because management is lazy and they’re seeing who can do the most since the company is cutting a billion dollars within the next year. Aka, if you can’t take over what management is supposed to be doing, you’re probablt getting laid off."
bad,"They seem to not care about the over night shifts. Everything gets pushed to them. They get ""upset"" if their mess isn't done. Pluse everything you have to do on top if that."
bad,After doing your shift work you were expected to help the other side of store..which was doing their work for them...most employees slackers they had time to chit chat all shift long. .then they were trying to catch up at the end
bad,"I feel trapped in this place. I will admit I was able to move from regular Customer Service Agent to Certified Pharmacy Technician, but do you think the company care about it? No. Customers can be rude like any other retail store. Managers are snakes. Do not trust anyone. Maybe it is the store I am at but I do not like this company. Help me."
bad,"At this place you will deal with all kinds of things like drama between coworkers that is unnecessary, extremely rude customers, management that doesn’t quite know how to actually do their job correctly, favoritism between managers and coworkers. Really the only great things that this job offered was good pay, long hours, and overtime."
bad,"I would like to say first that I adore my coworkers, shiftleads and my managers. They are wonderful people and typically we all get along well. That being said, I enjoy doing my job but thanks to short staffing and distance to my work, I'm constantly stressed out. There was a period this past month where I worked 10 days straight, despite me telling my job that I needed to cut back on hours because I was having trouble keeping up with school. I have yet to receive adequate time in the pharmacy due to staffing issues (roughly 3 hours in pharmacy since October, when I got my trainee license) and instead of scheduling longer shifts, shifts are roughly 6 hours 5-6 days a week. "
bad,"Walgreens used to be a good place to work. Managers used to care about employees, There used to be enough employees to give good service and get work done. Wages used to be respectable. After two promotions, I earn double what I earned more than fifteen years ago. Everything costs more than double what it cost fifteen eyars ago. I have less money available after paying bills than I did as a teen employee at Walgreens. I also have a lot more responsibility and stress than I had as a teen worker."
bad,"It's a retail job, at least it paid good though. Starting wage in my town was $10/hr. There was good and bad just like how you'd expect but the worse part was corporate. They are very hypocritical and will literally side with the customers in just about every situation just because ""the customer has to be happy."" They sacrifice having a respectful place to work so that customers can feel good about themselves yelling at a 17 year old cashier over stuff that is out of our control. Their policy on handling theft was ""just be nice and maybe they'll find it in their hearts to become regular customers because we treat them so nicely"" when all it did was make theft worse because we were notoriously easy to steal from (shocker right?) It was so bad that you could face a write up or even termination for taking theft problems into your own hands just because corporate doesn't have the brain cells to do it. If you can handle a corporation that doesn't seem to understand how a corporation works then you'll be just fine. Wouldn't stick around too long because the pharmacy is the only thing keeping them from going out of business, otherwise they would've gone bankrupt a long time ago seeing as how my own management talked down on corporate because every choice they made ended up costing the company more money than it could make, hence all the hour and budget cuts me and my coworkers had gone through multiple times throughout my 2 years of working there. I appreciated my coworkers and management but like I've been saying this whole time, CORPORATE SUCKS."
bad,"When I started there was over 1200 employees, now down to 700. Poor management, bad business decisions. Unnecessary overtime and mandatory Saturdays. Poor shift times. 1st and 3rd only. 530 am to 530pm and 730pm to 730am."
bad,"There are people who've spent their entire lives working at the lowest level at Walgreens. "
bad,"Walgreens used to be an excellent place to work, but they have gone downhill in recent years. The corporate mentality has changed from employees are important to employees are expendable."
bad,I did not like working there because they gave you such a hard time when you were trying to learn new skills! I hated working there because I didn’t feel welcomed there!
bad,stressful work environment pay is not as good as the stress the work puts on your life.  Customer is always right and any complaints will be taken above your head even if their is nothing you can do to help them.
bad,"Day at work: Mildly stressful, work load was heavy at times."
bad,Walgreens was a great place to work for until the previous two CEOs.  It was a pharmacy run by pharmacists. Now however it is a pharmacy run by someone who thinks cosmetics are more important that pharmacy.
bad,"So Stressful, terrible store and corporate management of pharmacists.  Disrespectful and cruel."
bad,"A typical day included a lot of walking, dealing with sometimes difficult customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the friendly staff and customers.  The most difficult part of the job would be working for a unqualified boss."
bad,"I loved being a pharmacy technician. It was a lot of work in a fast pace environment. The only negative about the job is it is a minimum wage job to deal with controlled substances, and people's lives."
bad,Walgreens is in the midst of a culture change but it's obvious they're not sure what they want that culture to be. They're have been layoffs each of the last four years including change in almost every key senior position in the company.
bad,"Working at Walgreens you typically do the same things and have the same given task depending on the area you're in. For example, in the cosmetic department you work on certain aisles and ring customers out at the cosmetics register."
bad,worked help patients and help doctors with labs and paperwork. I will work to translate and being able to talk with family schedule appointments and being able to talk with insurance on paying for the bills
bad,"The workers are friendly and go out of their way to help, but the job is awful and ridiculous; it is stressful, there are NOT enough techs, and just awful to work at. So glad I quit."
bad,"At first it was a great company to work for. The typical day was all good and fun. We had great customers, fun some fun co workers, it was a job I liked. After working there for awhile it got bad. Management likes to play favorites, if you requested specific hours or anything and you were not a ""favorite"" then you didn't get it. I was working there for 6 months and I was always, in their words ""the low man on the totem pole"". They also don't pay you enough for everything you do there. They treated me horribly."
bad,I was glad to learn everything that I could from working at Walgreens. The task that I had to learn was very challenging for me. Had a good experience working there.
bad,"Working at Walgreens was a great experience for me.  It taught me a lot about the retail environment.  However I was not really happy working there.  I mean hey, why work somewhere if you feel miserable there all the time.  The customers there were very rude and sometimes walk into the store with the most disgusting attitude and have the nerves to yell at the employees and have major attitude problems.  The down part about working in retail is not really getting the chance to enjoy the holidays with your family or any holiday at all.  Also, working in a 24 hour store was the worst, we were open during hurricane sandy in 2012.  Who ever was scheduled to work that day and lived within the area had to go in to work.  There was no sympathy for the employees, regardless of how bad the weather was, you HAD to be there.  If I was asked if I would go back and work for walgreens, my answer would simply be, NO."
bad,Job becomes tedious due to changes in company. At times you may feel less appreciated than others. Customers can sometimes be hard to deal with. Company does a terrible job of updating employees of anything important. Great first job for high schoolers.
bad,This company is a terrible place to work for. Over worked and under paid. All about politics and favoritism. They dont pay you enough to deal with the daily BS.
bad,"they  were  cool  people  but  they  want  only  one  person  to  face  and  recover  the  whole  store  help  costumers  pick up  shopping  cars  from outside    fill out  the  cooler  sweep  and  map  the  whole  store   and  leave  at  12:30  when the  store  close  at  12  and  it  will  take  at least  half or an hour  to  face  the  whole  store "
bad,"A typical day of work for me involves getting to work and doing everyday price changes and inventory. After that, most of my day revolves around customer service and keeping the customers happy with their photo orders. Through my years at Walgreens, I have learned an abundance of new things. One of the most valuable things that I have learned from my job is patience. I have also become very skilled at visual marketing and with the relationship that I have with my management I have also become more involved with the community. Walgreens has also helped me with diversifying the circle of people I interact with. I have made many lifelong friends that started off as only coworkers. For me, there really isn't anything that I find hard about working at Walgreens, however, I do feel that as I get older, I need something that broadens and expands my knowledge base more."
bad,"I was hired as one of 14 for a 4 month contract-to-hire. They were to hire 6. I was the last to be let go 5 months later. No one was hired. As stated above, we had 2 types of work as temp and I exceeded expectations. One was verification of patient and prescriber info. Average time per ""inbound contact"" was expected to be 4 seconds. I was about 2.80. The other function was clinical review or DURs. We were allowed 9 seconds on average for this. I was at approximately 6.4sec. It was a job where self-motivation and focus were needed and I felt that I displayed those traits along with decisiveness."
bad,"As a healthcare professional consider the 8-10 hrs (AM OR PM) to be brutal.....3 phone lines, one fax, 3 registers, two drive up windows and numerous OTC/HBA inquiries........and you haven't looked at a prescription yet. Throw in vaccinations, and you are flying completely solo. No ancillary help. Ya, they pay great but you'll earn it."
bad,"It is a typical part time job, I learned more a lot of different culture but it was more fun helping people who hardly speak English it feels good making them feel important."
bad,"Typical day at work, would be doing resets and revisions to change the store around when a holiday would come around. It would keep our customers interested in buying different things for them or for another person. Where its for a decoration outside or just a gift."
bad,"I handled orders that came in through our system. I would process them and make sure that they are ready in a timely manner. I would make sure that they fit our guidelines. I kept the machines at a safe chemical level. Disposed of the chemicals in the proper way. I would back up cashier if they needed assistance. Answer questions, phone calls, and deal with returns."
bad,"There is serious issues with management and Sr. management in particular.  The problems starts at the top.  Walgreens corporate professionals are treated like hourly employees, and don't get Paid Time Off until after a year.  Any time taken off prior to one year of completed work, is docked.  No vacation for a year, no sick pay for a year, only time off is holidays.  They are so ingrained in hourly workers in the stores they don't know how to treat salaried employees.  I would definitely not recommend working at Walgreens corporate offices.  "
bad,company is restructuring the once 19 paid manager is now the 11 paid sfl store floor leader ...a lot of work and not enough time...
bad,"This used to be a good job to work for, but now Walgreens wants to pocket more profit, which means more are taken away from the workers. Our hours are being cut, we dont have overtime, there is a pay freeze for us now so no matter how hard you work it doesnt really matter anymore. The shifts are now split and instead of you being a cashier you are more like a salesperson. Managers used to get paid 18 and hr and now they are demoting all of them to being paid 11.50. The pay isnt worth being a manager or even working hard since Walgreens does not care about the people in the stores who bring in their money."
bad,"Been w/company for 4 years, a manager. No growth potential. Best suited for a single white male because they advance faster. Company has lost 2 large lawsuits in last 5 years. First was for not promoting blks compared to whites. Second was not promoting females. I am over educated for position but stay because it pays well and is stable in this economy. No time for social life tho. Oh well."
bad,poor management no help for disabled employees forceful unpaid leave horrible to pregnant women who are injured on the job. no balance in work /life. don't care if you have school.
bad,"I was given a conditional job offer then I was denied once my background came back. I am on felony probation, and instead of giving me a chance, or even asking me the details of what happend, they just denied me and said No. I wouldn't want to work for a company like this. They are unfair. Its a warehouse job! Who do they think applies for positions like these! people that are in need of a second chance."
bad,"I never felt like a team or family at walgreens. They push their people so much. And not in a good way. You have to work, no matter what. You are burnt out? Here's another extra shift. Was not happy there."
bad,"I was offered the associate job, then had to take the drug test.  Test came back fine, then the next step was the background check.  I didn't hear for a week with any results, so called and was told there was an 'error' on the submission but everything was fine.   They finally called and said they never received the background check and hired someone else in the meantime.  Unscrupulous or incompetent  best describes this organization."
bad,"At the store level, Walgreens was the best working experience of my career. My associates worked hard for me, and I led by example; working as hard as I could. Amazing team effort. Unfortunately corporate is unethical and heartless. Mentally challenged associate was fired for not understanding coupon policy. Overnight shift was shut down, and the associates were wronged. They were offered either a position in a store much farther from their homes, if they did not except they were not fired; instead they were no longer scheduled hours. They should have been offered package based on service years, policy was not followed. Corporate lacks heart."
bad,Garbage pay for the amount of work. Employees are consistently pushed out for lower wage employees. Terrible company and I literally have nothing good to say
bad,Walgreens does not treat you like a person. You are treated like a number. The district manager don’t even take the time to even meet the employees.  They try to pretend like you matter in the programs they have but don’t commit and initiating them
bad,"Do not, I repeat do not go and work at this place.. the pay is great, the job is easy but management is sucks and they do not care about you.. you don't have a schedule u can work 9, 10, 11, 12 or more hours every night.. with a 20 mins break"
bad,"I will never work for this company again! Work hard for pennies, they fire you if your 15 minutes late to work nine times in a year. The customers are horrible. The managers are nice but they show favoritism. You only get a 30 minute break and they make you work long hours. (10 hours at the most) It’s hard to use your paid time off because they can never find anyone to cover your shift."
bad,"Working for Walgreens is very stressful, from the entry position all the way up to your store manager. As a cashier, especially working mid afternoon to night time, you play very many roles all at once. It's not just 2 to 4 roles, it's more like 2 to 7 roles and that's just at the entry level position that you only get paid minimum wage for. "
bad,"Management was horrible the experience working at walgreens was horrible. Management was unorganized and was very rude. The hardest part about this job is working with the staff, they are not team players and do not work well with."
bad,I wouldn't do it again. Spent years with promises of promotions never happened. They seen to really promote internally and somehow everyones related somewhere
bad,So the company them selves do not care about the employees. The have cut so many benefits for all employees and want you to work hard but not have very many employees work.
bad,"they would say your working 12every day and that is that no if and or butts, I don t mind over time but 12 hours every day, then they say we might have work on Saturday also, not for me.  I have dogs in the house that need to go out, I need to be home after 10 hours or I got cleaning to do."
bad,"Best part of the job for me was Truck day. A lot to do and the day went by fast. "
bad,"Upper management detached from store management. District managers were chosen based on personal friendships and not talent,  Spends to much time on new programs that don't add value to daily operations."
bad,"I would never recommend Walgreens to anyone as a company to work for. The company could care less about their employees well being or anything else about them,"
bad,"Worked there for about 8 years and promotions were very slim to none.  The raises were terrible, even for high performing employees.  As soon as I left Walgreen I was promoted within the year.  My current bosses also were promoted to management as soon as they left Walgreens.  They want you to only do one thing and that's it.  It's great for people that just want to stay in one position for their whole lives.  It is a very stable job with no growth."
bad,Not a bad job there is room to grow I just wish they would work a little more on their management skills and having their coworkers backs but in the long run I really did enjoy working for the company I just think it really depends on what store you’re at.
bad,"Lets just say there was something of a screw job the American employees got as well as management when Corp bought Boots, an RX firm in the UK. They gave them 51% of the controlling shares and took big bucks to leave the board and allow for the UK partners to take over. They are now vey unethical and loosing good people left and right. "
bad,"I liked working with people. Management sucked, they favored the employees that called in and didn't work hard, over someone who dedicated 4 years to them. I very rarely got to see my son. Way too much drama. And too much favoritism. I would not recommend working there if you have kids."
bad,"This was my first job and it served as a ""foot in the door."" In nearly 4 years of service only got a combined total of 79 cents in raises. I was promised a promotion that never happened and the assistant manager position was changed to ""shift lead"" which started at $16.50 down to $14. It was time to move on at that point as I had too many bills to pay and couldn't afford to live off the $10.04 I left at"
bad,Management makes you stay overtime with no warning and if you don't you get written up. I was in charge of the cosmetic department as a manager and in charge of ordering the whole department as well as receiving truck and unloading and stocking shelves. In charge of going to district meetings regarding the stores cleanliness and stock percentage. Also must have customer service Background and acknowledged all customers
bad,"Standard Retail Management Job"
bad,I feel they have declined in  a lot of areas. seem more corporate & self focused instead of customer & employee focused. prices have continued to go up & quality down. pharmacy seems rushed & gives poor customer service. store managers seem to be more focused on office work & less on customers. some stores customers don't even know the managers.
bad,"Very busy store, and some what loving customers. There is poor management at the Lindell location. I wouldn't recommend this location. Less workers b/c of managment not hiring enough efficient workers. They do not follow prodocall as far as having favoritism inside the store."
bad,This was the most stressful and unrewarding job I've ever had. Absolutely not enough staff to run a pharmacy. This place is ridiculous.
bad,"Very nice people to with and helpful and i learned so many thing as pharmacy technician i had a good experience. First if all  i learned to do despensing any kind of medecine taking any phone call , labelling the medecine taking the prescription from the customer, making any phone calls to different doctors for refills request ."
bad,Heavily engaged in outsourcing.    Techs are located in India and Mexico and not proficient.  Walgreens is not an american company anymore; its ran by European investors.
bad,"Working at the Pontiac Walgreens was like being in grade school; too my cliques, favoritism towards particular clerks from management.  Inappropriate behavior from management."
bad,"In the morning I start with the health care clinic patients follow-up phone calls. I walk isles to help customers find products they are looking for while also stocking, facing, and cleaning the four isles I am responsible for. I manage the Health Care Space, directing patients to the correct area. "
bad,"I've been a employee at Walgreens for almost 2 years now. My store has the highest turn around ever!! Since I've been employes there I've seen 3 pharmacy managers, 3 store managers, stealing, numerous robberies etc. Scheduling is the number one problem at my store. It's horrible. And the communication is just horrible..   it's techs that work there that don't know that they're not a manager. Smh I have been trying to transfer for almost a year now and the store manager and pharmacy manager do not want me to leave because I am one of the best techs. I really think it can be better if everyone gets on the same page..."
bad,"My job title was Order Picker, pulling product to set up orders to retail stores."
bad,"I like to work for Walgreens its an amazing place to work. The only thing I lacked is job growth within the company. I had learned to greet customers, exceled in sales with the company."
bad,walgreens is a fast paced company loved it there.a lot of room for growth with this company
bad,"The management was mean and picked favorites. They love to talk about people they don't like behind their backs. I was treated like a dog by the shift lead, who just pointed toward anywhere I needed to be and snapped his fingers at me. My co-workers who had the same job as me were very nice though! I will NEVER work for this Walgreens again and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to work there."
bad,The manager at the store I worked at was great. Employees were two-faced. Company has some verygood policies and also some very stupid policies. Company expects to much from its Shift Leaders with little to no help.
bad,Started with Walgreens almost a year ago and job was ok at first then a lot if things started to change started adding a lot of different wording to script as if it was a sales job and I was hired to take inbound calls from patients in regards to there medications. Now you have to call patients to ask them if there interested in the service and rebuttal and them why not if they don't want to sign up just like a sales job and they do not pay enough for what they want u to do
bad,"Walgreens does not have any respect for its employees for benefits, rooms for advancement, understanding, etc.  The company has totally gone downhill since I first started.  Taken more benefits away and budget hours every year to save money to look good for its shareholders.  Healthcare benefits does not even cover for Emergency Rooms anymore."
bad,"Too much work with little wage, no fulltime employees the company is taking a diffeernt direction. unsafe crime happening is.more often at walgreens.."
bad,Management keeps employees who do not perform there job correctly or efficiently. The play favorites and your voice will not be heard. Certain techs have a sense of entitlement and will make it known.
bad,"The pay is great, but the hard labor isn’t worth it. You have to lift heavy crates & that ended up giving me constant backaches. This environment caused me to feel depressed."
bad,At Walgreens I was able to step out my shell . Because I had to do things I’ve never done in sales ... which also help boost my confidante . Love the customers and the experience I gained .
bad,This company is not loyal or appreciative of their employees. This employer has changed its policies and procedures and they are not thoughtful of the people that have been there for years.
bad,"I loved working for this company, made alot of friends there planned of staying there until I retired but God had other plans.The people for the most part made it the most enjoyable job I ever had."
bad,"I don’t recommend anyone to work for Walgreens!! You don’t get treated fairly, you don’t make enough for what you do, they expect you to know everything. The hours suck!"
bad,"Management did very little work, bragged about bonuses but the employees who worked the hardest still living in poverty. Hard work and initiative barely noticed, not rewarded. Most of the store didn't get annual raise and the Assistant Manager who did the reviews that caused this wasn't available when the reviews were gone over with employees. It was more important to be ""besties"" with the manager than to actually work hard. May be different at other stores."
bad,"The co-workers were excellent, but the shift management gave no clear direction. The store manager was very good. The store location suffered a lot of theft, but the company did not encourage active deterrence."
bad,Great place for advancement. No stability in schedule constantly changing. Not equal in team work load. Pay too low for amount of responsibility as store team lead.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job were the loyal customers that you build relationships with. You are provided all breaks. Management is quick to respond to any situation or need. I loved the excellent customer service that I could provide and knowing the answers to their questions. The most enjoyable art of the day was laughing with the customers
bad,"Walgreens went from being a great company to a cooperated failure. Walgreens expects you to go far from beyond knowing the fact that your under staff. A person could be going to school, and the manager would be so mad and expects you to priorities walgreens. As a pharmacy tech, your put in a environment where stress is a on going bases. Your expected to do 2o times at once, and if you make a mistake its on you. No coverage for the staff for days off..."
bad,"Walgreens is a exciting place to work. I've worked at Walgreens for about 2 years, and I like that I work early mornings. Walgreens has many benefits such as profit sharing, and stocking."
bad,"The store manager is not nice to any of her employees. I take care of the customers, I face the shelves & I stock them also."
bad,"My job at Walgreens, I learned to be a team leader, a teacher, and a hard worker. I was dedicated to my job and did what was asked of me. We did everything from stock shelves to unloading big trucks from warehouse. We merchandised our products and gave excellent customer service."
bad,Avoid at all costs they do not care about their employees they overwork their employees and give them minimum wage people just starting there are making more money than people who have worked there for 9 years
bad,Working at Walgreens is fun and easy and it's joyment there lot's of people making friends the overtime i love people and meeting new people walking around helping people and doing things for people
bad,"If you want to work here make sure to have no self respect because it will be gone within your first few months of employment. Also don't expect help from management because they really can't be bothered. You'll be relying on the 1 (or 2 if your lucky) other co-worker  to help you have everything finished by the end of the day. For $9 an hour your daily requirements will most likely include running the register, photo dept, unloading the truck, organizing your bay, keeping the entire store clean, and also helping customers. If there is a customer issue or the customer becomes abusive, you'll just have to take it because as stated, management cannot be bothered. If your squeemish, don't work here because you will definitely have to clean up diarrhea and/or vomit at least once a week."
bad,"They don’t care about their employees at all. I was their not even a month and the store I worked at got robbed not even 2 months later we got robbed AGAIN and what did Walgreens do, get us security for a month and that’s it. The managers usually don’t close so they can careless they think when it comes down to it just give them the money and everything will be fine. They are so nonchalant because it didn’t happen to them. I would recommend anybody work for This company they care solely about earning an extra dollar and have absolutely no concern for the safety of their employees. Most of their customers aren’t  customers their thieves anyway."
bad,I work at Walgreens for roughly 8 months and upper management is a joke..the give the best workers a heavy work and the slackers just collects a paycheck..no recognition for your work..bunch of homophos..beauty consultant makes homophobic jokes in front of managers and they do absolutely nothing!! That was the last straw for me
bad,"They would override everything the only time I could take of was for court no free time an they rubbed me an every one I worked with there the wrong way so bad we don’t even shop there no more #whohurtyoubro "
bad,The store In Shelbyville Tennessee is the most disorganized workplace I’ve ever worked at . The pay as a pharmacy technician is not worth it and they will not give you a raise no matter how long you’ve been there. Hints why the turnover rate is terrible! The store including the pharmacy is poorly managed. If you’re looking for a place with fair scheduling or almost there scheduling this is not the place for you. I would not waste your time working at the store or this pharmacy
bad,The job in general was amazing and allowed for me to grow. However corporate and management did not seem too keen on helping their employees to grow and learn.
bad,I would not recommend this place to anyone. I started my first day as a pharmacy tech they didn’t give me any direction at all they sat me in front of a computer in a FREEZING room gave me a piece of paper that said “for the new girl” and one of the mangers helped me on to the computer than left. I was there for three hours with absolutely no direction of when I was supposed to leave if I could take a break not even where the bathroom was this was the most terrible experience I’ve had with an employer.
bad,"where do I start, management is terrible. They expect you to do the job of 4-5 people. restocking,putting up sales tag,being loss prevention, being the cleaning crew, being  a cashier for  Pharmacy,photo,beauty counter and the front registers. Oh and I forgot with no training you are pretty much winging it. My store had huge favoritism the store manager didnt care about the store nor her employees to much work not worth the pay. Hours and constantly cut  one week you have  40 hours another week  9 hours Corporate cuts huge budgets especially on labor but when you are there they try to work you like a horse."
bad,"Favoritism, lacks in motivation and any and all reasons are deemed worthy to be fired. Customers in downtown are the worst. Homeless and crazy can come steal without worries and if you stop them then you'll get fired."
bad,The people I worked with were great but they will use any method possible to fire you. I  believe this is more the case if you were inherited from Rite Aid as I was at a higher salary. They use it as a way of reducing payroll.
bad,"Walgreens doesn’t care about their employees . Everyone is replaceable , if your store manager doesn’t like you for whatever reasons he/she can treat you how ever they want and get away with it . It’s basically a high school ran by the mean girl . Everyone tries to kiss the store managers butt to get in good with them to be able to get promoted or have certain days off . So there’s a lot of back stabbing in this place"
bad,"Management will play you like a fool."
bad,"Sure Walgreens was great for the first almost 5 years I worked there but making one mistake that goes against their ""company policy"" and I am suddenly gone. Be careful if you wish to work here."
bad,Walgreens does not care about the well being of their customers nor their employees. They are only concerned about making money. They do not hold employees accountable of their actions nor do they even care about the attendance policy as long as they have a body available. They receive numerous complaints from customers especially when it comes to the pharmacy department.
bad,"This is an extremely stressful place to work, especially working in their pharmacy. The Walgreens motto should be “do more with less and like it”...with their constant hour cuts you are always running around doing the work of 6 people. Plus the pay is a joke for the work you have to do."
bad,"Walgreens says they’re going to give you great training, but as soon as you’re on the floor they treat you badly if you don’t catch on quick enough. Some of the people were really nice and some super pushy. The pay is 14.50 an hour and the insurance isn’t great. It’s a good place to get a little experience while looking for a better pharmacy job."
bad,"I’ve been with this company for 3 years now, they just changed it to us only getting a little raise once a year which is based off of what your manager thinks of you. I work very hard so I always get the biggest raise which is 40 cents! They just changed it to if you don’t work an average of 34 hours in 52 week period than you don’t get ANY pto but they cut our hours so none of us have any control over that. I work hard because of short staffing and never get rewarded or recognized."
bad,Don’t work here unless you need flexible hours. The only good thing about this place is the overnight hours. The company blames employees and constantly punishes them. I could see them falling apart in the next 10 years.
bad,"managers would cuss at you in front of customers and treat you horrible 24/7, family emergency that happened last min they made you feel like bad because you had to call out and they would constantly talk smack about everyone behind their backs"
bad,"A lot of discrimination ,management is terrible no team work ,communication its suck ,its the wost company to work for .its a good work place to be at"
bad,"I've been with Walgreens for 15 years and put in my very best. I've never given poor performance, and I've been told by all my superiors that I'm an overachiever, and that I've never disappointed. Regardless of this, my performance has seldom been rewarded. My performance and efforts have often gone unnoticed when time for performance review and promotion opportunities arise. Employees and managers that slack at their job and burden others with their workload often receive lenient treatment, and they hardly receive any criticism to improve their behavior. Pharmacy technicians working at Walgreens must handle a lot of prescriptions on a day to day basis, and this position requires a lot of moving around. If one person doesn't do their job, their tasks must be completed by someone else. Often times, employees that actually prioritize their responsibilities must take on the work of others to improve work flow. Unfortunately, the majority of individuals employed by Walgreens perform far lower than what is expected of them. Managers that are suppose to oversee the performance of all employees are unsure of how to handle negligence by employees, and often avoid any form of formal confrontation with them. I am really disappointed with the company, and for the sake of those who pursue retail pharmacy at Walgreens, I wish great improvements are made."
bad,Do not try to work at Walgreens. It will make you unhappy to go to work. Just ask any employee if you dare to go into a Walgreens to purchase anything. Horrible Pharmacy and horrible place to work. Do not put yourself through this job. Seriously.
bad,"Always about the numbers, show little care about employees. Policies and procedures are flexible never consistent. Rules apply to some people while others are overlooked."
bad,I don’t suggest you work here unless you arent bothered by unfair pay and being wrongfully criticized for no reason. You will be treated unfair and you will be a joke
bad,Excellent company to work with.  Corporate works with you as much as possible.  Consistant learning and training is offered.  Management is good to work with.
bad,I worked for this company for almost 35 years. I felt that they were trying to get rid of me.  Company loyalty seems to mean nothing to this company anymore.
bad,It's very frustrating to work at Walgreens employees are expected to do everything without a good wage. Expected to work holidays without holiday pay because I wasn't there 6 months. I feel unappreciated. Also we are always understaffed.
bad,"poor working environment, company doesn't pay well, lack of management and senior leadership, poor direction given to staff and management doesn't dig in and help get tasks accomplished"
bad,"Walgreens used to be a place I loved to work, until the past year.  There are so many changes taking place and overall, upper management has their own agenda."
bad,They don't care about their employees. Upper management is the worst.  They are not interested in listening to their employees suggestions as to how the company can be ran more efficiently.
bad,"The climate is now very cut-throat. You can trust a handful of people that you work with and they will fire you at the drop of a hat. They want people to stay for a short time so they don't have to give you a raise. The company doesn't care about its employees and they give you an incredible work load and say ""the focus is the customer"". But you can't focus on the customers because there's a list a mile long of what they want you to do instead."
bad,"This is the worst job i ever applied to in my life, especially at this lake st in aurora , il location. Please go fill out another application to anywhere but here i rather work a homeless shelter for free than to work here. The management wack and treat you like child even if you are AN ADULT, they are disrespectful super bad, i literally had to walk out on this job one day cause mentally, you don't get NO HELP, mangers are mad when its backed up with people and they have to help. They will play games with your head and having you doing goofy things all day for $9 an hour. Your pay rate will not go up. They have favoritism bad in this place. You are not allowed to talk to your other employees at all they will write you up!  The store lady  manager tole me before i quit that i would never last at my new job (words of encouragement right)  jokes on her. I make more money than she do now and all of those managers there right now. so haapy i left best decision in my life"
bad,By far the worst employer I have ever worked for. The “training” is a joke and you are expected to know how to do everything correctly from day one and there is no one there to assist you if you have questions. I would never recommend this god forsaken place to anyone. My pharmacy technician skills were wasted at this place and no one around me knew anything compared to what us LEGITIMATE pharmacy technicians do. God awful place.
bad,The management is a joke. The pharmacy is a joke. The whole company is a joke.. They lie and cheat you out of hours and certificates. You never really see your success. And they are rude and back stabbing.
bad,they are a company ruined by the workers. No1 at the head office knows if we're being treated fairly or not. Racist still exist within this company too
bad,"I would stock shelves, customer service was a must. So interacting with the customers was a big opportunity throughout my job title. On Saturdays we had a big beauty event."
bad,understaffed and bullied by management. I received almost no training on their complicated pharmacy computer system. They tried to short change me on unused vacation time when I left.
bad,"If i do any work.i do work hard so that i get succes.."
bad,"terrible place to work"
bad,"i wouldnt advise nobody to work there especially if they have a family to feed and take care of , low pay , horrible management , no advancement , poor customer service"
bad,Typical day at work was exhausting. Workplace culture was your are on your own to get it done no matter what. Hardest part of the job was the physical labor.
bad,"Terrible  work environment and very stressful through holidays,  management out of touch with reality.  Currently looking for better ways to meet my family's needs"
bad,The store manager that I was employed under was not a kind man. He was less than 2 years from retirement and thus spent a great deal of the day not actively working.
bad,"Working here was awful, mainly because there are not a lot of break options even though the job requires you to be on your feet all day. My personal manager was rude and disrespectful to women."
bad,"No future. Attorneys and Paralegals treated very differently. Where great employees go to have their careers die or get laid off in three years, when the organizational hierarchy shifts."
bad,The upper management is terrible.  They do not support any of their staff.  Especially the assistant managers.  They are are a terrible company to work for.
bad,"The regular customer load of any given location is relatively high to begin with, so busy waves of customers are very common especially at 24 hour locations."
bad,Walgreens was a great place to work for. I had good people to work with. The training was good. I tried to go back to work there but was not able. I would go back if I was rehired.
bad,"Open 24 hours a day 7 days a week, busy all day made time go by fast. Unable to eat lunch at a descent time. Great co-workers, will recommend anyone that Walgreens in a great place to work."
bad,Management never was able to schedule with a reasonable time frame. Tended to be a hostile environment as well. Issues between coworkers were not handled appropriately
bad,"If you get a good Store Manager and nice crew, the teamwork model at Walgreens works spectacularly! I love the flexibility in scheduling, and the neighborhood feel of the stores.Ever since merging with Boots, the restructure of the company has been a little concerning. Management has become distant and doesn't spend as much time on the floor with the team anymore."
bad,This company was good when I first started but as I got to know the higher managers I learned that it is who you know not how qualified you are when it comes to promotions. The managers that get promoted without being qualified are not held accountable letting them feel it is okay  to not help out.
bad,Worked hard as a Shift-Lead Manager and was disappointed in how they handled a situation.  I learned a lot of different ways to handle any customer situations working on graveyard.
bad,management is horrible. the managers are not trained to be managers. co-workers are lazy. I had to pick up the slack for them countless of times. not a great place to work at all
bad,"This company is not a company that thinks highly of its employees or its patients.  There are parameters put in place to measure time taken to complete certain aspects of filling prescriptions that should not be time based.  Many of these parameters weigh heavily on employee evaluations.  This causes an environment for mistakes to be made.    Don't short change yourself, do something better with your pharmacy degree if you are a pharmacist."
bad,The benefits are great but the actual employer is horrible. They expect so much from you for you to get paid so little. It would be great first job for teenagers looking to earn experience and pay.
bad,Poor shift lead very unprofessional bad pay bad benefits I wouldn't recommend unless you really need the money they hire unprofessional people
bad,A lot of labor work for this job position and long hours. You do learn how to stock and unload the truck and more.  A typical work day will be counting products and resetting shelves and at the same time check out customers.  Friendly customers from time to time.
bad,midwest medical records they have back customer service they did not have thing in order and come out to talk to the employes more
bad,"I liked how flexible the managers were when you needed time off and thats about it. There was never ending busy work, and the management never acknowledged a job well down, or when associates had gone above and beyond expectations."
bad,"Walgreens is a wonderful Company to work for. Unfortantly I wasn't able to be taught anything or helped in any situation, I was left solo to handle situations. However I did the best and correctly. Just got frustrating because I wanted to learn more!"
bad,The management was atrocious. The most enjoyable part of the day was either leaving for going to lunch. I dreaded going into work because it seemed as though the managers only job was making trouble for employees.
bad,"I honestly did not like working there. minimum wage for a lot of labor work. my hours were from 6-3pm sometimes, what I liked most of my job was stocking the shelfs"
bad,bad place to work run run run away hope you can run fast these people do not care for you your family no one. Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad place it is the devil
bad,My typical day is going in the store with a smile. I always set  out a plan for  myself to prioritize my day. My store manager always has a list that he would like done. Its my job to see to it that as much work is done as possible. Customers come first of course so every depends on how busy we are. I give out my expectations to all my employees I am in charge of for the day. My employees work on these as they can. I help customers with any possible need throughout the day. Sometimes balancing out my time can be difficult. I go home with a smile knowing I have given the day 110 percent.
bad,"It was an ok place to work, but at the time the management staff was not that professional and did a really poor job of training all of the new hires. The would expect you to know how to do something, but did not try to train you on that subject."
bad,I work for a busy pharmacy that dispenses an average of 750 prescriptions daily.  I have learned that the patient is our primary concern.  My job is to take care of the patient and make sure that the pharmacy maintains great work flow.  I love my co-workers I feel as though I work with family.  The hardest part of the job is leaving for the day unless I'm the technician that closes for the day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making a patient happy by working with my pharmacy team accurately and efficiently to dispense their medication in a timely fashion.
bad,Boring place to work. Employees aren`t nice and management is a hassle. An okay place to work if you have nothing but time on your hands.
bad,The managers knew I was going to start working there 3 weeks before I actually started after starting I was there for 2-3weeks and they never got me in the computer system. I had a manager tell me I was  a pain in his butt. and the pharmacist tell me they didn't have room for people who made mistakes even tho I had no training due to not being put in the computer system.
bad,They are eliminating jobs weekly and are not willing to pay the employees that have been with the company for many years.  They want to hire new employees for less money.
bad,I came into work see if I needed to level items on shelf then worked on register. management was not fair. co-workers were not helpful at all. hardest part of the job was having to do everything by myself.
bad,"This is the most disorganized company I have ever worked for."
bad,"I learned there the people was great and very helpful. to better my career as a pharmacy tech, I wish that I got the job there."
bad,It was not enjoyable. I was promised full-time work but was only given less than part-time hours. It was hard to pay the bills working here and with so little money.
bad,Don't be deceived by the whole health mantra this place has. They are not too concerned with employee health if you are in management.
bad,work with good people but really all they care about is the bottom line and how stock prices are doing. customers and employees really come in last.
bad,"The worst job I ever had was being an intake coordinator in college point queens. The people are unprofessional, the environment and work load is unorganized, there is no secure leadership, not a team oriented environment, and no proper training."
bad,"Horrible place to work and the staff was so unfriendly I could not believe it., They treated their patients horribly, and their staff. Horrible traingin program as well"
bad,"I didn't like working here, its a horrible place, mean management unorganized, and you will freeze to death in the pharmacy, its always busy, and you never get to eat, literally."
bad,"warehouse very talkative lots of gossip just like school all over again. Never know when your getting off."
bad,"I was a front end manager at a local manager and we were sold to Walgreens pharmacy. I received no training, did not feel like I could ask for guidance everybody was rude including the head pharmacist, The store manager was a loose cannon. I did far more in the pharmacy than I was given credit. I ran insurance, filled medications and kept the drive through waited on in an efficient manner which was very hard back breaking work. I never felt appreciated. Co-workers were rude. Finding medicine locations. I loved running insurance and data entry. Waiting in drive through and dealing with crazy management and pharmacists that thought they were God not willing to help you learn"
bad,I would say that this company is not a employee friendly environment. The company just recently got bought out. We have been hearing rumors or not so good things for us that have been there 10 plus years.
bad,"IF YOU WANT TO GET FIRED BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT TRAINED PROPERLY. WORK HERE."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. "
bad,"I didn't like working here. The technicians and pharmacists were rude. Every time I'd ask a question, I felt as though I was bothering someone. And the hours were terrible!"
bad,"sales associate, assisting customers, limited assistance"
bad,Poorly run district. No chance for development. No work/life balance. Lack of respect.
bad,I like working in Walgreens because you meet all kinds of people throughout the day.
bad,"No hours, no pay, not stable, stressful, heavy work load. Never again."
bad,"It is always fun for me working with Walgreens because it saved as the platform for me to learn and acquired the skill necessary to become better pharmacist."
bad,Extremely stressful place to work. Does not promote from within.
bad,"They will work you to the bone. There will be a hiring freeze, but they will let employees go and push all of the work off on other employees. I worked in the pharmacy, the worst job I've ever had. Also expect to be treated bad for wanting to take a lunch, even just 15 minutes"
bad,Walgreens is a job but they only take care of people they like and kiss butt if you put your head down and work it take longer to get a promotion.
bad,fast fun and friendly. area of workspace were always clean and customer would mostly be satisfied.
bad,"Not a very good learning experience, they received a new computer system and were not able to teach me"
bad,"I was an employee for a long time. They change the rules faster than the wind blows. We were discriminated against for being from Indiana because the warehouse manager was from California. She thought we were ""just a bunch of farmers and hillbillies!""  There were countless complaints. We complained to corporate and nothing was ever done. As for this postion  there have 5 previous managers that should tell you something about how they run their company! In less than ONE YEAR they lost 11 GOOD people!! It is the WORST PLACE I have ever worked!!!"
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of performing the basic duties of the job but yet going above and  beyond for customers, I learn the even though the customers may not be right you should always listen to their concerns, and problems no matter even though you may have the answer it shows to the customers that you care. Management there were some mangers I truly enjoy working with because of their flexibilities and personalities, verses the rest of the mangers who had attitude problems and brought their negativity in to work (but I still spoke to them). The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude people but I have to remember you never know what someone is going through always speak and smile. Lastly the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I help someone and they were satisfied and told me that I was a wonderful employee and I was always pleasant and cheerful."

bad,Over an pretty exciting job experience. Great on the job training.
bad,You are surrounded by the whole downtown ! The store is dirty. The staff is very unproffesional
bad,"I enjoyed my co workers, most of my managers were good and team players."
bad,I did not enjoy my time here. I did my clinical here and the staff was rude and and not very patient at all!
bad,I worked there for 6 years and had bad managers. I was there for the money and the benefits. I did make friends with a few of my co-workers but not very many. The hardest part of the job was putting up with irate customers.
bad,"Fill prescriptions, answer phones, customer service, deceifering doctor's prescriptions."
bad,Walgreen's Distribution Center in South Windsor is one of the worst places for non disabled people to work. There are no rewards for exceptional production but harsh treatment for the smallest of rules infraction.
bad,This is not a professional place to work. It always gets robbed and the management does not know how to keep everything organized and under control.
bad,"Company is great to work for it all depends on your location and management. They open all year round,but that retail. You can grow with in the company"
bad,Worked with Walgreens Corporation for ten years as Senior Beauty Advisor.  Saw many store positions eliminated over the period in which I was employed.
bad,At first I was excited to work here the pay was exactly what I needed and the benefits were great too. The cafeteria is amazing so were the hours. The job was also full time which was great. I believe I needed more training the training that we had was almost nothing compared to what we would experience on the call floor. This job litterally gave me phone anxiety for a short time after I quit. My third day on the call floor I had a esculation call where the customer wanted a supervisor I tried to connect the customer to the supervisor and she refused to take the call. This made me think if this is how I will be treated as a employee then I can not work here. Working here is extremely stressful.
bad,its  an ok job its hard work I enjoyed some days I like one o the manages the other was to bossy and wanted people put out of there
bad,i didn’t really enjoy it as mush as you think i would. the other workers and managers are not friendly and they pick favorites right in front of your face
bad,I really got nothing to say it just lack of thing to do the paid is good the people is good too friendly too. I learn how to kept my time on i just have a problem with the code to get in the storage.
bad,"its a ok job, hours are always getting cut. If the store is not making money they cuts hours. one i was getting 40 and next week its 30."
bad,"This job was a good one, i was the office manager and i dealth with the clients, booking appointments and estimates on jobs."
bad,This job everyone did their job and if you needed someone you could depend on them.
bad,dishonest company but if you dont mind that its a fun place to work
bad,Treat you like a family. They was nice and make sure you had work to do but some days it got slow and we went home early but was back at work the next day at your full time position.
bad,"I had a ton of good days, I had a ton of bad days, but all in all I truly enjoyed my work experience there, store was always business so never anytime to feel bored, it was always something that needed to be done daily and the relationships you create with the customers can be long lasting."
bad,Too many customers to attend. No one was ever happy working there. customers were constantly unhappy with our service. not enough staff.
bad,They have no compassion for their employees when it comes to being sick or a family event. If you are sick they expect you to come and spread your germs to everyone in the store
bad,I was only working there as an extern for school so unfortunately i was not working there very long. However what i did learn fro. Walgreens is that they are very fast paced which I loved and also they have a system where everything flows smoothly. I learned alot from being an extern at their store.
bad,Worked there was amazing at first a lot of things to do while working everyone was a team player they us a lot of goals and expectations and it was fun and amazing work schedules were pretty good beside all the homeless and no security wasn’t a good location but pretty decent
bad,"1. It was fun some days and sometimes boring"
bad,"On my job i always have good days. i help customers and patients everyday. almost everyday a patient tells me that im nice and very friendly, in also had one patient to give me a gift card for me awesome work."
bad,"Working in a retail pharmacy has its good and bad days, but you must posses  strong customer service skills to provide quality care."
bad,I have nothing bad to say about them. I recommend to do your job don't make friends. The employees at Walgreens can be very competitive. Don't trust anyone.
bad,"I have never worked for a company that has no shame in letting their employees know that all the company cares about is money,money,money! I believe I speak for all the technicians and pharmacists I had the privilege to work with that we were short staffed, under paid, and unappreciated. I worked so much over time when employed for Walgreen's because the company refused to hire more technicians."
bad,If you’re looking to head into a mental institution Walgreens would send you over  a cliff. Poor management in the Pharmacy altogether. Worst job I ever had!
bad,"Oh, where do I begin?  Let's start from the beginning."
bad,"Un dia tipico muy estresante, mucho trate discriminatorio no hay vida entre vida familiar y trabajo no hay arreglos .Es un lugar muy deprimente no valoran el labor de empleado si no estas detallando tu vida personal juegan de manera sucia con los empleados que no son de su agrado"
bad,If you have a bad store manager this job will suck. My store manager was a sexiest. Only male workers got raises and promotions. No one was held accountable for their actions. The boys slacked all day while the girls worked their butts off. Of course all the boys where managers.
bad,"Working for walgreens Save A Trip is horrible. They have no understanding about life events. They want you to just work. You can’t miss any days, you can’t do a half a day without them both counting against you. Only excused days are PTO and Jury duty. Nothing else is excusable. It’s the worst job I’ve ever had in my life. I would not recommend working for them to no one."
bad,The people of Walgreens need to improves  the manner that they work with the Employees and how they do the management. They don’t really listen the employees opinion or needs.
bad,When I was working at walgreens there were always people stealing or getting in fights inside the store. Also the managers always seemed like they didn’t like working there when you would need assistance. Had flexible hours just lazy rude managers.
bad,They promise  a lot and then do not fulfill those promises. Not understanding to the wellness or health of their employees which is what they advertise the most.
bad,"The team members or your coworkers are fantastic to work with. Their enthusiasm and positive energy make it a fun place to work as well as a job you want to come to"
bad,"My schedual was all over the place, and changing without my knowledge, and the women there were very catty and messy. The store manager whom was a women at the time got fired infront of everyone and cried, it was crazy. We got a male store manager and he was worse. He started off super cool then switched up on everyone. The job was overall very childish."
bad,There are no words to describe what happened.  Their performance review is not based on how good of an employee you are but how well liked you are.  You don't get a raise unless the store does well or you bow to your sm.  I sat at base pay for 2 years when the new asm started marking more than me.
bad,"Honestly, I cannot believe I even wasted my time working with this company. Lack of motivation from both them employees as well as management level individuals. Be expected to be paid around minimum wage for more work than anyone in the store would be able to comprehend, including the Pharmacists."
bad,"Horrible place to work at. The co workers are all unhappy, never fully staff, always work left from the previous  day, mangement sucks. The customers are always rude, nasty and impatient  . Working for Walgreens is like being in jail, do your time and get out. Find another pharmacy job."
bad,"My coworkers and customers were awesome, however this company doesn't care about their employees. They would have you work open to close 7:45 am til 9:15 pm without clocking out for a break. If they had two shifts working together and one was about to go into overtime they would make that shift take a 2 hour or longer lunch so they wouldn't have to pay overtime. Advancement in the company isn't based of personal performance it's all about who you know. The pay is great but not worth being used like a dog."
bad,good place only if you have right store manager been get picked on an written up by store manager more an more but to speak bluntly the company as a whole is slowly degrading these days new employees who come in last a year an quit and long term people are getting pushed out if you really want to work at Walgreens know your rights have a lawyer on hand if you have disabilities like myself good luck because some store managers do not care if you don't meet there expectations they pick on you
bad,"Walgreens is a good company to start off at. However, I don’t recommend staying at this company for the long run, many people get stuck and are there for years. No great benefits."
bad,"I liked working for them in the beginning. "
bad,Walgreens has become a money making company that has forgotten the value of their employees. The cutting of many positions left long term team members without many options. They need to restratigize the way employees are paid.
bad,Great place to work. Cashier is always smiling and polite . Would love to work there again someday. Photo Department is aldo great and very fast on printing pictures
bad,The manager was rude and very unfriendly at hour the other people I met were very friendly and highly reliable I only did it temporarily so I can’t tell you that much
bad,"I started working at walgreens to get experience and some money, little did i know the manager was going to overwork me as a part time making me work over full time hours without full time benefits, as well as working every holiday while other employees got holidays off, i did not get a raise, nor was i moved around from my normal position regardless of lack of help."
bad,"Walgreens Pharmacy Tech: The safe and effective dispensation of medication is essential to the provision of health care. The senior certified pharmacy technician is a dispensary agent who acts as an assistant to licensed pharmacists to ensure these processes occur as needed. Pharmacy technicians offer this assistance in many ways, such as the compiling, double-checking, and labeling medications. They are also responsible for answering customer questions about medications and dosage, as well as performing clerical duties such as handling cash registers and keeping the work area tidy. Some certified pharmacy technicians work in hospital pharmacies, which may require extra duties such as keeping patient records and preparing medications to be distributed by nursing staff. In some cases, the senior certified pharmacy technician may supervise pharmacy clerks and junior pharmacy technicians."
bad,"A long list of tasks and responsibilities for a job that starts off with less pay than that of a grocery bagger. That's absolutely ridiculous. HR is incredibly difficult to talk to as they are a corporate office and really don't see what goes on in individual stores. There is no way to submit any criticism anonymously. While you're on the job you can expect to explain how insurance works daily, and also answer non-stop ringing phones, run both front and drive through by yourself, and expect to work every weekend and evening. You're pretty much a glorified cashier with a salary cap at 30g, and you're definitely just a number."
bad,"Worked for this company for 18 yrs. Seen so many changes and people came and gone but I stayed loyal to this company Evan when Ive slowly seen this company moral and values starting to decline .as a shift lead I thought I could make a difference being fair and compassion to my co-workers but in reality everyone stabs everyone in the back and never get a chance well done or Pat on the back .Soon as I stepped down after 8 yrs of being shift lead got so burned out   lost so much family time .I went back to being a cashier and they decided to slowly cut my hrs to 15 hrs a week at that point after 18 yrs I was crushed realizing your not valuable to then anymore they toss you to the side wanting to frustrated you so bad their hoping you just quit . eventually you do cause you realize your more valuable than how they treat you.walgreens is just about greed we do all the hard work ,make sacrifices ,stressed out we become robots to them and we're not human being anymore ."
bad,I don't feel like I was trained properly add when I asked for I was put down and told I didn't ask enough questions. I got looked down upon for helping customers and making their day
bad,Only in America can you get screwed over. They will take you and put you to a level and can’t even comprehend. It’s something you have to know before you go.
bad,I would truly consider the option of working for this organization. They promote from within and individuals have worked here for a long time. I would not get my hopes up for a lateral or bilateral move as it will be someone they know.
bad,"The managers were demanding and unreasonable, the hours weren't terrible but they weren't steady either, and the store manager would regularly change my availability without my knowing and schedule me for shifts I could not work."
bad,The company itself does very little to acknowledge their workers. They offer very little help but have very high expectations and unrealistic ideas to aid with their mission. My team specifically that i work with makes it easier tho. like the manager herself make our life easier and personally reward us. being we all hate our lives with the company.
bad,"What I liked the most: I formed friendships with some of my coworkers and they really encourage good customer service. I enjoyed being good at my job and helping others."
bad,"Senior management comes in a couple of times a month and tears everyone and everything down. They focus on finding the negative. Continuous improvement should be the goal but there is a way to approach everything and unfortunately they don't always know how to ""read the room."" The goals and initiatives that are sent down the pipeline are often unattainable or out of touch with how the business can actually be run."
bad,Very political company to work for and hours are cut after flu season. You may be told you are being hired full time but the reality is 12 hours. Where I work other techs expect you to cover their shifts when asked and if you don't you get no hours.
bad,"shipments always come in, every week you have to put away all items before the next week. Everyone is assigned an area so you do have help putting up the entire shipment."
bad,"poor management, horrrible communication, very stressful day to day place. would not recommend to anyone anytime soon, disrespectful managers and poor supervision."
bad,I had to take a pay cut even though I have 11 years of Pharmacy experience. They always offer as low as possible in pay. Advancement isn't possible unless you move from Pharmacy to management in the store. Slave drivers.
bad,"There always seemed as if advancement within the company was forbidden and people were watching you like a hawk. No communication with higher authority and a lot of assumptions, no facts when accusing people of attitudes or bad demeanor."
bad,It's a good experience but I don't have the money to drive the distance that it was from my house at the time and it wasn't a good match for me.  I like doing labour jobs.
bad,"It started off good. And went downhill from there. Too much whining by slow technicians. Bigoted foreign pharmacists and techs. Some really good upper managers, but that doesn't help at store level.Good computer used to your disadvantage with metrics. Store managers butt into your business way too much. Too much volume. Be prepared to be treated like a dog."
bad,"Hired as front line cashier for minimum wage. But you have to do a lot more than ring up customers. Management was not the best. They expect you to unload trucks, stock shelves and watch your register at the same time, "
bad,I enjoyed the other Ed mployees I worked with and the customers.  The boss was very two faced and power hungry.  You never turn your back on him. I enjoyed my job the hours are good and the pay was excellent it was that there is absolutely NO Store Security.  Closing by yourself was very difficult and dangerous.
bad,"This isn’t a place for people with kids, the store is never closed, the hours are all over the place, HR never takes complaints serious, the policies doesnt back you up! Too many changes to adapt to, this company DOES NOT care about its employees."
bad,Nothing was good working here i liked it because this was my source of income.You really had to kiss mangments butts if you wanted more hours and the customers were very rude
bad,"I would spend most of my time at work fixing other co-workers mistake, repairing customer relationships because of those mistakes, then be blamed for the mistakes that were made by an employee that has been employed with the company longer than myself."
bad,very stressfull environment. No opportunity to grow.Constatnt change of management structure.The insurance is the worst.No bonus no stock options. Cost cutting is the only goal at the expense of employees .
bad,"My typical day at work was doing put away of the freight fixing problem pallets, What I learned was seeing how everything is processed before to the stores, The hardest part of my Job was how they would call a 10 hour shift at last minute, My most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team members"
bad,"The job is very route, until corporate drops a change without warning on you. Management gets transferred without warning. Hours are never consistent. I guess that's just retail for you."
bad,they say that theyre flexible with schedules especially if youre going to college and when youre hired they purposley give you the a schedule that intervenes with school.
bad,"I learned more about the cash register, how to use the price scanner, unload truck, worked in the photo/beauty department and be more comfortable with customer care."
bad,The company works as a part time job. After working there it seemed that the company was not varing for the employees. High school students and those that dont need to make a loving can work here for others its best to look elsewhere.
bad,"-hours were not consistent weekly"
bad,"I've been lied to from day 1 here at Walgreens. I was first hired and told I was full time and was promised 3 days minimum a week. I have gotten 3 days maybe once a month since the beginning. I had to beg other stores to let me work their pharmacies because I need the money and the hours. On top of not being able to work, I ask for certain days off to see my family ANF the requests have been denied or ""not seen"" 4 times now. Oh and forget about calling into work because then the awful managers bring you into the office and scold you for being sick and needing a day. There are absolutely no chances to advance in the company either. You do your job and they constantly tell you you are not fast enough you are not good enough. Oh and there are pointless meetings with the DM that make the day worse because no one is running the pharmacy so then we are busy and backed up .  The pay is not well enough according to what job you have to do. I personally speak 3 languages and do not get paid to translate yet they ask me to do it non stop which is not right . The training is ridiculous and puts us further behind in the pharmacy . The hours get cut non stop so I'm already fighting for hours and getting less and less. The managers favorite line is ""I can't do anything about that "" no one cleans properly, no  one does what their shift is supposed to do (example, openers are supposed to make 7 day calls and they usually leave it for someone else to do) . All around the place just isn't a good environment to work. I constantly go home complaining because no one here has their stuff together."
bad,Didnt like the job.management should favorites and there were not many postives.There were not many welcomes for new people and there were not many help given.
bad,didnt work with the best management probably wouldnt be willing to work for this company again is not family friendly nor do they seem to care about employees health
bad,"The company has its days. It can be okay 1 day and hectic the next, managers are always rude too...................…………….............................."
bad,They are a terrible company. They treat their employees terribly.  I disliked working with several of the terrible managers. I was treated terribly. I do not recommend working for them. They fired me for something I did exactly as I was trained to do it.
bad,overworked under paid. It is a good old boys system so even if you are good in management you wont get to be a store manager or even district they are not a diverse company in terms of leadership
bad,"back to back close/open shifts poor management overworked "
bad,If you like working 10 hour days with zero appreciation then this is the place for you.  This is the worse job I've had in 28 years of pharmacy. I make the same amount as someone with 1 year experience
bad,Used to be a good company.  Demands are too high with no budget.  Lack of direction from corporate.  Not a good place to have a long career.  Fine for a stepping stone or to get you through something.  Not a lot of room for growth.
bad,"With the constant changing in its business structure, Walgreens drops the ball when it comes to a fair advantage at making a life for its employees easier. Many are made to make sacrifices not only financially but ethically as well. Giving up time and making concessions with no comeuppance or appreciation."
bad,"Im not to interested in this job anymore, it's not enough pay, they over work you, and is not willing to work with you when you need to be off for personal reasons or holidays"
bad,They are eliminating important positions. Theft is getting way too high yet they are laying off people that are there to watch for theft. Corporate and management doesn't care about the health of their employees. They present favoritism to the fullest. They choose who to care about. They expect way too much from employees for such littlw pay. They expect us to do jobs of multiple positions for the pay of one. Then get mad when quality is low.
bad,"Overnight girls don't care for co-workers. Never the less workers. Just don't want to work, rather just be outside smoking and ignoring customers. Evil girls"
bad,"Well It started off good, got everything needed to know. Customeres were horrible, the staff weren't all that great either. I had a few friends, by a few I mean a few, 3 to4 to be exact. Just horrible all around."
bad,"I worked at the walgreens in Norwich, CT for almost 2 years. I was working 40+ hours a week. Their team of management was mediocre. They used tactics like, threatening to fire and put downs to motivate their employee's to work hard. At the end of the day I can honestly say, i'm glad things didn't work out there."
bad,"Loss of communication between shift supervisors and store mgr. Pay is very, very small."
bad,"The store was full of drama. You knew everyone business, The store manager came in one night drunk to help in the stock room. When I became pregnant they made me so uncomfortable  till I just eventually quit because I was being stressed medically."
bad,"They ask an enormous amount of work out of their employees with very little pay.  Management does not care about things that happen outside of work with family.  My co workers were great and a lot of fun to work with.  However, for being such a large company, they can afford to pay their employees more than what they do for the miniature paychecks they offer."
bad,"The company has had several restructures and the opportunities for advancement has drastically decreased. However, I do enjoy working with the public."
bad,to walgreens every person is replaceable. they do not care how hard you work or how much you care about the work that you do.
bad,stressful and very one sided with little to no upside in moving up in the company although working with the public and the customers you get to know is all worth it. some people i will never forget
bad,"no work life balance bad compensation bad management only good thing is working with customers, needs to pay for the work the employees do"
bad,Been there for six years however they want employees to give world class service and pay everyone nickels and dimes. They changed management to cut a lot of people titles and deducted their pay and then decided to change the name of management making it sound more professional but not paying.
bad,I really only worked here to have some money while in college. They wanted me to put work before school and for $10 an hour that just wasnt realistic.
bad,"had to endure a lot of BS for very little in wages"
bad,Good for keeping busy. Have to have tough skin to work in a Walgreen's environment. Stressful but it has a lot of fun good days with all the different people that you meet.
bad,"a typical at work for me walking on time,clock in, count the safe and then review with the other manger what need to be finish or done and start my list how many employee/s i have for the day any body call out, how my pharmacy is running are they being in filling. Do i need to go back there and help them, after all that my if my my manager leave me a list i start working on it."
bad,"My time at Walgreens has been horrible. The pay scale is not on par for the amount of work I do, the benefits are not worth it, and there are hardly any advancement opportunities unless you want to spend the next 15 years of your life trying to move up to the next level."
bad,"Management was horrible, under staffed all the time therefore overworking the current employees."
bad,I have learned to deal with difficult customers.  I need a job where I can contribute something worthwhile and might actually help people.
bad,"It was ok, busy like all pharmacies and customer care at least where i  was, was not very good"
bad,"they hire you to support ""there"" need for the help. however, the pay is low and you cannot survive on it alone. there is no opportunity for advancement unless you are one of ""their favorites"". the management and employees talk about each other and there is no conflict resolution. they have an open door policy; but what you disclose will be disclosed to others. and the story will not sound anything like the one you told. If there is another place that you could apply I would recommend that. Walgreens is a ""trap-house"" best of luck to you"
bad,Its alright could be better and it's a learning experience and stocking things on shelves
bad,if you are just starting with the company it is fine. If you know what they used to be you are disappointed.
bad,I worked for the Company for 6 yrs and and i got Certified for Pharmacy and they didn't want to  give  me a raise
bad,"I had an opportunity with the company and it started off great with my hiring manager but as time went on I found out how the district managers son was moving up the latter very fast and he had just started working for the company. Also my new manager who may have felt threatened by my abilities and past history had it in for me. Soon after leaving the company to work as a store manager for a private owner was when I had learned that they had finally fired this manager who had given me and other many problems."
bad,"I work over there for a year and a half, I was tempted by the size of their company and the experiences i might get from them. After a year and a half, I regret to say I made a mistake. Bad Management, poor team cooperation and bully leads..."
bad,it was alright i enjoyed working with the customers all of them were amazing and very friendly.
bad,I work for a company that has their thumbs as far away from the pulse as it possibly can. The workers are nice but the managers need to relearn their jobs.
bad,"Until they have good managers that work with you as a team, this store is not good to work for."
bad,"I recently moved to a new location and was treated so unbelievably unprofessional by the management. They gossiped about everyone, very cliquey, the managers were bullies, you have no family time because youre so overworked,   i even tried to communicate to HR about how hostile the environment was and HR didnt do anything to resolve this issue or reach out to me."
bad,"It was my first job, I was 16 years old. They were so horrifically understaffed all the time that all I really learned to do was operate the cash register, which led to me standing in literally one spot for 6 hours."
bad,They don’t care about the employees . As long as you do what’s best for them. The pay isn’t good and the benefits are ok. It’s no room to grown within the company.
bad,"Work is ok, management not so much they lack professionalism and team work. Is sad that even customers complain about them and you can say is sorry. I really hope corporate reads this."
bad,If you have a good manager and assistant manager your job can be great. The customers are great. You can work in the pharmacy and learn more there. To be honest I would have preferred the pharmacy position over the one I had.
bad,"Had to train myself. Morale among employees is low due to culture and bullying. Harassment from customers, coworkers, and management. Toxic work environment depending on what location you're at. Hired for one position but must be able to do all which includes janitor, clean up, photo, beauty, stock and sometimes without the help of management. stressful, lack of basic dignity and respect. high school like environment, highly abusive. the good repeat costumers made it tolerable, including one manager and only a small number of my fellow employees. favorites exist and often bad behavior is encouraged and rewarded. customers ignored when they complain. customers go to managers to tell them how good the employee was and it is dismissed, virtually nothing is recognized, acknowledged, rewarded. turn over is ridiculous, they can't keep people to save their lives. they waste a lot money and time. also the company does virtually nothing to prevent theft. it is a free for all. bad store mangers and assistant store mangers are kept on and shuffled from location to location. no consequences, no repercussions. just favoritism and incompetence dressed up behind a fake smile and tan."
bad,Been here 5yrs and it seems like they run ya ragged. From seeing ppl with less experience making to SFL or the fact new ppl now make a few cent difference than ppl who be here to managers being sly and promoting you but then demoting you but calling it a ladder shift in tittle.
bad,"Tis company could have been a great company for many to work at. However, my experience was far from great. The manager wanted to be everyone's friend. No one ever followed the rules. I would have to do jobs that I was not supposed to be doing."
bad,"No set schedule ever, if you need days off good luck. You are required to run the store with half of the pay as Store manager. Money and ridiculous policies are the root of the company. For the amount of work you are required to do the pay is not worth it."
bad,Walgreens was the most patient testing job I had. It was a good job because it was easy. But after the robberies and run customers I felt a strong desire to leave.
bad,This job by far has been my worst. Walgreens won’t even allow the store to be closed on Christmas for people to be with their families. Also the work to life balance  is horrible due to no employees staying.
bad,"Depending on how new or old your store manager is, is how your store is going to flow. So alot of older management are stuck in there 20 yo Walgreens ways."
bad,"Pay compensation is not good. No life work balance. Benefits are not good. Management was good, however coorporate was not. There is no balance in scheduling."
bad,"I have learned a lot at Walgreens.  It is a very stressful job.  They do not follow the every 4 hours you get a break rule.  You don't get breaks until you work over 6 hours.  Standing all day, very hectic.  I don't recommend to anyone middle aged."
bad,Walgreens Customers and Patients are the Best experience you’ll receive working there! Walgreens in Grenada MS needs better management ASAP. There is great deal of unprofessionalism at this particular store. The Pharmacist is great! Management does not consider the employees concerns. Nothing truly gets fixed when concerns are brought to the table and a lot of underhand things happen  your job is not secure unless you are in the in crowd clique at this store
bad,Management will hire more associates and cut everyone's hours to avoid paying any benefits.  They do not care if you can not pay rent to do this................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,I was lied to about begin promoted to beauty advisor they told me I had to wait 6 months to be promoted from being a cashier and I hit the 6 month mark and they gave the job to a new hire who had no experience in Beauty she was just a high school drop out.
bad,"I worked for walgreens almost 7 years."
bad,Overt worked and underpaid.  Does nothing about work place harassment/stalking from customers.Highly unimpressive. Doesn't follow through actively with promotions.
bad,"Stressful work environment."
bad,Walgreens use to take care of employees. Now it’s all about the dollar. They give more and more work with less hours. I will miss my regular customers
bad,So much pressure on management. Store managers are stressed and burned out resulting in them treating team poorly. Not enough hours/staff to meet corporate's insane demands.
bad,The company creates goals that are unrealistic. District managers and above are never satisfied with any improvement - they always just expected you to make a struggling pharmacy into something perfect overnight. The wages for pharmacists are progressively decreasing. Hours for front end and pharmacy are being cut tremendously every month regardless of how much business you drive.
bad,I have been with the company many years and the job is easy but mgmt makes it unbearable to work there . The pay is very low. You think they would promote from with in but they don’t . Usually they will hire someone to do a shift lead or mgmt job . It has a high turn over rate ! The mgrs need to learn to treat there employees better and maybe they will enjoy working there.
bad,"Competition, insurance was cut due to lack of hours."
bad,"I've been with this Walgreens going on 3 months, though I've worked at a different location last year in 2018. In the time here, I can count the number of days I actually worked the shift I've wanted to work on a single hand. The manager who hired me promise to change what they put down in the schedule, only to put me on the same days week after week. After I've talked to them on 3 separate occasions. "
bad,"Not a happy company to work for.  Most of the employees  where young or school aged and management would allow smoking outside the building about every hour, so nothing every got done."
bad,"I thought I'd like to work for this company, BOY WAS I EVER WRONG! THERE WAS HUGE FAVORITISM AT ALL THE STORES, the managers could care less about you as a person, its all and all just a bad place to work at. So do not apply here!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Dealt with people who never got their work done/worried too much about others, osa was a joke to them, people acting outside of their job title, too much responsibility, no care for the employee work life balance"
bad,"Virginia Beach district manager will use her team of store managers to terminate those in the company who hold ""whistle blower status."" They do practice a lot of illegal strategies to make you quit or terminate you."
bad,"This was a very stressful job . Working here made me very depressed. I made such little money that I had just enough to pay my bills but it was still leaving me broke every 1st of the month. I didn’t have enough to eat everyday. Luckily I had loved ones around to help me because if I didn’t I would have not survived. The managers are very rude . They yell at you a lot and treat you as if you’re a child . There is no room for growth . I’ve asked my managers multiple times if I can do something other than being behind the register and I was constantly told yes but they continued to keep me behind register . The scheduling is so inconsistent that they will schedule you from 3:00pm-11:00pm and schedule you the next day from 7:30 am -3:30 pm . If you do get the opportunity to not be behind register you will lot of heavy lifting. They do sometimes provide snacks and food in break room but most of the time you’re not making enough to buy yourself lunch so you just starve the whole 8 hours you’re there. The customers that come in there are very rude . They will curse you out and if you say anything back , the managers will write you up ."
bad,"A long day at times.A Lot to do.Resets,at  the register.A Lot of customer ser ice.I learn to work the computers,I did inentory for the Cos Dept.Order for that dept. for many years.The hours were ne er all good.I was lucky if I got 32 hours a week.After being their 26 years the best part were the customers helping them getting to know so many of them after all these years."
bad,Walgreens is a company who cares more about Money then its Employees. The Company works you ALL HOLIDAY'S! The PAY isn't worth the WORK. It's Terrible
bad,"Constantly increasing expectations, gives little annual. company is not competitive enough. very uncommon to see the recognition for hard work put in."
bad,"Personally i wouldnt recommend working here unless your on some kind of retirement and you need extra money to buy some groceries. If you transfered from a competitor store that closed down they always made me feel like a competitor and not a team member."
bad,"I understand walgreens is a place to work at when you are in school, for me it was a temporary in between job for the moment. I can't speak for other stores around but at the walgreens i worked for the management was awful! they were so petty and they acted like little kids! people who had been working there for over 5 years were trying to advance in the company and they would chose someone who was working there for only 5 months because they didn't like the person, and they had no problem saying that to other coworkers behind their back. and then once we got a new main manager he told everyone that he wants to replace everyone in the store so he can start fresh no matter how long the employees have been working their all because of race or gender. i could go on and on about the management. and the pay was terrible as well. i understand the starting pay there isn't going to be amazing but there was an employee who had been working there for over 5 years and she only got a 50 cent raise in that entire time period and she had been wanting to advance and i was able to advance within the first 6 months. they completely discriminated against her. its just a really unfair place to work and i don't think the pay is worth working with the management."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work for this place. Extremely high crime and No security. Managers don't want to hire security because it will take money from their pay. And they want you to be security and expect you to run customer service at the same time. The managers all are not on the same page, and there is One main manager who extremely abuses her authority over her employee's. She doesn't treat them human, and belittles their ability. If you think you can handle both being a security and doing customer service by all means go for it otherwise i would definitely recommend seeking better employment elsewhere."
bad,must stand on feet for 71/2 of the 8 hour shift very short lunch breaks dealing with alot of costumers very little appreciation from management store is unorganized and staff is treated poorly and under paid feels like slavary.
bad,"Raises we're basically none and if you are owed one, you will get cheated out of it. Management takes care of their favorites and treats everyone else like garbage.  District management is also a joke. Act like they care but they don't. Corporate adds all kinds of stupid tasks to the pharmacy staff but doesn't give any more hours or hire more help. Forget about advancement unless you are buddies with management."
bad,The store manager is a pushover who wont do anything. The shift leads are all lazy and only care about drama.The shifts are extremely inconsistent too
bad,The company used to be great to work for until they purchased nearly 2000 RiteAid stores. They are in over their heads and are treating employees terrible to ensure the RiteAid employees stay. They have ridiculous expectations of even the minimum wage cashiers. They cut budgets by at least 40 hours a week and expect the underpaid employees to work even harder. The district staff is clueless as to how much hard work goes into the stores every day. They are going to lose a lot of great people.
bad,If you work hard you are taken advantage of by mangement. I get all the terrible shifts. Others working there are given free pas after free pass while the managers chew me. We are constantly understaffed in both the front and the pharmacy. All responsibilities are thrust onto me as well while everyone else takes constant smoke breaks.
bad,Unreasonable amount of work that is required to do and sign off but not enough staffing hours to help. Company changed their healthcare goals into business model goals.
bad,The manager and some staff seemed clicky. didnt get much training.the hardest part about the job is not being explained or trained well. the manager always seems annoyed when you ask for help.
bad,every one there had an attitude no matter what. even the managers had attitudes. very disrespectful. I did not find a nice employee within that store.
bad,"Management has lack of communication, childish talking about employees behind their backs. Pay has actually decreased from hire date in accordance to minimum wage and cost of living. They say there is room for advancement but the only thing that advances is the amount of work and it seems no one is paid for how hard they do or don’t work."
bad,"Walgreens employees are the best to work with but as a whole, they try to cut corners and cut hours for employees so Walgreens can ""save money"". It's not a fun place."
bad,Walgreens is a large corporation that makes policy decisions regarding customers and staff with an eye only to profit building and not to work-life balane or customer care.
bad,"Management skills are very poor, you don’t really get to do your actual job, at the end of the day they focus on pharmacy way MORE than beauty, the ASM or SM are both women so there’s always drama. Just wasn’t enough money for what I was dealing with."
bad,"Not worth the time and effort.  Slow promotion, lack of training, and a evident sway towards favortisam.  Working at Walgreens was not the most pleasant place that I have worked.  Some of the managers were very biased, and were not truly doing the job that they were hired to do."
bad,"Provide more flexibility of hours, more labor budget to make is easier to focus on customer service. Include more incentives, better healthcare benefits.  Improve access for to our pharmacy plans."
bad,"I currently work here and it’s not the best... not much to help. Even if you try to look at the bright side and suggest things that will make work a little easier, no one will listen"
bad,This particular store seemed disorganized and understaffed. Co-workers and management were friendly and professional but scheduling is inflexible. Good full time cashier job for a college student with no kids.
bad,Walgreens does not take the time to care for its employees or its customers. All performance evaluations are KPI and customer survey based............
bad,Now dont get me wrong walgreens can be ok. It only takes one bad manager to ruin it. I have had 3 in total. number 1 was the best number 2 was good and number 3 im looking for a new job
bad,"I hated every second of it. The management at the Wheaton store is absolute garbage. They change your schedule the week of with no warning, and the schedule can't be viewed online. They never give you the benefit of the doubt, and the number of hours/days you can work are merely suggestions to them. I told them I could only work about 15 hours per week and I couldn't work Tuesdays/Thursdays, and low and behold I was scheduled 30 hours and on a Tuesday and Thursday. Terrible management, terrible training, terrible all around."
bad,"I would never work here if told I had to. I had a kid and made it clear to them I couldn't work past a certain time. They cut my hours, and eventually I had a lot of things going on, there's not communication between management and employees."
bad,"Working as a cashier at Walgreens was awful. It was consistently slow and it was always a stretch. One is expected to run the photo center, run the register and stock shelves all at once. It was consistently overwhelming and there was never enough time to get everything done. Management was horrendous as well. Everyone was consistently gossiping and being super unprofessional. Not to mention the store manager was childish and was consistently under investigation. Management also picked favorites and treated everyone differently."
bad,"It was a straight forward and easy job at first."
bad,Poor judgement! Unfair! Upper management the district and store managers are inhumane. Belittle you! Do not recommend working for either store in Anderson SC
bad,The store manger was sexist rude and did not care about people’s personal lives or anything else. You could never feel comfortable when the store manager was around.
bad,Walgreens is a nice job for someone in school because theyre very flexible. But what ruined it for me was the crew. The environment is full of drama and no team work. It makes going to work depressing. There's nothing fun or exciting to look forward to.
bad,"cut pay ,cut benefits and help  and increase workload, profits and  dividend payouts to shareholders and upper management. No future and continuous bad news and deterioration job satisfaction."
bad,needs better management. needs better lunch room. you need a certain amount of patience to work there. you stand for 6 hours. to much work assigned for little pay
bad,"Your expected to do more work than what they pay you for, the manager leaves whenever he wants for whatever reason. For example, his wife got a new cell phone so he had to take off and after they picked up her new phone they went to Chicago for the rest of the day. There's a method to getting moved up in the store. First your a cashier, then photo, then cosmetics,  then either pharmacy or maybe assistant manager."
bad,"Discrimination, Intimidation, Lack of career advancement. Long days, managers took credit for other employees work. Paycheck only enjoyable thing about the job."
bad,"I have an associates degree and 25 + years in retail management , I live in a small town so jobs are very hard to get. I have worked here now for close to one year - minimum wage and my hours / shifts fluctuate all over. Honestly I was disappointed by this company who claims to be on the corner of happy and healthy. They only consider customers in this rule because we associates are underpaid and advancement is impossible. I am a grown person working teenaged hours / pay -- overall VERY discouraging and I would never recommend anyone working here unless you enjoy being poor and underappreciated."
bad,"Typical day is I arrived at 7:30am, count the register drawers and place them in the appropriate places. I print off any pictures or information that was left the prior day. I've learned a lot more about sales and how different things are done as far as unloading and accepting truck orders etc. The job is a good job overall but the pay is not sufficient for my living needs."
bad,"Overall your really don't know what job represents until receiving the job,  Walgreens is so old fashion and stressful to the point of looking for a job is a must you do not want to work for a company that does not have family values for their staffs families you may have to wok holidays and winter days and room to grow there is not any room to move up you have to be there for 10 to 12 years for them to least look at you for improvement,  Attendance is a must for me they don't even look at you for at least making an effort to go to work."
bad,I really hate the direction that the company is going in. You probably will never get full time hours. People call off so much. It's hard to get mornings.
bad,"Managers were extremely biased, hours were long and rarely got breaks, pay was pitiful, and no pto. Patients were always fun, and mostly understanding."
bad,just wasnt that great way to stressful and zero oppertunities to advance carrers. i just didn't enjoy my job there............................................
bad,"I worked her in high school and right out of high school. One employee got fired for stealing, another got fired for stealing drugs and the head pharmacist got fired and so did like the next 3 after that, I filled scripts , billed insurance, phones, called insurance company, customer service. stocked order, helped do order and filled scripts."
bad,I would help customers in the front if I was working the front cash register I would stock and make sure area was clean. I love helping some of the customer we would crack up on something they would say  and sometimes I would make some of them smile when their day was bad.
bad,"This company is very goal oriented "
bad,"It was difficult working for this company even though I would recommend this position for someone, it just wasn't for me. It wasn't the customers that gave me a hard time, it was the management and the fellow employees. They did not recognize what I was trying to achieve in my position as Beauty Adviser. I was excellent at my job and worked hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers with their cosmetic and beauty needs."
bad,"Poor management, I was a cashier and was always scared for my life becus every other worker stayed in the back bunch of crazy ppl came in n I was on the floor alone, scared lack of security"
bad,This work place is extremely stressful and there is absolutely no work/life balance. It is like slavery. Staff opinion does not count. It is all about the sales figure!
bad,No set schedules. Unorganized management. They give promotions to then give it to someone else. Favoritism between employees. Overall worst company I ever worked for
bad,Not a work place I can recommend due to lack of support by management.  They are cutting back on budgeted hours and workforce but expect the same quality of work.
bad,The people I worked with were overall very fun to be around and ran a good shift in regard to guest service. Management is awful! Being a shift leader had no bearing on being able to do anything other than count drawers. Not being able to hold people accountable made it difficult to assign and follow up on tasks
bad,"I work at the Walgreens Specialty Retail Supoort Center and I do not recommend anyone to work here for longer than 1-2 yrs. If you have a professional background do not count on advancement because once you become an IV there is no where else to go.  work/life balance, vacations are denied for when you need them and special execptions have to be consulted within management. Mandoatory OT is forced in your schedule and recognition is with cards and pins. Grp Sups do not supervise anything and do not go above and beyond for you. Metrics do not work and still get repremanded for stupidities.  There is is no consistency and everything is minimizing. Stores are better but the pay is way lower."
bad,"OK place to work, would rather work for someone who appreciates the work we  do. the pay could be more competitive so people did not quit all the time. Would also appreciate more flexibility around class schedule"
bad,"If you are able to learn quickly, you can learn how to cashier, work the cosmetics counter, run the photo lab, and manage the Hallmark aisle. All of these things can be fun, but the pay is minimal here and there are ongoing issues with them not being willing to work around your school schedule. They are also not very lenient with people who are unable to lift 20 lbs. or more since there can be some heavy lifting involved. Communicating with management is also difficult."
bad,This company offers little to no benefits. They removed many of their incentive programs and benefits just in the year I was there. I worked hard with little to no raise andI was treated poorly throughout.
bad,"My expirence at Walgreen was okay, but the people there was prejudice especially management. I felt uncomfortable, and I was not treated fairly. So I may not want to work there again."
bad,"Walgreen's used to be a decent place to work, but it isn't anymore.  The kinds of employees that stick around for a long time are the kind that should have been fired years ago.  I realize that companies have to make money because they are accountable to their stake holders, but Walgreen's has taken this to an extreme.  Hours in the pharmacy have been slashed to the point where I personally know multiple technicians that have left because they no longer feel that their patients are safe.  Management clearly plays to the quarterly report and doesn't think any further down the road than that.  If there is a genuine issue they have an open door policy, but nothing ever comes of it."
bad,they do not respect or care for any of their employees.  breaks are not give.  working greater than 6 days in a row is common and they will also call you in on your day off and bully you to come in.
bad,"The position of Pharmacy Tech with Walgreens is not appreciated. If you are not ""in"" then you are out. Job security - there is none, Job advancement - there is none, Raises for time in position and seniority - forget it."
bad,"The job was simple enough. However, the management had no empathy on pregnant mothers. Hours were very little. The management seems annoyed if you had questions."
bad,Its a learn as you go type of job. The compensation is not good. The training is mostly on computer. the management is not supportive either. not a preferred place to wrk
bad,"Typical day at work was beyond stressful with corporate ""budget cuts"" creating a skeleton crew type of environment that only led to a domino effect of underpaid-overworked employees who could not provide adequate customer service due to work loads."
bad,Walgreens the company is a joke. I've met some really teammates and people that'll probably be a part of my life for forever. Other than that they suck! They'll fire you for anything but refuse to give you any raises. Managers are never held responsible for their wrong doing and mistreatment of employees.
bad,"Functions as every other big box retail outlet. Work schedule is never the same, making it difficult to know when you will have time off. Pay is not great, benefits are okay but overall standard for similar types of companies. Management...mostly doesn't listen to employees but how much of that is because of policies from upper management is hard to tell. Wouldn't go back if I have the choice to work elsewhere."
bad,"I have learned so much from this company.  Contract negotiations, setting up and building fee schedules both charged and allowed, coming up with training materials that are used company wide, as well as fine tuning my skills with working with fortune 50 companies."
bad,I loved working with the customers but not so much with my coworkers the lead tech acted like the Pharmacy Manager and the Pharmacy Manager had no voice. Alot of bullying from the Pharmacist. I appreciate having started off in this kind of pharmacy and learning to handle evil people. Just a starter job
bad,"I worked at Walgreen's for a year and a half. I got promoted quick which was good for me, but they hire everyone and there will promote anyone."
bad,It is a bad place to work due to the bad enviroment and rude customers. to top it off the workers are just as bad if not worst. Always provoking arguments and using stereotypes to characterize individuals.
bad,Working at Walgreens offered no future opportunity advancement. The position is physcially demanding the pay structure does not meet the job requirements.
bad,"Pharmacy Department sorely understaffed and poorly managed to meet the high volume demand of prescriptions to be processed, while addressing other customer inquiries at the same time. Lack of a training program leaves new technicians overwhelmed and dissatisfied, which explains the high turnover."
bad,"Walgreens is a company of decaying values. What was once an employee friendly environment has now become hash and unforgiving. Employees are overloaded with work to the point that some tasks cannot be completed, only to be punished for prioritizing. Management refuses to address the real problems, instead blaming the employees."
bad,"I came to walgreens after leaving severeal previous management positions. The idea was to be promoted and move up in the company."
bad,"A typical day at Walgreens would normally be quite hectic because of our large customer base...but in my opinion it made the job far more interesting and kept us busy to the point where it steered me away from boredom. In my opinion, the customers were the main factor in keeping me motivated about my everyday duties."
bad,good job. but wasn't flexible with schedule. I was working 2 jobs and I was scheduled for nights after I specifically ask for days when I was hired. it interfered with my other job so I quit.
bad,They cut hours to bare minimum so you don't feel safe working and selling rx's Hardest part of my job is becoming so attached to people then they end up passing before too long
bad,"management was terrible and unorganized.  when you first start they barely train you if not at all, yet they get upset at you when things are not done correctly. (how is something supposed to be done properly WITHOUT the PROPER TRAINING) "
bad,Management was inconsistent and sloppy.  The company in general seemed to focus on the concept of employees being expendable creatures as opposed to human beings. Best part of the job was getting to meet the people I worked with and developing last relationships. Most trying part of the job was dealing with management who seemed to lack control of the environment.
bad,"Walgreen's is a good company to work for if you have the right managers. A bad manager can take a good team and make everyone either quit or slack. If you don't listen to the people that are working for you, how can you expect them to listen to you?"
bad,"I worked at Walgreen's for 6 months, and honestly, worst 6 months ever! The managers were hard to work with and communicate with. They weren't flexible or lenient when it came to other requirements. The co-workers were unpleasant all the time and you couldn't even have time to socialize and get to know them, even when working together on a project or something. I got ""penalized"" on the 4th of july, NIGHT SHIFT, for not making $400 at the Cosmetics counter. The whole store was DEAD the whole night! and I was lucky to have made the $38 that I did! So I got written up for that, and that is when I drew the line and quit! Clearly the managers don't care if its a holiday or not. They're not understanding at all! Not a place I would work at!"
bad,"This company is failing. I have been promised advancement for two years. I share all the knowledge and ability of my managers, yet, because of the financial state of the company, I work 70 hours a week, and they have found a way to give me no overtime, no evaluations, no training. Do not apply here."
bad,Too much micro managing. The moral of staff and management is very low. This company changed for the worst. Would never recommend this business to work or even shop
bad,Walgreen's love me because I work so hard and have a great work ethic but they have little ability to give raises and such without greater management approval.  There is little advancement and few positions and I was given the run around for a few months and decided to move from this company.
bad,"Alot of work for little pay. Customers are agitated as they should be after a dr visit and then having to wait on a prescription, if there are insurance issues they become irate and unruly."
bad,"Walgreens, just like many other retails screw around with your hours each week and even leave you scheduled only once on occasions. However, if you have been with the company for a while you can make a pretty decent wage and fair benefits. I strongly recommend that if this is your first job your fine, On the other hand, I will not recommend anyone to make this their life time job."
bad,"I've learned how to use a cash register, how to merchandise, how to stock products. Their is no enjoyment towards this job, if you don't finish on time, they cut your hours.You have to kiss butt, and sometimes work for free/ not getting paid your over time."
bad,"The job is simple, but the company is not a good one to work for. The management team at the store I worked in had no idea what they were doing."
bad,"It normally depends on the store you work in, but the experience I've had working at Walgreens has been very unpleasant. I used enjoy working there, but now it's gotten to the point where I actually dread coming in for my shift. The leadership here is inconsistent to say the least. When the store closes, we're scheduled to stay for a while afterwards to put away ""overstock"", sweep/mop the floor, count the money in the registers, etc. With some shift leads, we're able to get everything done and leave on time. This usually occurs when we start the process before the store closes. However, there's a couple of managers that start everything so that we end up not leaving until an hour of an hour and a half after the store closes. The scheduling is another issue. The store manager seems to schedule more people for the day shift than the shift. Usually, I work the night shift, and so I've seen first hand the problems it can create. We're already pretty thin to begin with, but if someone calls off, that really puts us in a bad spot and leads to longer lines and angry customers. I recently started going back to school, which meant that I had to change availability. After submitting my request, I came in to work and view the upcoming schedule. Not only was my request denied, it was flat-out ignored. Normally the solution in this case would be to swap time slots with a co-worker. But our manager's scheduling practices are so bad, that it make the idea virtually impossible. The only real bright spot is the people you work with. When you're having a rough day, which in the case of this location"
bad,"Walgreens use to be a family oriented company. As of 2012 the company has gone down, getting rid of 50% of the positions. There is no room for advancement. The managers are quick to shift blame, never taking responsibility for their wrong doing. Company throw you under the bus and never have your back when it comes to company complaints. Turnover is horrible. Pharmacy techs are overworked and short staffed. Managers make you run your department and pharmacy without any compensation. They overwork overwork overwork their employees."
bad,"Work was very long and half the time I had to beg one of my co-workers to cover my lunch. We were supposed to get two fifteen minute breaks during our shift and out of my nine months of working there, I maybe received two fifteen minute breaks. If the day was busy, forget about a lunch break. There were many days where I had to stand from 8am until 4pm behind the register (no sitting allowed) with no breaks or lunch. There was only one manager that would check on me throughout the day and made sure I received my breaks and if I was doing okay. If I was closing with that manager, he would spend his time out in the lobby with us to make sure nobody came in and that we were protected. If I was closing with any other manager we wouldn't see them until it was time to lock the doors. The hardest part was putting up with long hours with no raise after the long period of time I was there. I even got promoted and still no pay raise. The most enjoyable part was working with the one manager that understood us."
bad,"The corporate culture is awful.  It appears that this cow is being tended by vampires instead of farmers.  It's dog-eat-dog, and the place is very poorly run.  The physical infrastructure is in a sad state, and there is obviously no desire to fund maintenance of it."
bad,The pay was awful. The environment was awful. Safety of their workers is not a high priority.
bad,Help customers with various task and always made sure I gave a helping hand when needed.
bad,"One of the worst places to work at no appreciation for all the work that gets done, management who tries to do nothing but make you fail and give them a reason to fire you. Persistent shoplifters and management does nothing about it. Management blames you if a shoplifter takes anything."
bad,"Putting truck up by yourself... I like how you get to meet new people and put smiles on their faces, going home knowing you changed someone life."
bad,"Over all bad experience. Benefits suck, Hours suck, Moving up isn't too much of an option, and they promised a raids for months and i never saw it. but was required to do the job duties for that raise."
bad,"Do not work here, they do not care about employees or their life outside of work. Company is about who you know and buddy system."
bad,Treat most employees like the are expendable and have you working extra hard with minimum compensation. Days are always stressful and management are almost impossible. I only enjoyed my paycheck. If you plan on working for this company you better invest in a good dietician and shrink
bad,Flexible with school schedules if persistent. Will cut hours/days without warning. Unpredictable schedules. Not much hard labor.
bad,"I was only with the company for a few months and one night as I was closing there was a call regarding a suspected shoplifter and when I called another manager asking what she thought I should do, I was fired for calling the police. The two ladies who called me telling me about the suspected shoplifter was not terminated, all they got was more training. The entire time I was employed with them I had never received any disciplinary documentation. I tried to do the best I could, but  what I got in return was determination for abiding what I had been instructed to do."
bad,The store was clean.  Most of my coworkers were friendly.  I had to do assistant manager jobs but did not get assistant manager pay.
bad,the managers dont care about you. if you call in sick you are harrassed to bring in a doctors note or you'll be written up instead of the manager telling you to feel better. you are not allowed to have a life outside of walgreens. your schedule can change at any moment without notice. the pay is a joke. walgreens has been on the recieving end of a ton of fines and lawsuits so the company is making budget cuts by cutting employees salaries and hours. STAY AWAY FROM WALGREENS!!!!
bad,"During my stay with Walgreens  I learned a lot about the importance of community and going after your dreams. The staff at this particular store were not at all supportive, approachable, or personable. If anything it was the wonderful customer base that invited new face with opening arms."
bad,"I loved helping customers, building relationships  & loyalty with them."
bad,"The managers were way to strict, not even allowing us to look/talk to each other. I had to report a manager for racist behavior, then shortly after, left the company."
bad,"Company would not allow religious time off, manager consistently refused time off requests, if you complain they make you a cashier. They expect you to devote your entire life to the company and are intolerant of any outside activities."
bad,I had alot of conflicts with personal and work issues. They want you to work 5 to some times 13 days strait. Even at times making me close the store then wanted me to open leaving me with less than 8 hours between shifts. If you have no personal life and want to live at work this would be the perfect job for you. I have worked for other durg chains this was the worst one I have worked for.
bad,"Typical day at Walgreens store manager. Start of day is at 7am or earlier. Store manager running floor and pharmacy until relief comes at 3pm. There is no time to manage people or your business. Upper managment not reality to running a store front. Walgreens was built on Customer Service. All the company does not is take hours away to help the customers. Average script to be filled is 45 minutes. You go to Wal-Mart it is filled in 10 minutes or less. You will see people in the pharmacy at Wal-mart, go to Walgreens and all you see is people running around overwelmed not help. Very stressful place to work."
bad,The benefits sucked.Poorly trained managers.Managers picked there favorites and overlooked ones with experience.Co-workers spent more time kissing up then doing there job.
bad,Did not like working here at all. I would never recomend working at Walgreens.
bad,Did not enjoy this retail setting. Constantly yelled at by angry customers. Gossiping coworkers.
bad,Would not want to work at company long-term. Afraid to say any more.
bad,"Walgreens overall is a good company to work for but my particular store was horrible. Hostile work environments, poorly managed, unethical store manager, long work days."
bad,"They work you hard and do not appreciate you for it, but all and all I worked with some very nice people and made some great life-long contacts."
bad,"Pharmacy Tech duties , busy workplace , not managed very well"
bad,"I was hired to be a photo lab manager, and was sent all over my borough to do everything but photo. Almost everyone I encountered in the company was difficult to work with. There was nothing good that came out of working for Walgreens."
bad,No one is willing to help out with the workload. The amount of work per person is unreasonable. Most management is lazy and don't want to give credit where it's due.
bad,I loved working at walgreens for the short amount of time I was there. Honestly they need to hire a new manager for the location I was at. That store was horrible and I did not enjoy my time there..
bad,Giving you the short version of life at Walgreens is hard to do but here it goes. Management only cares about number and metrics. They act as if things can change and be better but makes no real attempts at at trying to actually change. They give you goals and no one actually expects you to meet them
bad,I gave myself 10 years to this company. I tried to advance many times. The company is supposed to give promotions to employees that have been working longest. That never happened.
bad,"Store manager lacked professionalism, abilty to manage financial aspects such as P & L, lacked abilty to demonstrate active listening skills, inability to build effective team. I came from big box retail Senior level management and taught business acumen and leadership skills in order to be cohessive and effective leader. The job at Walgreens was temporary while making a change in my life"
bad,Management is clueless on what to achieve within the store priority. Management is very lazy and unwilling to listen to criticism. Unwilling to train a person unless they're into as work. Pick only their favorites to train. HR isn't no help willing to turn a blind eye when comes to harassing their workers in a unsafe environment. Hours not really given a choice. Looking down on staff.
bad,Once you become certified there’s no pay raise. I came in making 12.75 and after I got my pharmacy tech certification my pay remained the same. There’s never enough technicians working and the technicians are unreliable. Let’s not forget the customers are the worst. I’ve never came across so many nasty customers working in the Arnold area in my life.
bad,I worked at 2 Walgreens stores. Both had a disrespectful culture and depending on who you are you are treated either like you can do no wrong or you are in idiot who doesn't belong. I do not advise anyone to work at Walgreens. The culture is terrible. Management is ridiculous.
bad,"Pay is a few cents over minimum wage. Work long hours- until midnight even. Okay job for teens who want extra money. Best career advancements are pharmacy and management, who are underpaid compared to other jobs."
bad,"I was an intern at Walgreen's,it was a great experience. I learned most of the stuff I currently used at my presentation job.. I gained so many knowledge"
bad,"When trying to move up in this company with help from management the door was closed, i have operated as the store mgr for 3 months until replacement mgr was hired. This dist mgr isn't working to put the right people's into best entrance for this company. I have never worked for a company that reviews getting worse each year."
bad,"Got set up because of retaliation by a member of management, loss prevention is a idiot at my past location. I was terminated because of a $10.00 item and cannot get rehired after 31 years of service."
bad,I was there for 3 weeks doing my internship. I was not compensated and I didn't really learn much of anything there I only did product dispensing which was pretty easy to say the least. The manager was really uninviting she seemed to be ready for the internship to be over. Overall the internship program went by pretty quickly can't say I wasn't happy that it did.
bad,"Literally doing nothing for 8 hours but facing aisles youve alread faced 100 times, you cant leave the register, there was no proper training in any area of the job. I was expected to do resets on my 3rd day and no one was willing to teach me"
bad,"Dont plan on staying forever. Experiences at Walgreens depend on the location and the people that work there. My old location was terrible. Only worked with 1 good person and the store manager was a tyrant. Definitely not worth being paid so low. However, my new location is awesome. The people are dope yet professional. And the management sees your value. Work hard? They see it and acknowledge it. Dont work hard? They'll push you to be better."
bad,Even though this is the longest job I ever hold there was Limited room to grow.. I always thought working hard is what it takes to go to the top but really it's who you know or what relations you have with people really takes you farther.. I also appreciate working for Walgreens having a set schedule job..
bad,"The work itself was fine, I loved being so busy and on top of things. Both stores I worked in were in the process of converting from Rite Aid to Walgreens. The negativity was the other employees, and the higher ups. The corporate office legit does not care about anyone but themselves. I worked in 2 different stores in two different counties, with different DMs and it was crazy to see how careless they were to their stores. It saddened me honestly. They are pushing people out the door, yet blame the people leaving. Both stores had pretty much all very young kids working and it was nothing but drama and lack of motivation to work, which left all the work load on the Supervisors and Manager. Again, reporting to the higher ups about it, got brushed under the rug."
bad,"They call themselves a family company, but after working there for almost 11 years , I was incredibly saddened that they didn’t want to give me an extra bereavement day when my dad passed away.  It’s was just another day. In fact, they even said I might be suspended and lose my job....!!!!! Really??!!!! At that time all they wanted to do was cut hours while they were trying to train new people and it was a complete mess."
bad,The store that I work at is not cared for. Employee safety is not a priority. Security is provided only some evenings but should be provided every hour this store is open. Theft is a big problem aND nothing is done about it.
bad,"If there was not lies and favoritism, I would still be working for the company. When someone else is deemed better, due to color, then sabotage plays a part."
bad,Lots of work available.  Clean store. Products always stocked. Great job if you have little experience and want experience in working with the public.
bad,"Getting yelled at as an extern that just wants to learn is not good.   They really need to learn their soft skills better.  Other than that I enjoyed myself, but walked on egg shells."
bad,I wouldn’t work for Walgreens again I feel they weren’t compassionate or sincere managers treated employees they didn’t like poorly favoritism is evident
bad,Expect your to do the job of three people and give you a write up if not meeting their expectations. They have no follow through or focus on training.
bad,Management is terrible.  Management gives warnings verbal and written for going to the doctors with a doctor note.  All are unexcused.  Staff is great to work wi
bad,The pay was not enough to cover the high deductible of the insurance and the work life Ballance was poor. Staff does what they can but often payroll is cut so low the stores are often under staffed and unprepared for busy days.
bad,I experienced discrimination when it came to opportunities for advancement. I also was wrongfully disciplined with no cause. I would never recommend anyone to work for this company.
bad,"Worst manager ever!! Kept staff who were harassing and hostile. Manager who blocked all pharmacy people on days off, but wanted staff to call when staff was short because no one would answer his phone. Never tried to really train, just wanted you to fly through training and get on the floor. Let a part time employee manage even though she had no training and would harass new employees who posed a threat to her loose position. Heard they fired managers because of possible law suits. Corporate office did nothing and made me feel like I was making this up, later realized it was true and had to clean house."
bad,"Never really got any benefits as I heard the plans they offered were expensive. They expect you to not have a life and be on call for them. Our store saw a decline in hours quickly. We were extremely short-staffed while they continued to cut hours so no new hires. Honestly liked my coworkers but I'd say that was really the only positive thing. And you kind of had to do everything around the store, there was no specific task or department you were in charge of, very stressful."
bad,"Current manager for NH,NY store sucks. He doesn’t care about his employees. I loved most of my coworkers and customers but that wasn’t enough for me to stay. Being the beauty Consultant is extremely boring. That store doesn’t get the traffic it needs for that position."
bad,"Just needed extra cash but ended up getting more headaches I didn't need."
bad,"I’ve been with Walgreens for 2 years. The schedule is never the same. Close one night, open the next morning. It’s fairly difficult to do with a small child. Upper management is terrible. They expect their store manager to sit in the office all day and do nothing while the others work themselves to death to accomplish what corporate wants done. Yet they cut hours tremendously! Currently searching for another job!"
bad,The only good thing is the employee discount. I'm treated like a peasant. I've had boxes thrown at me by a manager. I've had a manager lie on me which I got in trouble for. I've been forced to do all the grunt work. When I first started I was forced to work 9 days back to back because someone quit and they had no one else to fill their spot. The store is dirty. They completely screw you over when it comes to the schedule because they have zero respect for your life outside of work. Only thing keeping me here is the discount.
bad,"The district I worked in was to close to each other. No way to advance within the company unless you were part of the circle. The company does not offer over time, and will not allow employees in front to reach or get over 40hrs."
bad,"Working at the Walgreens in Hawthorne was stressful for a full time student. Working in the mornings were really relaxing compared to the amount of work when you close. Closing shifts were mentally draining considering the amount of creeps that would come in and stare at your chest the whole time lol. Or asking for your # and you can't tell them off since you're on the clock. Working the photo department was fun and a nice change of routine. "
bad,"It was good in the beginning but overtime, many things changed drastically. Management was poor, co-workers were annoying, customers were rude, and hours were cut significantly. Very toxic environment to work in. When considering part time work, DO NOT apply to Walgreens!"
bad,"The job has favoritism, you get looked over but single bad thing you do it’s termination. It’s annoying. Your hours will go up and down while everybody else hours remain the same"
bad,There wages don't go up  stuck  making same money for YEARS  at a time   They change managers like people change there socks . That often . They cut your hours often.
bad,"When hired, I was told it would be week days due to they had staff for the weekends. Then within 3 months I was scheduled for every weekend and closed. I was considered full-time but only got 30 hours a week, while others got 37-40. Registers never worked and always went down and managers didn't seem to care. As a cashier you get yelled at by customers for everything wrong in the store and no one ever wants to cover breaks for cashier. No holidays off and open 365 days a year. Managers talk about other employees behind their back and so much gossiping. Pay is horrible. Favoritism big time."
bad,"Doctor took me off work due to issues with my Gallbladder removal.  I missed about 8 days total i believe it was, and i had only been there a month or so.  Once the Doctor said i was OK to go back to work i did, and was quickly taken off the schedule and told that i was fired.  "
bad,"Schedule is brutal & inhumane...you are expected to work everyday & weekend. Store managers are true slave drivers (they get weekends off)."
bad,"clean working environment"
bad,"This is a good place to work if you want a simple job of either cashiering/assisting customers. Also, working personally with people in the photo department, some days on things as sensitive as memorial photo orders, the connection you make with customers while working so closely with them truly makes the job feel worth it."
bad,"It was a great company to work for a few years ago. However, right now there are so many changes that do not benefit a lot of people. The turn over is very high and management does not get any support from people above. It seems like store managers and upper management are leaving the company, and that alone is extremely concerning. "
bad,"Depending on your Assistant Manager its a decent place to work. Although, I am listed as full time at the store i work at. Full time to walgreens is only 30 hours not 35 this wouldnt be an isdue if I actually got the 30 hours. I wad told i have to have open availability to get my full time hours which is a lie. There are requirements for full time and i do meet them but due to management having favorites the part time employees usually get more hours then the full time. Not to mention they only let you advance in your postion if you are a favorite."
bad,"Walgreens used older employees to unload trucks and stock, while younger employees stood around and talked on their phones.  Younger employees were allowed to be disrespectful to customers. Managers were disrespectful to employees and often time unprofessional."
bad,"It was ok to work there,but i did like it the money wasn't great at all for real but some of managers were cool honesty.The store was a great store when it wanted to be ."
bad,You work fast but its boring they don't train people anymore they just say good luck. Surprise mandatory overtime 5 mins before your scheduled shift end. Workplace culture is terrible the management is a joke nothing about this job is good unless you are a high-functioning disabled person because you are a tax write-off for the company!
bad,"Lack of empathy or compassion towards employees, horrible scheduling, favoritism. You are only allowed to miss 5 days in a year, regardless of circumstance"
bad,"Resolve insurance issues for payment of prescription medications.I learned how to work at a very fast pace! And multi task rapidly. Management was always pushing you to work faster. I worked from home with 2 screens. The hardest part was to go as fast as you could, you were ranked on how many denials you resolved per day and that would give you options at a better schedule for the next 3 months. Because the job is 24 hours a day. The most enjoyable part is the ability to work from home."
bad,"The management was hard on all employees, gave employees not enough hours. Worked late nights and had to turn around and work the next morning. People with injuries had to do jobs that they were restricted of."
bad,"Walgreens used to be a really good company to work at but that has changed dramatically. Unfortunately their focus shifted and is all based on the customers and not the employees. They just care about the numbers that you produce and sometimes it feels they don't even see you as a human being. You need to produce the numbers they want but you rarely get enough help and their always cutting hours. They do have good benefits, but you need to think if just because of this is worth it because you are not going to be able to have a personal life."
bad,"Busier seasons and truck day's were exhausting while slower seasons left CSR's with not much work to do. Schedule, advancement referrals were created based on favorites. They also do not honor college degrees. I have a BBA and I was hired as a CSR, when advancement opportunities became available the position was given to someone else and I was told she had seniority over me and because of that I was not eligible for an advancement referral. To ""throw me a bone"" I was ""promoted"" (No change of daily task nor pay rate) to Beauty specialist."
bad,"day begins with smart counts, order check in, releasing of oos and partials, putting up daily order, verifying all items have been ordered for next day, handle insurance and rx changes... all while providing exceptional service to customers in person and on the phone, entering, filling, and dispensing prescriptions."
bad,"Working as a pharm tech at Walgreens is punishing work, and is not paid nearly well enough for what they have you do. Corporate controls how many hours you can work week to week, and often that means working 31 or 32 hours a week instead of closer to 40."
bad,"the manager at the time was very stressed, and it made every thing very stressfull. the schdjule would have you work till 11 pm one night and then get up and be there at 7 the nesxt day"
bad,"It was a pleasure and honor to work at Walgreens and encounter all the knowledge that was bestowed upon me, during the time of my Internship i was going through a rough time with my family, My Brother was in Hospice and there was days i wanted to give up but i knew My Brother was My Inspiration. Through it all i continued to complete my Internship and completed the hours that were required of me to complete, Walgreens workers were very committed to the position that they were working and everyone helped each other. This was a 24 hour Company with a drive thru that stayed busy at all times which helped the time go by."
bad,"The overall experience at this company is not worth the pay, they cut hours and add more responsibilities for you to do for the same pay. They give you less help and expect the same amount of productivity."
bad,"The person who works in the front anwser the phone does returns, run the front cash register with very little help from team members.The team members do not work together as a team."
bad,Working at Walgreen was a great way to advance my skills in cash handling and customer support. Through my time there however i feel management did not tend to the safety of employees well enough which resulted in a lot of changes in employment.
bad,Not a very supportive company to work for. Very low pay and not many support systems in place to enable single-parents to support their families. A lot of work. No security. A lot of customers that take advantage of companies lenient policies. Furstrated and unhappy employees. No healthy food to promote healthy employees. A lot of information to learn in a short period of time. Ensure you get placed at a good location with supportive leadership.
bad,Salaries are very bad. the schedule bids are very unfair. The hardest part of working there was the crazy schedules. There are very few opportunities to get a promotion.
bad,This is one of those establishments that tell you what you want to hear then do what they want without consulting you. They tell you that they understand your schedule then barely give you hours. This place is not a very single parent friendly environment.
bad,The most rewarding part of the job was establishing relationships with customers and helping them with any problems they encountered with find products or helping with their problems  The least enjoyable part of the job was attempting to stock the shelves on truck days all in one day and still give the best customer service..
bad,"No one wants to work at Walgreens for the rest of their life. You do what you need to do, and move on with your life. Watch out for overnight shifts though. Not only are you more at risk for robberies, but they schedule is 70 hours a week, then the whole next week off. Sounds wonderful, until you relaxing that 70 divided by two weeks is 35 hours a week, which is no the minimum 40 for full time, even though you lose 10 hours a night every night for a week. That following week might feel like a vacation, but without money to actually afford to do anything, you can get cabin feverish. Another job you say? Good luck finding another part time gig that's cool with you being off every other week, unless you're really trying to work 18 hours a day."
bad,Wallgeens is a stressfull place customers rude employees are rude and everybody do there own thing its cutthroat they try to get each other in trouble lie on each other. In general its free for all
bad,"Pretty bad hours and a company who does not care for their employees. Also, horrible pay. They keep adding on more work and less employees, but do not compensate with more pay."
bad,"I very much enjoyed working with the public. Having owned businesses in the past, I quickly realized that the management was under qualified when it came to having many employees under them."
bad,"They do not care about their employees or families or customers for that matter all they care about is top end "
bad,"10 hours a night, 6 nights every OTHER week. A sleep schedule is almost impossible to have. Tiny bit more than minimum wage for LOTS of work. Never got recognition for work that was completed. Co workers were not friendly."
bad,Walgreens is great if you are looking for a first job in high school if you prefer to not get into the food service industry. it is also good if you are interested in pharmacy experience other than that i would not say to make Walgreens your career.
bad,Very Horrible place to work at. I worked there for almost 2 years and got horrible review even though I dont believe I deserved them. Especially when i recieved employee of the month. THe new management were horrible and mean to the employees especially the olders that worked there for more than year or so.
bad,for the most part the job is very simple and very repetitive. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know other employees and meeting different customers on daily basis.
bad,"A big deal was made about the company at hire, how wonderful they were, all the movement and training. In the location I was in I got pigeon holed, I talked to management repeatedly about it, got ignored, watch good supervisors get overlooked for promotions and advancement. while people who were terrible workers, fussing and complained all the time got all the advancement and cushy jobs. "
bad,Not the best paying job. Management was decent. Management will cross train you to work the whole store with never changing pay rate. I worked their for three years and never got a pay raise.
bad,"This job was the most stressful job I have ever had. High turn over rate. Very disorganized. Management is not helpful at all. For the work that you put in they do not pay you enough. Not a reliable job, but a good job for a stepping stone for your future career."
bad,very boring and slow you are made to do supervisors work when they are short and paid minimum wage. Only annual raises and no compensation for hard workers
bad,I had a poor experience with this job given that management looked down on everyone and gave no appreciation for day in and day out hard work. The management had no trust in the employees that were the most loyal. Just overall awful experience.
bad,"One of the worst place to work, company doesn't care about how hard you are working, they will try to over work you with bird size pay and benefits aint no good."
bad,"Walgreens pharmacy is a stressful environment. I think it is not enough pay for everything we do and have to go through. The hours we work are messed up..example one day you will be scheduled 130pm to 10pm the next day you're scheduled to work 730am to 4pm. Working here takes away you're social life and time away from you're family. Its exhausting and they don't care about your health, if you call out for being sick they shame you for it. There is no such thing as an excused absense.This is mostly the people that I work but even calling our district manager or HR to discuss issues or have questions we are turned away from or given grey answers."
bad,"This company overall seems to be alright, the specific branch I worked at was poorly run. The store manager continuously promised advancement opportunities, then failed to follow through. The store manager constantly cut corners so much so that it led to lower ranking employees cleaning up his messes."
bad,"Company only cares about bottom line. Even though we are what makes Walgreens a successful company,we are not appreciated. Benefits are very expensive and inadequate. I feel like a company that is about health should be able to provide more affordable coverage for their employees. Wages are somewhat low,so if you factor in premium cost, I dont make a living wage."
bad,"When Walgreens North in Bartlesville was 24 hours I worked the overnight shift. Before the store went 24 hours work was evenly distributed between morning and evening crews, however once the store became 24 hours a day, an inordinate amount of work was pushed off onto the overnight crews. Despite each shift being 10 hours long, we did not have nearly enough time to do the amount of work they had expected of us."
bad,"Depending on which shift (either a.m. or p.m.) I learned the opening and closing chores and responsibilities. I was the front cashier who greeted and rung customers up. Kind of a ""full-circle"" customer service experience. Management was only called up if there was an issue with a customer or a high-priced return. The employees were responsible for working together to work their breaks in therefore we had to all get along which was a challenge at times as I worked with many younger and less responsible employees. The hardest part of the job really had nothing to do with the job...it was having a teenager while having this job.The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers smile and laugh, hopefully taking their minds off of them or their friend/family member being sick or not feeling well. The regular customers I came into contact with helped make my day fun and go by faster."
bad,The management would pick favorites and does not treat all emplyees fairly. The hours kept getting cut from younger employees and given to the older ones.
bad,"This job is a good job for high school students who can work nights and need extra cash. As a person with a car note, insurance, rent, etc., it was very hard to make ends meet. I had to work a part time job as well just to make sure I would have enough money to pay bills and I only ended up with may $100 in extra cash."
bad,I had 7 different managers in 3 years. 4 of those managers were fired and replaced with another inexperienced person.  One of the others left the company for better hours and pay elsewhere. No matter the performance they only want more and don't show appreciation for success.
bad,I use to love the company. But as time has passed they have gotten greedy. They only care about profit. They work their employees too hard without appreciation.  I do not recommend this company. They will make your time their miserable
bad,"When I was hired, I should have gotten what the manager at the time promised me in writing. But since I hadn't and the management changed, none of what I was promised was honored. Meaning they didn't give me flexible time for school or family. And they didn't help with harrassing customers or communicate when they wanted to randomly give me a morning shift."
bad,"Although I liked my personal manager and some people I worked with, the general managers did not treated you professionally.  They did not treat you with respect.  I still go to the Walgreens store and stay in touch with fellow employees at corporate.  However, I have no respect for the managers."
bad,"A typical day at work would start with harassment by management over irrelevant items, ie lunch break not take exactly at the half way point of shift."
bad,"This job is great for kids in high school trying to make a few dollars or people near retirement, but if you are looking for any type of advancement be prepared to work overly hard for at least 5 years before you see any real progress. They put way too much stress on the little things and they want you to dedicate your entire life to Walgreens. They are super impersonal and inconsiderate of personal situations."
bad,"The pharmacy manger allowed a Pharmacy Tech to dictate schedules and assignments. This individual was allowed to bully other employees with no retribution, even when there was written proof."
bad,"working for walgreens was a gross disappointment. no measure of excellence, no role model in management to develope high expectations. management has no management skills, strictkly  high paid stockers, the store was in constant chaos."
bad,Management is an absolute joke. Human Resources is no help at all and all senior management plays favorites.  They show race favoritism and do not follow their own policies.
bad,Don’t work there. They suck and are understaffed. They work you like a dog. I️ need to go. Seriously I️ can’t beliebe I️m still there. The job does not take care of its employees
bad,This job serves as a good first job for younger people. There is very little job security and the wages are pretty sub-par. Hours are budgeted so there is no consistency or guarantee that you will be given a decent amount of hours in any given week. Management is engaged but not understanding. A typical day consists of organizing the store and assisting customers
bad,"no room for growth. company does not have benefits commensurate to employee's work load. play a lot of favorites politics. most time, people are advanced based on who they know."
bad,"	Provided friendly customer service"
bad,"typical day, serve costumer needs, no management approach, work culture no very pleasant, long period time in calls, your break mingle with your co-workers"
bad,"When I first started with the company it was a lot of fun. I learned a lot and I am thankful for that. Now that most of our leadership is from boots, they can care less about their employees."
bad,This job came with a lot of hidden problems among coworker and management. Management does not value confidentiality and do not follow corporate guidelines in the day to day operations.
bad,Didn't like the direction the company was heading. A lot of changes were taking place and they weren't for the advancement of the employees. The pay wasn't the greatest and there was no room for growth within the company.
bad,"no help, management thinks a body equals help, cant hire anyone, gone over 1.5 years with insufficient staffing, upper management wont reply to calls or concerns"
bad,"I am a licensed professional and this job was not fulfilling. This job is for a person who likes makeup and skin care , but isn't quite ready to be more or do more.was a cashier with a beauty consultant title. I did nothing related to my title at all. I was onboarded for a full time position, but only worked 29 hours a week."
bad,"Hours are never fairly distributed amount co workers. Favoritism is a big issue for the pharmacy manager there is never opportunities to learn , you just get scolded for doing what you know but really they never teach. Store manager always likes to retaliate for any little thing she does not like and will find any reason to write you up.  It's probably different in every store."
bad,I don't want to give a horrible horrible review because it could be better job at a different location but at my location I was always sad and depressed going to work I would cry on my way to work management was so mean to everyone it was horrible I had a couple co workers who I will miss a lot when it's my last day but I'm excited to start my journey outside of Walgreens
bad,"Been here a long time. Climbed the ladder, worked hard, felt good. Now it's more of a cut throat environment, where people are bullied into performing, rather than rewarded for a job well done. Went back to school to change careers. Sad the direction the company has taken in the last 5 years."
bad,"The management wasn't very nice. They were really rude, and so were a lot of the employees. There were a lot of things to learn, and they weren't very patient if you didn't understand."
bad,The trainer at the facility was not a god trainer.out on the floor if you did not get something they would let you g o instead of putting you back in training.  No one on the floor had time to help the ew people
bad,"The pay is considerably low. $7.50 an hour in a city like Boston is counterproductive. Hence the low ratings. The job environment isn't bad, employees get along well for the most part, but there was also an incident of theft which involved a manager at the time. I think they should do a better job of identifying adequate leadership"
bad,"Well i work at both places and it was ok environment"
bad,There needs to be better training implementations. Favoritism is a primary role in discipline. Employees don't feel valued and that's reason for high turnover.
bad,I have worked for a few companies in my life but none as poorly managed as Walgreens. Easily visible that they do not care about you. There is ZERO room for advancement.
bad,Management is not trained properly to guide team members to do their job effectively.  Workplace culture is very cutthroat and not empathetic to the employee.
bad,"Walgreen's pharmacy system is designed with impossible to meet standards.  It was described to me as ""...not meant to be easy"".  Plus there are more than a few pharmacy managers in the system who are sadistic, punitive and power hungry.  Techs burn out at an alarming rate.  Job related injuries, physical and emotional, are rampant.  At my pharmacy, I was the only employee who wasn't on either pain killers or anti-depressants.  As of today, the only permanent, full-time employee who hasn't given their intention of leaving the pharmacy is a sr. tech who just transferred in from another state.  All of these things are due to the fact that our current  pharmacy managers is one of the worst in the region.  Store management continues to look the other way when issues are brought to their attention."
bad,"Ask a lot of leads, but let employees walk all over management. Hard to have life outside of work with the contest changing schedules. Very physical job for being a retail job."
bad,"There's  not much to say. I was paid almost minimum wage. I never had a lunch break. Most days I could not even finish a 15-minute break to scarf down a protein bar and a drink. It was always chaotic, I left at least one hour late at the end of every shift. Customers are extremely rude."
bad,"Poor leadership, policies and procedures. Floor reps are treated like second hand workers. No positive reinforcement. Not a good work environment. Stay away."
bad,"typical day at work consisted of lifting and making merchandise sellable, management wasn't good at communicating, was rude most of the time, they have different management now"
bad,"While working for a retail store, I learned how to make customers happy and be customer oriented. I also learned how to work under stressful situations while keeping a strong work ethic."
bad,"Since the merge with Boots Alliance, Walgreens has adopted some policies that are not pro-employee whatsoever, and the general sense within the employees, is that the new vision of the company is strongly directed to maximize profit at all cost, and for me a company whose only goal is to make more and more money (by the way is already a billionaire company), is not worth working for. Companies at that level and with that power, should be worried and working for a better world."
bad,"I did not like working for Walgreens. It was stressful,dirty, unsafe and just poorly operated. I barely got a chance to take a break and the management team put majority of the work load on the few good employees we had."
bad,"Don't work here!!! They make up litres and threaten to fire you if you get a lawyer because one of your coworkers was strangling you,  putting plastic bags over your head and trying to suffocate you and hitting you. Had I not Bern young and dumb I would have known better."
bad,"Walgreens is a business,  first and foremost. They may act like they care about their customers or employees, but it's really just all about the money. Employees don't know their own schedule beyond 1 week, and the pharmacy computer system is dumbed down so much that it is extremely limiting and frustrating to deal with. My own pharmacy is so understaffed for the workload, some employees opt to give up their lunches to stay and make things a little easier for coworkers."
bad,"nice employees, management sucks, never knew when you would get done,could be 8hrs,10 or 12hrs."
bad,"In trying to be fair, retail pharmacy as a whole is a field without a future.  High prescriptions volumes, unrealistic work goals, steady streams of complaining customers all have to be dealt without good pharmacy tech support (maybe 20%are actually solid) or good support from store or district management. What makes Walgreens different is the excessive micromanagement, the blame shifting (the RPh is the only responsible for errors) and the constant games management plays instead of solving problems.  Would not go back and work there, would rather go back to school and train in a different field."
bad,"Met and worked with a lot of wonderful people. Its very fast paced especially during holidays. It can be very challenging and, sometimes stressful, but I feel that it builds character and helps you to be a problem solver."
bad,"Walgreens is very old school- men still in suit jackets, no work/life balance, and management is unapproachable.  Promotions given to people based on personal opinions, not capabilites."
bad,Job had very poor management with 0 chance of advancement. Management relied on temp works to make the company run and hired on maybe 10% of workers.
bad,"They will steal your money and adjust your schedule. Maybe this location, they pick favorites and if you don't kiss their behinds, they will most likely give you attitudes all day and treat you like you are nobody. They supposedly do drug test but majority people in here, smokes marijuana. They look at background checks but a few are felons. It's weird."
bad,The management is not understanding at all with military backgrounds. Does not work with scheduling very well. stressful working environment
bad,have nothing to say. I use to love working for this store but the new manager came in and she is younger than me and she has favorites and she shows it to the younger kids that are there and the older ones are nothing to her
bad,It was my first job and i was excited about being in an environment helpibg people and sharing new products. Good place to be at.
bad,"There is a peak season for hour(s) availability which is very limited still, and if you have little to no experience you would expect to be given enough hours to practice and apply job skills. This will not happen here even if you are a trusted & reliable employee. You need to be in good with your manager to get what you want/need as hours go (basically brown nose your way in)."
bad,"You basically have to live at Walgreens and center everything in your life around what they need you to do in their under secured, low paying, unfriendly environments."
bad,"I advise whomever when you're picking a job like this make sure the location is good. When I first got this job at Walgreen's I loved every second of it. My store closed and I had to relocate which is where my problem began, at the new store the management was unorganized, coworkers messy, I wasn't comfortable around my peers, I was very unhappy with work."
bad,"I worked there for a very short period of time.  The workers didn't train properly, basically expected me to already know how to work the registers and know where everything was.  The co-workers were awesome, but again, didn't train well."
bad,New management things are changing for the worst. Feels like they do not care about employees anymore. Everybody make salary. It does not encourage people to work hard.
bad,"Walgreens has to be one of the worst places to work at for someone who is trying to go places in life. Pay sucks, schedule is alright. It is mediocre. Great for a person with no work experience whatsoever like a student who does not really need the money but is just working to have some extra pocket cash."
bad,"Ive worked at Walgreens since I was 16 and it has been a rollercoaster. Your experience completely depends on management, and what they want you to do."
bad,"very low pay, store manager would never do anything about employees who were not doing their job accept have the few people who actually did their job take up the slack. always being called in because of others calling out got old quick."
bad,the Walgreen that I work at is not an ideal work place. The management is rude and helpless. They do not care about their employees at all.
bad,"Not Good working environment, not enough compensation for hard work.Not allow to takes brakes for 12 hours working day."
bad,It was a very boring job. I would remember looking out of the sliding doors and envision doing more with my life. It's not a job to make a career out of it. It was more of a position to get fast cash. The hardest part of the job was standing all day. I learned to be patient with customer's.
bad,"Not too much fun."
bad,This is no longer the same company to work for.  They cut pay and positions yet expect more work.  The employees are undervalued and underappreciated.  I am happier and healthier now that I am no longer working there.
bad,"Always frantically busy. Unrealistic goals set by Corporate. Silly ideas frequently implemented and changed just as quickly by Corporate. Managers are good people but overwhelmed by company’s impossible expectations. Communication between management and workers is poor (see previous). Worst of all, minimum wage for a year, but (wait for it) a twenty-five cent raise annually.  Co-workers were wonderful, honest, hard-working, personable. Hardest job is cashiering because you answer the phone & transfer calls, greet every person walking through the door, stock items up front, bag items, push sales items at counter, AND cashier. It’s tough to handle cash while doing all the other tasks simultaneously. Oh, and we have to clean up after customers. You name it, we’ve cleaned it: Vomit, diarrhea, toilets, spills, etc."
bad,"They treat you bad, unappreciative. Labor is brutal. Don't care if you take breaks although it's against the law. I want to keep it short, but overall didn't like any of my three years working there and took it for experience and the little money I was earning. They always try to punish you when you take Vacation time that WAS earned and had plenty of. Just negativity everywhere."
bad,"Every day, it's extremely busy in the pharmacy, and we always seem incredibly understaffed. It's hectic, stressful, and not conducive to good mental health. We work in a place that promotes good health, yet we're penalized for missing work due to sickness. Even being in the hospital is no excuse for Walgreen's. The technicians are rude and unhelpful, the pharmacists are lazy, and everyone treats each other like a stepping stone instead of like a fellow cog on the gear, where we are all supposed to be working in conjunction to help keep and make patients happy and healthy. The people here are all out for themselves and they make no effort to hide it. This place is terrible to work, management doesn't care at all about their team members or what help they need when required. They are only about their sales numbers and nothing else."
bad,"Sad to say this wasn't one of my favorite jobs. It was boring and frustrating most of the time. My co-workers were like ghost, you hardly ever knew they were even there. The managers were no different. The best part about the job was how laid back it was but that gets irritating after so long. The only helpful thing I learned from working there was working the cash register."
bad,"Unrealistic expectation, harsh criticism, unsafe work areas. The most difficult part of my job was communicating with management that were always too busy to deal with employee safety utmost chemical photo labs."
bad,"welcome customer to the store, check them out at the register and make sure my work area is clean. put in new products on the floor. make sure my register is right before and after my shift. greet every customer with a smile. make sure i meet my monthly candy sales"
bad,Walgreens proved to be a place with little real accountability lots of finger pointing and passing of blame.  Management was not very flexible.  they set different standards for different people.  my time there was very difficult.
bad,"I have been with this company almost three years. Instead of seeing better benefits the company has taken three steps back."
bad,All i have to say is this place is RACIST. When i first started it was awkward because i was put in the beauty department where a worker had been working in that department for years. i was training and learning and in stead of telling me how to correct stuff she would run directly to the managers and tell them what im doing wrong ON MY FIRST WEEK. they finally moved me out the department and the person after me ended up getting moved and on...and on....they ended up putting me as a cashier/ photo person. majority of the people who were white would pick on me...even one women whom was mixed would say smart stuff about me and i was a very quiet person when i worked there. i ended up befriending a lady whom everyone look at as a mother of the store and then the drama started and eventually they pulled me in the office and told me my position (beauty advisor) had expired in which i had long gone from being a beauty advisor. at the time i was a regular cashier and a photo worker. i felt as if they found the smallest thing to use in order to fire me. i didnt make a issue but i did call cooperate whom by the way called back 2 months afterwards and said they cant do anything about it.
bad,"If you are unemployed, it beats not working. I would have never left any of my prior jobs to work there. There is no advancement and they are eliminating positions. "
bad,"Very Unorganized, very unfocused, always short staffed, I was unable to develop my department to it's full potential due to being short staffed and working in two or more departments in one day. Some members of management were very unprofessional, and did not work well with most employees, managers also spent a large amount of time on their personal cell phones playing games and surfing websites, leaving the employees to deal with store issues."
bad,"Working with the public is not easy, especially when you do not have enough help for all of the duties that need to be done."
bad,Their are no down times. Typical days are very busy. Management needs a lot of work and training to communicate with both coworkers and customers. Meeting new customers everyday is very exciting and continuing a good relationship with returning customers.
bad,"The people I worked with were absolutely fantastic.  The management definitely needs a lot of help.  I worked in the learning and development department and we received no training for our positions at all.  "
bad,"Company is in the midst of a restructuring plan right now as well as purchasing other companies domestically and internationally.  A lot of the senior leadership that has been with the company for several years has either left, been forced out, or is in the process of looking for other career options."
bad,"You're chained to your computer with very strictly scheduled breaks and closely monitored schedule adherence, with any deviation effecting your employee ranking, which in turn can drastically change your schedule and long term earning potential. Your schedule changes every few months and you have to work whatever you end up with. There is little to no information exchanged, pertaining to the job, between regular employees and the ""big wigs"" which often results in employees being misinformed and/or exchanging misinformation between themselves or providing misinformation to customers - and then being chastised for it. Co-workers are pretty great if a bit chatty. Supervisors and department directors are not particularly knowledgeable and are unable to make decisions; mostly as a result of their hands essentially being tied from above. This can be infuriating if you are paying attention day to day and care about the information you are providing customers and co-workers. The starting pay is competitive for the area but not for a corporate office job. Raises are small and only once a year. Pay increases exponentially with any advancement, but those opportunities are extremely rare. Benefits and raises are often being adjusted with the company benefiting and the employee ending up with less time off, longer waits for raises. The hardest part of the job is working for a company that is too big to care about you, and having every second of your work day analyzed for maximum profitability. Oh, and you listen to customers complain about mundane nonsense 40 hours a week. If you are a blissfully"
bad,"You work hard and get little.  They treat you as a liability, not a resource."
bad,I feel that by staying with this company/store it'll only creat a more stagnent manager of myself. It's obvious that about 95% of the current staff where I'm located is looking/VERY open to working else where.
bad,"Right off the bat, the manager flat-out refused to pay any overtime. We were required to stay even if our jobs went over a regular day's shift, and were not compensated for it. The management also refused to let us leave early on days when work finished early to make up for the overtime they refused to pay."
bad,A great place to work if you're in high school or working through college. Compensation is horrible. The best part of the job is helping customers.
bad,"Managers are unprofessional."
bad,"Due to the recent restructuring within the company, Walgreens doesn't offer many incentives to stay anymore."
bad,did not like this job at all. management would tell you one thing and do another.
bad,"initially for first year was ok, and after a while too much of micro micro management. they treat employees like they are disposable plates."
bad,The company went in a different direction than when I entered.
bad,"You can tell your bosses about problems in the workplace, and they'll give you a lot of lip service, but nothing will change. Things may even get worse!"
bad,The in particular store I worked at was garbage but I had the fortunate experience of temping at other stores and not all of them are horrible.I guess it was just our management.
bad,"Because of my experience with this company, I feel it is better that I not discuss life at Walgreens."
bad,"Learning opportunities for COE are great, but if you don't staff one of these sites, you don't get to train for non-sterile compounding, hiv, etc."
bad,Working for this company has been a learning experience they say they are family oriented but not really. When I first started working there they raise and benefits were great when they bought another company things went downhill. I enjoyed helping the many customers find what they may need and getting my work done fast and efficient.
bad,"-A typical day at work always depends on which shift you get. If you have the morning shift a typical day begins with a morning meeting followed by being told what we need to do on top of what we always do. The evening shift however takes over for the morning shift and you usually stay late. If you are a 24-hour store and you are overnights you finish everything that was not done by the previous two shifts."
bad,was over night shift so really was maintnance type of work . Part cashier . I learned how recieving for store merchandise was handled and stocked for the company. I was only cashier with an overnight manager. Hardest part was getting used to the overnight hrs. The most I enjoyed was the rate of speed it was more of a comfortable night.
bad,The best part of working a Cashier at Walgreen's are the customers and the my co-workers.  It is a long grueling work with lots of duties to fulfill at the end of the night shift.
bad,"Everyboyd had there own experience with every job, and i must say i had mine with Walgreens."
bad,"I worked for Walgreens for about 4 months. While i did like the job itself. The management was the worst i have ever seen. They dont train you at all. My pay checks never made sense, as in i was not getting the right pay for the hours i worked. The management was extremely sexiest towards men."
bad,Walgreens is a good place to start your retail experience. I enjoyed the customer and the cosmetic.
bad,"I worked with the company for a couple of months. my shift consist of grave yard hours. there  was no time for my actual life and everytime i went to work i feared for my life. there would be so much theft and no securitty. one of the manager was really homophobic and that is our main customers. with this job i learned to be more strict with my self and to not believe that customers wont or cant hurt you. I actually enjoyed working with my co-workers. when i first got there, they made me feel calm and thought me th basics. the hardest part of my job was trying to stay awake during the night, and not being nice to the customers that would steal and called me names."
bad,I did not like working for walgreens. everytime my grandmother or new born son was sick I had to call out and they did not like it. Managment at the time were very rude 
bad,walgreens stores are very fast pase which is fine but there is always a case of not enough or insufficient help.
bad,"As a manager at Walgreens you are required to do all the work that employees don't think they need to do. And you are held accoutnable for these tasks as well as all of your regular job duties. Management postions are eliminated starting next year,so if you are an ASM you will lose pay."
bad,"Expect to work long hours and receive no recgonition for your work. A typical day includes, receiving ware house trucks, making price changes, doing resets and revisions and working over stock."
bad,"Our store is very stressful. Our manager is very unpredictable and can lash out at employees for no reason. There have been several complaints to human resources but corporate doesn't care because our store is making money. Also, job descriptions keep changing and hours are arbitrarily cut. The assistant manager position that others have said pays well is being eliminated. The new shift lead position has all the same responsibilities but the starting pay is 8 dollars an hour less. Its also a very male dominated workplace. Only ten percent of the management in my district is female. Young men have the best chance of advancement. Customers can be nice but many are not."
bad,"Greeting people and helping them with any questions, guidence or advice when requested. Management was friendly, however, not helpful or advice guidenced. No guide lines or directives were given in writing, even when requested. Never given guidence on how the job was to be performed and then let go for not knowing."
bad,"Very little pay, twice a month employees were required to clean the public restrooms. Bad management that was not solving existing problems in the store."
bad,"If you want to work like an indentured servant to top out making $14.50 an hour after seven years of hard work and dedication this is the place for you! Management is horrible, our manager had dirt on the district supervisor so got away with treating her employees like dirt. I ended up quitting after finding out my time-clock was being altered for months and my hours were being shorted."
bad,"Everyday would be a chellenge and a learning experience. It would be from ringing great customers to counting and balancing safe. Daily routines, projects, merchandising, keeping store dusted and mop, fully stocked. Also managing store floor and team members, handeling customers and team members complaints and requests. Last is taking in and ordering for warehouse and I would also check and fix cash reports. Management did an excellent job delegating and mentoring how retail stores should run. Hardest part of the job I would say keeping up with inventory. And the most enjoyable is being around great customers."
bad,"Walgreens is lacking in management skills, value of the employee, work-life balance, merit increase when its warranted and are very behind the times on paid time off."
bad,The store I worked at was awful.
bad,"Not enough help most of the time, store mgrs, asst. mgrs. come back to help in pharmacy some times, and some better than others."
bad,"I worked at Walgreen's Co. for three years. There was absolutely no room to advice your career/training there and if there was no one was motivated or interested in helping you. almost everyone in the district I was in seemed burned out and unmotivated to do anything! most everyone there is now getting De-moted!!! Walgreen's recently came out with this new position called store team lead (STL), its step below Asst. Manager and a lot of AM's are getting de-moted to (STL). Anyway, best of luck to anyone wanting to join the Walgreen's team! hopefully you'll be a great store with managers/co-workers who are motivated."
bad,Typically you'll come onto the floor and sit at your desk in front of a computer with your headset on. Work includes making and receiving calls related to refilling specialty medications. Most of the calls made will result in leaving a voice message. Workload is insurmountable. Management is ineffective and does not provide feedback. There is a ton of drama and gossip between coworkers. No chance to go far in this department or company. Insurance is expensive.
bad,THis company cares only about money. Work in one of the busier stores and tell me I'm lying.
bad,Walgreens was a great company before the family sold the business.
bad,Typical a day of as a manager. I walk the store in the morning each aisle about three feet at the time looking at opprtunities and writing notes on my supervisor pads on what we need too work on.
bad,"I worked at the busiest store in my district, it was terrible. The store manager forces you to call her ""Mrs. Roe,"" despite the fact that she's only in her 40's, she also has no respect for what the pharmacy does. The store is 24 hours and they refuse to give their people a consistent schedule which leads to horrible sleep deprivation. The patient care is pathetic at best. Due to staffing issues it takes hours to fill a prescription and the store manager refuses to allow the use of free discount cards; I've personally witnessed her throwing a stack of RxWest cards in the trash... pathetic."
bad,Computer systems is so out of date and hard to use . Not a happy place to work. Don’t like the changes since Walgreens has taken over. Everything is harder to do the same amount of work.
bad,"When it comes to this location, be prepared to do the job of your management team!  If I had to list the pros and cons, the cons would win. I honestly feel as if nobody should have to do the job of their bosses when the bosses are REQUIRED to do their own work. I guess the cameras are only there for show too. Tell me again how it's ok to let people steal in your face but employees are searched regularly? Outside thieves are costing the company way more money then employees but hey what do I know? Maybe Walgreens should think about donating everything they want us to throw away and actually save some money. That's thousands a month we throw away in non-perishables. I forget as long as it's not digging in their corporate pockets they wouldn't need the extra money to help their stores."
bad,In the 7 months that I’ve worked at Walgreens i learned lot of communication skills for example talking to different type of customers helping them with their demands another big thing was talking to different race individuals I feel very comfortable talking to them and enjoyed helping them
bad,Not the company it use to be. Falling more and more towards a company Bankruptcy. Restructuring the company and reducing pay for the same position with a different title. One could actually get a promotion and lose pay going from Assistant Store manager to Store Manager.
bad,Walgreens Policy you can call 5 days out of the whole year. If you call of more than five that’s a termination.i feel like you don’t get the pay for what you worked for
bad,"I worked for 5 years and never got a raise, fewer hours over the years no advancement opportunities. Taking calls for call center for login issues, photos related questions, tracking, refunds, resubmitting orders."
bad,"Although this job was technical and repetitive, it had some issues. The supervisor wasn't a motivating as much as managers were. The pay wasn't that great either. Maybe if the pay rate had a little bit more incentive, it would've made the job a little, no alot better environment."
bad,"Pay over all it's bad and dont have growth opportunities. They dont have competitive pay for bilingual employees, they look out only for the corporation not the employees that's why they are always hiring"
bad,"Store manager talked about employees behind their backs constantly,would send inappropriate text and photos to certain ones,like a naked cowboy wearing chaps.But I was fired for bringing it to upper management's attention."
bad,Advancement is only for management's favorites. I have worked for this company for 6 years and people who are lazy and haven't been with the company long get to move up.
bad,Working at Walgreens was so negative I had to quit and start my career all over again. They took over my Rite Aid store and the first thing they did was cut hours. The second thing they did was fire every highly experienced person (pharmacists with the most benefits and higher salaries).
bad,They claim to value both customer and employee but they are only concerned about the all mighty dollar. They would rather allow shoplifting  and not  employees saftey
bad,"My location is a very stressful and high anxiety environment. No matter what we do, is never good enough for our higher up management. We never have enough employees to work, so we're always understaffed, the employees who've been here for over 6 months still get treated like they just started. We have amazing shift leads, but no one enjoys coming into work. Perfect for people who are in college, and not for future job reasons."
bad,"If you’re looking to be treated fairly skip over this company well at least the SATR department, the management sucks completely. The only time you can get management attention is when they all come together to throw you under the bus other than that there’s no help, assistance, or support.. definitely looking to leave this department or company."
bad,"Okay place to get experience. Low pay and few hours. Corporate dictates policies down to stores without consideration. Used to be a place where people stayed for years, now after merging with Boots (UK), corporate thinks more about profits and image rather than employees."
bad,"Management spoke down staff, often not present, co workers were rude to new staff, not provided with opportunities promised at hire - training and materials for pharmacy technician license, full time with benefits."
bad,The managers at Walgreens were not qualified or responsible enough to be in charge of anything. The cashiers were responsible for cleaning public toilets while barely being paid enough to do customer service. Drug paraphernalia was found multiple times in the restrooms and public trash cans. Hours were never consistent and even full-time employees wouldn't be scheduled the same days each week. The mental strife is not worth the pay.
bad,"The job itself is not hard. But the management team is the worst I've ever experienced. They were unfair with scheduling, and they would not let me work the positions I was assigned. I was forced to work at the cash register whenever I came to work even though the schedule called for me to work somewhere else in the store (i.e. the photo kiosk). We were very understaffed almost everyday but they did not take that into account when we were behind on our duties. We rarely got to leave work on time because we would have to stay after closing hours to clean the store. Overall, the management team was the worst part of the experience working there. Fellow coworkers were nice but the night managers and assistant managers made working there unpleasant."
bad,"The management at thedastribution center is a mess.  Staffing is done poorly so hours are long and unpredictable.  PTO is capped yearly at 40 for roll over.  They play like they are friendly, but don't let that fool you.  They know they pay well and they use that to keep you in bad working conditions."
bad,"Terrible workplace environment, harassment is easy to get away with, unprofessional environment, and poor staffing procedures. The area is too small to feel like you can get away from other employees."
bad,"It's a pretty soul sucking company. I worked at Walgreens for about a decade, watched the benefits slide, watched the company cut and cut and cut. Walgreens stores are purposefully kept understaffed and they tend to under pay verse other large retailers. Only consider this company as a last resort."
bad,"Walgreen's will do anything they can to not pay you for your work. They haven't offered pharmacists a cost of living raise in 4 years. They constantly cut hours despite higher revenues or volume. Middle management loves to micromanage but takes zero interest in actual issues, such as harrasement in the workplace, violence against employees from customers, etc."
bad,"Walgreens has been on a downwards spiral since the merger with Boots Alliance. Senior Leadership most of all District Managers are oblivious to the demand in the stores, and they walk in demanding miracles that are unattainable. Company Policy's are not enforced in any store. Team members run a muck and without any consequences. Lord forbid you walk in and ask them to do their jobs.they will call the hotline on you and fabricate stories to get you out."
bad,"The hours are inconsistent. They higherd me at part time, but said I'd move to full time and never did. Then there were budget cuts and all of us that got higherd on last had our hours cut EVEN MORE. I finally had to quit because it wasn't enough."
bad,"The company was okay 10 years ago. But even when I started, they had began cutting back on things to save themselves money. "
bad,"The company is garbage, they do not care about their employees. The scheduling is so unfair. The pay sucks. Managers and District Managers do not care at all if you have problems. Not a family oriented company. Only out for themselves"
bad,"An outdated management style and strategies that are not competitive in today's world are making for a difficult business environment. Poor management, low engagement and apathetic employees."
bad,I can’t say all of this is true for all of Walgreens. Most of my managers are great and my boss is pretty chill it’s just the schedule manager in terms of staff. It’s retail so it does suck sometimes but I wouldn’t say we’re worse then anywhere else.
bad,First off before you become an official assistant manager you have to pass through Walgreens University. When you pass you get a small raise.... that's IF an official assistant manager position is available as you will only be an assistant manager in training. Responsibilities grow while pay rate stays the same. District managers and store managers are too close for comfort.
bad,"Don't be fooled. It is NOT a team effort between management and employees. I have worked at a Walgreens for 18 months and found that the management can be power-stricken. Management can create chaos, but blames employees. Management likes to use ""intimidation"" to get work done. Management likes to abuse / snoop  with Surveillance Cameras on employees. Corporate is extremely paranoid about likely lawsuits from any customers. "
bad,It was fine at first learning where everything is and how the pharmacy technician line works to keep the work place organized and flowing. But realized fast that this is a super fast passed high stress environment and in the middle of all that I still needed training to learn how to pack medicine and how the cash register computer works when costumer is picking up meds but there was budget cut and things went down hill. understaffed and then there is me as the new Full Time employee is now making around $160 at best best and that is if there is any days to work now considered not Full Time or Part Time more like what ever is left over for time slots and we will kinda train you but when we have time. which was hard for me since now I couldn't pay my bills and when ever I get stuck on trying to help a costumer out and I ask for help from the staff they roll their eyes at me since they are busy and I still do not know how things work haven't been fully trained. Worst experience ever made me look slow and dumb and the customers would yell a lot of times why the check out was taking to long.
bad,"Walgreens used to be a family friendly place, but that has changed with the constant neglect of senior employees and favoritism. It has become a place where the average employee doesn’t make it a year before quitting or getting fired."
bad,"Talking with customers about there needs while shopping , store management terrible no communication , too many favorites with management  overworked in pharmacy no help   ppl's are a  big joke ."
bad,Management are bullies but co workers are okay.  Be prepared to beg for your breaks and don't even think about calling in sick.  This is an okay job for school kids or young adults but don't plan on a career because the only successful people are ones who will sell their souls and integrity in order to advance.  Overall... just don't do it.
bad,There never really was a bad time at Walgreen's. Everyone came in at 8:30 and left whenever the managers felt like letting them go. i worked 3 weeks straight and only got a $400 paycheck and not including taxes. it was really unfair that i worked so hard and I put in overtime because there were only 8 people working there everyday. I would not recommend this job to anyone who graduated high school. this is a good job for kids or you ng teens who go to school and work right after. Just don't let them try to run you out of your check.
bad,"Working at Walgreens was a mistake, the management was inconsistent and hard to work with. Non flexible with hours and requests off were hardly ever approved. If you had to call out with even a doctors note you would be fired. Expect to be called in and if you don’t come in they will cut your hours as punishment. Overall my most hated job."
bad,"Only meant for deeply committed employees."
bad,"Walgreens was a great place to work. However, at the customer call center, management was never consistent with anything. Favorites always received special treatment while any one hard at work was not.  Opportunities to advance were hard to get approval for when your manager didn't like that department or vice versa. "
bad,"Management and poor communication. Policy needs to stop changing so often. If a customer calls corporate, they tell the customer something completely different from what we trained for. Benefits keep changing. There's no consistency."
bad,"The days are long, and management doesn't care about their employees most of the time. I've had 2 out of 6 managers that were even the bare minimum of respectful. Everyone at Walgreens hates their job. The best part is the customers, surprisingly, and the worst part is definitely the attitudes of other employees (management included)."
bad,Such an unprofessional and disorganized job. It was my first Job so it kind of shocked me how unorganized and unprofessional it was. I expected a fixed schedule and for more communication but I never knew what was expected of me and I never knew when I was scheduled to work.
bad,"This may have been the worst job I’ve had. I will say that it’s a good first job for a teenager in high school but as an adult no the pay is horrible, management sucks, and they are very inconsiderate and only care about Walgreens ."
bad,"I know in my case I was constantly switched all over to make sure things were covered. When I was working there.. when working the photo lab you had to cover lunches, and help in pharmacy when needed. Management was usually never there. Maybe 15 hours a week and still got their bonuses and everything at the end of the year. They were pretty good at micromanaging everything. I was let go for something I didn't do and lost all of my vacation days I was owed because paper work wasn't sent to me when they were suppose to hand it to me in store. Not a career place for sure. I forgot to mention I went 4 years with no raises because they Capped my position in the company."
bad,"The advancement that was promised was never given.I was not given enough hours to make a livable wage in the economy that I currently live in. Advancement was not offered and I was overlooked repeatedly. The manager was very on organized, never available, made promises that were never kept, did not know what was going on in his store."
bad,"Your just a number that can be replaced. They have great benefits. It is a high stress job, always busy. A lot of people have been let go. A lot of people have left."
bad,"They say they care but in reality they don’t "
bad,"sweating already"
bad,"Only working so I can go to school. Had the hardest time getting days off when I'm sick or otherwise. I've worked over 5 years and have missed less than a week. Entire atmosphere is awful, unless you just love retail. All management cares about is meeting quotas, tracking numbers, etc. But do an awful job of training and hiring. So tired of working there, most people would just get out as soon as they could if they were decent."
bad,"Patient engagement and assistance should be our number one concern, however the company has made the choice to focus on survey scores and profits. Due to recent events in California, employees in the entire company have suffered hour cuts, with increased work loads and engagement requests. Recent engagement survey scores have led the company to force employees to request surveys from every patient, with threats of termination if the request is not followed. In a typical work week, hourly technicians are now given at most 34 hours, at least in our market, but are expected to do three to four hours of external patient engagement, via phone-calls, per day. This may not sound like much, but on an a week day, the pharmacy is open from 9 am to 9 pm, with the opening technician leaving by 4 pm, the mid-shift working from 11 am to 5:30 pm, and the closing shift working from 2 pm to 9 pm. Recently, our specific location has suffered such heavy hour cuts, 105 hours for three full time technicians, that Tuesdays and Fridays have only two technicians scheduled, with the work-load of easily four. Daily e-mails are received from the DM with negative comments about the inability to complete near impossible work loads. Overall, our ability to help our patients has been made much more difficult. As good employees, we shall continue to push forward and hope for the best."
bad,Walgreens has gone from what I thought would be a great company to absolutely terrible.  The amount of work verses the amount of labour hours provided is aweful.
bad,Would not recommend unless you want to literally live at work. Unless you are DM or a Pharmacist you are paid according to your responsibilities. Under appreciated and under paid.
bad,No longer an enjoyable or rewarding place to work.  Everything that made being a Store Manager so great was ripped from our grasps.  It was transitioned to an individual sitting in a cubicle at corporate who's never worked in a store before.
bad,"Always smile treat customers and coworkers with care and respect, value your work. Work fast accurate and responsibly. Most importantly always be on time ready to work."
bad,"Maybe this company is just a front for something else but you get the impression that Walgreens is bright and Roomy, if you walked into the store yet I was a remote worker. and that's how the founder had made it yet there is no diversity inclusion which is their motto I even asked once because they're globally-minded through some of their movements and I asked if I had because I had seen that there and some remote positions are worldwide and I had seen that they had some offshore workers and I asked if I had relocated if they would honor that and because it wasn't in the states even HR hadn't got back to me with an answer for a month, Actually  I had never gotten a response, that I think was discrimination, and also between the technical problems and evaluation through those times and not giving it us a Grace. I had to even reach out to government organizations supporting my side."
bad,Management is not held by capable managers. Employees are not coached appropriately . Qualified and non-qualified employees are treated equally. Policies and procedures are not always observed.
bad,Extremely stressful work environment for pharmacy managers.  Fast changing systems with not enough training. Pharmacist salary increases  are on hold for the past few years.  Bad business acquisition decisions.
bad,Be prepared to be unhappy working here.  Long hours and constant scrutiny.  Understaffed unappreciated.   Management doesn’t know how to treat its employees
bad,horrible management stores are poorly ran company is constantly making drastic changes that are no benefit  short lunch breaks...sad part is this used to be a great company to work for but since the Rite Aid transition and Boots Alliance it's horrible.
bad,"I've worked for the company for 5 years, and after 5 years, and working at a different Walgreens in another state, my career ended. Maybe it was just this store that I worked at but they were the worst group of people I have ever had the pleasure of working with. The management could be better."
bad,"Not the best place to work. No lunch break, frozen pay for non union employees, highly structured organization. No compassion or fair recognition for hard work. No initiative is encouraged in fact. Asset management is waistful."
bad,"A rough retail job that would rather pay its executives and shareholders than adequately staff stores. Not a bad first job, but not a good job to stay in unless the top brass recognizes the value its retail staff holds."
bad,"I worked hard for this company. Never stopped working all shift with very little training. Did not complain to my manager ever. Was hour early ever day . took my job seriously, took pride in my self on what I achieved. I was confidant in my abilities and they fired me for not being a buttkisser (verbally). I was set up and fired without her even asking me my side . They wanted me to beg instead of following policy. I guess if you have the right manager that doesn't need their ego boosted and is about the job then it would be a great place to work. Now on unemployment thanks to them!"
bad,"I worked there not even 6 months and it was terrible. They don't train properly, they just stick you with an employee that's been there countless years and expect you to shadow their every move. The manager I had was ghetto and rude, not to mention they had me as part time but I was working full time hours  with no benefits at all.. wouldn't recommend."
bad,I worked at Walgreens from feb 2018 to January 2019. The management was horrible. They expect you to do all stocking lifting and count all the money at the end of the night with no staff. Walgreens is not a save place to work at all. People steal on daily basis and  threaten you and they management does not care about your well being. NO BREAKS!!! I’ve called corporate and they are no help. Worse job ever.
bad,"I worked hard for store. I ran freight, closed the store,Developed pictures in  photo lab, worked in pharmacy getting scripts ready for pickup. Most of shifts and store management stayed in office."
bad,"Ultimately focused on metrics not on patient care, refuses to hire enough to staff to make the job anything but stressful and inefficient. "
bad,"Everyday was different & busy with different projects to work on daily."
bad,It is a fast pace job and you learn a lot. They teach you many different things and there is a lot of opportunities to move up. You can ask management for help and they will always help you.
bad,"When starting with this company looking forward to moving up into management was myself goal. After being here for some years. They program about open door policy to help employee's, is closed."
bad,Not a great place to work. Always losing employees. The pay sucks. They want you to do so much for so little. Their pharmacy is a very needy people. Not again
bad,"Walgreens isn't a place that I would go to have a career in retail. Honestly, it almost killed my passion for retail. Being a cashier or floor person is fine but going into management is something I would strongly advise against. I don't feel that this company invests enough into its employees. In my opinion, Walgreens wants its employees to give their all to the company with little to no recognition for those who do. It used to be a really good company when I first started but that isn't the case now. I personally think the company is taking on too much too fast. it is growing and expanding but not putting money, time and effort into the people that it already has. Also, there is a huge lack of training."
bad,"A typical day at work, I am called to multiple locations at one time leaving me feeling inadequate. I am called to Pharmacy to help out at the detriment of the rest of the store departments. My location suffers due to lack of hours provided to cover store needs. For many years, this was a great company to work for, but in recent years, it seems we get fewer and fewer hours to schedule employees and our customer service is dwindling. Our shelves are left empty due to a lack of available time to fill."
bad,In a few short years the job has gone from a challenging profession that rewarded creativity and success to a regimented checklist job with ever increasing targets while removing tools and support needed to achieve them.
bad,"At my specific location a lot of favoritism was played and I was often given the work of other people and was asked to do work meant for managers. I was also sent into departments where I often had little to no experience. Despite this, the workers there are wonderful people aside from management."
bad,"If you are lucky enough to have a good, caring manager who bothers to stay even though they can get better money elsewhere than it can be an ok place to work. That is until you can get better money elsewhere which at this point is any other company."
bad,"Understaffed and overworked employees is the norm. To-do lists written in a way that makes you question every task you're assigned to do. Unsafe stockroom where the large and heavy shelves are placed 15 feet above your head, and balanced precariously on top of each other. I know someone who worked there for 8 years and still hasn't advanced into a management role they've been seeking. Annual raises based on performance that barely exceed a quarter raise, often times much less. Expect a dime raise if you're decent."
bad,The company is trending in the wrong direction and making a lot of bad decisions. Likes to show face to the public but can’t back the decisions they are making in stores
bad,ok place to work if you don't mind little to no chance of advancement as well being over worked due to not having enough staff to help with constant flow of customers
bad,"It might be my store that doesn’t provide you with the enough training and the assistant manager won’t ever look out for her employees. In fact, she only goes to work to get her paycheck, meaning that I would never see her doing anything productive when the boss is not around. But, besides that, I think what I like the most was how flexible they were with the hours."
bad,"Management is rude and mean, there is no such thing as excused absence even for ER visit or hospitalization. Harassment is swept under the rug. And new hires are thrown out on the floor with no training."
bad,Walgreens keeps cutting hours and expects its employees to do the work of 3 people in 8 hours. I really use to love working here. All of the changes all of the time and they don't pay enough for all of the work that you do.
bad,"When I first started at this job it was amazing! There were lots of benefits, the store was brand new so everyone was really energized and enthused about making it a great place to work. We also did a lot of community events. Eventually all of that went away. And was replaced with management that was too concerned about making their own daily life easy rather than upholding company policies and ensuring that the customers were getting the best possible care and best looking store that they could. It's very sad really. The shift managers are run ragged so that the assistant manager in the manager can sit in the pharmacy all day or sit in the office all day and worry about where they are going to order lunch from, and then sit in the office and stay and eat their lunch. The associates of the store treated even worse than expected to do even more. Whereas I have no problem doing my fair share of the work, if you weren't one of the assistant store managers favorites, then you were expected to do the work of your own position, and whoever her favorite was on that day as well."
bad,The work wasn't bad. Its a lot of material to learn quickly. The work culture however was under poor leadership.  Very click-ish. Terribly catty environment. Rude and unhelpful supervisors.
bad,Walgreens is usually not a  rewarding environment. negative focus towards employees is typical. management will pull rank on non management employees when conflicts arise.
bad,"I currently work for Walgreens and I am planning to leave soon as the pay is so low and after signing up for the health insurance I barely have anything left. I have been with the company for almost 6 months and up to now, we haven't even reached half of the number of employees that are needed for the job. Almost every week we lose 1 or more employees in my department (Health Care Clinic - Patient Support Center), most of them quit within the first month, as the job is highly stressful and the company does not give enough training and support to their employees to make them stay. The managers are nice but that's about it."
bad,"Started off as an ok place to work, then they changed management. From there, things went downhill. My hours started to decrease; & there was a lack of employees during my shift. I worked in a 24 hr store, with only 2 employees there. The task asked to perform were outrageous for the number of employees & lack of pay."
bad,"This was a great first company to work for. However, as you move up, you start to see the political side of a corporation. Since retail transformation began, hours have been cut causing stress and poor morale. Upper leadership chooses who gets promoted and it is not based on whether you are qualified to do the job or not."
bad,"Senior leadership has made some poor decisions, in the past two years, regarding how the company should grow. Wall Street reflects this."
bad,Used to be a good company to work for has changed a lot over the last few years.  Not for the positive.  In this company garbage rolls downhill. They are very out of touch with what is happening in the stores.
bad,"Any given day at work was indistinguishable from the next, with little to no room for promotion. Very limited contact with management above store manager. Nonsensical store review numbers and vast fluctuation in availability of hours and shifts to work."
bad,"Never supplied with enough Man Hours to accomplish or meet the goals they set."
bad,"With this company it's either work or family. They play favorites, and are never willing to work with your schedule. Schedules are all over the place, and hardly any weekends off."
bad,Communication was abysmal between fellow management. Financial compensation was poor. Employee moral was so-so and the employee training was minimal as well.
bad,I did not like doing everything it seemed like while other people watched on and didn't offer any help. Face to face interactions all day was not my ideal choice of work then but I would be up for the challenge today.
bad,"Walgreens offers no real motivation for employees to better themselves. Goals from corporate are unrealistic because they've never worked in retail themselves, there is an obvious lack of promotional availability to employees other than direct store managers and assistant store managers."
bad,"Used to be a great company for pharmacist back in the day. Now, you have a bunch of under educated, overly arrogant middle managers as the pharmacy ""supervisors"" who don't understand the first thing about management let alone pharmacy. It's laughable .  They worry about whether we are chasing surveys instead of filling RXS or inventory. "
bad,"I currently feel that Walgreens is not the same company that I started working for in 2016. Instead of really concentrating on patient care and consultations, it seem like it is a numbers game now. How fast can you achieve goals, how fast can you move patient's in and out? I don't feel like I have the opportunity to really do the job I went to school for, and that being to really help people and give incredible life changing  advice"
bad,"By far the most boring job I've ever had. The pay is decent is you're a pharmacy technician which I was for a period of time, and then my hours were cut so I began working in the front of the store. Managers are on top of you constantly, and up front the pay is very difficult to live on. You will find the time drags, but overall its a really easy job. If you're out of highschool or college I would not recommend."
bad,Its a fine place to work for. If you like doing the samething every day and each week. There is security in the job but has begun to see high turnover.
bad,"When I first started it was great. I have worked at multiple stores and they are all the same. Cliques are very prevalent in these stores, and they typically include store managers, so if you get on the bad side of one of your coworkers, you can surely bet that they will all be gunning for you."
bad,"Worked for multiple stores which were all fast paste. The bottom line is if management is not on the same page, the store will suffer. Many times management is so worried about covering themselves only, they throw every else under the bus, including the store manager. I do believe it’s entirely too much pressure on management, which falls on the rest of the team and no one is being properly compensated. This company makes too much money for their staff to work as hard as they do and can barely get by. Also, you could have worked for them well over 20 years and they will still fire you over some bs, everyone is replaceable!"
bad,"Its your basic retail job, the company really doesn't care about employees. if you happen to have a good manager the job is tolerable, if not than you wont be able to handle it for long"
bad,"process prescriptions throughout 8 hour shifts. Customer service was very important with this job. Dealt with customers, physicians, nurses, insurances. High stressful, fast pace, poor working environment. Not enough breaks, not enough help. Had to deal with lot of patients throughout whole day. Some were nice, some were upset, some were just rude. Interpreted prescriptions from doctors, processed prescriptions, data entry, filled prescriptions, verified prescriptions. Inventory management, trained staff, provided immunizations."
bad,"Although the employees and shift managers at walgreens were great, the main management gave me nothing but problems. They knew I wad a beginning college student and refused to work around my school schedule."
bad,"I worked at walgreens for almost a year and by the end I looked like a zombie. That place expects so much out of employees that they are paying the bare minimum. It's terrible, I would never recommend to someone who isn't desperate"
bad,"Unless you want/ going to be in the pharmacy, Walgreens does not really care about you. They know that pharmacy brings more money than anything else so you will be stuck in a position there for a very long time."
bad,"no lunch breaks, I learned how to get people to cooperate with immunizations, but on my own accord.. Walgreens doesn't really care about the people....its a corporation ..I did my best to create an environment for my technicians where they actually WANTED to go to work ....most enjoyable part was building relationships with my patients and my technicians...we built a family"
bad,way too many things happened at my time at walgreens that have showed that corporate and the managers (where i was at) do not particularly care about the well being or advancement of their employees.
bad,"The culture at Walgreens makes for a tough environment to be in, especially when you are there 50 hours a week. They have managers/leaders who haven't had leadership training and have no business managing another persons career/growth."
bad,poor management made me dread going into work.  8 hour shifts that werent flexible and made it difficult to manage work and school. overall would not recommend
bad,"There is no accountability and mid-level management does not do well to engagement team members.You have to be the boss's favorite in order to advance your career or even worse, any project agenda."
bad,"In my experience, the two walgreens stores I have worked at have been terrible. The management was always very self absored. For three years of my life I was still paid the same, I never received a pay raise simply because the management did not like me as a person, although my work ethics were amazing and I had been praised several times for it."
bad,As part of the Management Team I learned how to do all the operations of a retail store.  Helping customers find what they needed & making my customers happy.
bad,My least favorite place I have worked at. Manager was awful and rude to customers and employees. Lied to about job advancement. Not a place I would recommend.
bad,Walgreens is looking for younger pharmacists for less money . They look at numbers not people.  Very stressful  Dms need better people skills. CEO needs to be an under cover boss.
bad,Isn't really a place to work at if you are faster paced and wanted to do more things. Work days feel really long. Working here was ok but you gotta be ready when its slow most of your day is stocking.
bad,"I was fired for giving my fiance my employee discount that you are only allowed to give to ""immediate family"". SInce we werent legally married it was NOT ok and they made me pay them back in cash with my last check. Pay sucks anyways"
bad,Poor Management led to a lot of wasted time and lack of production. Very easy job however. The people there are okay but overall they do not enhance the experience.
bad,This was a very stressful place to work at. Extremely poor management. The only time they care is if it will benefit them or the store directly. They don't really care about the safety of their employees.
bad,depending on the store that you work at depends on how busy you will be. Day is spent stocking the store and doing all the necessary things that keep the store functioning. The problem is that the manager at the store that I worked at wanted to have everyone do tasks or jobs that a Assistant manager or shift lead should be doing for the pay or a store associate. The hardest thing about the job is working all kinds of crazy hours and being away from family. The most enjoyable part is being able to hear all the stories that the customer would tell me about photos or families and events of the past. All in all wasn't that bad of a job for me but I did learn a lot.
bad,In the past couple of months walgreens have been going down hill. They do not care anything about their employees or patients only about their PROFIT. The management do not have any commonsense and if it makes sense or working they want to change  it to something that does not make any sense. I have been a pharmacy technician for 10 years and I really hate coming to work. everyone in my pharmacy looking for a new job what does that mean!!!
bad,It wasnt great i told them 8am til 5 during the week because i was a mom after starting i was getting 10hours because i cant work nights which i was hired for days
bad,"As a student it works with your school schedule, but if you're looking to make a career out of it, don't. I work in one of the downtown locations, if you're ready for people stealing regularly and management power-tripping on you then this is the right place. Other than that, it's just another paycheck."
bad,They Discriminate. I filed for harassment and had to transfer to another store. Only to start writing me up for no reason. I Have since filed charges with EEOC.
bad,"It's okay for a retail job if you just want to work part-time."
bad,The stores are frequently understaffed causing the employees that are on duty to multi-task as a regular part of the job . Management frequently assigns more task than time allows.
bad,"Deal with shop lifters daily"
bad,"It really depends on the store you work at as far as the culture and management.  My 1st week on the job they posted the schedule for the following week which I wrote down.  No one advised me that someone changed one of my days b/c another employee needed a day off so when I didn't show up to work I was written up.  I think being a new employee of a week and having no one tell you that the schedules can change several times a day I should have been educated not an automatic write up.  Too much drama with the manager, pharmacist and other techs."
bad,The store manager made herself difficult to contact and gave very counterintuitive criticism for the job being that she didn’t like that I conversed with customer rather than just being a cipher to them
bad,"I wasn't properly trained in my original store. I was sent to another location to get trained effectively. This secondary  store taught me basically everything. The job itself can be very stressful but for me it was even worse because there were people that were trying to micromanage me who claimed to be my ""trainer"""
bad,"The company is changing so much, everyone I know (even the Pharmacist) wants to leave. District managers are the managers of the Pharmacists and they do not understand that the pharmacy doesn't run smoothly...ever! My store manager, along with many in the district, walked out. They say CVS is the worst place to work for.. I would say Walgreen's is getting to that point. Grateful for attaining my certificate for free because of the company but that is about it. I do not like their expectations."
bad,"the work day was hard, employees are underpaid, employees also have to deal with extremely rude and unprofessional management. not fair, especially when you are a dedicated, faithful employee to the company."
bad,"Continue to do more with less, Seek every way to cut costs, more specifically cut labor to squeeze as much profit as possible for every quarter.  The company is seeking to create new ways to spin the employees as the focus but still maintains a very low wage for everyone less than the upper management level."
bad,"Walgreens as a company has nothing wrong with it from my perspective, but having worked at more than seven different stores over my employment of three years I have a lot to say about the people they put into management positions. Being only 18 years of age when I first began my career at Walgreens I was put into a position of servitude. Every store I worked at until my final transfer placed me as the youngest employee therefor all the grunt work fell upon my shoulders. I saw no issues with being entrusted with this work but every store I worked at my dedication and lack of defiance was abused. As the youngest at each store I should have been in a position to be learning from my superiors and be guided into maturity at the workplace, but instead I from day one had to be the face of maturity and professionalism. I was the center of information for childish arguments between employees, store managers, shift leads, etc. I always sought to get people to solve their problems by seeking to come to an understanding and yet everywhere I went store managers were speaking ill of their workers and vice versa. Store managers and their assistant managers consistently found a way to blame others for the work that they were not completing and assigning others to things that they felt they were too good or being paid too well for. The management at most Walgreens locations tend to be stuck up people who see themselves as too good to do the job they're paid to do. My biggest complaint with Walgreens is that for three years consecutively I had store managers and their assistant managers telling"
bad,pharmacist barely get time to eat. want you do to many tasks off the clock on your own time. Barely room for advancement. So stressful.  non productive meeting of employee engagement to show they care. Compensation is so low.
bad,"It was very high paced, long hours with no breaks, sometimes allowed to go to the restroom, poor management, no organization, unfriendly coworkers, had to work most holidays including Christmas."
bad,"On a typical day we had to deal with customers which was fun to be bale to interact with new people,but the reason for leaving was the management. They could not work with my class schedule."
bad,"At least the consolation of working here is that i t far outweighs working at CVS. All retail is the same (for minorities, that is)...enough said. Regardless, it's a great place to start."
bad,"Co-workers would often do little work, pushing work to those who were expected to get work done for same pay. Management didn't want to fire those that were recognized as doing little work, so they didn't have to find new employee's."
bad,Overall some management were good others were belittling and very rude.  Proper training should have been implemented for the accountability.  Staff were not treated fairly
bad,"I enjoyed helping the patients and becoming more familiar with them.The company is always coming up with strategies  to improve the company, when all the need to figure out is how to get more hours to assist the patients,"
bad,Since our warehouse wide schedule change last year most departments can not finish the daily work load in a normal shift leading to lots of overtime and having to come in on days off to help. Lots of people have quit leading to more stress in the building and even longer hours. Management doesn't know how to fix the problem and instead most times they make it worse. Also your start times change on a days notice making it hard for anyone with kids to plan for daycare.
bad,"For a drug store, the managers there sure do expect a lot from their employees. You better be available to cover for people every conceivable day and abide unerringly by the ""if you have time to lean, you have time to clean"" rule, or you'll be on their bad side forever. But if that sounds like you, you'll fit in just fine. Otherwise, don't bother unless earning minimum wage in a borderline liminal space is worth dedicating your life to."
bad,Good place to work just need something better. I just need something that will better me and my family. Raises are not good for as much work as we do. Management isn't what it's all worked up to be.
bad,If you want to give up your soul and anything that resembles a family this is the perfect opportunity for you.  I hate coming to this place....every time I have to
bad,i worked in the pharmacy and it was a decent job. they tried to work with you on scheduling and the people i worked with were ok but i dont miss the job.
bad,"Most likely the worst place to work. The pharmacy is understaffed and the senior technician acts like the world revolves around her. The managers did nothing about her foul attitude or behavior. Walgreens wants their employees to kiss every patients behind to ensure return business. Employees would not be so surly if they had regular breaks, good compensation, and managers that cared about them."
bad,"Very stressful but also very fast pace. One has to learn how to be able to work under pressure, multi task, not be afraid to speak and communicate with people and also being efficient in the pharmacy."
bad,"No issues with the corporate culture in general, but the management at the Revere, MA location was very suspect. There are opportunities to be sponsored by Walgreens Corp. for PTCB certification, however I was met with opposition and general apathy on several occasions by the Senior Pharmacy Technician, Pharmacy Manager, and Store Manager at the Revere store."
bad,somewhat nice place to work. no room for moving up was a very easy job to do the coworkers were like an extended  family management only cared for the numbers they were hitting not for the employees and how they are doing
bad,"I worked at the call center for about 4 and half months. I was hired in for one department and that was fine. I really enjoyed it. I had been there for about 2, maybe 3 months when they told us they were cutting our department. We were also told, at the time, that we would have a choice on where we went next, our hours would not change and we would have sufficient training. Come to find out we had no choice on where we went, we were give mandatory overtime without being asked first, and our work load tripled. Plus, the training was going way to fast when dealing with sensitive info. For someone like me who suffers with anxiety, this was not the place to be."
bad,A day at Walgreens for me was very random at best. I learned how to deal with virtually any type of person as well as their various moods. Management started off well but it sank in time. The hardest part of the job was working shorthanded. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers smile.
bad,"Horrible company to work for. They give no benefits, no health insurance and they treat you like the lowest level of person. Do not work here ever in your life."
bad,"Full- case work was labor intensive at times, just from heavy liquids, dog food, and other units that we throw onto the conveyor belt. Ten hour shifts, 7:30pm- 5:30am is the second shift. Some management were okay but most of the management had a condescending or lackluster attitude towards the regular employees. It was an okay job if you keep to yourself and just do your work. Just don't let any drama come your way as it seems to do for anyone working at that warehouse. They say that we were all a family. It sure didn't feel like it."
bad,"If you enjoy working in a call center environment you will be fine. But the changing ""grading"" metrics and poor management makes this job tiring FAST."
bad,"Would not work here unless it is your only option. There is no work-life balance and frequently asked to do overtime. Can be penalized for months for calling out, arriving late or having to leave early no matter the circumstance."
bad,"At first it was a good place to work I liked the environment and my coworkers and then after a while there were too many changes that were meant to be good changes to make us be more efficient but it only slow us down and making the hours longer, can't even go outside to go eat."
bad,very stressful.  They work the mess out of you for little pay.  You train other technicians and dont get paid for it.  They work you for longer than normal hours by yourself running the whole pharmacy.  This company is too stressful to work for.
bad,The pay for the amount of work a tech does here needs to be revamped!!!! Once you reach Senior tech status you no longer have room for growth as well as your pay may be capped off after a few years.  Benefits are too expensive for a family and overall pay is too low for all the hardwork techs put in on a daily basis
bad,"Walgreen's employee expectations are not parallel to the compensation. It is unfair that only pay attention to the shift leads and not the actual cashiers, technicians, and advisers."
bad,Walgreens is a customer service and retail based job. Associate may be expected to up-sale current promotional products. Organization skills are preferred but not required.
bad,They start you with hours but eventually they get cut ridiculously. They have nice people that work there but some managers are very picky and have their own group of people they associate with
bad,"Not the worst kind of places to work at but the contract is not as good as it used to be, you don`t know whether you finish early or stay late every day, they don`t pay for lunch hours, management`s not all that bad despite the fact that you can get dismissed for a small thing."
bad,"If you get hired at the right store everything would be great, the managers,shift leads and co workers.  At a flagship store however be prepared to be miserable. They are despicable imbeciles who refuse to separate work from personal feelings."
bad,Too much work wanting to be done for such little pay. They are unorganized as far as management. The store is full of nothing but drama. They keep scheduling me to work all day every single weekend.
bad,"The pay is not good, management is not fair with scheduling, they do not respect your boundaries or life situation. Customers are really nice and polite."
bad,At first I thought the company was great however my mind quickly change when I was no longer getting help from upper management. No help whatever was working alone half the time while others were on their phones and or talking in the center of the isle's.
bad,"Salary position that only meant work more, never meant leave early to see your kids concert.  reduced staffing leaving manual labor to management, meaning you had to work longer hours to get it all done.  Walgreens continues to find more ways to reduce salary and benefits to its long term employees."
bad,Beware. Trust no one. Store management resents pharmacists and tries to get them fired. (Common situation in many middle tn stores.) Corporate values are ideal but not exemplified at store level.
bad,Typical day would include stocking cleaning organizing. Customer service a must unloading of trucks stocking shelves. Management was unfortunately always changing
bad,I' am looking to leave this location due to poor management and a low chance of advancement. I would not recommend this job to anyone. My day is mostly spent picking up the slack from lazy employees and store manager.
bad,"When I first began working for this company, advancing in the company was easy. Now they've changed the roles around so much that it is little to no room to advance."
bad,changing the schedule without notice..... horrible communication skills...... no one was willing to meet me half way with the work left for the over night shift.... I worked hard for low pay & short days
bad,"Always under staffed, My schedule changed daily and there was no support from management. Co-workers and shift leads worked together well. Trained new employees on register."
bad,I was interning at Walgreens for my Pharm Tech certificate and nobody wanted to help me out they wanted to welcome someone who was willing to jump right in when I had never been in a retail environment so I did not know how things were ran.
bad,i worked full time 40hr a week. i learned how to work photo and resetting the store around. i also gain and my customer service skills. I also helped out in Pharmacy and in doing manager work. my co-workers was my co-worker I aslo learned a lot from them. The hard part was moving the sholves around and the most enjoyable part was our customers.
bad,I was promised opportunities at walgreens but more people kept being hired to take over the position I desired. Because of that I'm seeking different employment with more pay included
bad,"Great development for management structure, however, not very supportive or welcoming for new employees. Rotating work schedule and poor wages makes for poor work life balance. Continuous work flow makes for poor training environment. Good job for students are those new to work force."
bad,"The managers stayed in the office talking all day, the associates all had nasty attitudes, not enough people on the sales floor, open 24 hours so there was always a wide variety of customers. It was a great place to start so you know the worst of the worse and it helped me understand that I wanted a lot better from my next growing experience."
bad,"patient cursing you out, throwing prescriptions at you, fake rx's, no security to help you. It's a scary environment to work in, when you have patient with fake prescriptions, demanding you to fill them."
bad,Been with the company 5 years with hopes that things will improves and nothing yet. Management is careless and those on the lower end suffer for all that managers are expected to get done but don't. Open regular hours even on Christmas!
bad,"The Walgreen company is not what it used to be.  Now it is owned by foreigners, Billionaire Italian who has been known to remove benefits and bonuses from managers.  My experience with the Walgreen company has been great but the company is changing."
bad,In this pharmacy business i learned part of the experience on pharmacy and insurance and interacted with a lot of professional peoples
bad,"Walgreens needs to be more about there employees as they are about the customers. They also need better management, they need to be on the same page with each other and recognize there employees when they are doing a good job. Fairness needs to be brought to attention there. They play favorites with people they like or with people that's been there longer. The pay is way less for the work load given."
bad,It was definitely an amazing opportunity to gain the management experience that I did. The management that I worked with wasn't necessarily professional in the aspect where it cultivated in some of my fellow coworkers (management) questioning my character from calling in sick for one shift. I don't want to be associated with a company that allows that type of behavior.
bad,"The job is mainly managing money, training/supervising/leading employees, and completing a number of tasks. I feel as though the recent changes the company has made have not been for the better of their employees. Store level management has been restricted, overworked, and underpaid for their impossible workload. Which has resulted in a negative work environment with poor structure, making it difficult to not only enjoy my job, but do it efficiently."
bad,"The management was horrible, they didn't know how to talk, treat, nor respect the employees. I fought a good fight, until I was forced to submit my two weeks notice."
bad,"A lot of turn over due to management. Shady things go on their that are probably illegal to do to your employees, but get away with it anyways. Co-workers and the people you meet their is the best part. Never try to stand up for yourself what is right or wrong. Advancement only happens if management likes you and you keep your head down. Gained a lot of great experience. Would never want to work their again. I wouldn't shop at Walgreen's, the only time I do is to visit my co-workers and to get prescriptions. Love the pharmacy staff! They overwork and understaffed the pharmacy all the time, but if they had the right tools they would be the best!"
bad,Walgreens is so focused on making money that they cut technician hours constantly and expect the same amount of work to be done with less people.  Every month they cut hours lower and lower.
bad,Management is incompetent. Management does not discipline employees who do not pull their own weight. Favoritism is rampant.
bad,"They don't care about their employees & their health. All they care about is their numbers. They don't commend you on your efforts done well, only to put you down when things are incomplete or don't have enough help or time to complete tasks. Third shift (24hr stores) - there is no overnight security, even in the worst of neighborhoods. It's just 1 shiftlead & 1 cashier. Not safe at all."
bad,Pharmacists are great but the full time technicians who have worked there for 7+ years tend to scapegoat on the newer technicians.
bad,"I worked as a Beauty Advisor. I don't mind the whole pushing featured product sales thing, but when some of the floor managers, who haven't even worked in my position, accuse me of not trying to push sales because I didn't meet the sales goal, it didn't make me feel like a very valued employee. These managers were hardly even out on the floor to see me do my job, and they kind of just assumed through the numbers that I wasn't pushing sales as hard as I could. In reality, our customer base was mostly old women that were stuck in their ways about what brand and color of lipstick they wanted to buy and didn't give two figs about the latest and greatest product. I was great at recommending and explaining different products to customers. I kept my area clean, my shelves straightened. Almost all of the customers that came by my area loved talking to me about makeup and skincare. But in the end, I was just nitpicked at about how much of a featured product I couldn't sell."
bad,was always running out of sale items stock was not rotated when the truck came in and stuff was put out on the shelves the old stuff was shoved to the back of the shelf and the new was place in the from which ment more things being on the shelf past expire date.
bad,"Decent job, great pay, hours can be very overwhelming especially with the overtime because you never know when your shift is going to end. Lots of overtime, it's great if you don't have children!"
bad,"a typical day would consist of changing the advertisement prices and products, change full priced items to sale price or clearance prices, during the holidays we set up lots of displays"
bad,Going to work is fun for the most part because my co-workers are like a second family but the company is lacking in some areas and could use improvements. For one the pay is not very good at all and moving up in the company doesn't really happen. Hours are not that great either.
bad,"My first review was very honest, a little too honest. This one will just lightly touch on the fact that this wouldn't be some where I would recommend to a friend. That is all. I am looking for a new job to replace this one for many reasons that I will not be listing here."
bad,"Typical days at work was always signing onto the computer and check e-mails to be sure if there was anything corporate may need either finished immeidately, or if there was any signs, resets, or ordering that had to be done for upcoming promotions.  It was fast paced atmosphere but that is what kept me learning.  It was a lot of fun especially when we had a big project that needed to be done; watching my co-workers grow as well as enjoying the projects take off.  Yes, there was a time that things went a little crazy but that is when you step back and re-group......after you see what went wrong you fix it and continue where you left off."
bad,"Enjoyable part of job meeting customers needs, be able to work cooperatively with other coworkers, must to be able to deal with customer needs and be a team player."
bad,Easy store to work at not much demand as far as work goes. The management doesn't work very hard and you will probably never advance or get raises. Short hours and low pay. good as a part time job when you wanna just kill time.
bad,"Walgreens has great goals. The problem is that they try to achieve too many goals with too few people in order to save money. There are no provisions for emergency call-ins. The job is much too stressful for the amount of pay. In order to provide excellent, caring customer service we had to sacrifice certain goals in our shifts, for which we could get written up on. There was no real way to track that we were not slacking in our job but were instead putting customers first, not ourselves and not the company."
bad,"As long as you enter prescriptions very fast and to their production, you will do great at this job. If you want to move up to a different positions there are really no other options. Everything is ran from Top to down. So no real changes or ideas will be considered unless Corporate comes up with."
bad,"there were many things i was told would happen during my hiring that made me want to work here, they were all lies. walgreens is a horrible place to work, they move you from store to store, the hours are horrible and the managers are horrible"
bad,I love the customers I dealt with but the management was awful. Changing availability is a nightmare for college students.
bad,"The managers did not stand up for the employees, they only cared about the rules. I do not approve of this. Once I refused to sell several packs of cigarettes to a clearly pregnant woman. Instead of being supported, I got written up. Had horrible hours and worse pay."
bad,"Company has changed since changed CEO'S. Work life very hostile, compensation does not match work load. a lot of politics which does not leave much room for growth."
bad,"My day consists of making sure the work flow for the Pharmacists is seemless in the transition of patients discharging from the hospital to home. Checking on all admissions and readmissions with hospital case managers and liasons, preparing charts and supplies, authorizing those supplies with insurance companies and communicatng with the liason and patient the accurate information needed for any financial obligation they may have. In many cases finding nursing agencies to provide the care for patients is the biggest struggle as there are many restrictions prior to any agency accepting a patient. Co-workers are enjoyable and offer their expertise when needed."
bad,"The manager is horrible and no matter how many times you complain on her, she will always have her job. Walgreens does not take care of the good employees. the ones that want to be with the company."
bad,Worked there for years and no advancements were offered to me. The pay was terrible. Will never invest so much of my life or time into a company that care nothing about me.
bad,"I was able to tolerate working here only because I needed a way to help support my family. A typical day at work would be a very busy evening following into the night. I learned a lot about customer service on my own working here. The management was terrible. Managers were rude and didn't know how to properly teach employees. The hardest part of the job was having to do other people's task and my own, and still be expected to finish all, because managers didn't know how to stay on top of their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping costumers. They are the reason I enjoyed working."
bad,"This company is currently in a state of major management change. "
bad,As an Assistant manager you are over worked and not really valued for your work. But i stuck it out for the experience. Wouldn't really recommend Walgreen just because of the culture and core values of the Company.
bad,"The job is like any other retail job. The pay is too low to make a living and hours are not that great. The schedule is random and every week it changes it is never constant so you can never plan anything ahead. "
bad,"This is the place where I learned my voice didn't matter as long as I made the company another dollar. No holidays off, no short holiday hours. I learned to expect a phone call on my days off asking me to come in. No room for advancement unless I wanted to sell my soul and go into management - which doesn't pay much more than floor positions. Waste of time."
bad,"great but could be better, doesn't seem like you can advance much. not very good to their employees. doesn't pay as well. unorganized and"
bad,"The work load is too slow. Managers can give me a list of things to do such as light cleaning, facing, checking out dates, and doing resets, and I will have that all done a couple hours before my shift ends. Some of my co-workers never made me feel like I was not accepted by them and I felt like an outcast. The hardest part of my job  was to keep myself busy."
bad,Big company but not run well.  Many different levels of management.  Unclear what managers are responsible for training and development.
bad,"it was a very good company but I was in a bad location, too much favoritism and hostility, and no room for advancement, no team work done."
bad,"A typical day at the walgreens I worked at, depended on what shift. it was usually busy on a typical day, lots of ringing at the cash registers and stocking when necessary. I learned how to do smart counts, resets and scan outs. I did not have a great time with the management. I had no respect for my beliefs or respect towards me just as a fellow co worker. I got along with all the floor employees except for the management, that was the hardest part of the job besides the occasional rude customer. I enjoyed when I could make any of my customers smile as well as my coworkers"
bad,The company does not care about their employees. They cut your pay then freeze your pay after 15 years of service to thousands of employees and says there is the door if you don't like it.The insurance is not affordable to employees at the rate of pay given.The payroll of hours is so low the stores can't function properly.Long lines at the pharmacy and bad service.When will the customers wake up and go some where else.They have many hard working employees that don't realize there are better companies to work at.
bad,"Lack of staff, pulled in different directions continuously by different directives from different levels of the company, lack of clear policy, as management transferred to different stores more than 10 times in 3 years which doesn't let you get accustomed to anything.  Continuously cutting staff but asking everyone to do more at the same time.  Some co-workers were decent but negative attitudes are prevalent and drains moral.  Don't expect advancement opportunities as many that used to exist are now gone.  Compared to when I started with the company I would not recommend anyone to this company unless major changes are made."
bad,"Typical day is fast paced and hostile at times on a regular basis. The same every day like ground hog day."
bad,"company demands more and more but pays less and less, typical day at work is stressful, i learned a lot about management, management is so-so, co workers are the only thing wonderful"
bad,It used to be a decent place to work lately with all the changes and the way they let some managers treat employees its a little ridiculous
bad,"I am sure if it is company wide or not, but the location I was working at was very ugly. Management was just looking out for themselves and they were very quick to throw you under the bus. On top of all that, each department head were always blaming each other for any mistake. They are also very clickly. If you were not part of the group forget, you were on your own."
bad,"The Walgreens Corporate Company is nowhere I'd come to work if you're not interested in giving up your work/life balance. I am no stranger to hard work and dedication. I believe that there are times when going beyond the job requirements is necessary. However, this company gives a new definintion to the words ""overtime"" and ""workload"". If you are working for Walgreens Corporate in the field and manage a region of stores or even manage one store location, expect a typical day at work to be full of distractions. So be prepared to multi-task. Also, be prepared for the unplanned changes in the day to add hours onto your workload for the day/week. You may find that you will have to work on weekends and sacrafice doing normal personal activities such as excercise or preparing your own meals. Simply because you no longer have the time. "
bad,"Not the company it used to be."
bad,"Typical Day At Work:"
bad,Walgreens claims to care about their customers and employess but can not deliver. The customer is not always right and the employees are worked to death.
bad,"For a company that says they value family, they are open on every major holiday, which makes it impossible for one to enjoy their holidays when they have to travel to be with family because based on my experience you have to work either Christmas or Christmas Eve, and in regards to all the other major holidays it remains the same policy."
bad,"Once you get to work you have daily paper work. Then you have money tills to close and count. You then deposit all the money from the tills that you pulled. You then put all the deposits into the system. After all the deposits have been finished you then start restocking everything that needs to be restocked. After the restocking its time to start what's called facing the store. what that means is you pull everything from the back of the shelf's to the front and make it all look nice and neat. After all aisle are complete its time to start cleaning you sweep, mop clean the restrooms, spray off the sidewalks, take out the trash, ands clean the windows. Finally after that you start unloading the truck belt which is the belt that the delivery trucks unload onto. What you do is take everything out of the boxes and put them on the stockroom shelf's. All this plus letting your cashier take a 30 minute break, while you run the front register, helping customers find things or take care of any problems they have. Also helping pharmacy when needed. Printing photos and fixing errors or problems with the equipment. I learned a lot from this job I learned what all goes into running a store and all the little things needed in it running properly. I also learned how to manage money. I managed other employs. The hardest part of the job was all the things that I had to complete in the 10 hours that I had to complete it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and people that I had the privilege to meet and help on a regular basis."
bad,working at walgreens was horrible at the end. They are unfair to their employess.
bad,Walgreens used to be a company that made you feel that they really cared about you and your well-being all most family oriented.  Now its really a corporate America company.  Its a numbers only game.  The company only cares about making money and not the health and well-being of its customers or employees.  They have some of the worst managers thay I have ever worked for and with but they refuse to do anything about them because they produce good numbers.  Hello... they dont produce the numbers the grunts do but I myself (a grunt) am not going to make myself look bad to make the manager look bad in the process.
bad,Retail is not for everyone. Management is very poor in my experience. They have no real management experience. You tell me if there is something wrong with the company celebrating a cashier's 30 year as a .... CASHIER!!! Not promoted once for these poor people and after 30 years they still earn less than the management who are sometimes fresh out of college. Who knows more the college grad or the 30-year veteran employee.
bad,"Good pharmacy and retail experience, but company continues to downsize and make unrealistic demands on associates. Does not offer the needed support for success"
bad,Filling prescription and ringing customers up daily and maintaining pharmacy operations.Insurances are not always easy to deal with. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping people by filling their meds in a timely manner. I reported directly to the pharmacy manager and dealth with her instead of the store manager.
bad,"Doesn't pay well, Co workers are good people. Most enjoyable part, helping people."
bad,"A typical day at work you come in, get yelled at by customers for 10 hrs straight sometimes 11 hours.  Management doesnt care if youre ill or not .  They dont recognize when youre doing a great job.  Ive worked for walgreens store and walgreens cpo.  Cpo is horrible.  The store is great.  Feels like a team in the store enviornment. Management doesn't know what they are doing.  Sometimes you have to explain to them what needs to be done.   My co-workers are great.  We as a team keep each other level headed.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with unorganized management.  The most enjoyable part of the job is lunch with co workers."
bad,"Worked for the company for 11 years, then let go (while they were restructuring) under false pretenses and had to fight for unemployment. Your shifts will be from the crack of dawn or til you're burning the midnight oil. It takes a decade to get promoted, and raises are 7 cents a year. The managers are generally pretty cool, but mainly because they feel bad for everyone who works there. The pharmacy is dysfunctional at best. If you enjoy being over worked and constantly understaffed with little to no appreciation, you'll love it. "
bad,"i worked for the company starting with overnights & ending with regular evenings. i applied most of my gained knowledge from previous combined work experiences as a regularly seasonal employee from various companies (most whom do not exist anymore) & for the most part enjoyed completing my tasks which were routine in nature. i'm a no nonsense kind of person & enjoy my job when duties can be completed & i can head home relatively problem free, most complications & difficulties came from the people unfortunately & that's when the job became unpleasant or unproductive. this was exacerbated by poor leadership & low company moral (in the form of payroll reductions & monetary fueled demotions) which inevitably resulted in grind like work weeks which are unnecessary in that line of work that can & has run like a smooth machine when everyone completes their duties, takes personal responsibility when they don't & understand team effort is helping each other so the job can be a better experience."
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of stocking shelves and working on the register as a cashier. I learned that it is better not to try to converse with management about ongoing problems that i was having, because it only made things worse. My co-workers were not very friendly, and i was miserable there. The hardest part of the job was never getting days off that i requested a month ahead of time."
bad,company is not ideal for anyone looking to advance/ no personal care for other employees/ does not allow you take vacation days earned
bad,A typical day at work for me is always expecting the unexpected.
bad,"This is the only job that I have disliked from the get go. They will not promote unless you have been with them for a year, regardless of how well you are doing. I have never worked for a company that does not base promotions on merit. There is no training. I have been ""winging"" it for over a year. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am clocking out to go home. My co-workers, seem to be out for themselves. There is no team. The corporate customer satisfaction rate is 60 percent. That is horrific. Not to mention embarrassing. Every time I go to my Dr. or the emergency room, I am told how awful the service is in our pharmacy. I don't work in the pharmacy, but I cannot argue. I have witnessed it first hand. Any one out there have a management job for a customer service professional who takes pride in her work and that you can count on to do a great job?? I have never not enjoyed my job. I need to find something else because I feel that if you can't put 110 percent into your work, you don't need to be there. I will continue to give my all because that is what I do. I just don't want to give my all to a corporation who doesn't appreciate it. My 110 percent will not make up for their customer satisfaction rate."
bad,"Typical work day at Walgreens was very busy. The tasks that needed to get done are based on your position, but I can assure you no matter what your position it was a busy work day."
bad,"I worked for the company for almost 8 yrs and on numerous occasions felt as though I was asked to make Walgreens more important than my family. Even after working for the company for so many years people who were hired after me were given better hours and better pay. On numerous occasions I was made to stay past my scheduled time to clean the store or sit in the office to ""watch managers count the safe"" when others were allowed to leave. I also had people came in after I did and got nights and weekends off and when I asked for that same schedule I was told it wouldn't be fair to others if I was given special treatment. All in all it was ok place to work as long as you had a decent manager but the assistant managers moved around a lot and were given the same power as the store managers and some of them let it go to their heads."
bad,Walgreens is not a job to seek a career. It is a job that help benefit an individual at the current moment. There isn't any advancement within the company and the compensation is horrible.
bad,"Walgreens was the most horrible first job experiences ever. I would never recommend it to anyone. Managers were extremely rude and disrespectful, they throw a lot of work at you for not so much pay. They take advantage of your skills and all the workers lazy. Hours are being cut and it's really not recommended to work at."
bad,Co-workers and management is changing maybe not for the better.
bad,"I have to be to work at 8:00 a.m. I clock in and open the door's. I straighten up the carts and put the newspapers in there proper places. I then log on to my register, which is computerized. I no sooner do this than I already have about 3 customers. I greet them with a ""good morning"" and ask them my routine questions. In between customers I stock the cigarettes,the candy,and anything else in the front of the store. I clean around the registers, sweep,and water the plant's if we have any in the store."
bad,"A typical day at Walgreens is pretty pleasant. Some of the things I have learned is inputing insurance claims, learning about new medications, different codes for insurance, & inventory just to name a few things. Walgreens is taking away most management positions nationwide to cut down on cost. The co-workers are all fun & outgoing. One of the most challenging things about the job is to try and help customers get their medication when their insurance has expired. One of the most exciting about the job is knowing that you helped someone and they leave with a smile."
bad,"I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with, but there were many overhead issues. I worked overnight as a cashier and stock person, and I loved my schedule. But there were issues with management stealing time, and short changing employees behind their backs. As nice of a company it was to work for, if the overhead and management invested more thought into their personal actions things would have came out much better for all involved."
bad,"Each day, I would work hard. I would come to work as scheduled. Others would not do there job the way I did, but i still worked hard."
bad,"I learned a great deal of customer service, Typical day at work the phones ringing, customer screaming at the drive-through and a long line inside the store while the fax is also ringing"
bad,I worked there during my college years and it was okay! I wish that I could work there part-time now just for extra money!!!
bad,Job was an okay place to work at...people minded everyone elses business and a lot of back stabbing going on.
bad,"I absolutly loved working with the different types of customers on a daily basis, from as young as 2-3 years old to as old as 60+. It gave me the chance to build my personality skills as well as my very compasionate attitude which is what my customers really appericiated the most. The hardest part of my job is when my customers had issues that I could not in any way shape or form correct. My most enjoyable moments I must say is when my customers left very happy and pleased, or entered the store & they were very happy to see me."
bad,"This company talks the talk, but doesn't walk the walk. Ever since they split with ESI (Express Scripts), job security is out of the window and caring about the employees went as well. In some departments they set unrealistic goals for the employees and all they care about is money. Stores and pharmacies experienced and are experiencing many cuts in hours and pay cuts, but the big executives get million dollar bonuses? Not okay with me."
bad,"Very high stress work environment, with little time to help customers and develop employees."
bad,"Company in my opinion is on a crash coarse with catastrophy. Cuts hour all the time leaving a skeleton crew and expects (---------------------------------------------------------) amount of work from a really really crew of people worried if they can pay their bills getting hours cut on min wage. Unfair to employees and management. VERY unfair scheduling, you aren't in charge of your life, management is."
bad,"I was terminated because i gave them false information about myself during an investigation. I was using the bathroom (i have IBS) and the couldn't find me and when i wrote my statement that's where i told them i was and then they said they couldn't find me on the camera and they told me that i gave them FALSE INFORMATION DURING AN INVESTIGATION AND THAT IS GROUNDS FOR IMMEDIATE TERMINATION!!! I asked to see the video and they told me i needed a court order. So I am battling that now, and getting nowhere."
bad,"As a store manager, I put in 70 hrs/wk between work and commute."
bad,"When I started working over four years ago, it was known I wanted a full-time position though at the time there was only part-time positions. I was assured full-time would come. Instead at present, I am not scheduled at all as they keep cutting hours. I was not permitted to perform duties for which I trained as I was deemed ""too slow"" though I was just beginning."
bad,"When I first started working for the company, they were better. After a year or so they started changing the whole company. New managers were being sent religiously. Seniority was not honored anymore. The company's morals were lost. I would work Friday close shift, Saturday close shift, and Sunday open and 2 closes during the week. My manager would only schedule me to put sales tags up on the weekend for the entire store. I had no life. When I confronted my new manager my requests were ignored. I am a student. I need time for school. Furthermore, before the new semester started, my manager called corporate in and accused me of everything imaginable. Horrible company to become involved with."
bad,"Company acquired my location. I was unfairly forced out "
bad,Best part was helping customers who are regulars and my team members who made the job a little easier. worst part of the job pretty much everything except the good things i said in this review.
bad,"I have been working here a few weeks. Started out in the pharmacy with absolutely no training and very little help from coworkers. Asked to be moved to sales and still barely received any training. I'm often told one thing by my coworkers and another by my managers, solidifying the fact that management and training are scarce. The people in the leadership roles are rude and often ignore my calls for assistancd."
bad,"The overall Walgreens mindset has changed."
bad,"All though most of the fellow employees were very friends and easy to get along with, the management is absolutely terrible.. they don't support thier employees nor help them learn when they need taught"
bad,I worked at a 24 hour store and when I say it's busy that's an understatement. The good news is the day goes by fast. The bad news is it's extremely stressful since you have people coming at you expecting things to be ready in an unreasonable amount of time. So you take a lot of grief from customers in addition to all the other job duties. Also it's hard to advance to a senior position and the pay isn't great.
bad,"Great location if you don’t live far from Main Street,very convenient .Close to mini mart and Brazilian food cafe. The gas station has decent coffee if you need some caffeine to get through the day."
bad,The Pharmacy Managers are great however there is one pharmacist who bullies new employees and apparently several people have quit because of him. HR and Personal Relations don't care if employees are being bullied. Wouldn't recommend this place if you are new to the company.
bad,"I have been working for the company for 8 years and I only make $16 an hour, so that should tell you everything you need to know there. "
bad,"Walgreen's as a company Values it's profit over it's employees. As a shift lead / manager, you'll encounter unreasonable deadlines for projects that you'll be unable to complete by said time. You'll be running to and from registers to handle customers and cashier errors, while still having to get the store completely up to speed by the end of the night. This company is and should be a hard pass for anyone who values their home life over work due to the amount of problems it will cause while working there."
bad,"When I started working at Walgreens everything was great! After 3 years we ended up with a pharmacy manager that was absolutely amazing! After 5 years, he left. From that point on, day after day, working there seemed less than satisfying  and company metrics became impossible to meet."
bad,"I worked within the pharmacy for 3 years, I also made myself open to  work shifts in the front end of the store. It was a complete night mare. The staff in the pharmacy never made me feel comfortable. I was never given the opportunity to complete my pharmacy tech certification ( which should have taken 6 months to complete). The head tech was always allowed to do things their way! I am now enrolled in school to get my certification.The pharmacy has no real manger. I had gotten my flu shot here for the last 3 years but I didn't receive the call this year to get my flu shot. Don't know if that was a personal thing cause i have insurance to bill.My father was also talked into getting his shingles shot ( he needed the shot because of his age) But no one every called him back to get the second dose. He has insurance that could be billed also. He received his first dose bout 1 1/2 ago. Surely Walgreen's has had plenty of shipment of the vaccine. Can't say that i enjoyed working with this company!!!"
bad,"After years of employment the company changed.  Slashed pay, bonuses, and store support.  Over worked and unappreciated  major opportunity why do you think stock sucks now ."
bad,"LATELY HERE IT SUCKS WITH MANAGEMENT, Too many managers have favorites. there isnt enough days given for sick days, 5 days is very little. I think if your going to be very strict about uniforms then you should provide them and that doesnt mean just the shirt, it should include shoes and pants too. I also think that most drinks if bottled or sealed should be allowed to drink such as tea, coffee, sports drinks or soda and jot just water."
bad,"When I first began Walgreens had very flexible hours and seemed to be committed to both its staff and customers. However, in recent years  Walgreens has been trending down in both its commitment to its customers and employee's in recent years."
bad,"lots of management issues"
bad,"Fast paced job depending on location. Pay is great starting off but once you reach a certain level, raises are less than 5% anually. Occasionally they'll say salary is capped to justify smallraises."
bad,"Poorly managed, underpaid, and not a flexible schedule. Hard for someone with a family to work around scheduling or any sort of time off. Worked at several different locations and all the same"
bad,Ever since the walgreens boots alliance merger the culture changed. We lost all of our core company values. The employees are put last and its evident
bad,"I wouldnt recommend the store that I worked for to anyone.  I started on as a full time employee, and this only lasted two months. They cut my hours drastically because of not being able to change my availability for them.They play favoritism, and they do not help you to learn or advance your knowledge there.  I learned mostly everything I know at my prior pharmacy job, and the employees talk down to you degradingly.  Do not come here looking for something better than what you have currently because they will not aid you in any way. This company hindered my growth as a certified technician."
bad,Extremely fast paced and very stressful. Not really any room to grow from pharmacy tech unless you go to college for a pharmacist position. Even the senior techs (who have been hard workers there for years) were only making a few dollars more than I was as a trainee.
bad,"job was extremely easy with the same day to day tasks, i would have stayed long term but the managers did not make work easy. when i applied they advertised a full time position but after the interview i was only given a part time shift. the manager played favoritism with the hours. some weeks i was only given 10 hrs when other part timers were given full time hrs monday though friday. ultimately i left for a full time shift."
bad,"Hard to get promoted, all depends if your manager or DM likes you. low pay for all stuff you have to do as a shif lead. To much retail drama. Always short staffed because of the very low budgets"
bad,"Management makes this job unbearable, you are not trusted to do any task without management questioning you constantly and just breathing down your neck the whole shift. If you wanna feel like walking on eggshells all day then come on over to Walgreens! Its where stress lives and management walks on the backs of the workers without doing any work themselves. Come on down! We got sales every Weekend folks! Ill be here all day! Gotta love the smell of the Photo Kiosk in the morning!"
bad,The company has changed tremendously overly the past 5 years alone.   Accountability is high and the reward for achieving success is minimal. No work life balance.
bad,"You are working in a very fast pace setting. After I got hired I realized how an organized everything was, I’ve been working here for over two weeks and nobody’s told me about benefits or talk to me about PTO or absences or late policies. Manager isn’t friendly. I’m very disappointed in working here. Nobody has any answers to any of my questions regarding Walgreens as a whole. I don’t recommend this workplace"
bad,"$12/hr not enough to wake up in the middle of the night to worry about a mistake you may have made during the  day."
bad,Its not a good place to work. Poor management and favoritism going on... racist and less hours .. so many shoplifters and stupid team members who smoke in parking lot and do nothing and management does not care at all.
bad,"Worked at Walgreens initially part time. I was offered the part time job w/ a gurantee to enter the Assistant Manager Training Class the following spring. Unfortunately, when Spring came around I was told bc I worked for the company less than a year and hadnt received an evaluation that I'd have to wait. Work for basically 17 months w/ the company and each time was never offered the class although having scored well on every evaluation and having  impeccable attedance and rapport w/ my employees and customers. The pay isnt worth the workload and stress of being in management. Having to work every holiday and not allowed more than 40 hours a week isnt my cup of tea. Its a great job for a college kid needing extra bucks but not for anyone trying to provide for a family."
bad,The Walgreens that I worked at was managed very poorly. Nobody really did their work except for me and there was not really anyone that would account for that. The starting pay is almost embarrassing and is not worth the work that some people actually do there.
bad,More is expected and no compensation was given.  When you work hard all the responsibility lays on you and nothing more is expected by others.  Always work holidays too.
bad,Walgreens as a company is great however the store manager showed favoritism. Wasn’t fair to people who had been there for years. Threaten people their jobs don’t work with people schedules. The biggest problem is showing favoritism towards the people she liked the most.
bad,This company took all the power away from it's managers they dictate everything you do not the same company it was many years ago Charles Walgreen would be turning over in his grave.
bad,Workplace culture prioritizes efficiency but at what expense? Management lacks positive feedback making it hard to feel appreciated. Typical corporate setting.
bad,Gave 10 years of my life to this place. I will never do it again for any company. Team would hear rumors from other regions and/or via online forums. When they would present concerns or confirmation or denial of rumors to district leadership they were given robotic responses that did not answer the questions. Hence communication is extremely poor. Be open and honest with you team! Rite Aid acquisition went horribly with little support from corporate and horrible labor budget. Training is poor - Training and Development needs major work at Walgreens. Turn over is high! Wish I would have left sooner.
bad,"It's not what you know, it's who you know. It's not whom works the hardest, it's who kisses the most (__|__).. they are completely unprofessional and completely biased towards Latinos."
bad,"You will be required to work EXTREMELY HARD, for minimum wage only, and if you are lucky, you might be able to receive a 25 cent raise PER YEAR. This is given to everyone, regardless of their performance. You would be better off working for a fast food company for the same wage."
bad,The stores are neatly organized and veryclean as a customer.As an employee I’m not happy at how bad the training is. They work you thru your breaks and thru your lunch. The pay is not acceptable either.Need to work on better management and better training
bad,"If you are in a ""leadership"" position there is zero schedule flexibility, corporate sees all employees as a number instead of humans, and pay is HORRIBLE. I had to fight tooth and nail with dozens of documents and references to get a 25 cent raise. Walgreens argues that their benefits program makes up for the poor wages instead of paying a living wage."
bad,"Below average company that is going in the wrong direction . They have ni structure,  no organization whatsoever. I believe retail in general is going to take  big hit"
bad,"They need one more Walgreens in Opelousas because its too busy to breath in there. I worked in the pharmacy where a typical day cld fill up to 1,000 scripts and normal pharmacies fill 250 on a busy day."
bad,Started as a family oriented company but things have deteriorated in the past years. Workers are not happy and under staffing is a huge problem thus goals are impossible to meet. Upper echelon of management do a very poor job at recognizing the needs of individual stores.
bad,"Walgreens was a high school job for me, and they disrespected me by scheduling me when I had told them ahead of time that I could not work. They also have some terrible management and other employee attitude problems."
bad,"I started with Walgreen's when clients and employees were highly esteemed. I was released during recovery for major surgery. The culture of the Company began to change several years ago when the focus became numbers and not service. The nature of Patient care requires time, attention and CARE."
bad,Walgreen's was convenient for me because I lived nearby. Management did what the were required to do; but very little else. I experienced a lot of favoritism. The CSRs rarely smile. It looks like a very stressful place for them. Walgreen's seems short-staffed most of the time.
bad,In the beginning you are supposed to be given 2 weeks to complete training. They threw me in and management got mad at me for not completing it till 1 yr in when they don’t give you the time to complete it. They have cut my hrs to 10 hrs max a week and when we have no hrs they hired 2 new people. I’ve been in almost a yr and a half in pharmacy and no job advancement opportunities. I was laughed at in the beginning for not knowing how to transfer a patient when I had never done the training for it. If you ask for help you don’t get any or you get eye rolls and sighs.
bad,"Walgreens is in the midst of a lot of change, particularly in marketing. The digital team has had over a dozen key people in leadership leave in the last 10 months.  These roles have not been backfilled, instead they insist on having the teams assume more responsibility without an increase in title or pay.  The are doing nothing to address the issue.  I attended two going away happy hours last week... and have another next week.  People are dropping like flies. It's an epidemic.  It's nearly impossible to get anything done because resources don't exist and processes were established in the 1900's.  They don't care about people, it's all about the numbers. Several people in marketing leadership (including the CMO) are ex consultants. The culture reflects this.  At no point do you feel like you have job security and if you don't have a Harvard MBA don't even think about trying to make it to a Director level.  If you're looking to work at a company where you can make an impact, Walgreens is not for you."
bad,"Poor management, no work/life balance, pay isn’t good, they cut store hours/bonuses/raises often. They care more about their bottom dollar then they do their employees."
bad,Part of the team was racist and the other half just didn’t care moral of the company is not the same as what’s promoted day to day work would be nice if some one wasn’t eating your back up
bad,"I was told that after one month my hourly wage would go up by $1.50 an hour. Did not happen! My hours went below 10 hours a week because I did not make it into work on 2 snow days. I live in the hills 12 miles away on country roads and did not have a 4 wheel drive. We had 14 inches of snow. That payday I got nothing. I really wish that Walgreens corporate would look into the store I was at. Employee turnover was crazy. I saw and heard about this store after I started. Also, quite a few people changed their pharmacy of choice to Bartells."
bad,"Mt.Vernon did not practice and could not practice most of the principles of this organization during my short experience there. Ineffective leadership that talked about a lot of problems but didn't fix many of them, including basic employee engagement and ownership concerns. Poor performance is condoned and accepted."
bad,"My hardest part of the job is being able to do my job. I am asked to do specific jobs while contradicted as in answering multiple phone calls while dealing with many patients in drive thru and in store patients, with very little help."
bad,"Walgeeens overall isnt bad. My most recent experience however was horrible. Terrible management makes a huge difference. If u find a manager that wants to teach and educate the staff then stay. If not, run. They will speak to u as if u know nothing."
bad,"If you enjoy a culture where hard work us repaid with gossip and backstabbing, this is the place for you. Corporate has set up great guidelines but local supervisors take gossip as gospel and promote those who spread it. If you aren't willing to lie about coworkers you won't get far. Hostile work environment is the only way to describe the atmosphere with this company."
bad,Local District Management is understanding and usually get the challenges stores are facing. The problem is the people above them don't get it and/or don't care. The efforts put in by field employees are not recognized by corporate people.
bad,"After the Alliance Boots takeover, the corporate culture has shifted from one where employees were treated as assets but are now treated as liabilities.  It's run like a middle school but the bullies run the place, the most inept and blindly obedient are promoted, the most hard-working and skilled are steered toward mediocrity or are forced out, favoritism is rampant, promotion from within is now a rarity, nepotism is now the method of bring management form outside the company, upper management sees great people as threats, and retaliation is their remedy for anyone expressing opinions or trying to address issues within the DC. "
bad,"Throughout my experience at Walgreens, I had both positive and negative encounters with coworkers and management. The reason I left was because they were unwilling to work with my school schedule. I was expected to prioritize my position as a CSA. Other coworkers had experienced such disrespect, and to make matters worse, management consistently rejected scheduling requests-even after review."
bad,Use to be a great company to work for. There has been many changes and none that benefit the employees. Long hours and new management that do not listen to senior employees. Lots of turn over.
bad,"Walgreens tries to slide by on paying as little as possible to staff their stores. The hours are so badly cut there, that most of the time the work of 4 people is left to 2. Upper Management has been instructed to give customers what they want in all things, and will always side with the customer, even against company policy. Also, there's no retirement, very few employee benefits, and they make sure you can only use your sick days *after* you use up your vacation hours to make up for the time you missed."
bad,Since Boots took over they have been on a witch hunt to get senior managers to leave so they can pay much less.  The hours have gotten longer and longer and pretty much if your customer surveys are not above 75% satisfaction;  your job is on the line.
bad,"A company that lacks integrity.  Company would like to say that customer service and care are their number one priority. But in most stores, when it comes down to it this is the last thing that is Encouraged."
bad,"The hours allowed for each store per month are cut a lot. Depending on the store you go to and the amount of full time employees, part time employees tend to get the short end of the stick for hours. When you first start off, you're almost guaranteed to only be on the register."
bad,The company speaks about being on the corner of happy and healthy but they do a poor job of taking care of their store leadership and providing time to coach and train their employees.
bad,"A typical day at Walgreens meant being in a fast paced environment with little or no time for unexpected delays. Management would access staff on a daily basis. Pharmacists should go above and beyond patient expectation at all times with little expectation or consideration for themselves. This environment taught excellent customer service skills and selflessness, with a workload beyond staff capability."
bad,You should not work there unless you are very good at multi-tasking. It is a difficult work environment. Some store managers have no idea what it is like to be a pharmacist.
bad,"Working at Walgreens involved working with customers which most of the time was enjoyable.  Standing, squatting and lifting for 8 hours at a time was difficult.  Management depended on which floor supervisor or manager was on duty.  I learned patience.  I usually worked the front register, but sometimes would help unload trucks and put stock on shelves."
bad,"Retail pharmacy is extremely competitive and Walgreens has taken it to the extreme, though they need to focus more on their technology. They use a very outdated system that oftentimes is confusing."
bad,"It's an ok job, but nothing to write home about. The coworkers are ok but they are very unwilling to take shifts you can't work but expect you to take theirs. They are very difficult about scheduling you around things you might be doing."
bad,Not what it used to be but great starter for a pharmacy career with lots of benefits. Work day can get very stressful depending on where you are located and population density. High technician turnover rates. Strives to create a team atmosphere however it is usually not the case.
bad,When I first started out it was great. Flexible hours and no managers constantly yelling to meet quotas. Then the micromanaging started happening. Constant how many flu shots are we at making us harass customers for shots. Ridiculous
bad,Walgreens was a stressful job regarding the management and all the work they expect for little pay. The manager of walgreens at the location i worked at gave me a problem with a step ladder said i broke it because it was leaning on one leg and that I was the only person who used it last which was false a big gal with a 12 ton rig was the actual one who used it last since i seen it with my own eyes. But let me mind my business.
bad,"Store manager apparently would rather you come in sick than miss a day. Claimed job advancement was possible for a year and no advancement was ever made. Many two-faced people. "
bad,"I have worked at this company for 13 years. I have been in management, watched things change from bad to worse. Customers have become nastier. Micro management has become the norm. Every step is ""sign your life"" paperwork. Security has become lax with new infrastructure that makes no sense. Management are getting promotions, terrible training, and those who do get promoted are kiss ups. You cannot contact HR for anything because it trickles down to the District Manager in which is the biggest problem. And if the complaints is about them, it's a gossip mill. Everyone knows your business and no one is running the company correctly. Meetings every month about the same with no visible results, surveys every week that show that nobody cares. Terrible morality. Save yourself and don't step one foot in Walgreens. You have been warned."
bad,"This company has a very old school method when it comes to management that is outdated and has no place in the modern world. I was called out by my store manager constantly in front of customers and employees for little things. Im all for criticism because it helps to know what to change but no one wants to get reprimanded in front of  someone else, and thats just not a good work environment. the district management seem like they are so unhappy with there position that they have lost teir abiliyty to connect to the other employees and therefore lose respect and dont have the ability to rally them. this means moral is always low in the stores in my experience."
bad,Good company to work for but the pay is low. You will have to work long hours and not know what time you will get that off. You must make production rate every date.
bad,I worked at walgreens for a long time and the pay was not that good and advancement in company was not that good. The people I worked with were very nice and it was like a family.
bad,"Have learned to prioritize tasks, due to fast paced work environment. Most stores are understaffed. "
bad,"Forced to work all holidays by some managers no matter circumstances. The open door policy is a joke, and when you go to corporate to state problems with how management treats enployees nothing is done or they ignore you. It feels like working in a high school with they type of people you work with and it is not worth the pain."
bad,"I go to school full time so they weren’t able to work with my schedule accordingly. Also, management was very poor and rude. They didn’t know how to properly treat customers. They always got complaints. As an employee as well as a customer, I find that completely unacceptable. Customers complain about the associates having better customer service than the management."
bad,"Be prepared to do so much--work on the front counter while restocking and checking outdates while expecting to help in different departments AT THE SAME TIME with $9 per hour. "
bad,"For the first 5 years of my career with Walgreens, I really enjoyed working there and was proud to tell people where I worked."
bad,Working at Walgreens pharmacy is a very high demanding job. There is much to learn in the short amount of time from training to the being out on the floor.
bad,"The expectations are through the roof at Walgreens and although have been paid well in the past, pay for performance and hard to attain targets make it a dead end career anymore. If you are one of the favorites of upper management then you are okay, everyone else is struggling to""meet expectations"" to get raises and or bonuses anymore. Once was a great company with great culture but now driven by shareholder expectations and not by leadership of people and the culture it once was."
bad,The managers took advantage of the student workers scheduling them during times they were unavailable because of class and made it their responsibility to find coverage. Adult workers were childish and thrived off gossip. Was told during a review that I did my job perfectly but got an average score because I didn’t socialize with coworkers throughout my shifts.
bad,They are open all year around. I had to work Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The only reason I got New Years Eve off was because I HAD to. The store I worked at used favoritism heavily.
bad,"I come in with a good attitude and always ready for a busy work day . my store manager always find ways to make my day horrible , she talks to her employees like they are children . I would not want to work under someone like her again ."
bad,"I constantly got reamed for being 5 min late once a week when others were constantly late daily with no repercussions. I have a family and they hold that against you. They told me they were family oriented during my interview and I told them ""Great to hear. I have kids and my kids come first and foremost."" I had to take days off for doctors appointments, dentist appointments, school appointments, and of course, thier sports. THEY DO NOT LIKE THAT! They punish you by giving you less hours for the next few weeks. I was supposed to be a full time employee but when you request one day off on a day you usually work, they will take you from 40 hours, down to 27! And it's that way EVERY TIME! "
bad,"I started out at $9/hr. And I only get about 20-23 hours per week. Which is close to nothing when I receive my check - considering I have bill(s) to pay & a family to support. "
bad,They were working me nights and I wasn't getting home until 8:30 and my husband was not getting home until after that. It just was not a good fit for me.
bad,"If you want a career advancement this is not the place for you. It's very rare to see the growth of employees there."
bad,I was hated by a assistant manager right away for no reason and he always treated me unfair compared to other associates.He would go out of his way to make me feel uncomfortable and make me feel less than.The manager would let his assistant managers run stuff and do whatever they wanted usually play app games on phone or texting constantly.they would treat others better because they liked them and would play seniority card about Every thing.
bad,"Was a fantastic company until about 5 years ago. Then after the merger with Boots Allience, job security dissapeared, wages stagnated, and employees went from being valued assets to vote in the wheel. The shareholder and srock pri ce was EVERYTHING."
bad,"When I worked at Walgreens it wasn't exciting at all, you basically stood at the register all day, the Managers couldn't find me anything to do half of the time and I was mainly just bored out of my mind, wasting my life away. The Pay was okay, but could've been better. Overall, if you're looking for a Super Easy Job then Walgreens is just for you. However, if you're a busy body and want things to do then I would recommend you work somewhere else."
bad,"Ever since Walgreens merged with Boots Alliance it has gone downhill for the employees. Profits are up yet there are no budget hours for the stores. It seems that the expectation is that we should be able to work with less help, yet take on more work/tasks. Also it was just communicated to us that Walgreens has this huge lump sum of funds that will be used to give all employees raises......except for the pharmacists. This is the 2nd year in a row with no increase for the pharmacists."
bad,"There was a lot of unnecessary drama amongst the managers and staff.  I am not impressed with the company at all.  If there wasn't so much drama, I probably would have stayed longer but they didn't seem to genuinely care about their employees at all."
bad,"The job was remarkable in that the customers were so versatile and most of them wonderful. They are or were some of our most accomplished citizens in the workplace and were (mostly) a delight to work with. The culture in a call center is borderline hostile and anxious. Just when you are getting your sea legs on, making great strides in shortening the calls as management requested, yet still delivering exemplary service, they come at you with something else you are doing wrong. You never knew if today would be the day you are axed or if it will be your neighbor.  It is so unnecessary to create a work climate like this full of paranoia and fear. I had a great feeling of doing worthwhile work, didn't waste time criticizing the company, management, or the job, I just put my head down and worked hard. Unfortunately, this was not enough for Walgreen's."
bad,A haphazardly run company with different expectations between corporate entities and the bottom line that leads to sometimes confusing and outright bad decisions by management.
bad,The company used to be good to work for. But as you advance up the ranks the consideration of the person gets to be less. If numbers aren't met you aren't achieveing expectations.
bad,Not a great place to work sin Boots Alliance aquired walgreens a bout three years ago. They continue to cut hours without any explanation. 30 hours is considered full time if that.
bad,"I made the mistake of taking this job at the recommendation of a friend. From the outside it looks good and, in theory, it used to be a good company to work for. My first store manager seemed to delight in keeping workers dissatisfied and distrusting of each other. He eventually got released from employment to be replaced with a lying, self-serving drunkard with severe OCD. Over the course of almost three years I received a TOTAL of $.25/hour in pay raises as a shift leader - all while training others who were promoted over me. I spent ten years on active duty in the Army, have an earned PhD, and have forgotten more about leadership than my DM ever learned. I wouldn't recommend working at my local store to a homeless beggar."
bad,"Terrible Hours no matter what shift you're on"
bad,"The only good thing about working at Walgreens wasn't directly related to the company, it was my co-workers and employees. The pay is far too low for what you're asked to do, the company does not give the store enough hours to keep it fully staffed and as a result you are forced to push yourself to do the job of 2 people, provided someone doesn't call off and you're doing 3 jobs. It can be rewarding to assist a customer who truly needs it, but most are as ungrateful as the company that you work for."
bad,"i quiet enjoy working with my coworkers and some leadership members. my biggest concern is that the corporate side of Walgreens seems to not care much about their relationship with their store employees and doesn't put their store owners in leadership members in a place to be successful, much less the retail/floor team. they have Walgreens employees meetings where we shoot our opinions to help us do our jobs more effectively, however, it seems more like a front than anything as I seldom see any of our ideas/opinions/suggestions actually be tried out."
bad,Walgreens is a good company if you want to work in the pharmacy. Other then that the rate of pay is to low even for a shift lead. I wad a lead for 2 years and got no raises and was making 1375 the whole time. Its hard to have a family and not be able to progress in your job.
bad,Walgreens was very fast paces.  They also changed managers and some were nice and some were not.  The job was very hard at times when you would have to stand on your feet for hours.
bad,"Not a good company to work for. Very stressful. A lot of micromanaging. Unreasonable expectations. Really great employees are leaving, not valued. Constantly being watched and criticized. Management never says anything positive, always more ,more ,more."
bad,"They'll screw you for benefits and won't give you nearly enough hours to make any real money. Don't bother. They don't care about your situation and will drain you until you have nothing left to give. Then they kick you aside like an unwanted puppy. Like I said, don't bother."
bad,Short handed on help which made it very difficult to take a day off from being sick from medications. Not as flexible as they claimed. The pay decent.
bad,I did not feel this company had enough emphasis on patient care and education. I did not feel that there was flexibility and support for pharmacist to better serve the patients.
bad,"Working for Walgreens, you either fall in line or they will get rid of you one way or another. "
bad,"Most FM's and GS's don't know what they are doing anymore with them having minimal to no experience running a department in a mod. We are always working mandatory overtime and are understaffed with little to no proper training for new employees. Always adding more workload for us to do."
bad,"The store manager is actually pretty good at his job, however when I confronted him about the assistant manager having a bad attitude & verbally abusive nothing was done about it. They ask you to be overly responsible for the minimum wage they pay & the lack of hours they give you to work. I am actively looking for another job."
bad,"This company has become a cooperation.. It use to be family owned an they use to be a great company to work for, they dont really allot for flexible scheduling, their store managers or the one i worked for persay their motto was in a company like this you have 2 types of employees you have bodies that just fill in where there needs to be bodies then you have workers who do everything else.. I felt as if i made other peoples paychecks for them, an i was never happy or fulfilled during my time with this company"
bad,"Walgreens stayed that our cats about employees and our opinions but that is not so. Walgreens employees are the lowest paid in the industry. Walgreens stayed that employees were getting a raise at the beginning of the year from the money they received fromtge government and yet that has not been done and we are in the middle of June. They pay their Pharmacists an average between 110,000 to 150,000 per year but only pay their techs 22,000 per year. Mind you that the techs have to be certified and are held accountable by law and could face criminal charges if anything happens yet Walgreens feels that these responsabilities are only worth 11.50 an hour after certification. Company is not worth your time."
bad,"I worked 5 years at Walgreens and at first it was good place to work but they make promises they cannot keep. I became stockroom manager but never got a raise. Minimum wage went up so a new cashier gets paid same as I do so their salary went up but mine didn’t. They couldn’t help me for even .10. Workload too much to handle, stressful, understaffed, management was subpar but store manager never fought for his employees. I left to pursue school and became non motivated. I don’t recommend anyone working their because it’ll be out of business in 15 years and theyll hire less people to run the store. Billion dollar company can’t pay what people are worth. Its basically a high school job with people pointing fingers. Its good if your young but if you want opportunity its not Walgreeens."
bad,WOW so management doesnt listen they just want you to fill the spot while they are gone.  so I worked here like 3.5 months and never in life again.  So when I started working there the phones were down hey told me they were getting them fixed.  In the mean time I had to answer the phone in the front of the store whenever it rang and listen to what order they had for their med write it down take it to the pharmacy mind you im an front end lead so I also have my own things im getting down and supporting my other areas.  The last straw for me was when the place was robbed months later and the phones were still down soooo we had to try to get cell phones to call 911! it was a mess then the next week they scheduled me alone at night im a 4 11 woman.  The night before my shift two gas stations on my street were robbed..... I was done.
bad,"the job in general is stressful with customers, this is due to the location not all walgreens are the same. A typical day being at the walgreens is getting mad because customers want to steal and get mad when they got caught."
bad,"Your experience at Walgreens will largely depend on where (what division) you work in and upper level management of that group. In my experience working at Walgreens has not been a great experience overall. The company generally promotes growth from within, but when you attempt to move around in the company you are met with resistance. Training dollars are not distributed fairly among team members, employees who have been at the company for many years have a good o'l boys club mentality, there is not a general care or concern for fellow team members as everyone is out for themselves. If the company wants to get rid of you, I have seen them create paper trails on good employees to avoid paying severance and justify the elimination of your role. The company does routine lay-offs at least 1-2 times per year. It is not a stable work environment."
bad,Walgreens taught me how to be a leader. Also how to train other employees. Helped me a lot with customer service skills. In the 4 years of working here I have been promoted 3 times.
bad,"When I first started working there, I believed i could have grown with the company; however, the true motives of the person(s) were slowly being revealed. They did not want to train me properly. If you do not train your people properly, then they will not be productive."
bad,Not enough man hours or man power to delegate work makes for a tired and stressed employee. I love helping our customers in whatever they need. The hardest of my job is lifting the weight of 40-45 pounds.
bad,"Pharmacy technicians are under paid. Walgreens does not focus about their employees which does not motivate employees to give the best service. Its always busy because understaff, since new hires don't like it and quit right away."
bad,"Working at Walgreens was a stressful place to work.  Temps are treated as outsiders who are not allowed at meetings, with no benefits.  Worked there almost 2 years without a raise. No room for advancement. Manager worked in another state. Open office concept with no privacy, and no assigned desk. The best part of the job were my fellow temp co-workers. Lunch and break times were good.  There were unrealistic deadlines."
bad,honestly when i first started i really like working after a while i did notice that i was starting to be singled out for a lot of things that had nothing to do with me.
bad,Management too busy having negative intent instead of positive intent with employees and the other way around with customers.  Management not taking staff seriously and then punishing when they mention it more than once.
bad,The managers here had a hard time working around and with my school schedule and this made working and going to school difficult. i learned a lot about customer service and working with cash registers.
bad,"a typical can be at registrar, photo or on the floor. Stocking and cleaning up. The best teachers are the older employees. The younger employees can be drama. Management not always the best teachers when it comes to new equipment or new policies.  The hardest part of the job are the difficult employees who don't want to work are bossy and don't want to clean up the work area.  Sometimes it's the people you work with that makes the job enjoyable."
bad,"Check email & Compass.  Walk the store and create a list of unachieveable work for employees you don't have, then go back the pharmacy and get yelled at for 6 hours.  oh yeah, somewhere in there find 10 mins to shovel food into mouth hole while rechecking email & Compass."
bad,"Let me preface this by saying that this job varies based on location and store management. But I have not had the best experience working at Walgreens. This is a company that doesn't really care about its retail employees at all. Corporate places tons of pressure on store management, which then filters down to employees and so forth. The company routinely cuts store hours, doesn't aim to be a high-paying employer unless you're a top-flight executive, lacks in benefits for many areas, has a lot of silly policies like not being able to wear a jacket at the cash register (unless you pay for one of theirs), understaffs its stores, and puts way too many tasks and expectations on said staff on top of general customer service/store duties. The company can run their stores so much better, but every year it seems like they refuse to improve."
bad,"dont work here, not worth it. poor management, constantly doing other peoples jobs and yours. have to do lots of tasks at once, sometimes you don't even get a lunch."
bad,"the company downsized and took a big hit, employees are often asked to operate outside of their departments and are never compensated for it. there aren't enough hours for the tasks being asked for."
bad,"My specific manager was not very good, in that he didn't coach for success and was very demeaning. It may be different with other managers. I know that some people have really enjoyed working for the company."
bad,"When I started there shifts were 8 hour days. It at that time was a good job. I became a supervisor. Then shifts were switched to 10 hour days. Which, with losing people quickly became 12 hour days. As a supervisor I accrued PTO based on a 40 hour work week. Most weeks were at least 50 hours. No additional compensation or PTO for this. The environment was highly stressful. More and more things to do thrown on your plate every day. On top of this all areas were short staffed which often meant doing another person's job in addition to your own. Worst part was upper management was clueless to the actual problems in the building and unwilling to listen to suggestions from  anyone lower on the totem pole. Overall my last couple years there the working environment was downright toxic. Morale was terrible. I would recommend anyone looking to work at a distribution center in this company stay far away...."
bad,"I was hired in at full time hours, between 32 and 40 hours per week. I advanced from cashier to pharmacy technician in less than two years. The pay is based on one person's opinion of you personally. You will not get cost of living increases or an increase in pay based on that one person's review of your work. Don't expect to make this job a career, you will never have a steady paycheck when hours are cut weekly. The only way to survive is to call other stores for hours. When I asked for more hours, my manager gave me this advice and showed me the list of stores to call."
bad,This company has no manager accountability.  All of our projects are handed out with a moments notice and we have no clear goals to work from. Our ideas are shot down and we are spoken to with disregard to our personal feelings.
bad,I thought this would be an awesome place to work at and honestly it has turned into a stressful. Some of the managers are not helpful but expect you to do everything all at once.
bad,"Management needs improvement!  You are treated like a child, staff is always fighting with each other because of the lack of management. People don't stay for long."
bad,"A typical day consists of strategic planning to determine store needs and delegating tasks to staff for execution. "
bad,"Although it could be used as a stepping stone to open the door to more careers down the line, the time here was very unpleasant. On a daily basis I would work as hard as I could, go above and beyond for the job and for my customers and would get no recognition or any appreciation. Once one person complains about you it doesn't matter about the hundreds or thousands of customers/patients you've done so much for you are now looked at like the worst and most rude person because one person complained about you."
bad,"The Walgreens culture has changed drastically in the last 2 CEO's. I have worked at walgreen's for a long time, was really looking forward to retiring with the company. Now I don't think its possible due to the luck of management and unrealistic expectation of team members."
bad,"While at work, management was very unprofessional. Co-workers were great. Engaging with customers was the best part of the job. Hardest part of the job was satuday night putting up coupon tags."
bad,A lot of new changes and supervisors give out invalid information. The point system is ridiculous. I had a miscarriage and when I returned to work they told meh I had 15 points
bad,I felt unsafe in my work environment. There was no security and management seemed unpassed by my safety concerns and requests. I was always uneasy about getting to and from work safely
bad,"hours always endangered of getting cut to pay for new construction"
bad,This company no longer cares about the employees. They expect you to bust butt. And they have a certain payscale they follow. If you are there no raise every again. Yearly reviews are bad. You don’t score good unless you do charity work on your own time. They don’t care about your family. They just think you should be at there call 24/7.
bad,"They don’t care how long you have with the company, if it saves them money your gone!  And the open door policy isn’t what it’s  supposed to be .You’re supposed to be able to tell when something is not right and not be retaliated or fired for well it happens all the time !"
bad,"the things they expect you to do in a day is unrealistic trying to do things in the main part of the store itself ( like remodeling, moving items around, making sure the store is clean/ presentable ext.)"
bad,"Walgreens was a Okay Job In the beginning I started out as overnight (had no security btw) just me and one assistant manager but overnight stop after Walgreens co started cutting hours and the district decided to close the store at 12am. I begin only working 2 Days Out The Week And That was All weekends . Never respected my requested time off when i was full time , lazy co Workers it was just Bad Never Again 👎🏾"
bad,Working at Walgreens is very stressful and demanding. Management can pretty much make their own rules without policy involved... I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"You go to work, they add 10 new tasks every day."
bad,"Walgreens is the place to work if you need great benefits and a future for retirement, but it is just like every other large corporation. They have no employee recognition and bonuses are almost impossible to reach."
bad,Lack pf management due to managers leaving and everything fell down on me as the receptionist. No back up or help when needed. No one available to handle problems or calls due to lack of organization. Calls on hold too long because pharmacist and supervisors not at desk or just not wanting to take calls.
bad,The mode for upward mobility was not plentiful. Employees were overlooked or not even recognized for their contributions to company's profits. Most of the customers were enjoyable characters that more than made up for the very few difficult ones.
bad,"In a typical day, one technician was required to perform a 4-person job. It was often under staffed. It is especially hard for a new employee, current employees often times showed impatience when you ask for help, but this is mainly due to under staffing."
bad,i found that then job was satisfactory. sometimes it was busy others its was very slow. when it would get slow would do lots of busy work such as stocking and cleaning.
bad,"The job is stressful, no actual breaks, and you must have open schedule including holidays and weekends. I have manager responsibilities with bad pay. They make it very difficult to move up, and once you get to assistant manager in training you will only have that position for 2 years. If you don't get promoted again before the 2 years, you get moved back down. This is unfair for those who work their butts off and it's not their fault when no positions are available to get moved up into. If I didn't want to move up in a company this place would be ok to work at."
bad,"horrible store manger at 10184 (South Bend)  would not let me transfer to another store. Doesn't treat people right, can't even do passport pictures in the photo department. Don't work here unless you want no opportunity to advance or move up."
bad,There is very little communication between associates and management and between associates. Associates kept their areas of work cluttered and unclean/unsanitized. Associates would come to work sick without caring about infecting others. Management is unopen to change and doesn't take constructive criticism well. The hardest part is the half a dozen tasks expected to be completed by the end of your shift. The most enjoyable part is making relationships with specific customers and the employees are enjoyable to be around. The culture is very chaotic and unorganized from top to bottom.
bad,Management spent most of their time fussing about work situations and on the phone in the office. Training was not done properly and when an employee made a mistake due to lack of training they were reprimanded.
bad,worked at few locations all are full of drama and everyone spends their time worrying about who is not working enough.it is a nightmare working here most locations will only hire part time hours are not regular you can go from 29 a week to 8 hr per week.
bad,"When Walgreens was in the process of purchasing Rite Aid, they closed down a lot of stores. This left many store managers out of work. This meant that whenever a new store opened up, or a store manager got fired or quit, the managers without stores would get the stores. This left little to no room for growth for tenured ASMs. There were many budget cuts which led to staffing issues. If your store doesn't have a high enough volume, your District Manager will ignore many of your store's requests."
bad,"I liked the company, I just didn't like the management. And, for people who speak with an accent, they are so racist. they will not let you improve. They through me there with no training, then they complain everytime I asked questions then brought a new person and trained her very well! I had to leave,,, maybe I just had a bad manager"
bad,they dont care about  your well being and the area their stores are located and too cheap to provide security.....................................................
bad,Walgreens is a great store to work at but you do have poor management that don't help out when needed it would be alright if everyone cone to work and do there job
bad,This company is all about the corporation . Family is not first for them. Short staffing a very stressful place to work. All the employee's would complain.
bad,were trying to make cosmetics like a macys with very lower end cosmetic lines goals were very unattainable with lower end products very repetive as far as daily tasks
bad,"Need to rehire management at this store, also customer service and work behaviors with some of the technicians in the pharmacy need to be addressed with higher up management that will do permeant actions."
bad,Management was awful. A lot of backstabbing went on within company. It is poised to get crushed be Amazon so management is feeling pressure to cut down on human resources to save money. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"I've held 4 positions with walgreens.  I started at entry level and moved up to the management team.  My experience for the first 7 years was excellent.  What I found as I moved up was and the years went on, the company itself has moved away from valuing their employees and their focus became focused on the almighty dollar.  They did what they called restructuring and basically changed the name of job titles in order to be able to legally cut the pay by up to $4.00 less per hour.  Management has dirty hands and  does things under the table to benefit themselves.  Open door policy is a complete joke!"
bad,"They're constantly adding and taking away positions. Our manager was a complete push over, who let the laziest workers talk their way into not being reprimanded and not being held accountable. As for Walgreens itself, they have just come out with a new ""plan"" called ""frontier."" Basically, each person gets more workload with the same pay and the manager gets less responsibility. I know I'm biased because I'm obviously not a fan of Walgreens. But to be fair, not one person at multiple stores (besides managers,) were happy about this new plan. My assistant manager however, was incredible."
bad,It's an ok place to work the work load was pretty laid back the only thing was it seemed like moving to a higher position there was hard because it seemed like they rarely moved people up to more responsibility
bad,"This job can be great, but the downfall is all of the supervisors are way to uptight, they have no sense of humor. You will get talked to if you are even caught talking to another employee or looking over if you are being asked a question by a colleague. We are treated liked robots, to not talk, but to just stay seated in front of your computer 95% of the day silent. Although on the flip side, the company is very flexible and willing to work with you in tight situations. That has kind of pushed me to stay as long as I have, HR is very very well in communication with the employees."
bad,"Walgreens used to be a great company to work for. Then the company decided to change almost every policy and leadership model. Way to many bosses. to many chiefs not enough indians..... "
bad,"Horrible management, from store to district to area. Good for a first job or for teens, otherwise your screwed. I will say the only good thing is job security as employees basically don't get fired no matter how horrible they are unless they steal."
bad,"Retail pharmacy is a nice place to work but depends on so many factors. How many rx per day, your staff, your clientele, your managers and when you worked at a location"
bad,"The management was dropped their salaries and brought down to my hourly rate so there was no place for me to advance to, and the Management changed and was run like a sweatshop by the new managers"
bad,Stressful and terribly mismanaged. Had a change of management while working and completely mishandled the turn over. Couldn't even find a new manager int he pharmacy and we are still without a full manager 5 months down the road. Completely unprofessional work environment and chaotic work flow.
bad,"The managers will make you stay if  another manager calllout unit for you already work an 8 hours  you will have to do doubles til sometimes triple shift .The managersWork Monday through Friday and only work morning shif5 so they give you all the  shift no body want ( closing shift or overnight shift).We don't have security this is not in the budget so therefore it's a lot of shop lifting and drug addicts that comes steal from us a ,sometimes threatening you with knives and any thing.  You have be careful ."
bad,"I completely weeks of training to become a pharmacy technician here, and was given a pay raise of $.50 per hour above a regular store cashier. Most of the staff was friendly, the work was long hours with almost all of the time spent on your feet, and not a lot of recognition for the employees that went above and beyond their daily duties. The manager was disliked by almost all of the employees, and was the main reason I left the job. Not very considerate and not a fun or productive environment. I did not feel like I was doing good by working here."
bad,"Employees get along to some extent then there are the other employees that think they run the store when they don't. Then, The store manager fires people and doesn't tell the reason. It caused disruption during the working store hours."
bad,Poor management.stressful work environment.The pay was ok and the hours were good but it was very streasful and the manager was very un professional. I would not recommend.
bad,"really enjoyed my potion and most of the people I worked with. One of our shift leads was not easy to work with, and was very lazy and stood around talking with our beauty consultant most of her shift which made our staff very unhappy. Management was informed of the situation and we were assured that they were going to do something about the concerns we had, 2 months have gone by and nothing was done so I had enough of busting my butt while higher ups did nothing, Sorry Walgreen i'm not a doormat."
bad,"A typical day at work requires tending to customer needs, stocking shelves and running the register. Management is okay. The workplace can get hectic and be slow at the same time. I enjoy the simplicity of the job. The job is not hard at all."
bad,"bad management, unwillingness to wok with schedule, overall overnights were highly prone towards robbry especially in the houston area, definitely would recommend as an absolute last source"
bad,"It is a stressful, hectic and busy place to work in. The most enjoyable is the employee discounts. You get things for a good price especially when the things are on sale."
bad,The management team was bad we got robbed and the manager left us for a 125 dollar drawer.....I would never want to work there again...the customer where great and treated me like family
bad,"This company has taken a turn for the worst. Upper Management only focuses on numbers with no regard to pharmaceutical care or patient safety. Pharmacists/Pharmacy Managers are being supervised by people that have no concept of what it means to be in either of those roles and, at best, have a tech license. There is very little value of employees. There has been a max exodus of Pharmacists and Pharmacy Managers two times over, but the company refuses to acknowledge why they are having this turn over. Even the technicians are trying to get out. I would not recommend Walgreens to anyone."
bad,They have taken every benefit they can does not take our  ideas or concerns into affect . we do have health insurance but not competive to other places
bad,A typical day at work is unnecessarily stressful and continuously busy. The customers can be nice sometimes but when our CPO gets connected I often find them contentious and hostile. The workplace culture is nothing that would entice one to continue working and the hardest part of the job is drive-thru duty. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about new medications and resolving TPR client-related issues.
bad,"Advancement within the workplace is slow moving. Customer service is on point. Fairly overworked with low compensation. Breaks were always given, but not always on time and standing for over 4 hours without sitting is hard. I have learned every station besides pharmacy. Management was somewhat sketchy."
bad,"This is a job for someone that only wants to work part-time, it's not a full-time job for starters they don't even want to give you the 40 hours and on top of that without the 40 hours you won't get the benefits. So this job is just for someone in collage trying to just pay their gas for their car, not for a mother trying to get by with her children."
bad,"It's not the job I see myself retiring from. I was misled from the day of my interview until now. There are no advancement within the company. The job takes away from your personal life outside of work. Your days off are not really your days off. I'm just speaking from my two year experience of working for Walgreen's at this particular location. This particular location turnover rate is ridiculous."
bad,I didn't like working here in saint Petersburg. Some members of management are rude and don't care about the team members. They don't treat all team members and other members of management with respect
bad,"Worked with Walgreens for many years took me 11 years just to make 11 dollars an hour ."
bad,The company has whole could use better organize operations. As a whole the staff is overall pretty good. Need better leadership and better pay and training.
bad,"This is an okay company . Management needs more training and the policy isn't as organized as it should be. Not much room for promotions. The ""budget"" is always being brought up when it comes to hours"
bad,When I was hired I was excited because I thought this company really cared about their customers and employees.  I was wrong.  I did very well here was over quota and they laid me off.  I was shocked.  The people I worked with were all back stabbers.  I helped a few people and they ended up wanting me gone because I was doing so well.  If you go there do not trust a soul.  You will be surprised on who will sell you out..
bad,"stressful And boring. Managers in this market are overbearing And documentation happy,  ready to put you out the door if they don't like you. I work my butt off for 50c over minimum  wage and have nothing to show for it."
bad,"For me, the best part of the job is when I work alone. I either work in the cooler or on the floor."
bad,Walgreens has taught me a lot about my strengths and weaknesses. I grew to be a stronger manager and a better leader.  In our world today our strengths are shown through our people.
bad,"Walgreens keeps cutting our hours, so we are forced to work long hours while being under staffed.  Management is not willing to work with you on giving you time off, but they take off as much time of as they want."
bad,The pharmacists that I worked for here were awesome and loved their employees and treated them great but we were very understaffed due to the company only allowing us a few hours in the store even though we were one of the busiest Walgreens stores. It was very stressful and the pay was terrible.
bad,"My typical day at work at Walgreens is like every other retailer out there; providing good customer service and always keeping yourself busy. I learned many different expectations for every department in Walgreens. Management at Walgreens is very bad, workplace culture was a really big diversity among everyone but it is also very engaging. The hardest part of the job was handling theft, how to handle bad customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job our customers, helping and engaging with customers makes me happy."
bad,"While working at Walgreens I experienced some of the worst management I have ever experienced. There are numerous problems at the Walgreens on Trenton and Tiny Town Rd in Clarksville, TN. A day working there was like working in the biggest gossip group ever it was like dealing with multiple horrible bipolar coworkers. Managers only helped themselves and asked employees to help do their jobs for them while they gossiped about other coworkers. As far as learning something it really came from self teaching and that I would say was the hardest part of working there. The only thing to enjoy working there would have been the customers themselves."
bad,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. hard to do your job to everyones satisfaction. difficult to maintain morale and retain employees. Often you find yourself in a moral conflict following company pol;ocies.
bad,"The company seems to be losing its soul to money grubbers.  When I joined in 2006 they were workforce oriented and we were like a big family.  Our photo department drew in people from nearby cities to get their work done here.  That was a source of great p;ride."
bad,"Cashiers are expected to do everything and if not, will get written up or have a talk in the office. Long hours of having to take abuse from both customers and managers made it a very terrible experience for this ex-employee"
bad,"Awful, you can only move up if you're friends with management not if you're a hard worker. Most workers dont do their duties and just talk and hang out."
bad,"Manage and develop employees"
bad,A typical day at work consisted of maintain stock and inventory in the cosmetics department and developing digital pictures in the photo lab.  The store manager was not the most approachable individual.
bad,Need good management in order to keep good hard working employees work on being kind to people to any rude managers and employees not a good environment to work
bad,Store managers where not always nice.  Always changing the schedule and not notifying you.  My Store manager was always outside smoking and not minding the store operations and cashiers.
bad,"Company is decent for the most part. Typical day at work consists of helping customers, managers can work on communication etc. Seniority and favoritism plays a role within the company. There's no straight answers on certain questions an employee asks, usually a round-a-bout answer. Customers can be ridiculous at times. Pay isn't the greatest."
bad,Been there for 10 years. Way too many management changes. Not enough pay for all the work they made you go through. HR was not good. They don't care about the employees. Only about money.
bad,Overall an ok place to work but compared to most of Bay Area there is no life/work balance and no perks you see other companies give. Health insurance has extremely high deductibles so work force is choosing to not see doctors when sickness and they are health professionals . Pharmacists are multitasking while checking prescriptions .
bad,"The hardest part of this job is getting all the work done that is expected of you."
bad,"Walgreens itself isn't a bad company. As a whole I've had good experiences with the company. However as a former employee, Walgreens is a terrible place to work. They will cut your hours with no explanation and the management is usually awful to their employees. Their were a few exceptions but overall my time at Walgreens was miserable. Everybody knew everything about my personal life, including details about my pharmaceutical purchases."
bad,"Management, case management of patients profiles, probation case management, conflict resolution, public relations, electronic prescription processing, cash handling, cash counting, public relations."
bad,"Anyone that is regular in the morning knows what need to be done.  You come and start your daily activity and most of all have an attitude to greet the customers.  My co workers I really enjoy working with.  They are fun, wonderful to talk to. We communicate with one another which is the key in anything.  The hardest part of the job is the standing.  It is constantly standing, especially standing in one area.  If you are moving around it is better, but standing behind the register it is very rough on your legs and feet. I have never had problems with my legs and feet until I started working at Walgreens.    You are not able to sit down.  The most enjoyable part is when I see the regular customers whom I grown to have a relationship with.  I look for certain ones to come in and when I don't for whatever reason or reasons I get concern but they eventually come in.  I love when they recognize me too and ask about me when I am off.  When we can laugh with one another.  Management can be challenging and it has been challenging.  But sometimes change is hard, but both management and all staff have to work together and get on the same page of expectations.  We are mainly there for the customers because if there are no customers management nor others would be there."
bad,Store Manager is very uncompassionate and don't care about peoples feeling for anything.  The over all company is fine to work for. ............>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
bad,it was just like any other retail store until they started change the path the company was going to and started closing stores change pay
bad,I got employed at Walgreens September 2015 and at first everything was okay but I started to realize the communication and the service was very poor the management didn't communicate well the shift leads have attitudes or didn't want to communicate well it's just a very poor company to work for I've never worked for a company like this one I've been working retail since I was 14 years old and Walgreens has to be the worst retail experience I've had.
bad,"Retail is not an area anyone should remain in for too long. The hours are flexible, however the pay is low, the work is a lot, too much company politics and limited progression."
bad,There is lack of job security and advancement with this company. I worked for the company for 10 years and was laid off without enough notice.
bad,"while walgreens is a great, strong company to work for, there is no worklife balance.  myself and my team work 50-60 hours a week just to get base job completed, leaving no room for growth, development or strategic planning"
bad,"company has changed, not for the benefit of its employees"
bad,"These folks have the most hypocrital corporate culture in the business. They talk a big customer service game then cut hours to the bone. There is a constant stream of blame flowing to the employees for failure to live up to Walgreens 'High Ideals'. A persistent hostile work environment exists toward all and emotional blackmail is rampant.  Micro tasks are torrentially squeezed in with the admonition to 'do this in your spare time' Floor staff is often recruited to work as pharmacy techs without compensating them as such."
bad,"I don't even know where to begin with Walgreens. Not only were they only paying me $7.25/hr for a ton of work, but the management was terrible. I was in school and they were working me 3:30-10:30 every night and they wouldn't listen to me when I said I needed fewer hours. They knew ahead of time that I was allergic to peanuts/tree nuts and they had me unpacking food items, which sent me to urgent care at one point. Overall, a terrible workplace."
bad,"A typical day consisted of developing photos, cashiering, and stocking shelves. Other than learning how to use the photo developing machine I didn't learn anything of great value. The managers were nice, but often showed favoritism to their coworker friends such as discounts, better hours, etc. Some of my co-workers slacked off or called in on a regular basis leaving the rest of us with heavier work loads. The job overall was easy and took very little brain power. There was not much I enjoyed other than interacting with the customers."
bad,A typical day would be greeting customers and directing them to which part of the store a specific item would be located.
bad,Working at Aegis consisted of selling and ordering medical supplies. Receiving and making calls to patients. Also consist of enrolling patients in home delivery of their medications.
bad,They have changed so much with this company that it is not worth working for anymore. I can't wait to see this pharmacy go out of business.
bad,I had an interesting experience working at Walgreens not the best experience that I would of liked. Lied to me bout moving a position a bunch of times and they would keep giving me excuses when I asked why.
bad,"Walgreens is an ""ok"" place to work if this is your first job or you are just trying to make some extra money. I worked here for two years and two different locations and at first I was pretty excited but after a while I really started to see what this company was about. They couldn't care less about their employees. ESPECIALLY pregnant ones. GOD FORBID you get pregnant while working with this company. They beat me out of three raises although I was constantly praised about my work ethic. And don't get me started about the management. The store managers play OBVIOUS favorites it's ridiculous. The shift leaders are so immature and can be extremely unprofessional and inappropriate. Long story short, work here for about a year or two then leave. OR work your way up and become a manager or go into the pharmacy or something because Walgreens really does suck."
bad,"As a greeter I am first person customer encounters.  I greet and direct customers, also inspect employee packages. I stand for sevens."
bad,"Store #05847(fresno,Ca) Overall working at walgreens isnt to bad if you dont mind not getting any recognition for hard work and sacrifice. Upper-Management is clueless and cant give you up to date policy information and punish you for not knowing current policy. Long story short im glad im free of that place."
bad,"My entire management career has been with Walgreens.  I am near retirement and have witnessed Walgreens reducing benefits, often without notice.  All they do is take away from your wallet.  "
bad,"Pharmacy team was excellent. Problems with management and corporate directives. Long days without any breaks. Expect heavy work load and some support staff is not well trained.Some tasks were a waste of my skills, felt like a telemarketer some days.Travel was required after 3 years , not agreed to at onset.  Guaranteed 32 hours per week required over nights at other locations. Reimbursement for travel expenses was often delayed.  market scheduling was delayed and often did know work schedule beyond a few days."
bad,I learned how to maintain the accuracy of the store inventory with these reports. These reports helped with shrink and overstock items. And at the end of work day post all counts that were changed.
bad,"Walgreens has a fast paced work environment where you can interact with many people throughout the day.  As this is a pharmacy, you may encounter those who come to fill or pick up prescription medicine.  Therefore I'd advise wearing latex gloves when dealing with money from customers."
bad,"The Managers at the location I worked at were all under qualified for their positions."
bad,Predictable schedule and work days are typically the same. Not a hard job to learn the routine of responsibilities/duties.
bad,"At this job, the management is what really made the job so bad. I would go to take my 15 minute break and if I was not back within 5 minutes I would get in trouble. I almost got fired because I had pneumonia and was told if I missed another day at work I would be fired. So, I ended up coming in while I was puking blood and I got sent home and then got in trouble for that the next day. Don't ever work here."
bad,"this job was okay, the only one thing i didn't like was that we were always getting new management , also there was favoritism, i got along with all the co workers but some where to lazy or they thought they were a boss and could do whatever they feel like."
bad,"Walgreens used to be a great, family valued company to work for up until four years ago when they started cutting expenses, lowering wages, eliminating positions, and setting unreachable corporate goals.  This was all in preparation for the acquisition of the Boots Alliance Company.   In order to achieve the needed capital, they no longer valued their employees that worked so diligently and faithfully to place them in the position of being the ""pharmacy America trusts"".  The elimination of loyal, experienced, higher compensated employees began, and the lower salaried, younger, college grads were recruited into their positions."
bad,Honestly this job was a waste of time. They do not work with the employees they work against them. Well maybe just my location but honestly that job was the worst experience ever.
bad,I run the photo dept. So I order supplies for my dept and also help customers with their needs. I help keep the store clean. The management does a good job keeping everything in order.
bad,"Great place to work, The company always have new and confusing changes. I've learned a lot about store operations and advance through the company from a cashier. Good work environment, almost family type atmosphere at the location i worked"
bad,"work is easy, never challenging"
bad,"This company manages its cash-flow by eliminating good, tenured staff.  Pay and benefits are good, but job security is non-existent, even with stellar performance reviews."
bad,"Begin Administrative Tasks"
bad,"They expected me to work 24/7, low pay, every year benefits are worse. Company changed a lot since 10 years ago, created new position titles just to lower our pay."
bad,"there are better places to work at"
bad,"I enjoyed my time at the store, I was working over night with a set schedule. The customers where great and my co workers where a lot of fun to work with. Only fall back was every holiday we where open so I missed out on family time."
bad,A typical day at work for me would be rough. The rules and management are terrible. My co-workers were constantly stressed because of the management. People were constantly quitting and being yelled at. The most enjoyable part of the job would be when I put in my two weeks.
bad,"- From punching in to punching out the day is hectic with constant work with only the exception of Holidays because there is a lack of employees. "
bad,"A typical day in this position included more drama that you could shake a stick at, managerial issues all over and the deep seated need to run for the hills.  However, holding my own, utilizing as much professionalism and patience as possible, this was not a horrible job to have.  It taught me patience with, not only customers, but co-workers and how to deal with the younger working class.  "
bad,"if you like being yelled at daily by customers and gossiped about by management, then go here."
bad,"I like the customers, my co-workers, and even some of my fellow managers. I even don't mind spending a lot of my time helping in the pharmacy. However, the Shift Leader job pays too little for what's expected of us."
bad,"Previously I held an assistant management-level position in which I performed my job to the best of my ability, and I believe I did it very well."
bad,"I really enjoy the job that i do and the team members i supervise and and work with on a daily basis."
bad,"Management was poor, WAY too strict and unprofessional. I've tried to transfer to a different store that was closer to my house for months (since I had to travel a total of 4 hours each day, To and From work) and was constantly denied. Always short staffed and nothing was ever done about it. Many applied, none were hired."
bad,Very obvious good old boy environment.  If you're not part of the club you're singled out.  Only negative re-enforcement.  Never positive.
bad,different experience everyday and customer service. managing the store and the employees as well.
bad,"Job as a retail pharmacist has evolved over the years with the shrinking margins we have no choice but to add more ""clinical"" tasks with less help to accomplish them, to add to the bottom line."
bad,The people working alongside me were all good people it was just the company itself that I had issues with. They had no set guidelines so everything was different depending on the day of the week.
bad,"Working  for this place is very is tiring, its hard to breathe. Every breathe or step you are expected to be doing something. It feels like slave work, any and everything one does can potentially get you fired. if you're  not doing enough your job is on the line. So I am looking for a better environment to utilize my skills wisely and be able to breathe."
bad,Extremely high expectations and workload for management positions and no opportunity for advancement. 50 hours a week min and 70 during holidays.
bad,"Overall a solid employer; but pay not as good as it could be and hours less than 37 or 38 per week. Alot of multi-taskingm and cross Training, Keeping busy nost of time."
bad,"Just a normal retail much more busy as it was in the heart of the city,i learned to realized that i can also deligate jobs to my other co worker for more work productivity, as i am too focus on finishing the job my self. its more fun working and making other people happy trough service and having a repeat customers."
bad,This job was just same day in day out with no room for advancement. The only thing that was good was all benefits were paid for.
bad,"The changes in the company are just centered in the company's ways in making more money while they are doing pay cuts and putting more responsibilities to employees. Employees are always threatened to loose their jobs if they can not comply with all the changes they are making. They wanted to pay an Assistant Manager $15.00/hour (no increase until you get promoted, no bonuses) and expect to run the whole store with very minimal employees plus run photo department when the technician calls out or provide assistance in Pharmacy department if they get crazy busy. All this in a days work then add the nasty treatments of some inconsiderate costumers."
bad,"Management was the reason of my leave at Walgreens. Poorly ran by all managers and had such disrespect towards their employees. I enjoyed working for the company based on the tasks I was assigned as a beauty advisor because I enjoy keeping busy. My co-workers were not any better as a whole, but I did not let it show on my work. Overall my experience working for this company was not what I expected based on the employees and how it was ran."
bad,"It was a  good place of business and work they just didn't provide me with the hours and schedule that I was hired for. Overall it still was a great experience, I learned more about multi-tasking and taking leadership roles, friendly co-workers, and i really enjoyed being able to talk to and help customers and their needs."
bad,"A typical day of work for me is to arrive early, clean up the mess left by the night crew and finish the orders that came through the system over-night.  After that, it is work on various tasks around the store, until a customer needs photo assistance or a photo order is ready to be finished."
bad,While I was employed at Walgreens. I would have to say my overall like for the job came from my customers. The reason why I say MY customers was because I felt that it was necessary for me to be personal with each and every customer. If for some reason I couldn't find the item and my store I would try to find one at another or send them somewhere else. My overall experience with Walgreens mangers was that some of them obtained the position and started lacking the overall objective of Walgreens.( To me Walgreens is a drug store to help promote happy and healthy and to help educate about different plans of healthcare.) some Manger was unwilling to help customers as well as employees .
bad,"I learned on my own, was not about to advance in this company at all due to favoritism. Can't talk to managers because they don't bother to listen. Your voice does not matter to this company. "
bad,"Little pay, No one appreciates your hard dedication, work 364 days a year, never closes early, Sunday usually places close early nope there open till 10pm everyday, management needs help"
bad,Company's have changed a lot for the worse. Walgreen's use to be a good company to work for now they treat their employees bad.
bad,"My day consists of stocking shelves, assisting (needy) customers, ordering new product, relieving long lines, printing photos, and keeping the stockroom organized. I have learned the frustrations of the retail environment and have found that working in an environment where constant interruption is both practiced and maintained can be highly detrimental to my mental health. This job requires people who are extremely patient and have good people skills, but also people that do not mind doing repetitive tasks and being interrupted to answer the same questions over and over. The management is decent, only for the way that they treat their employees, but the corporate-mandated buzzwords appear condescending. Corporate mandates express that management from above has no idea what store employees actually do nor what makes a store efficient. The hardest part of my job is knowing that despite having a bachelor's degree and an associates degree, I will never be promoted because management positions are few and far between and not readily available to those not already in management. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping those who truly require assistance and seeing what an impact my help and service has been to them."
bad,"As an employee, walgreens has good discounts especially when certain items are already on sale."
bad,not a very positive work environment. the management was horrible.
bad,job stinks. I wanted to kill myself working there. I did not learn anything.
bad,"Great team worked with, always a fun time with co workers. Poor training new employees."
bad,"Please review my resume; I was told early on in life; ""that if you don't have something nice to say about someone/something, then don't!""."
bad,"I was a shift lead for not even a year, but I was an employee for 3 years.  I would never recommend working at the store 07116, its too much favoritism and too much drama."
bad,"At this particular Walgreens, I did not care to work here because it was too stressful in means that there was to much favoritism.  I worked hard everyday, asked to learn other departments but got turned down.  My biggest enjoyment of my job was the customers, by means of helping them and demonstrating new beauty products to them."
bad,"Walgreen's is not a warm friendly cooperation, in fact they constantly take advantage of their loyal employee's. Either by cutting their salary or cutting their hours and in most cases both."
bad,Not much to say aside from it being a very tough working environment. Management promised advancement and cross training but avoided discussing it again after hiring. co-workers were mean and picked on you even if you did tasks correctly. Not a comfortable place for me to work.
bad,"The management was unorganized, unsatisfactory employee to employee relations, not a very enjoyable environment to work in."
bad,During my time working at Walgreen's there was multiple time my schedule was changed without prior discussion with my managers.  Also there were a lot of position changes throught the store while i worked there making my situtaion difficult.
bad,"Unfortunately, working for Walgreens' was a horrible experience overall.  The values that they constantly discuss during your training goes out the window as soon as you step into the pharmacy.  The work flow is chaotic and stressful if you are working in an high volume store.  Taking all your breaks mandated by law is a fairy tale to them.  If you look like you want to ask for a break outside of your 30 min lunch, you will be crucified.  And the worst thing is that you are always understaffed and working beyond your shift.  However, I did meet and work with good people who were trying to work through the mess for each other."
bad,"stocked shelves, set up for next weeks sales, worked on cash register"
bad,A few years ago walgreens was the ish.... now the company is doin to many changes that are not for the better
bad,"Helping customers locate, assist, and checkout products, filling and stocking the entire store Assisting manager to modify the price and sale, also inventory. "
bad,I loved working at Walgreens but my store had very poor management and they didnt take the time to really select good workers for our store
bad,"Poor compensation for the demands, too many cut backs in hours and staff"
bad,"If you are in retail this may be the place for you. Just beware you will not have a personal life as you will owe your time and scheduling to the company's needs versus your own needs. Managers - some are good and some are real bad. The bad ones make the company look bad, especially when they iginore corporate polices and run the store as if they own it themselves. "
bad,"walgreens used to be a great place to work, not anymore, they're cutting hours left and right. even when we're producing at high level, corporate greed is crazy"
bad,"Working at walgreens has been the worst job that I've had so far. Stocking shelves and working the photo machine on a regular basis was far from stimulating. The best part was having customers come in to ask for advice or just help with the photo kiosks. Not only could I stretch my photo-wings a bit, but it allowed me to connect with some of them and sometimes, really impress them. Unfortunately, this was always frowned upon by management as there were other tasks around the store to complete. Many times, these tasks involved moving around sections to places they were moved away from just a week ago. The store was very busy and many times this would only frustrate customers because they did not know where items were. Finding items and dealing with management was the difficult part. However, the rewards for seeing how happy a person was with their photos, cards, posters, and especially, their canvas prints were insurmountable."
bad,"If not seeking schooling for a pharmacy technician or pharmacist job there is absolutely zero support for student employees and is sometimes downright aggressive toward the idea of academics a real shame."
bad,"Rung up customers"
bad,Getting hired is easy. actually getting steady work is not. No set schedule until you have been there at least 5 years. Most store managers that you deliver to are unfriendly
bad,"very busy, not paid for amount of your you do, no work life balance, open 365 rain or shine"
bad,Enjoyed work at Walgreen's.Strong Retail Pharmacy knowledge and customer service.
bad,Company has decided to run stores with cheaper labor. Many managers years with years of experience are being forced to step down or move on.
bad,"Don't plan to stick around. If you have been promoted and make too much, you will be let go. They will find a reason."
bad,I started with this company almost 10 years ago. It felt like a family to work for them. Here recently with all their changes. They have managed to demand more and cut hours. I love the people I work with. I love our regular customers but feel so sorry for the fact that we can't provide the same great amount of customer service that we were once able to. Very sad that Walgreen's has chose to fill their pockets with more money but to only treat the people that work for them as if they were worthless! It saddens me greatly! I really appreciate helping our customers to the fullest extent. Just sad that we no longer get the time to do so.
bad,Walgreen's work ethics varies on locations and is defined by management and district manager.
bad,This employer was under staffed and expected you to live in the prison. Most of the time I had to work 16 hour shifts 6 days straight before I get an off day.
bad,"Not a very loyal company. Alot of politics based on who you know, likes and dislikes, and race.This company over works and under pays there employees. They expect your life to eat , breath, and sleep Walgreens. They are quick to transfer you with out notice, and use persinal vendettas to exploit and abuse authority."
bad,"Ever since a back fiscal year in 2005, Walgreens has been making drastic moves ""restructuring"". This often meant severe pay cuts, stripping of benefits and more. Awful job. Awful pay. Awful work environment."
bad,A typical day is getting done things that need to be accomplished for that day. Each day in cosmetics is like a building block for the next day. Assisting customers with a warm friendly attitude even if they are having a bad day.
bad,"The store is very busy and there is always work to be done but there is to much gossip, favortisim, and attitude problems in the work place. There is also health concerns in the store."
bad,"I love working with people, customer especially, I knew most of them after being there for a while. I tried my hardest to get as much training even completing their course for the Pharmacy certification test. I passed the pre test but quit before I got the certication. I am signing up to take the test, I am just studying now for it since I just found out I can do it on my own. I like the job even though there was days that were real hard for me if we didnt have the correct staff, which we were understaffed alot. I like a challenge and this job was definately that."
bad,As an assistant manager you are expected to work as if your life depended on it with little or no help from upper management. Store managers are usually males that take advantage of female workers. They do not allow time off for family and other life events that happen outside of work. They do not train properly and expect you to know what they lack to teach. The pay was great but since they pay you so well they feel as if they can walk all over you. They will transfer you with less than 24 hour notice to a store that more than likely will be 35+ miles away from your home.
bad,"Good job for teenagers, not for single mothers, gives younger people a place in the job market but not for single mothers who can't work night shifts."
bad,Ever since the departure of Express Scripts Walgreens has been failing miserably. Hours have been cut and jobs have been taken away.
bad,"A job description for an Office Manager indicates that a BA is required. Yet, they promoted a high school dropout into such a position. Though she started from the ground up, and certainly had a moderate level of experience, it takes far more than that to be an effective, efficient, and respected manager of people."
bad,"They treated you poorly, if something is confidential they will tell it anyway. They have no respect for their employees. Managers expect you to do all these things while they sit in the office on their phone going thru Facebook. The training is horrible. If you do something wrong because you weren't trained correctly it's still your fault. They never give you praise for a job well done."
bad,Very much corporation thought and mentality. Your only as good as your proformance.  Worked for them for many years and I never received even a cost of living raise that I didn't beg for. Seen many people fired under the pretext of theft so that they wouldn't have to pay unemployment. Walgreens works if you put your head down and put up and shut up.
bad,"Overall employment there is fairly good, atmosphere is good a  little flexibility, there is support from team mentors there, There are areas of computer network that could be approved"
bad,They don't care about the employees. Do the workload of three people and still not good enough for a raise. Let thieves walk out with the store but check out the employees for their pop and chips they buy.
bad,"It was a interesting position."
bad,"Models and delivers a distinctive and delightful customer experience. "
bad,"Why was company used to focus on employee longevity and a good customer experience, it has lost much of that and is more focused on stock value and is willing to make cuts in any area to achieve that"
bad,"Management is so unprofessional and incompetent, there's so much expected of you with little to no time. The pay should be better for the things you have to deal with."
bad,You are not put in a position to succeed. It has become micro management at its worse. The store manager does not run the daily operations. Our days are pre planned from 8 to 5 and if anything gets you off task you might as well plan on staying extra hours if you don't want any trouble
bad,"After 2 years working at Walgreens, I finally broke free. Co-workers are lazy and as a former cashier, I had to do everything. It's ok job as a stepping stone."
bad,The best part of working for this company was the training I did at another Walgreens location. They were much more organized and courteous of each other. Whereas the store I worked at was horrible. The store management was terrible and the staff was rude and unwelcoming.
bad,"Walgreens has become more about the money and less about their employees.  They are offing less pay, hours cut through the store,and wanting you do way more work. They are open 365 days a year even on holidays."
bad,"Too many changes in direction and aggressive cost cutting have soured what has been a decent experience at Walgreens. I've enjoyed working with many people there, but be prepared for rapid, seemingly pointless, changes in direction."
bad,"For 4 years I did the same thing every single day, ""Welcome to Walgreens! Welcome to Walgreens!"" The worst! I wasn't given a raise for the last two years and the opportunity for advancement is slim. The advance who they like most or if your bilingual you have a shot. It wasn't all bad though. The hours were flexible enough for me to work a second job without my hours conflicting and transferring to another location isn't a hassle either. Management SUCKS!"
bad,Never train management about anything and then blame you when you don’t know or understand. Move you around too often and without knowledge. Every store has different policies and rules which they don’t tell you about.
bad,"Working at this establishment, I learned how Important it is to prioritize the customers wants and needs. I have developed a new sense of patience and problem solving skills."
bad,"never clear direction and constantly told the exact same thing by 5 different members of management, which did not communicate with one another so confusion and misunderstanding were common place."
bad,"Not a huge fan, management sucks, nobody communicates and it's a terrible environment. You don't get any recognition for anything you do. I go home wanting a new job everyday. Plus, nobody is on the same page. Things change all the time. Also, the pay isn't what I was expecting."
bad,The pharmacy started off being the only and best pharmacy I'd want to have worked with starting in the early 2000s.  That is now the opposite. Don't work here.
bad,"It’s not a bad or good place to work it’s a lot of fake ness that goes on in the store the management from shift leads all the way to store manager really don’t know what they are doing, and it’s a lot of drama throughout the store and it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth and as far as moving up they pick and choose who they feel they want to promote in that store they don’t base it off of how long you been with the company or what all you know by being there so long they promote people I feel shouldn’t be promoted. And it’s just no kind of structure in the whole store and it starts from management they get in order and so will the rest of the store and then maybe then it wouldn’t be a bad place to work."
bad,I would work at Walgreens again friendly work environment provide a good customer service I would definitely refer friends and family to work at Walgreens
bad,"Staff is short and upper management refuses to give stores enough resources to alleviate this. As a result, staff is constantly stressed and patients are left unsatisfied."
bad,"I feel that Walgreens has the potential to be a great company to work for, but the store I was hired on at has many policies I disagree with. I find the store manager and assistant manager contradicting each other/themselves far too often. I also don't agree with how the district manager manages the district, therefore I am currently looking for a new company to work for."
bad,Processed and filled prescription orders efficiently with prioritizing tasks along the workflow; assisted pharmacist's job permissible by law and one's capabilities
bad,"Some managers and some stores are fine. Others are awful and can't keep staff. The payroll hours fluctuate a lot. Good luck getting 40 all the time, you have to pick up shifts all over town. The insurance is only affordable if its only an individual , add anyone else and its 4x the price at minimum. Not an exaggeration. Often short handed and if a customer complains about you by name you can be fired."
bad,Management at Walgreens are not treated well. They are paid better than some entry level employees but that doesn't say much. there is a hard limit on how many hours you are allowed to budget into the schedule a week and there is no way for everything to get done without the salaried management working 50+ hours.
bad,"While there were days where work was not too much and co workers were fun to speak to and customers, too much was asked of you as just a simple cashier and you could be held responsible for some assignments not getting done if management could not step up to the task of actually leading and making a plan on how to get things finished. While it's not the most difficult job, overtime the atmosphere of unhappiness and stress can catch up to you and make the time at the store miserable, especially when very little help was provided while there was a rush and the cashier was left alone to handle it on their own."
bad,"-You will be given several task through out the day with no reasonable time to finish them, yet higher ups expects you to complete these task while maintaining A+ customer service."
bad,"The Walgreens I worked at was a clean store. Nice environment. Daily tasks were fairly easy. The pay was decent. Co- workers were nice to get along with, but management needed to stay true to there word and not play into favoritism. There is definite room for improvement"
bad,"Do not come here unless you are looking for a challenge as an assistant store manager trainer. You will do everything, don't think you are the stuff because you have a degree, that don't mean anything."
bad,"I would steer just about anyone away from working here at this point.  Repeated hour and benefit cuts.  Tier 5 stores running on bare bones crews, neglect or half assed attempts of most required tasks (Outdates, Rotating Stock ect.)  Most employees are just itching to get out of there."
bad,"Leads are lazy. Management is worse."
bad,"The pay was decent. Enough to live off of, but as a Shift Lead you do not get breaks. I got 2 lunch breaks out of my entire 2 years in this position. Never got a 15 minute break. Always understaffed and because of that you get into trouble for tasks not being completed."
bad,It's an okay place to work. They dont care about your personal life as long as they have a body to be at work that day. But there is room for advancement if you want.
bad,The work itself isn't bad but the managers make it miserable.  If you do your job effectively then congrats now you get to do someone else's job and still get told you need to do better.
bad,Walgreens is not the same Walgreens when I started 20yrs ago. They lack in a lot of CARE for their employees. The cuts on budget is ridiculous and we are always understaffed. They expect you to do pretty much everything with not enough people. Sadly to say but Walgreens is a place I wouldn’t recommend anyone.
bad,On a normal  day the work day  includes handling  customer  service  issues and problems  that arises from that. We also deal with merchandising  the story's ends and sides . We also did with issues in our pharmacy  and our photo department.
bad,"They cut our hours beyond belief, leaving shift managers doing all the work. I wouldn’t recommend anyone work here now. They used to give us commission now it’s not heard of. The company just wants us to kiss up to customers and not hold to company policy. It’s a wreck"
bad,"I was a manager in training, did everything that the store manager was paid to do while he was there, and away. You work hard and get paid like 16hr starting off. The manager trainee program is a waste of time and money, especialy if you are a minority and have a 4 year degree while your store manager doesn't have one. You will have problems not only with the manager but your co-workers too, he, she, and they will be reluctant to train you. because of being in fear of losing their position to some one  greater than than them."
bad,"In a typical day you do not have time to accomplish all that needs to be accomplished.  There are not enough payroll hours allocated, especially to the pharmacy. It is very stressful when you don't have completely trained technicians in the pharmacy which is always the case.  They get backed up, and then call for managers to help them which are less trained.  The managers now can't do their jobs and it all snowballs."
bad,"It’s an ok place to work but there is no team work, mangers don’t act like mangers , the women are petty and childish, no one wants to help when there is an IC3. You get punished for not following a rule that mangers let others get away with, and the pay is low for all the things that want you doing at once."
bad,"This job makes you do to much work and you get payed poorly. Upper Management don't care about there associates, just care about there stores and there sales."
bad,"Management sucked at the location; very high amount of people quit cause of them. No help with corporate either, nothing was ever fixed. Do not recommend if you have any health issues. FMLA wasn’t the greatest set up. Plus counted “call-ins” when at the hospital. Only get 5 and verbal warning; 6 written warning; 7 you’re terminated. Don’t work here... go elsewhere. New hires get more than me after being there a year. No raises"
bad,"Unprofessional, lot of gossip & backlighting. Policy changes CONTINUOUSLY. Bare minimal pay raises. Year by year benefits decreasing. Need base pay & maximum pay for each level increased."
bad,Please do not work here unless you aspire to become store manager or a pharmacist. Any other position is worthless. You will miss out on opportunities to spend with family and friends. Your job will be your life. There is a good possibility of working 6 days out of the week if full time. Terrible work life balance.
bad,"Nothing to say about this job except the pay could be better, but beggars can’t be choosers at this point when you are looking for someplace to work.."
bad,"Walgreens as a company has gone downhill in regards to compensation and benefits. The people who work in the extremely busy stores are in no way compensated for that extra work and always short staffed. Also, the managers make more than four or five times as much as an assistant manager."
bad,"no comments, due to a personal believe I don't like to share any resent or former employer review. no place to advance in career and their salary is a disadvantage with the amount of work."
bad,"The position evolved in a telemarketing position. Making a high volume of outbound calls everyday, which is now the position is advertised. No benefits for six months."
bad,"Micromanaging at it's finest, they have taken most of the managers empowerment away and cookie cut every store. Pay has gone down and bonuses have been lowered. Turn over is at a all time high."
bad,Corporate would cut down hours to the extent that only a mod and 1 cashier performing all closing duties which kept getting longer.. During daytime scheduling management spent a majority of time in the office. Treated people as disposable.
bad,"Wasn’t the worst experience, but definitely expected more. Management is all over the place and no matter how hard you work, it won’t get recognized. Never will get hours. Sometimes was good about time off for other needs but not always. It worked for time being but probably wouldn’t work at another one again"
bad,Nice company to work for nice benefits nice business Good experience Nice people to work for learn a lot always busy fun environment busy environment learning environment
bad,"A typical day is spent doing too many tasks with not enough help. They expect us to accomplish our assigned tasks and help the customers at the same time, which is difficult at best and overwhelming at worst. A typical shift consisted of 1 shift manager, 1 cashier and 1 floor associate to handle all incoming deliveries, stocking shelves, customer issues and keeping the store clean and presentable."
bad,"Non stop work, no breaks, frequently missed lunches. Constant complaints from customers, co-workers and Management. No one to speak to about concerns."
bad,"If your in high school, this is a good after school job as long as you do your job and show up.  Management is concerned more about sales and watching your hours."
bad,I enjoyed the customer's they made the job worth coming back to. Management worked against me. I was not treated as a valued worker. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,It's an alright job for someone who isn't fully supported on this job. It's stressful and very detail-oriented and the pay isn't high enough for all..
bad,"I’ve been here for three years and I am mentally and physically drained. Not enough hours. The pay isn’t great and  not enough employees. It’s a decent job to get some experience, but I wouldn’t make a life long career out of it."
bad,"If you are desperate and just want a stepping stone job to hold on to until something better comes along, then go and work for them. They will work you like a slave."
bad,"Good first job, very relaxed and laid back. I ran into multiple problems with management. Seniority doesn’t mean much at Walgreens. Multiple hour cuts, budget cuts, inconsistent hours and scheduling errors."
bad,"Sadly, the company is collapsing. Walgreen's stock is tanking. Now they are cutting costs in all the wrong placesin an effort to compensate. I am looking for another job before i get laid off."
bad,The company does not care about their employees and are constantly cutting hours and benefits. The workplace culture is toxic. The hardest part of the job is that management will not back you up.
bad,"They will hire and help anyone to advance bc each manager is required to promote a supervisor to Assistant Store Manager in Training. Its a trap honestly. They can and will move you as they wish. My manager was moved over a weekend. I had ASM moved without prior notice. I was moved as a shift lead and never knew that if i said no they wont force me to. Walgreens fail to help shift lead with the proper time to train and assist in Pharmacy. Also, very limited support from manager. Rcvd a raisw to 14.29 for my position as Supervisor, minimum wage went up and my position minimum wage pay was 14.25, they wouldnt raise my pay even with the raise of minimum wage. Management would support me in raising the issue. Full time for walgreens is 30 hours a week. Shift leads are guaranteed their hours, however my management did not give me that even with more seniority."
bad,Not enough pay for the work required. The job is hard enough without poor management. Very flexible hours is the only reason I’m still here after 18 months.
bad,"Cons- The biggest issue I have had with Walgreens is the fact that getting promoted is almost impossible. Some managers will drag you down. Walgreens would much rather hire from outside of the company then to hire from within the company and to promote those who truly deserve it. They truly are not concerned with your best interest. They will use you for whatever they need and it doesn’t matter what the employee wants. Out of all of the store managers I have had at the multiple stores I have worked at in the past couple of years have been pretty terrible to say the least. I often wonder how they got their title as “Manager”. One managers opinion of an employee will be passed along throughout the district. If one manager dislikes you for any reason, good luck finding a new start. Walgreens is full of gossip. Another con is Walgreens often gets budget cuts which makes them have a limited amount of hours for the schedule. Some employees get laid off but in a very unprofessional way- They will start scheduling that employee much less without any notice and before they know it, they could be out of a job. "
bad,Walgreens is going down hill and I would not recommend them as an employer. The retail staff is overworked and under compensated. Poor leadership from the top on down.
bad,Walgreens was taken over by a European millionaire who has drastically changed the culture. They are now into making money off the backs of the under appreciated employees Store managers are salaried and forced to work more and more hours due to corporate cutting the hours back for the staff. They now get impossible goals for the stores to obtain to further hold the wages down. Overall a toxic environment to suffer through. Most store managers I knew had been with them for over 20 years left in the last year. They would rather work for less anywhere else.
bad,"I have worked for this company for over  four years. I have been passed over for promotions several times when I know that I am more than qualified. Managers have played favorites and given promotions to who they like, rather who is a better employee. As a shift lead, I had to supervise, help pharmacy, run photo, and sometimes even work the register. This position requires way too much for the pay. This place will drain you if you stay too long. If you aren't moving up the way you want, don't waste your time. Move on."
bad,"Terrible place to work.They use you,calling you in to work extra shifts when people call out, but when you want days off and put it in the computer well in advance they don't always honor it.Assistant manager made mistake on schedule even after time off had been approved and then expected staff to work anyways or get coverage.Allow certain employees to goof off,take prolonged breaks, etc. , but the employees who work hard, get job done, come in to cover absences, and work extra shifts are never appreciated for what they do.District people don't reply to concerns or complaints from employees about managers.They will use and abuse you"
bad,If you can't or don't want to stand for 8 hrs this is not the job for you. Weird hours. Saturday hanging sale tags sucks hard on your back and body. customers are rude
bad,Only cooperate gets paid fairly. Most employees do not make enough for cost of living. Big turn around with manager. 90% of staff are only there for paycheck and do not care about the store or customers. Walgreens needs strict shoplifting policy instead of take whatever you want policy that is in place now.
bad,"During the interview I was told that the store closed at 10 and that if I was asked to close i wouldn't be leaving the store later than 11. Immediately upon being hired, our location changed their hours to closing at midnight. This meant that every night I closed, I wouldn't get home until 1 am, sometimes even later depending on how much cleaning I had left to do once we closed the doors. "
bad,It's impossible to have a social life since they'll schedule you to close at 10pm and open the next day at 7am. One senior tech has been there forever so don't expect to advance. She's rude and acts as if she runs the pharmacy by constantly barking orders and treating the other techs like they're incapable of working their stations without a drill sergeant. The pay is terrible for the workload and the location is less than desirable. A police escort to your car is needed if you work a late shift due to drug addicts flooding the area.
bad,"The work place was lackluster to the least. Each day was another mundane set of repetitious tasks, that provided no incentives to grow with the company."
bad,"It really depends on the store manager you have.  Having a great manager drives you to do your best work and you begin to strive to become a better you. They give you the knowledge and opportunity for you to move up the chain, as the chance arises."
bad,I can say that when I started working for Walgreen's it was suppose to be a part time position. I already had a full time job just wanted to make more money. I learned a lot about he job and loved the other employees there as well as the management team. We all worked together and got things done. I was a customer service agent but I knew and the taught me how to do management things
bad,"Walgreen's is a nice company to work for and there are a lot of great benefits. Pay is decent and you do gain pto after your first 6 months. The thing that really pains me is that it is all a numbers game with corporate. Every week your Pharmacy manager and store manger will come up with some other excuse why you and your staff are preforming under expectation. The opportunity for growth and longevity for employment with the company is great but on the other hand your are just a number. A statistic with a face and they treat there customers and interactions with others stores just the same. There is so much gossip going around and rumors and whispers of what corporate is gonna do next. I just want to show up and do my job, not having to worry about how the next wave of change is going to disrupt my daily routine."
bad,If you're looking to advance it is very hard to do so. This company has locations all of the country and advancement is hard to come by due to other employees from other sites usually get the positions.
bad,Over worked and under paid would not recommend no one to work there management acts like there better than you and not a family atmosphere the pay is only $9 a hour for multiple job descriptions
bad,This place is okay. No place to grow and develop any skills. They will replace you in a heartbeat with no remorse. Always feel underappreciated. Store manager never communicate back to this employees.
bad,An easy job but it really depends who you're working with. No raises or incentives for long time employees. Managers could be very hit or miss. Upper management was unhelpful and judgemental.
bad,"i wasnt there very long because i was an intern, but everyone was very nice! They seemed to be really low on hours so i was there a lot since i was unpaid."
bad,"The job itself was not that bad. They worked around your schedule and would give you the hours if you needed it. The only bad thing was the pay, it was barely above minimum wage."
bad,"I originally applied as a part time employee being that I am a full time student at Miami Dade College. I had believed a part time job was anywhere from 20-25 hours, and that was not the case with the Walgreens I worked at, I would have to work 30+ hours every week and still go to school. The managers at the Walgreens store I work for are unprofessional, unreliable, and unreasonable. Not once have they listened to the many things I have told them with the hours I have been working, it is unfair and unprofessional. I speak only for the Walgreens I worked for this is not to bash on every other Walgreens I'm sure their are better Walgreens elsewhere."
bad,Walgreens is a stressful environment and it seems like training employees are expected to know everything right away there is no set schedule and it’s hard to have a life out of work
bad,"Work fast pace environment"
bad,"I was not happy workinge here, no place to move up. Did way too much work, with no benfits. Was not a job for the long run for me. Somethig to hold while I went to school."
bad,Walgreen's was a fine job for short term while I really needed something. I was in school and needed flexible hours. Every time I wanted to advance or applied for a new position available in store and was told I would be perfect for it someone outside would be hired and not last. I did enjoy meeting some of the people I did during my time there and working in a calm atmosphere.
bad,"I volunteered to do a conversion in another state. When I came back to work someone had transferred into my position and no other position was available for me to transfer into. There are other circumstances involved, but that's it in a nutshell."
bad,"In my experience, Walgreen Pharmacy, was also not one of the best positions, i have held in my career. They Company made it difficult to achieve promotions, move up in the Company, which in turn made it difficult to enjoy working for the Company for many years."
bad,"Walgreens is not a good job for adults with bills. They barely give you hours, they could care less about the employees, and it’s a money hungry company. They are buying up different companies but won’t give their employees hours or decent pay.."
bad,"Very stressful, favoritism, never concistant work hours, unreliable employees always calling out, write ups over things you can't control, old employees being pushed out by new manager"
bad,"We recently found out my mom's diagnosis had worsen.  Myself as the primary care giver had worked for 14 months at Walgreens. I told my store manager right away as soon as I had learned the news. 4 days later I was asked to into the managers office and was told I would be given a breathalyzer and drug test. I hadn't had a break and asked if I could walk out and smoke.  I was told no even when I asked if the manager could walk out with me. After waiting for some time and being very stressed I was told I could leave and wait to hear from employee relations.  I went to employee relations at cooperate as well as my district manager and I was told I was terminated.  I just really needed some help and that was the way my store manager showed she cared.  I worked every holiday,  I was there whenever they called me in and when I was having a huge problem in my life,  terminated is how they truly cared about me"
bad,Good to learn the practice and become familiar with meds and typing and how to solve insurance denials and problems. But hours are not stable or secure.
bad,I cant say much because I was just there for a month or two as an extership. The time I was there I noticed that people work hard and multi task. Staff are supportive.
bad,Over the years this company has done a complete 360 when it comes to its employees.  The company used to be employee oriented while still focusing on customer service.  Now its only concern is the dollar.
bad,"Listen to your employees, promote from within hire staff that are willing to work train employees v. telling them and expecting results overnight without any help from upper management"
bad,"As a technician you are a cashier first, insurance agent second, and a pharmacy technician third. The benefit are ok, pay was ok, but the amount of work and lack of accountability and inconsistent policies leads to work frustration.  Lack of a normal schedule and working every other weekend is also a draw back."
bad,"It was a great first job, i learned that you must have barriers between  coworkers. The management as far as the assistant manager and store manager at the location i worked at was horrible and extremly unprofessional. I would alot of the time not get a lunch or break. I loved the people i worked with for the short time they worked there before quitting. Lack of staffing at my location as well."
bad,"I loved working for Walgreens (31years). However I don't like working with mean people,jealous or hateful people in management.i lost my job because I was set up to break a new rule,lost my job but management still has her job!I would never go back to work for walgreens.period"
bad,"No praise for anything good you do, they focus on all bad. They expect a lot from you and give nothing in return. For being here as long as I was and for achieving as much as I did, I feel as if I should get praised a little more."
bad,"Walgreens treats its employees almost as bad as Walmart. Extremely low wages for practically the hardest work in the industry.  You get paid for being a cashier and a technician at the same time, which some places allow, but Walgreens already chooses to short staff every department in order to save on bonuses and profit at employee expense. Terrible place to work."
bad,"typical work night was very busy, i learned time management and also to multitask. Upper management was not good. Hardest part of job was the weekends tagging the store. most enjoyable was meeting new customers"
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here unless your not type to stay on your feet and keep moving. It was a really depressing job just because all your customer base would be sad old people that would constantly be taking out the anger a you.
bad,"it could have been better. the management was not that great, and there were def favorites. and the hours sucked because the management did not let us know ahead of time when we worked"
bad,"This place was very unappreciative of the staff. They rewarded us will sending us to other locations when they"" couldn't give hours"" at your home store."
bad,"only do this job while in school. "
bad,"This company pressures the workers into sale pitches and heavily forces its employees to meet quotas for things in the ad, immunizations, 90 day refills, autopay, etc."
bad,"A typical day consists of greeting and serving customers and attending to daily tasks typical for the position.  I feel that I am valued by the customers but little by the company and management. That is the hardest part of this job, Best part of the job are the customers and how they appreciate what you do and tell you so."
bad,"Walgreens used to be a wonderful company to work for. They really cared about their employees and it showed. Now, they have gone so far downhill in every sense of the word that it's terrible. Management could not be any worse, and they're so greedy that customers and employees alike are suffering. I would no longer recommend them to anyone. I miss the old values of Walgreens very much."
bad,"I have been a long time manager for Walgreens. When I first started, there was great opportunity to move up and get promotions. The base pay and bonuses were great too.  Over the last several years,there have been so many cuts to the pay, to hours given to stores with the general expectation still being to do more and more, while being given less and less.  It has now come to the point of sheer rediculousness.  There is no incentive for people with a college education to get into the manager role with this company.  The pay is not enough and the expectation for people to put up with all that they are expected to do is just plain crazy.  Well educated and well trained people with management skills are much better off working elsewhere."
bad,"Rite-Aid (as a client of Walgreens) still fell under the management of Rite-Aid, which had little interest in the well being of its employees. It was driven by sales and lack of hours to work with. In other words, employees on the sales floor were expected to do twice the amount of work for half the pay by themselves for at the very least 3-6 hours daily in order to stay within a semi-strict budget. This meant that there were very few opportunities for growth, training, or any type of learning and development provided by upper management. While this was mainly a problem produced by corporate, store level management was left at a lacking point as well, providing little support in the areas of growth. Walgreens was doing a much better job of supporting the function of providing assistance, however, the transition between entities left somethings to be desired. Overall, the management formed a tight niche to which they would select very few employees to help, and the rest were left behind. This allowed the company to coach the employees out, and not up."
bad,Company used to care about it’s employees and patients. Now all they care about is making it appear as if they do by pressuring employees/patients to give them good reviews to make it seem like it’s a good place to work and shop. It’s all just misconstrued information transformed to get the results they want.
bad,bad management. overworked low pay. work EVERY holiday. hours are horrible.  i would not recommend walgreens to any person. worst place to work literally.
bad,Easiest place to save money is cutting labor costs. In my 3 years I have seen hours reduced each year. It is a very stressful place to work. I work in the pharmacy and we are given no breaks even though policy mandates it. Your hours will be cut from 40 to 20 for 4-5 months straight. If you count on enough hours to keep medical benefits or pay the bills this is not the place for you .
bad,"I have always loved Walgreens.  I have become very tired of all the bad messages that I have had to deliver to my subordinates.  I wish I didnt feel the need to leave, they have really messed up with their most recent changes."
bad,Management is not effective.  They expect you to do too much with no help. The front and pharmacy are treated like to separate entities.   Management needs to be better.
bad,"Era un empleo que te mantenia en todo momento en tension por las filas, visitas sorpresas. Pero me gustaba el poder dar un buen servicio al cliente."
bad,"The job itself wasnt extremely difficult but the amount of weekends and holidays that I was expected to work was absolutely ridiculous. Walgreen's doesn't pay well enough to be a ""required holidays"" company in my opinion. If you expect people to work through blizzards, tornado's, and Christmas, then there is NO EXCUSE for not paying your employees a competitive wage. Walgreen's brags about their billions in profit every year but can't pay the foot work folk more than minimum wage?? And don't even get me started on their pharmaceutical schemes. They literally pay there cashiers a dollar amount for every person who you can talk into getting a flu shot. I just can't get behind a company like that."
bad,Don't train you at all its kind of throw you in and they hope you float and make it. Corporate also doesn't give a lot of hours to the stores and then the store is overstaffed which leads to people not getting a lot of hours.
bad,"I had over 10 years of experience as a pharmacy tech but was still talked to as if I was not only un-knowlegeable, but adolescent.Often, I was stuck with doing the work of three people because of the high rate of turnover. The managing pharmacist was very racist, and it was evident in her interactions with myself and other persons of color."
bad,"Assistant managers do all the work while the store manager do office work."
bad,"Terrible management. a lot of changes needed to be made, but if you say something you get written up for it. They cannot find enough people to work there because of their hours they work."
bad,"Been trying to get the Senior Technician status for some time now and it had not yet happened. Walgreens does not compensate me for training, although I am training other employees."
bad,"Taking away PTO hours from employees who have worked for more than 15 years is a true slap in the face."
bad,"They require too much from the employees with limited hours.  It's very stressful, not enough training to the employees, and limited staff.  All those aspects take away from patient care."
bad,"The entire time I have been at Walgreens I have been going to school. I have never worked for a company more unwilling to let people educate themselves. While yes, they did work with my schedule, once I got near graduating the store manager started trying to change my schedule, and generally make my life as miserable as possible. Never, ever work for Walgreens. I can not stress that enough. They don't pay enough, and are open every single day of the year, including Christmas. It is rough."
bad,Management never directly addressed any questions asked.  Zero accountability. Poor leadership. Schedule changes without notice. Petty attitudes from leadership
bad,"The job itself was not really bad, and there was no one thing that made me leave. "
bad,I did not like working here bc they push to hard and never would have never made it far there being yelled at for no reason but that's how I feel and would never go back
bad,"It's an ok job that requires patient with upper management and customer, and if you don't know someone in the top management, you will never get advance."
bad,Company completely cuts hours all the time. Unrealistic expectations to meet especially in urban areas. Treats store level employees like dirt when we are the ones on the front line every single day
bad,"Very disappointed in the direction this company has gone."
bad,"I was not very happy being a brand new employee, in a new market in Springfield and having company experienced managers train as if the new employee should already know what to do. The training program was not healthy, nor helpful."
bad,"Managers movie in an out constantly."
bad,Job is very fast paced with little down time a low pay. This job is only a good job if you plan on being in the same position for yearsor if you are just doing it for extra income on the side.
bad,"My first store was a good experience....learned a lot, with a hard-working team. The next store not so much. The female manager didn't seem to like another female being in her store, or maybe it was that she knew I didn't like her laziness. She let certain employees get away with pretty much anything while she sat in the office all day. The other managers had to do all the work. And god forbid you have a family emergency! Karma  sucks! Onto bigger and better things. The things I still hear about this company and the things they do to employees amazes me."
bad,What they require of their management is criminal. Working 50-70 hour work weeks with no overtime and a poor bonus structure doesn't motivate you to excel. Couple that the lack of loyalty on the companies part and you have a recipe for an unhappy experience.
bad,"A store manager can make or break how you feel about the company. It depends on how driven a manager is as to how you are treated. Out of 5 store managers, I only had one that I thought was a good store manager."
bad,"I took a job as a floating pharmacist with the understanding that schedules would be out 4 to 6 weeks in advance. In reality it was rarely out even one or two weeks ahead, and only a skeleton schedule at best. It was not uncommon to get a phone call at 7 in the morning asking me to work at 8, or a call at 11 in the morning asking me to work at 1.  In 18 months I worked in 57 different pharmacies in five different cities.  Shifts were all over the board (opening, closing, weekend, overnight), with no consistency at all, making it extremely difficult to plan around. Training was poor, management was apathetic, and communication with the float staff was nonexistent.  Working conditions were difficult and stressful. Support staff competency was inconsistant,  hardware and software failures were common, low employee moral was pervasive, and the only time you ever got a true meal break was the rare occasion when you were working at a store with pharmacist overlap.   Most of the time, however, you are the sole pharmacist on duty (or possibly the only employee on duty) and good luck getting a bathroom break let alone a chance for a meal break. I had to be very careful with my fluid intake to strike that tenuous balance of drinking enough to stay hydrated, but not enough to need to use the restroom.  The pay was mediocre, and as a salaried pharmacist  I was only paid for the length of the scheduled shift, and not the time actually worked.  And since the vast majority of the pharmacies are understaffed, leaving at the end of your shift is almost never an option.  I lost track of the number"
bad,"Even if you've worked at the store the longest if you aren't a mother of an elderly you get no hour priority even if you accomplish the job better than your co-workers. Wouldn't recommend for younger workers as if you work with older people there is a severe lack of respect and professionalism. Overall negative job depending on who you work with. I learned how to handle customers as well as how to handle long lines well without need of help as on some days you won't have any. A typical day consists of 7-9 hours of customer service in the front of facing on the floor with occasional customer assistance needs. Hardest part of the job is working with others, especially if they misunderstand your role and perceive this as you not doing your job properly. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping nice customers and leaving."
bad,"Just as the title states...poor management, poor team. No one works well together. Everyone creates trouble in an already problematic environment. My store needs serious revision."
bad,"Managers or TLs were very snotty, you  really didn't get recognized as much for good work. You take up tp 300 calls a day, So not really any time in  between calls to take in a deep breath and take the next call. That bad! breaks , well by law you need a lunch, and a 30 depending what state you live in other that I wouldn't work there again. Zero room for advancing unless you want to be a pharmacist which they wont help you with your education like they promise they will when they hire you"
bad,Walgreens used to care about it's employees. Then at the end of my career there. They didn't care that I had 15 yrs of service. They started treating me like I was just hired. I was good at my job. I loved it the beginning. You were treated like family. They cared and then they stopped. Everything changed and it made me sad.
bad,Gets stressful when it gets busy and low on staff because you feel like you are doing so much for only one person. Then when it is not busy the job is relaxed and not ao stressful.
bad,"Overall walgreens is a horrible place to work, its very boring, shift leads are shifty. There are no incentives, no perks, and management is not very good with communications"
bad,Management on all levels was a joke. No one cared about doing anything more than they had to. Workers came in and played on their phones and whined about problems.
bad,I asked to move from the beauty counter to pharmacy with the training I was supposed to receive. I got two days of training and was thrown back in the pharmacy and was expected to know all terminology and how things ran.
bad,"Its been many years since I've worked there, so a change in culture is possible.   But I found training to be minimal or poor at best.  Managers weren't very friendly and there was little to no flexibility in work schedule."
bad,"One of the managers at walgreens was amazing; however, the store manager was a very mean man, and was even meaner to me because I was young. He felt he did not have to address me, so we communicated through other people. He overloaded everyone with work."
bad,Working at Walgreens was a difficult time. I was stuck cashiering for 9 hour shifts at a stand that was too short for me and strained my back scanning items. lots of time where there wasn't anything for me to accomplish
bad,"After 9 years of being employed with Walgreens,there is no room for advancement in the field. Moral with the company has  become very low and there is less help to get the job done,the team work effort is very low standards,i would like to advance in my field as a highly motivated worker as i know i am competent off."
bad,"Selected digital images for printing, specified number of images to be printed, and directed to printer according to customer specifications. Produced color or black-and-white photographs, negatives, or slides, applying standard photographic reproduction techniques and procedures."
bad,"Walgreens was a little better to work for than CVS, but they managed by negativity and expected their busy pharmacists to act as cashiers when we should be concentrating on correctly filling medications."
bad,i liked the walgreens company but i did not like how they would taunt you about your position and make you feel less than and uncomfortable all in all id say still good company.
bad,"I am blessed with good people to work with. Our hours keep getting cut with a higher demand in work. I do not make enough money to justify the stress on my body. I do not make enough money to pay my rent, bills and live a healthy lifestyle."
bad,"too much  politics and influence of people who know people. in my explerience, a every young district manager was hired (around 30 ish) and weeded out a lot of middle aged seasoned pharmacist who had been with Walgreens for years and were very good employees"
bad,"It's a nice place to work, you can advance a few times then you quickly hit a cap and can not go any further. It has greatly grown more into what corporate wants and making their set ""numbers"" over the best overall care to patients."
bad,Walgreens doesn't shows they care about their employees and when you start working there they don't give you enough training. They also show favoritism.
bad,the job was good. the environment is very laid back and not really exciting. management was good. the job is very routine from day to day. the hours were good.
bad,Working in Walgreens in the very beginning was great in 2003. We had a decent amount of paid  holidays. We had vacation days and call in sick days. Techs would get bonuses. We also have 401k for every $1 we put in they put in $2. It was a good company to work for at one point . But it all went downhill after 2010 when we merged with Boots alliance a European based company. They decided to decrease our hours tremendously. Then they lowered the starting pay for techs from $15 to $13.50. They also started doing the PTO system where they combine the vacation days and sick days ( which I didn’t like ). Then because of the decreased hours there were not enough techs to help with such a busy store where the volume of scripts being filled are 350-  400a day. When we call for help from the front end of the store it’s never consistent. And super long lines! With not enough help.The pharmacy makes more money than the rest of the store. There’s not enough hours to give to have extra techs. So if anything  I am grateful for the opportunity I was given at Walgreens. I did learn a lot and continue to learn but it’s not worth the stress!
bad,Walgreen's Pharmacy is very fast paced environment which is fine when you know what you are doing but when you're new it can be very intimidating. The pay is terrible for what you do and all the responsibilities expected of you and experience isn't acknowledged either where your compensation is concerned.  The pharmacists I worked with were very nice and helpful even though they were stressed with their workload.
bad,I worked for The DME division not the retail store . They moved the DME billing to another state therefore I was out of a job and found new employment at EHSI
bad,i dont want to write a review. I dont want to leave walgreens but i am being forced because the seasonal hours are not enough to pay my bills. i like having a job i can depend on.
bad,Walgreens was horrible.  Management often put all tasks off on employees while they sit in the office.  Hours where short.  Forced to work on holidays.
bad,"At the time I was hired Walgreens was undergoing pay cuts, and letting employees go throughout the company. I worked overnight crew 10 hours per night, 4 nights a week. Nightly differential was 15 cents above minimum wage. Manned the cash register, stocked, cleaned, and inventoried the back all night. All shifts ran minimal crew and overtime not allowed."
bad,"Walgreen's has become like so many other large companies, too many inexperienced analyst writing policies without understanding one size doesn't fit all locations.   The lack of flexibility to do your job the best way you know/can, the lack of allowing critical input from first line Supervisors results in high turnover, poor candidate selection/training, and a constant downgrading of employee morale.  If you are just looking for a check, or general work experience, go for it, otherwise suggest to keep looking."
bad,fast pace busy warehouse continuous standing must lift at least 25 pounds picking restocking receiving shipping must pick items accurate and keep a clean environment must work as a team player must follow direction and work efficient  to provide best service for our customers
bad,"Not a great place to work at all. Management is clueless, and the team members pretty much do what they want to. Management don't care about there employees and management talks about pretty much everyone behind their backs. Not a good place to work. I am not sure about other locations but the location I worked at was terrible."
bad,I am seeking opportunity for advancement. I would like to own a business with the benefits of certain skills. I am eager to learn and have the determination of a team player. I am dependable with the ability of a flexible schedule.
bad,"Pay, the managers do what they want and you have to do everything else. it sucks. you cant get a raise unless your managers like you and give you a good yearly review."
bad,"Friendly environment, people friendly, Some Manager are nice working with.  You meet a lot of people. I really enjoyed working with the young ones who work for a part-timer."
bad,"Pharmacist take an oath - to first do no harm, the system is set up to push numbers, and it is impossible to actually focus on our patients & Meet metrics at the same level with little to no assistance; due to budget constraints( techs).  There has been a shift in leadership, and the store leaders are not invested in the health & well being of our patients; yet they are in control?   Again,  Immature leadership that responds accordingly ( 1) control what you can control  (2) take care of customer.   No matter what the question, this is the response?  This is definitely not the same company I started with; the founders were actually Pharmacist and they understood the complexities of our profession."
bad,"My store had just opened, and we were a very slow store. As a beauty advisor, we were not able to leave the beauty section for risk of theft. Required to do a beauty event every saturday to promote a product and boost sales."
bad,"Severely disappointed. Always short handed, never had proper training, even going into a management position. Was laid off due to lack of available hours, but was not told that 6 new employees were just hired that very same day. Had plenty of employees during day shift, but rarely any for nights. Would not recommend this business... still refuse to even go back to shop here because of how I was treated."
bad,Typical Retail.....Dealing with the public is the greatest challenge. As a pharmacist it is best to keep your business in house. Store managers (non-pharmacists) enjoy meddling in the pharmacy affairs.
bad,Suitable for a high school student. The atmosphere is a little immature so as I got older I wanted something more mature and I could not find that in this company.
bad,"Working at the 24 hour Walgreens Pharmacy that I work at is very tiring. There are always high volumes of customer going in and out of the store. we fill up to 1,000 + prescriptions a day. You are never getting board."
bad,I have been with Walgreen for many years. They don't work with  employees who have sick  children they are not a family company. Have worke20 years. Not much more i can say.
bad,"Hours get cut and hours get added, you never know when you're going to be working a lot or a little.  Management isn't fair when it comes to call outs either.  Often times having to pick up slack for people calling out."
bad,Walgreens was one of those places where you come in to work and have to work to be accepted into the employee line. By this I mean the coworkers I had were not helpful or inviting when I was trained in. It was one of the least like places I would return to. It was also very hard to advance from part time to full time employee unless taking on a much higher position.
bad,"worked as a cashier, basic office skills, order, inventory, customer service, entered prescriptions in computer, enter data, fill prescription, dispense medication to patient"
bad,"Management of all photo orders and supervision of the photo lab team associates.  Daily tasks included providing outstanding and friendly customer service to ensuring customer’s needs were met.  Provided safe work environment by ongoing assessment of my environment.  Handled shipment trucks on arrival unloading cartons and running product to designated areas in a timely fashion.  Restocked photo lab, electronics and food/freezer department.  Responsible for sales displays and creating appealing selling points in various departments."
bad,The position was very stressful. The overall company atmosphere was very pleasant. I learned a lot about how a pharmacy retail company operates on a day to day basis. My most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
bad,"However, they pay is subpar, considering how much the pharmacists get paid, you would think that that they could pay their technicians much more fairly. I worked here in college, and i made due, but i considering the level of stress one has to deal with in the day to day, compensation could be more fair."
bad,Needs work on management........................Learned a lot on my own. Training process needs work......Overall a good place to work....................
bad,"blue black green yellow orange red indigo violet.  turqoise sea green white blueish orange orangish blue blueish blue orangish orange.  Oh, and don't forget the purple."
bad,Waling ono egg shells cause the management cared more for our customers then the people who worked for them. if got a complaint they didn't care what happened they care that you got one. couldn't defend yourself on anything. and knowing you could get fired if they felt you weren't needed was not a good feeling.
bad,Working there for such a long period of time you'd think you would make more than incoming employees. But nom sadly the New hires with very little to NO experience were hired on with higher pay than me. And i had been working there 2 years. The managers have no respect for the fact that some employees have family. They aren't understanding or flexible. I have had the schedule changed on me without notice multiple times and the leave rules are ridiculous. They only allow you 6 days a YEAR to miss. Good luck with that.
bad,Fun place to work and enjoy all the personnel that work there. Training and leadership work hand in hand on a daily basis. Work conditions are fun and relaxing
bad,"Worked there since 2001, was a very stable and productive environment until 2010 when they began looking to sell company to someone. Since then there have been constant restructuring of the field and upper management. Tons of silly programs brought in from business consultants that do not add value to store operations. Ambiguous and often unobtainable goals."
bad,"Everything's about sales and constantly forced to meet unrealistic expectations and push some type of upgrade or ""special service"" on the customers. They put way too much stress on the employees shoulders. Expect to be constantly micromanaged and to work close-open shifts because ""it's what's best for the store"". There are a lot of nice customers who shop there, but unfortunately most of them are pretty nasty. I've been told it's just Jenison though."
bad,Walgreens has changed since I started working there. They are more concerned with tracking numbers and how much money they can make but not about the employees who help them make those numbers. The hourly wage for employees does not justify the amount of work walgreens wants them to do. Also I have never felt appreciated for anything I have ever done for this company.
bad,"not a good place to work, not enough hours. supervisors were unprofessional. no security on the job. lack of educated managers and employees. Low pay."
bad,"This was an awful place to work. Very cut throat, and it was always a ""hurry up & wait"" environment. Managers always passing off the buck for their own failures, and the client support teams not very cooperative with each other. Upper management never really showed any respect towards lower management nor the employee. Very low moral, and a lot of chiefs and no one wanted to be an indian."
bad,Good communication rarely exists on an everyday basis. Expected to work when sick and every holiday. Pay is low especially for what is expected of you. Lazy coworkers are continually allowed to act as if they have no accountability for their lack of work ethic.Personal   safety is unimportant from what I have witnessed while there. Management is moved around like some mad game of chess. Opportunities to implement sensible work practices are overlooked daily.
bad,"It was okay, however, at the time the pay was not the best I had to seek other source of income. I appreciate the opportunity to start as an entry level pharmacy tech."
bad,"I liked working for Walgreen’s Pharmacy, because it gave me the opportunity to learn and experience new adventures with inn the pharmacy industry.  it was a great experience."
bad,"The company is very to the point. If you want to advance, you must ask because your skill will not be recognized. The company requires full dedication. They'll repay hard work with more hard work."
bad,Corporate doesn't care about employees and makes more and more policies to follow which severely slows down productivity but wants increased production with less help.
bad,I loved working with the customers and management was great but this is not a place to work if you have children.  No sick leave and you have to beg to get vacation time off.
bad,Depending on what department you work will depend on how much or little you can enjoy your job here. I personally enjoy pharmacy work than front end cause it's more hectic.
bad,"Walgreens is self-destructing. They’ve put non-pharmacists in charge of the pharmacy, and patient care has become secondary to bigger and bigger profits. Pharmacists are over-worked and poorly trained technicians are often doing the majority of the work. Too much work for too few people equals mistakes being made"
bad,"The hourly pay is a joke. Extremely high school attitudes as far as management goes, but the worst part - as can be said for ninety nine percent of retailers - is the complete lack of understanding of a balance between life and work. If you do not wholly throw yourself into the job, you're penalized for it and given no freedom to deal with life outside of work. No shift flexibility, a near impossible hard-line when needing time off unless it's scheduled half a year in advance, and little compassion if the worst happens."
bad,Co worker are great but mana gamers need a lot of help. It's either her they don't care or their focus on the wrong things. In not enough hours for anyone trying to pay bills
bad,"with the changes in healthcare, wages are not competitive, but yet the responsibility they continue to add on you will increase with time, sometimes they don't do the best at training new technicians"
bad,Walgreens does a great job of making the customers that shop there feel welcome and taken care of but fails miserably at making sure its team members are just as happy and taken care of.
bad,A lot work hours during peak season. I love the discount employees get at the Walgreen's store. The employees have worked for the company as many as 15 years plus which speaks volume about the company as a whole.
bad,"The job itself wasn't bad. The problem is that the management, including the store manager and the majority of shift leads, was not very good. They were lazy, they played favorites, and they made the job very difficult. On top of that, you tend to get overworked. I was scheduled to be part time, but always ended up having at least 39 hours per week. I was never allowed to call in, even when I was CONTAGIOUSLY sick with a doctor's note. I was always assigned many more duties during one shift than there should've been and I got penalized when I wasn't able to finish all tasks that were given. It was not an enjoyable place to be."
bad,"Working for this company was a learning experience great employees, not so much management. Benefits are okay not anything extravagant. While working here I did become a registered pharmacy technition and paid for classes."
bad,"It was ok working there, but at the time I had to focus more on school so I didn't work as much. I didn't really care for management before he wasn't a team player with his staff."
bad,Walgreens is a horrible company to work for I do not wish to participate in the survey Walgreens is a horrible company to work I would not recommend anyone to work for this company low pay mininum room for promotion
bad,"Company changed, everything is about pharmacy now.  Corporate does not care about Front end team members. pay is low for them but high for pharmacy.  pharmacy is all important"
bad,Both managers I had played favors and had relationships with other employees even though those managers were married. I do not approve of that at all.
bad,i have been with this company close to 15 years and the lack of support is beyond belief !!! less hours less crew and more tasks and kpis that not even the skilled and advanced team can meet unless you are a robot that doesnt require  sleep or help
bad,I seen people go above and beyond for this company and get dragged through the dirt.  Including myself and others I went above and beyond for customers and still didn't get treated as such.
bad,"Call center environment, management not really good , in meetings the tent to offend employees. Some supervisors are awesome. No room to growth within this facility"
bad,"Corporate seems a little cut throat"
bad,It is a stressful place to work. Customers are mean sometimes and you do too much and do not get paid enough. The hours stink and you have no life besides Walgreens
bad,Everything from the overseeing manager smoking in the back to fellow shift leads not doing their due diligence this place was a hassle and very difficult work environment. You find yourself doing the work of four people while they are all chatting in the office.
bad,"The higher ups in the company are clueless about what is going on at the store level and do not care. Favoritism is constantly seen at multiple stores and if your store manager is bad, the entire team suffers. Store Managers that stay holed up in the office expect ONE employee to do the work of 3 while doing their other duties. Expectations can never be met. "
bad,Very stressful towards the end. Cutting employees down to the bare minimum   Cross training was good if you have enough employees and you are not stressed to run to many departments
bad,Depending on the location (this location is the worse!!) Every 6 months to a year new management is being placed in the store. Not enough training and focusing on the employees that work there. Hours are always being cut.
bad,"I hated that place, my phone was stolen from me and it was on camera , cops were called but my boss didn't do anything about it. never fired the guy, the guy quit."
bad,Company has really gone downhill. Upper management is so greedy and treat everyone below like garbage. Expect so much with no help. Lots of favoritism and HR issues swept under the rug at District level and above.
bad,"The work at Walgreens was repetitive, it wasn't necessarily a bad thing and I knew the information any which way it was asked with needing minimal reference documents. My manager was great. The workplace was constantly changing policies and while I am one who adapts easily I felt the changes being made were not really benefiting the company and the energy could have been exhausted in other areas to ensure success. The hardest part of the job was not feeling bored. Most enjoyable part would have been the ability to work from home."
bad,stressful but you get to connect personally with patients. multi-cultural and constantly changing to advance.  Management can have poor communication at times.  Not much advancement or going up the ladder.
bad,Just an average place to work and make some extra money. I just needed to make some extra money as I have been a student these past few years. Most of my co-workers were very nice and the main management was great.
bad,"Incredibly understaffed retail pharmacy that is micromanaged by the store director, not the pharmacy manager (who actually knows what's going on every day and what needs to get done). It was a decent place to start, as they offer a free month-long class to technicians in order to get nationally-certified. But the enduring stress & lack of support from the rest of the store (the customer is always right should not apply to pharmacy) sends everybody out the door as soon as they've got that piece of paper that the hospitals are looking for. (;"
bad,"Walgreens is probably the worst retail company to work for. They have no interest in keeping their employees happy, nor do they care about them, other than to work hard and follow policies, otherwise, out the door. Very cutthroat, stressful, and inducing pharmacists to a quick burn out."
bad,Too worried about micromanaging everyone the only good thing about this job was you could listen to music. I would never work here again....................................
bad,As a shift lead you do the same job as the ASM and get paid pennies. They don't want you to move up. Seeing it benefits them to keep you in the same position. High turn over and don't want to hire anyone once they let people go. Under staffed to be a 24 hour Walgreens specially in the Pharmacy. As a shift lead they expect you to run the front with one person and still help in the pharmacy. The Pharmacy comes first as they say. But what about your front end customers.
bad,"Managers play favorites to certain people, days off are very hard to request and get approved. pay was HORRIBLE, a new company has taken over things might change but i don't recommend"
bad,Same thing as any other cvs safeway etc. Its a relaxed job no rush just do your job and youll be fine. The staff is chill not really ever busy compared to other stores.
bad,"This company was good when it was still family owned, but then it became corporate and now they care more about the bottom line than employees and customers. Really not a very good place to work."
bad,I worked at Walgreens as a temporary position.  The hardest part of the job was interacting with rude customers.  I liked working with my coworkers and the hours were bearable.
bad,"Increasing lack of concern for employee workload, providing minimum technician support. I was denied of any breaks on a 12 hour shift, including lunch. When I asked  to take 3 ten minute breaks spread out over a 12 hour shift, since a 30 minute lunch was not permitted, I was informed that would be unacceptable."
bad,Walgreens is squeezing everything out of their employees.  It is so stressful and hard yet they want us to remain engaged. There's so much to do but they cut your hours and expect you to have the same output.  It's hard to find decent employees so you're stuck with sub-par people yet are expected to deliver 1000 percent.  It's extremely stressful and as store manager you're expected to keep it all together which is hard in itself.
bad,"They never close, you have to work holidays and they don't care about you. Management is stressed, the customers are all terrible quality people who have no concept of real life and will yell or spit on you if you don't discount their bag of candy by .49."
bad,My overall experience working at Walgreens was great with the exception of people dangerously stealing/robbing to the point I had anxiety going to work.
bad,Working in the photo department and processing film made for an interesting job. The people I worked with were also super friendly and we were able to develop friendships outside of work.
bad,"management was absolutely horrible they bad mouthed you to other co-workers, they would tell you that you are doing nothing to contribute to the store (even when you are)"
bad,"I felt like I was being constantly watched by the managers. Not just me everyone who worked there. Management is really lazy, forgets suggestions the next day, lack of initiative."
bad,"Great first job or secondary employment. Suitable for students. Not acceptable for full time adults."
bad,"With being a shift supervisor almost everyday I would be doing something different. Anything from stocking, checking inventory, setting up new product, receiving orders, and helping in the pharmacy if they were busy. For what work went into being a shift supervisor there it wasn't worth the pay."
bad,I learned about how to manage a company. It taught me a lot however I was not happy with the environment there. Management is a numbers game and that is completely fine if they understood that it is just a numbers game. Happiness can be only measured in the eyes of the customer not on a sheet of paper.
bad,open the store get everything ready and work through your shift people working there are nice but management need improvement and raises need to be on a time
bad,"Working here is far from enjoyable!! Not the safest environment since there is a lack of security- drug addicts frequently come in and steal as well as overdose and come into our store. While working here you will be over-worked and under paid and have unrealistic expectations put upon you to complete in very little time during a busy day which amounts to a 2-3 person job for 1 person! micro- managed and treated like a child constantly, blamed for things you didn't do and rarely appreciated for your hard work."
bad,medical billing and coding for different health organizations. extensive training given when needed and when procedures change. sent forms to healthcare company
bad,medical billing and coding for different health organizations. extensive training given when needed and when procedures change. sent forms to healthcare company
bad,you're on your feet all day and if you have bad feet or anything its killer on your body. The people you work with can be nice but depends on where you are some people are just rude. the customers are mostly nice but when you get a rude customer it ruins your whole day. The management is fine they're doing their job the way they are supposed to but it can be really tough to make sure demands are met with scheduling.
bad,"My work experience with Walgreens began incredibly well. The management and associate team was kind and welcoming and very helpful with any and all questions. My day usually begins with a set list of duties that need to be completed by the end of your shift located in the area you are scheduled in for the day, with the customers always remaining top priority. Some days, however, there is no list and with no list, there is no guidance in what to do during your shift. Nine times out of ten, the employees leave a mess at their workstation, whether it be snacks or drinks of their's, and/or items that were returned and/or items that need to be placed back on the shelf. Although I get along well with my employees, everyone always has something to say about another employee. The lack of organization and communication between associates and the management team is ridiculous, resulting in unfinished work and more stress placed on associates having to complete their work before beginning their own. However, I am very grateful for my manager working with me for several months as I underwent invasive surgery."
bad,Too much standing in one spot for hours. Too much expected for such little pay. No flexibility in hours or days worked. Constant crticizm from management
bad,"Management was very poor, all my employees were extremely rude to me and made me do all the work. "
bad,"One of the most physically demanding jobs I've had. With 3 men on payroll out of 27 employees, we were delegated with stocking the store and working on truck days. I wouldn't recommend this job at minimum wage."
bad,i really dislike it here and im really only staying because it helps paying bills. i will say i am  mildly pleased because they did help me in pharmacy. however i am unhappy because they dont really provide a chance to advance
bad,they are all about metrics. they do not consider the validity or realism in the things your are asked to do on a daily basis. never provide adequate tech help.
bad,"not enough coverage on the floor or in rx, whatever doesn't get done gets pushed to the next shift in the day. unrelenting managers, no work life balance, no time for family emergencies or medical emergencies for staff. Would only recommend as a part time to get work experience, mostly luck of the draw if you get a decent manager to work under. High turn over rate, people leave left and right."
bad,Walgreen work has unrealistic expectation of the employees. I would not work for Walgreen again. There is no concern for the employee. I t is not  for family oriented workers.
bad,"i had a very bad experience at walgreens as a pharmacy intern, i didnt learn what i was supposed to, the staff was not helpful at all, all i did was fill scripts and call customers to tell them there scripts were ready."
bad,"Too much focus on shareholder value and not enough on customer or employee value creation. Lack of transparency from leadership to middle management and non-management. Inability to execute on anything resembling bold vision, instead focusing more on risk aversion and existing business model."
bad,Walgreens values its customers more than its employees. I worked for a company that was worth millions maybe even billions but they never or rarely offered an opportunity to advance for its lower end positions such as stock associate or cashier.
bad,"Used to be a halfway decent place to work, benefits keep getting cut, hours keep getting cut, all about metrics, people don't feel valued, no satisfaction."
bad,Not much to say but it was quite simple. Customer service was the main focus. I had a good time working there but the pay was not enough. The employees of the store was like a soap opera. Too much drama going on.😩
bad,"Your experience will vary depending on who your immediate supervisors are. With the trends of the corporate world today, you will be continuously asked to do more with less."
bad,Stressful at times. we were always behind and never knew what we were doing. management was pretty rude at times. work load was school was pretty hard to manage as well.
bad,This job can be high stressed especially when you have junkies and they follow you home. Understaffed and expect you to work as 3 people instead of one. Multi tasking is a must
bad,"Working at Walgreens has never been a good experience with anyone. They change your schedule every week, which sucks. They don't give you many hours. They are always hiring and that causes fewer hours for you."
bad,the demand and cutthroat feel of the workplace where a company demands a lot for little to no reward is not beneficial in creating engagement with staff unless individuals go out of their own way and pocket to do so.
bad,"did not like working here. the manager was not a nice person at all, they don't let you apply for better position, I really enjoyed talking to the customers."
bad,"A typical day at work will be what team manger or store manager told you to do, everyday is something different or finish what you started."
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance is bad, compensation is okay, job security is good, no one gets fired, management varies from district to district, and the job culture is bad"
bad,"I would recommend this job to someone who is looking for a summer job, not as a career. Maybe different walgreens were better but mine is not. I've been there for 2 years now."
bad,"Managers would hate to see you make friends because it meant that you'd be ""less focused on your job and more focused on your friends"". Once I started making friends, they quickly changed our shifts around so that we wouldn't have a chance to interact with each other."
bad,It's not the same family company I once worked for.  The money is good but now the company seems to be getting rid of the employees with a lot of service in.  I did enjoy working for this company but lately there is to much stress and confusion with what the company standards are.  They are also saving money by getting rid of long term employees to hire newer ones to pay them less.
bad,"Just like the title says, do not work for Walgreens unless you are a pharmacist; or I suppose if you want to be a general manager too. Otherwise, they pay their hourly employees next to nothing for incredibly large responsibilities."
bad,"I did enjoy earlier years with the company when their was a great deal of advancement. The hardest part of the job was being asked to do more with less, cut payroll and expenses. The benefits package is decent."
bad,Walgreeens is changing drastically every other month. Jobs are eliminated or re-named starting at a lower wage! They take care of their customers but not of their employees.
bad,I was initially excited to work in my department. I performed well and colleagues regularly expressed their satisfaction to my manager. There was a change of manager. The workplace environment became very hostile and seemingly racist. I'm disappointed to report that I could no longer work in such a negative environment. Reporting up the chain yielded no helpful results.
bad,Typical day at work would include a lot of customer service. Also setting up sale promotion signs and restocking merchandise when we were running out of products.
bad,ok place to work was a fun crew on grave yard shift  good team work  we hand fun at our job 8 hour shift good pass down  17 miles of conveyors to work on we were always busy conveyor repair jams
bad,"My job title and objective was customer service associate and I was to fill the candy section and man the front register. On a good day I would do a 2 person job and on a bad day I would do a 4 person job. Most days were not good days. Employees there would get too comfortable with management and not follow day to day objectives (hence the reason I was stuck with a 4 person job.) Would work many, many, MANY double shifts for people who never showed to work. I did however make a friendship with a fellow employee so not all was bad. I also trained 3 people within a 3 day span of me starting."
bad,"The job itself wasn't terrible, but there was no real direction from higher management, cliques were formed, and if you didn't pick up extra shifts and become a slave to the job, you were out of the loop."
bad,"it was ...okay. the job was not hard but the people were not pleasant. And as they say ""the people make the job"". Management was okay but the work environment was not."
bad,"The management was ridiculous in what they wanted from their very understaffed area. The photo tech is basically stuff with every task in the store because it is only the photo tech, one cashier, and one management ever on the clock at one point. As a photo tech my expectations was janitor, sales associate, extra cashier, photo guy, and even manager half the time. The hours were everywhere instead of a fixed schedule and after working there for over a year you would expect a raise or promotion but nope. It was a poor place to work."
bad,Its a good stepping stone to work at to develop the necessary skills and abilities to succeed in the retail industry. I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given
bad,"Lots of favoritism. No security and management doesn't recognize or value their hard working co workers. Customers are crazy, and rude, although there are some that are nice and sweet.  Pay sucks."
bad,Just need improvement in everything. Also make sure the beauty person is fit into the budget. Also a raise for the workers. Get security. Also get better management. 415 Shepherd
bad,"negative attitudes from management, people are mad they have to come in and actually do what is required of them, I'm only put on register which is also something no one wants to do, 40 year olds with work ethic of 16 year olds"
bad,"take this review with a grain of salt, i haven't worked for walgreens for five years but when i was there, the workplace was grimy. break rooms were small and machines inside malfunctioned almost daily. also being by the public restroom. we were constantly interupted by guest who wanted help while we were on break. hardest part of the job was dealing with the unsatisfactory training within the company"
bad,"I will never again work in a busy Walgreen's with a drive thru. The customers are simply horrible, one of the Pharmacists was mean, the other techs were b**hy and the pay was less than MacDonalds. Just no!"
bad,"Fast paced environment "
bad,Decision are made with cost being the only factor.  40 hours provided to complete 60 hours worth of work.  Sub-par employees are what is required to hire in order to keep in budget.
bad,"I worked the evening shift at walgreens, usually 4pm-11pm. I worked an average 32 hours a week as a full time employee. I started as a cashier and was crossed trained as a photo-tech as well. They had several managers and most of them did not care to much about the employees, only their job."
bad,hated everything bout this job because i was the youngest employee he didnt gie me any hours i hated this place the manager wasnt fair at all and the customers werent the easiest
bad,A typical day at work would be lack of communication and training. Waiting for 5-1/2 to 6 hrs for any type of break. Difficulty getting register relief in order to use the restroom.
bad,Walgreens Specialty is not flexible with hours. They would do a shift bid frequently. if you have kids or have anything going on outside of the workplace this job is not for you. it's a really an unpleasant atmosphere and for the compensation after insurance is really nothing to brag on for the amount of work you do. Please PASS on working at this job.
bad,"a typical day at work would be interacting with customers to get a sense of their needs and what is best for those needs. Pharmacy is very active in this area. I have learned quite a bit working under various management depending on who I got and how important growth was to them."
bad,"- As a technician, the store was very high volume and difficult to handle at times. "
bad,"Teamwork eroded due to higher mandated rates. (Speed required to go). High turnover all levels including upper management.  Inconsistent application of policies & rules. "
bad,Never enough help and Store Manager has to much to say about what goes on in the pharmacy. The Store Manager has no knowledge of pharmacy rules and regulations. A lot of the store managers to not have college degrees.
bad,the company is a great company but the pharmacy that I work at in Rockford was horrible and misguided. I will not recommend the Pharmacy but the Store is great.
bad,"Walgreens all together is a horrible work place, for they do not provide many benefits to their workers. They tend to overwork the employees for such little pay."
bad,"I worked as a beauty advisor and at first I enjoyed working in my department however after a year of being there, I started to notice our manager has favorites."
bad,Fast paced merchandising on a daily basis. Corporate has taken over all merchandising of the store to bypass local sales targets leading to lost sales.
bad,"When I started 10yrs ago great environment and really enjoyed my job, but when the company monopolized the company changed drastically regarding benefits and compensation."
bad,Strict about customer service. Being on the registers most of the shift. Bathroom breaks are frowned upon. You constantly get called over the announcements system. The employees have little patience.
bad,Walgreens is an alright place to work at if this is your first or second job. Management is not very flexible when it comes to hours and the hourly pay is just above minimum wage.
bad,Working at Walgreens for only 9.00 is very difficult because they work you a lot and the company itself has a high turnover rate. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers.
bad,Walgreens used to be the company to work for.  Now it is how many Rx can you fill/check with the least amount of help.  Stressful environment and management are not pharmacists anymore.  You are just a number and you are replaceable.
bad,employees were treated differently. managers treat other employees not equally. Wouldn't respect what employees would have to say and management was very judgmental.
bad,Nice place to work and grow! Nice coworkers! I've learned a lot during my nine years working for this organization! I've learned the importance of teamwork and working hard to meet goals and deadlines.
bad,Could have better listening skills when it comes to finding the best fit for individuals.  I know your supposed make the customer feel welcome at all times but to do it where you just  go through the motions of breaking your neck to get a good review it just goes to show some manager are not cut out to be managers if you can't do it naturally or with in reason.
bad,"Was a good job, but all the experienced techs have moved on and there is stress and chaos with new techs. People (me) are being stretched to breaking point."
bad,Too many turnovers in job positions. Their benefits are not what that they claim.  Work environment should be more consistent with OSHA standards. PPE should be a priority.
bad,"Was only there for two days and had a workplace performance review done without my knowledge which prevented me from making night manager.  Every manager knew of my rating before I was aware I even had an evaluation.  This in turn violates my professional privacy.  All managers at this store are weak, including the store manager himself."
bad,Poor management. Poor Communication. Favoritism. No room to excel. Bad days out weighed the good. Don't listen to employees advice on how to improve operation.
bad,"there is no balance, you can only care about work. you'll have no personal time, my boss got mad at me because I had to get a second job because they don't pay enough."
bad,"Flex scheduling, pay decent, good job for people seeking to be career retail managers. Many people looking for career changes go to Walgreens as an option."
bad,"The small staff of the store causes drama between employees and also adds stress on everyone. If one person calls out, all employees have to chip in extra work to get their tasks done."
bad,"Way too much work for the amount of pay. 8 hour shifts with no break in the pharmacy. $10.50 an hour starting pay, 11.50 if you pass the certification after 6 months. not worth it"
bad,"Very busy and short staffed. Impossible to find coverage when you or your child is sick. They treat you like you do not know what you are doing, constantly change things they tell you. You will be trained one way and then they will act like you're supposed to do it another way later down the road."
bad,"There was a time when Walgreen's was all about making sure their employees were taken care of.  Advancement was always an opportunity and there was always a chance to grow and expand."
bad,"would never like to work in the company.  poor quality  of life, people are very miserable because the company does not take care of the employee."
bad,"Overall, the customers are very nice and the actual job of filling prescriptions and selling them was very pleasant. I worked as a pharmacy tech for almost a year and I might have just gotten an unlucky bunch, but my overall experience here was that they definitely choose favorites based on who is full-time, reflecting the views of upper management as well."
bad,"Es rutinario. Aprendes cosas nuevas casi todos los dias. Los gerentes no son tan a favor del empleado. Los colegas, hay buenos compañeros, y otros que no. La parte mas dificil es cuando no tienes personal para realizar el trabajo."
bad,"Walgreen's has some very good aspects.  The run a fairly good chain and do a  more than adequate job.  I do find, and this might be district specific, that management cannot be trusted and does not like constructive criticism or questions concerning their policies.  I.E. The district I worked in had a policy that 20 dollar bills be placed under the drawer with no real reason as to why it was done nor concern about the potential issues it could cause.  I saw one married person who had an affair with staff, a clear violation of Walgreens policy, yet the person was promoted and moved to another store.  Older pharmicists were pushed out and, until a complaint was filed it appeared that few, if any, older individuals were being considered for the position of ASMT.  Upon the filing of a complaint, the person making the complaint was told it was untrue and then was written up for the first time (within a month of the end of the investigation).  If you are 20, go for it."
bad,"While, not always the best place to work, Walgreen's did open the door for me to become a certified pharmacy technician which is allowing me to expand my career and experiences."
bad,okay place to work. job wasen for me. i need a constant flow of people to keep me going threw the day. manager was a cleaning freak.
bad,Management is very rude and insensitive to customer's needs. Lacks good communication skills. Co-workers are friendly and always efficient.
bad,I don't have any comments about Walgreens you don't have a life working in retail with Walgreens you can only spend your holiday at your job in retail
bad,Management will step in and help with customer cashier lines and issues. High stress enviroment with growth. work flow is not too bad to handle but the customers are the worst people to deal with in the world.
bad,"Assisting the customers with all their needs. "
bad,"my typical day at work was to clock in, go to the cash register and sign in and start working and then go off and do what ever my manager says to do when they need me. I learned their will be many things you do while working, you're never assigned to just one station. The co-workers I worked with we're all different, some were very closed to themselves and some were helpful and a team worker. The hardest part of my job was never getting a break and always having to cover someone else's place while they go take a smoking break. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping costumers."
bad,.....I don't really want to write anything about this company but it's making me for some reason. I think the company was fine but my manager at the time was a pompous moron who thought he could do it and knew it all.
bad,"I will not state that this is native to Walgreens itself. I know that there are some VERY good Walgreens stores to work at."
bad,typical day stressful. management helpful. co-workers were helpful. hardest part of job was stocking and inventory. most enjoyable part was serving the community.
bad,The job would be ideal if the company would remove the pick rates for employees because they don't look at all shifts to see what is exactly going on and its based on dayshift alone. The supervisors try to help but in the long run you are forced to sink or swim.
bad,Great customers interactions.  People are friendly. Fast pace . The story stays busy they're open 24 hours so it gives people an opportunity to get things they need what other stores are closed
bad,I didn't like working there because you had to clean toilets and take out trash pick up gum and the employees were not very talkative they were quiet and talked amongst there selves
bad,Work includes stocking cleaning cashiering answer calls dealing with rude customers. Have to be very patient and. Calm. Keeping track of store and where everything is and keeping stick room nest and orderly
bad,"Walgreen's finally matched CVS on the 9$ per hour after they had been doing it long before them however great it may seem it led to less hours to be distributed. Many people never got over 25 hours and they will never schedule you for 40. The holiday season is completely awful, you have to chose between missing Thanksgiving or Christmas no exceptions and to add to it those days are not busy. Walgreen's is open every single holiday including 4th of July, Christmas Eve, and New years. I didnt expect to have any kind of connection to the regular customers but they were actually the highlight of the job. I was fortunate to have good shift leads but store management wasnt bad either. My biggest issue with the company even past their blatant disregard for their employees family time is the happy and healthy agenda. When you have to sell someone a carton of cigarettes that doesnt have the breath to make it to the counter you begin to question these greedy people. Its their means to a sale not a satisfied customer. They can sell all the smokes they want but they shouldnt act like they care about their customers health, if anybody does care its the low level employees not the people that actually make the arbitrary rules and actually make a living. Lastly there isnt really room to move up at all. The management trees in place will stay that way. Also 2 out of the 5 shift leads couldn't afford their own cars and had to work 2 jobs. Plus hours and hours of computer training for the easiest job in the world"
bad,"When I first started it was a very pro-employee company. Now it feels like we're just a giant expense cutting into the bottom line. Profits and stock are as high as ever but we continue to take the brunt of all budget cuts. Eliminating positions and creating new lower paying ones, reducing benefits, laughably low starting pay and salary caps."
bad,"This company continues to decrease staffing while increasing workload at a phenomenal rate. There seems to be very little regard to in store/in pharmacy staff from the higher-ups. I am fortunate to work at a location where the on-site management tries very hard to be encouraging, but in general I would not recommend this company to anyone as more than a short-term, stop-gap employer. I would not have said this a few years ago, and I hope corporate management makes much needed changes. I have been with this company for 15 years, so obviously I feel some loyalty and it was mostly pretty good but now the company essentially encourages customers to be obnoxious (by rewarding their behaviors), while taking away virtually all useful support and reducing the staffing hours."
bad,I worked at for like a year and half . didn't get to advise as fast as I thought . overall is was a good experience
bad,Hours are variant so you never have a set schedule and may come in early one day and late the next day. Not a balanced work/life schedule. Management can be very unfriendly and treat their employees harshly. Favoritism occurs and the job can be very tedious and discouraging.
bad,"More workload with less resources. Retail business never worked without correct staffing and resources. "
bad,Company promotes extremely under qualified management which creates terrible workplace atmospheres.  This also runs off the talented workforce to go work somewhere else. Company expects overtime on a weekly basis.
bad,"Worked as relief staff at 10 different stores, all shifts including night shift.  Included all aspects of retail pharmacy, supervising of staff, patient care, vaccine / immunization administration, etc."
bad,Customer Service is a priority and must be given no matter what. You are given tasks to complete per department and those task should be completed before the end of your shift.
bad,Walgreens is ok but it sucks. Pharmacy is understaffed. They do have good Paid Time Off however. They have high turnover rates because they dont value their employees.
bad,Way too much work for one person while others stood around and chatted. The hardest part of the job ways communicating with others. The management was not where it should have been. Everyone was doing their own thing. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing what I was doing and the customers.
bad,"A typical day at Walgreens involved working the cash register, stocking, and maintaining a clean and organized environment. I feel that although the management and coworkers were unhelpful, I learned how to be a good team member. Handling unpleasant customers was difficult, but I was willing to remain helpful, apologetic, and keep up high standards of good customer service."
bad,its ok for someone who is in high school to start out at management is amazing but it just pays way to little. But it is a good job in its own sense
bad,"This was your typical, run-of-the-mill chain retail establishment."
bad,"To start this off I will say that if you have no retail experience this would be a good option. Compared to other stores Walgreens allows you to gain a lot of experience. You learn about how to keep track of inventory, how the truck gets processed, when it's appropriate to purge overstock, etc. However I just feel like with all of that and you're expected to give extraordinary customer care at the same time. It simply isn't worth the 8.00 an hour. The job should pay more in my opinion."
bad,"I started at Walgreens Corp thinking this company is an established and a fine oiled machine, I am going to learn a lot here. When I got here it was more like working for a start up company. Been here 2 year still trying to get out of my department. I have worked with my non-communicative manager to reach my ""goals"" but all the bi-weekly sessions are empty and no discussions are based on where she would like me to be or where I am unless she has an issue."
bad,"The company as a whole from at the beginning was very employee friendly.  After about 4-5 years, I never felt appreciated and just didn't enjoy working with that company."
bad,"Walgreens doesn't pay its employees as much as other pharmacies around, while also cutting hours to a bare minimum working crew.  It is expected to get certain tasks done that require more people for time and safety wise with less than adequate amounts of employees.  Employees are consistently teased with the prospect of company wide raises and opportunities for bonuses but then no information disseminates and ultimately no raises or bonuses.  Management organization for the pharmacy portion, the structure is constantly being changed with less emphasis on patient safety but speed and not accuracy which becomes dangerous for the patient."
bad,Pay is decent but they always make people work MANDATORY overtime which can be anywhere from for to 8 hours extra a week but you have to do the required hours or you will get pointed. You have to clock out at the exact end of your shift ( i.e. they will not allow you to clock out at 5:58 if you're scheduled til 6. Only place I've worked at that won't allow you to. You're not allowed to talk. You have scheduled breaks. You also have management often looking over your shoulders. There's only one bathroom in the building that you're allowed to use which is horrible since there are at least 100 people on one side of the building. Since the bathroom is always in use you're always running into people coming in and out of there. There's a wall outside of the bathroom so you can't see them and they can't see you. There have been times when women have been told to use the men's room!
bad,I just checked out the customers items and helped stock items on shelves.  I learned a lot about customer service in a retail environment. The managers were hands off during most of  work day.
bad,Walgreens has changed alot and is just a place where someone can get the experience and then go to another company for more advancement.
bad,The typical day would be ringing up customers and to put up freight. I have learned about retail experiences. Management was okay could have cared a little more about the employees. My co- workers all for self. The hardest part of the job was getting a raise. The most enjoyable part was meeting new customers and different people.
bad,"They treat their employees badly, and need a better management, I am a firm believer of treat your employees as if you want to keep them."
bad,"A typical day usually consists of moving displays that were recently constructed, helping customers with various needs, and restoring the store's appearance after a day of business and sales."
bad,"As a cashier, you stand in the same spot for eight hours at a time.  The managers' favorite phrase was ""Loss Prevention!""  They were ever-vigilant against you possibly stealing a candy bar, or coupons, or time.  Once, I was lectured for getting my purse out of the back room, then clocking out for lunch, whereas I ""should"" be clocking out, then making the 1-minute walk to the back room to get my purse.  I was also made to work while sick one day and was only excused after vomiting every ten minutes.  Walgreens is a terrible company to work for, and I can't even fault my managers too much, because even they seemed very unhappy with their jobs, too.  Don't work here."
bad,"Walgreens, like any other big business, seek to over work minimum wage workers and treat them like dispensable criminals while no advancement is possible"
bad,"If you like being a number in your company, this is the one for you.  Decent pay, but that's about it.  You will never get any sort of break (even when required by company policy/the law).  No opportunity for advancement.  Others who had been licensed less time than I had a more stable staff position in a shorter time.  If I was underperforming, no feedback was given to improve.  Management from district level up through corporate try to mandate job duties, but don't support with extra hours or staff, but instead cut them.  They have no clue what is actually going on with their stores.  If you want a job where you're cared about as an employee, this is NOT the one."
bad,Pharmacy was completely disorganized with considerable number of prescriptions late on an every day basis and dispute between day and night pharmacists was beyond unethical.
bad,"Walgreens is operating on unsafe budgets, and making profits on the back of there pharmacists. I loved Walgreens my first year there in 2008, and it went down hill every year after that. Major cuts to tech help, and constantly asking for more from the pharmacists with little hope of accomplishing it. I left because the quality of care I was able to give was sub par with the help I was able to staff."
bad,"I was not happy with the company, I feel that they did not care about their customers."
bad,"There isn't much room for advancement at Walgreens. I love my job and being able to help patients, but overall the management team are never on one accord."
bad,"This was probably the worst company I worked for. The benefits, management, work flow, customer service, and pricing was horrible. It wasn't fair to the customers and we stayed out of stock of drugs."
bad,"After the re doing the pay system and giving everyone pay cuts, the company lost alot of people. I was one of them. Work load for min wage isn't worth it."
bad,"Walgreens has a lot of training, and there is growth potential within the store; however, once you reach the level of store manager the opportunities are extremely limited.  In the past decade the company has cut pay rates for all positions to an incredible degree.  You basically have to get promoted to a store manager in training to earn a living wage now.  The first level of management started out at a wage 22% higher over a decade ago.  All the non-management positions within the stores are being systematically eliminated so that all employees are earning a wage just above the legal minimum.  Additionally, the new company management is making decisions on every front to sacrifice stakeholder value for shareholder value.  These decisions are obviously made by individuals with no emotional or psychological investment in the company.  The Walgreens family ran the company like a very large independent business and garnered a vast amount of loyalty.  The new leadership is leeching all the value out of infrastructure and the talent pool with short-sighted decisions.  The harsh treatment of the front-line employees got so rough that, as I manager, my career was no longer morally tenable.  I simply couldn't stomach being the person who pressed the button on policies that showed a nearly criminal negligence toward our employees.  Walgreens has made such irrational decisions in the last five years that I not only left the company, I sold my stock.  It feels unethical just to own it."
bad,"Not enough salary, fill prescriptions stock medication, call insurance, call doctors.. Not enough workers to get off days."
bad,Started with the company 18 years ago. Loved It. Now the company has changed and my pay is less after 18 years thought i would be making good money and are not. Meet numerous of  people through the years that were very nice and friendly.
bad,Not a good working culture.I have no additional comments.They did not foster a positive work environment.I would not ecommend working for this company.
bad,Its a demanding job where you are required to learn and perform in many different roles.  A lot is expected of you and very few people are recognized for their services.
bad,"12 hour shifts with no break"
bad,"ran every position in store, only to get treated like garbage, n get paid minimum wage. worked in cosmetics, photo, pharmacy, unloaded truck, , manager work, front, ran to every postion, n got treated like garbage bent over backwards"
bad,My most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people which became my regular customers.  Enjoyed waiting on them everyday.
bad,"The company has very good benefits. The company only value upper management. All employees and shift leaders are easily fired, and laid off during cut backs. Very political company, if you don't have friends or buddies in management your not getting promoted. Raises are minimal if you get one based on your performance review from manager."
bad,Walgreens requires A LOT of your time with very low compensation. Advancement is hard to come by unless you've been there for years.
bad,"Good place to learn about the in and outs of Job training, if you can last a year then you can work just about anywhere. The pay is horrible, no one can survive in that world. Bad hours too."
bad,"didnot work with any one schedule"
bad,"I would say that the only positive about walgreens is the fact that most coworkers are decent people. Everything else however is a different story. They place too much work on everyone, and always schedule small [read under] amount of people per shift. Some places also have a very bad customer clientele. Furthermore everyone gets only one break per shift, and that break is either 15 or 30 minutes. There are also high [again read unreasonable] expectations placed on everyone. There is most likely more to say, but not really worth saying it, like straw on the camel's back."
bad,"A very learned experience"
bad,"All management is scared for their jobs at all times. Upper management gives no positive reinforcement. Training is completely informal, mostly on a computer, and can be easily skipped if you have any knowledge of how to use a computer."
bad,I received my pharmacy technician training here but the atmosphere is not conducive to learning. Management does not look out for employees only the bottom line. Infractions are not disciplined so reliable employees suffer.
bad,"Let me start with the good:  The people you work with at the store (techs) are hard working people and were the biggest bright spot of working at the company.  However, how you are treated by management leaves much to be desired.  Getting days off is much harder than it should be.  Compensation and benefits use to be the reason to work at Walgreens, however they have steadily declined over the last 10 years and are now merely average among competitors.  Walgreens is a company that promotes whoever sucks up to the right people, but has no idea what leadership is or what a leader looks like.  If you want to move far in the company, you better have the same last name as a high level executive.  Morale has steadily declined over the years and no one at store level believes in the company anymore or feels that they are treated fairly.  I do not know of any other profession that treats people with doctorates like grunts, but here that is exactly what happens."
bad,this will be a great place to work if they were still willing to give raises to the employees whom deserve them after being there for years.
bad,"Typical day at work will start off (if closing) counting the safe and covering breaks for pharmacist. Then reviewing and completing the daily tasks assignments. The employees already know when to cover for breaks and lunches. Handle customer concerns and assist customers throughout the day. Approve returns and exchanges. Confront shoplifters (this is the dangerous part). We can't leave the store (not even outside the door) because corporate is selfish and does not want to be liable. We get shoplifters and people walking in with weapons (such as knives and guns visible through their pockets). Theres NO securities. Management will have to make cash pick ups and just shove the money into our vest and rush our life to the office door. Same thing goes for making change for the register. At the end of the night, we will be carrying trays of money from the register (completely visible to shoplifters and customers) all by our self. As far as closing, opening is just as dangerous. Only the opening manager is there to open the store (there's no other employees to maintain safety). And management, including shift lead like me, will work full shifts without actual lunches and proper breaks."
bad,Walgreens moral has gone down within the company and there is no job security. Management are not all on the same page. There is no flexibility with in the company.
bad,It was very nice when I first started working at with the company. Over the years the company has changed from good to worst to work for. I left right before they were cutting employees pay and having employees responsible for the same work load.
bad,"Really don't like the overall job culture of the company, which has high expectations yet compensates their employees poorly."
bad,getting fussed at by your bosses or mgt sitting in office all day very hard work too much stuff to do not enough time to finish it
bad,In the pharmacy there is never a dull moment. It is always busy and there is plenty of work to be done. The work day really flies by.
bad,Given giant task list to be completed everyday. The managers smoke cigarettes all day or sit in the office on their iPad while complaining about the performance of the employees to one another.  Been asking about a raise for over a year with no real response.
bad,I was rare to have a good day. No training. Got shorted on my breaks and lunch. Never had a mgr. for more then 3 months. Get certified get year or two of experience and get out unless you love stress
bad,"On a typical night at Walgreens, it is very slow-paced and you don't get to interact with customers like you would during the day, maybe 20 people in a night. It went very slow. The most enjoyable part of my job was the girl I worked with, that was about the only positive thing about the job. It was just her and I there at night, which was scary considering we had a 24 hour pharmacy, and the store stayed open 24 hours as well. There was no security whatsoever. There was nothing really 'hard' about the job, but there were situations that I wish I could have avoided when it came to certain customers in the pharmacy."
bad,I didnt like the Manager of the Texas City store. She didnt have a good approachable image for her employees. Management was unlikeable and made for a long stressful day.
bad,"Didn't like it. It made me sad. It was a place of business, but instead it turned out to be a boxing gym. Oh nothing will make sense when you are at the cash register, because the customer comes in and says the same thing over and over and over again."
bad,"They higher ups do not care about anything at the store level. The pay is decent if you're just starting out as a pharmacy tech, otherwise stay away."
bad,"This was a good Company to work for . Main complaint was from upper management. They could never make their mind up, mico managing, way to much pressure in the work place, very poor training. Very point finger and blame type of environment. Employees pretend they like there job because management sucks. In my time I was there I only encountered one manager who I would rate at 5 stars"
bad,"It's just a typical work place but the pay is awful. You basically live pay check to pay check working here. "
bad,Walgreen's as a company is mismanaged and a poor work environment. The top hardly knows what the bottom does on a daily basis but still assumes they know everything about it.
bad,Responsible for opening or closing of stores daily functions. Managed daily operations for customers and employees. Assisted customers with shopping decisions. Walgreen's lacked training for existing managers on how to manage employees. Enjoyed working with customers and employees.
bad,"The culture has changed quite a bit over the last few years. Restructurings and lay offs are very common and have become normal now. The compensation and benefits are not great, but that is also across many retail companies. The company is pretty cheap overall with their employees. On the accounting and finance side, it's very difficult to move around or up unless you know the right people. Management will talk a lot about employee development, but there is virtually no training, career development, or succession planning unless they consider you a star. From an infrastructure and systems standpoint, the company is archaic. There was so much focus on expanding the stores in years past so the company fell behind on technology.  Overall the company is ok to work for, but a lot depends on your department. There are many other companies in the Chicago area that are much better at employee engagement."
bad,"If you have a family you like to spend time with, holidays you enjoy, like getting a normal amount of sleep, then stay away."
bad,Walgreens is a place for teenagers or someone who doesn't have a family. A typical day was crazy. I learned that companies doesn't care about your family or your life. The management needs to learn how to speak to customers and employees and appreciate what they do. My co-workers was very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job was be shorthanded all the time. The most enjoyable part of my job was customers who came in to see me
bad,"not a bad experience.  employees were friendly.  pretty good hours.  customers can be grouchy and rude.  However, they are probably on medication, so that's a good excuse."
bad,Working the personal care department was really fun and exciting because I do hold a interest in cosmetics and how to obtain flawless skin and living a healthy life inside and out. Taking the time and consulting customers with what it takes to stay and live healthy was also educating me and my life as well.
bad,learned a lot about pharmacy work. working there was fast pace and always doing something.
bad,I was not happy working under this company. They lied to me about keeping my position.  They filled the spot so it would not get filled by another company. They waited till they could bring one of their employee in on a Visa and then they did not find me another position with Walgreen which they had promised me. They also said I was over paid.
bad,"price changing"
bad,"Atypical. Inadequate staffing."
bad,The company itself was a good company to work with. The management had begun to be a problem because of lack of education and management skills.
bad,Only was a cashier here. Most of the work is put on the cashier to keep the front end of the store clean.
bad,They want you to work hard but not pay enough. It  was a fast pace environment. time would go fast. It was also a very diverse location.
bad,"too busy to learn anything at most hours especially if you are part time, great system which has many fail- safe procedures."
bad,My coworkers are awesome! The pharmacy is always understaffed and every month hours are getting cut. The store managers will not help out during busy times. Most technicians salaries have been capped and there no room for growth with this company.
bad,"some managers are not very helpful and considerate if you are a student with schedules and such,"
bad,"A typical day at work is nothing great. We are understaffed and under paid for the amount of work we do. Our management is no help when it comes to customer service so we are the ones standing there looking like idiots. There is no room for job growth there. Our pay has been ""capped"" meaning from now on pharmacy technicians there will never make more than 16.50 an hour. Don't recommend working for this company if you want to have a future."
bad,"cleaned photo machines"
bad,I feel that they have moved away from caring and compensating their employees.  With restructuring the past couple of years they have made it so they pay less and expect more!  Not fair to the employees that work really hard.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with unhappy customers and non-compliant employees.
bad,"a typical day was to come in at 10pm and work until 8am. I learned how difficult it is to work overnight midnight hours. The management was ok. My co-workers were fine. the hardest part was the hours. difficult to sleep during the day, work at night, overnight."
bad,this job I had as an intern when I went to pima medical. I learned how the pharmacy worked and what was required of you every day. helping patients and keeping the pharmacy in neat condition along with making sure your inventory was correct. It helped me in my learning experience of be coming a pharmacy tech.
bad,It's an OK job. Limited hours at locations that are not 24 hours. Room for advancement if dedicated to the work ethic.
bad,"Was an amazing company despite the terrible work schedule. The new field transformation caused several employees to chose to leave a company they used to believe in, or to stay in a position without immediate advancement."
bad,"Retail is tough! Too many politics and no real direction. When I first started with the company as a Cashier, it seemed rewarding to become an Assistant Manager.  After making that regrettable move, it was downhill from there. I mostly worked the night shift and would be understaff...and forget about getting a lunch break.  Now, after 13 years down the drain, the company decides to take a direction that would not eliminate my position, but cut your pay in the process."
bad,"I love my coworkers but do not like the management. None of them are on the same page. Your work day changes depending on who your working with, not very consistent. Walgreen's cares about numbers, not about the people. We are expected a certain amount of immunizations each month. We are expected to fill a certain number of scripts by a certain hour. The registers are close together so everyone can hear everything that they should not be hearing. I like meeting new people but I do not like how the company only pretends to care."
bad,"In a highly political working environment, most managers are more worried about keeping face than managing their team. This would often lead to poor communication between teams, finger pointing, and a generally caustic working environment. Many team members were overworked, underpaid, and under-appreciated. "
bad,long work days with no advancement and low pay and unreliable management. aside from management coworkers are great help you through the day. makes the job a little more enjoyable customer are great. itsfast pace so its learn as you go and you teach yourself.
bad,Walgreens is a good start for a pharmacy career but thats about it...compensation is not level with the amount of work that is required.
bad,I worked here through a temp service called Outsource Receivable Services (ORS) I loved my job because it offer good pay and a set schedule. The downfall of this company was that I was let go on short notice causing me to become unemployed for awhile.
bad,"After 7 months of excellent customer service, reliability, punctuality, and record suggestive sales, I get a clear opportunity to work and train in pharmacy of another Walgreens store rather than in the front; however, instead my manager choose to hinder my advancement and even discourage me from advancing."
bad,didnt really like working her because the staff was so immature everybody was worried about another employees an not them selves
bad,"I learned a lot of different things in the store, but didn't feel that I was compensated for them. The managers had there favorites and let them more or less run the store their way. Most of the co-workers were nice but easily influenced by other higher up workers. Walgreen's did teach me to be pharmacy runner, resets, revisions, unload trucks, stock, display, some management techniques, and inventory. The most enjoybale was the customers. The hardest was trying to satisfy the managers. First they wanted things a certain way and then after you did it that way they wanted you to change it. I felt as if they would have treated everyone the same, they would have had more satified customers and employees."
bad,They worked everyone to the bone and expected everything to be done to perfection.
bad,The condition of the sale of Chatsworth Pharmacy was to work for Walgreens for 3 months.
bad,"Doesnt have flexible hours, the management is the worst, advancement is out the question."
bad,"Mostly customer service, replenishment, then became a pharmacy tech which was very stressful and tense."
bad,It wasmainly the store manager that made working there horrible.
bad,There is nothing good I can say about this place anymore.  I used to love coming to work everyday but now I just can't wait to get a new job.  The managers don't even care about the employees. They are more worried about whos back they can stab to get store manager.
bad,"A typical day working at Walgreens warehouse started at six in the morning and could be completed at four or six later that day. No weekends, unless working evening or night-shift. The pay was great! However, turnover was high; therefore, I quickly learned that I needed to give my two hundred percent and work with dignity and respect. The relationship with all levels of management and myself was open and great. I was able to speak with any of them about concerns by choosing my words correctly and being mindful of my tone of voice. "
bad,"My job let me go because I got injured at work, which was, in my opinion, illegal and immoral and I do not have a lot of positive feedback for this company."
bad,When I first started it was a new setting for me. My coworkers and management took the time out to teach and show me things the correct way. They train me to be the best that I can be. The most difficult part at first was learning the different medications and what they were for.
bad,"I was working there from November to July and about a few months of being there I was approached about if I would want to become a Team Leader. I told them yes. However, I was the main cashier for the night shift. And I had asked them to move me out onto the floor. I never seen anything happen. They literally told me no to my face that they would not put me on the floor. Which meant I was not going to have any room for advancement. They just wanted me to stay as their cashier and that was it."
bad,No advancement- learn from different individuals weather co-worker or customer everyday-laughing with the customer or co-worker
bad,"-Meet with manager about the daily project"
bad,I was not a big fan of walgreen. I did not like my manager as she was their only for her benefit. I did however like the people that i work with.
bad,Don't look to advance unless you know someone in high places. Walgreens doesn't reward hard work and loyalty.
bad,Walgreens was a great job in the fact that the customers were fun and interactive. Fast pace which made perfect for multitasking. The store and the pharmacy managers where not so great. Over worked and under paid. No work/life balance.
bad,"answering door alarms, helping customers with their merchandise"
bad,Most other managers can't or won't pull their weight yet those that do are held back. Promotions go to those that kiss up to the right people and not the ones that get results.
bad,"a typical day at work consisted of attempting to clock in exactly on your scheduled start time because they didnt want us to go over our scheduled hours even if it was only by a few minutes. this usually resulted in clocking in late. i would spend the day cleaning and assisting the customers in need as well as stocking shelves, organizing the stock room, receving shipment orders, preventing company losses and working the register. i learned how to work without being told what to do. the co workers were friendly but the management was not very employee friendly. they treated me like i was suposed to know everything my first week. the hardest part of the job for me was memorizing the buttons on the cash register since they werenot labeled in case of break in."
bad,to be honest it was to fast paced for me and bc it was to fast I had really bad anxiety that it mad me very sick
bad,crazy pace and overworked great experience.................
bad,Did not like this job. I have nothing good to say about walgreens
bad,"At the end of the day I am very grateful to have a job, it might not be the ideal job but its a job"
bad,Great to interact with customers daily and build those relationships
bad,"I work at the front greeting people as they enter the store. The most enjoyable part of this job is when it is time to get off. Working at Walgreens has been an eye opener for me. The least paid employees do most of the work, the easy and the hard it does not matter. The pay is not comparable to type the type work they expect you to perform."
bad,My typical day involved dealing with miserable management whose daily goal was to fire you. Otherwise it was an educational experience working as computer operator.
bad,Rite Aid is notorious in providing adequate pharmacy staff to run the business due to the reason pharmacist at high risk to make mistake in filling prescription. Rite Aid offer a good package of benefits for pharmacist specially health benefits and 4O1k. Store management normally do not interfere with pharmacy management.
bad,"I learned a lot about rebuilding printers, and enjoyed my co-workers, but the job was different than what they said it would be"
bad,"Walgreens is a great place to work for your first job, they train you very well and work with you to make sure you know exactly what you are doing. The hours are very flexible to allow you to go to school while you work. The biggest downfall would be the hours, the younger employees tend not to get full time status for awhile. The bump you from part time to full time by seniority, I was there for a year and some weeks I would only have 8 hours a week. They also had the same process for hours, don't expect morning shifts unless you cover for a long term employee who is on vacation "
bad,Management was very unprofessional and made working there very uncomfortable. Staff was nice for the most part.
bad,The corporation is way too much into micro-managing. You are held accountable for every second of every day.
bad,"They cut hours in the stores and at corporate. They hire top heavy leaving all middle management and lower short-staffed. People are stressed, the HR rules are not enforced, and the hiring practices are a joke. Analysts can require more experience than manager positions."
bad,"I lear mani things like managment, lidership,organization,"
bad,Everyday is always a bad day at this job. Supervisors are not fair at all. Favoritism. You can't even have a normal break.
bad,A typical day was okay. I didn't like to be in the sun. I did enjoy work with the guest.
bad,"Responsibilities include: restocking food products/coolers, and interacting and assisting customers"
bad,"A typical day at work consists of constant Customer Service , the experience of being able to help our customers have a awesome experience as they shop in our store. Through out my time with Walgreens i have learned that respect for customers as well as co workers is highly important. My co workers have helped me learn the things needed to be a successful employee as well as i have taught them the same , The hardest part of this job would be the up-keep , maintaining a clean store with all items placed in their proper location through out our open hours but i do enjoy remaining busy and making sure our store is presentable as well as clean so our customers can find things easily."
bad,Individual stores enjoyable to work at.
bad,"Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy deals with people that have chronic disease states or require high-dollar, specialty medications not readily available at community pharmacies. It's always busy, which makes the days go by quickly most days. The management team could definitely use a lot of improvement in various departments which is readily available if they were more attentive to employee needs and discomforts. The team at the site I was employed at was definitely like a huge family. Everyone looked out for everyone and teamwork really made the dream work and honestly my team was the only thing that made work bearable some days. The hardest part of the job was feeling unappreciated by upper and middle management as well as direct supervisors when we all worked so hard to meet company goals and numbers while helping the patients who need us direly. I will say that while this wasn't the worst place to work, it's not the best either or even close. Aside from the management shenanigans, we also had to deal with faulty equipment and subpar network systems and were still expected to perform ABOVE expected without the proper resources. Also, for the Walgreens slogan to be ""on the corner of happy and healthy"", the medical benefits there are horrible with high deductibles and and inconvenient joke of a Flex Spend program. Helping those patients was the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"return center overnight job , to hefty totes , do lot of return merchandise , need to label all in own place on shelf"
bad,I never fit in at Walgreens. I knew from the very beginning that I was a small town girl that needed to know her patients personally.
bad,Typical day starts with a barrage of emails of must do items that contradict each other. Planning and making daily notes for the staff is preached as a priority then all plans are superseded. Followed by a questioning of why notes weren't completed. Explaining that mandated tasks used the man hours that were to complete the store notes is unacceptable.
bad,"Carrying heavy items all the time. Help customers with photo orders. Sometime, i did manual bookkeeping. I learned a lot about customer services and being patient. Mangers were ok. i loved my co-workers. lifting heavy items. helping people and listen to their funny stories of awesome pictures"
bad,the management wasn't very understanding and you don't get many hours.
bad,Average compensation/benefits. Great interaction with customers'. Open late and during holidays.
bad,assistant managers are the last to know of any changes but we are suppose to uphold all employees mural at all times.and keep every customer happy. with out the tools that just doesnt happen
bad,a typical day for me.. After you punch in you have to go in the back room & get these tots & bring them out on to the main floor & stock the stuff in the tots. & Then ring up customers & just keeping the store clean. The one thing I really liked was the fact that the mangers would never ask you to do something that they them self wouldn't do.
bad,"Once at work you went straight to work and stayed working intil the bell rang for break or lunch or time to go home. No fun, no talking or leaing your station."
bad,This was a progressive company that had pharmacists performing multiple medical functions within the scope of practice of the pharmacy. I learned to operate the IC+ computer system which incorporated many safety checks to protect the patient & the pharmacist. My co-workers were very talented & efficient & enjoyable to work with. Work flow was the hardest part to manage in the very stressful environment.
bad,it's hard work some of the ones i checked were pretty nasty.you have to smile no matter what.
bad,i have two years retail experence.it is hard to work in retail.
bad,"I used to love coming to work all the time then every changed. I thought it was me because I was losing interest, then I figured out it was the company itself. There has been too many recent bad changes. It's harder now to move up unless you're real best friends with the store managers or the community leaders. I demoted myself from Assistant Manager so I could get a steady schedule for school and found out that I made a huge mistake because I show proof that I'm going to school and the Community Leader and Store Manager don't care and still schedule me to work on the same hours I have school. It's been very hard for me to stay positive at this work place that is why I'm pursuing any available job. I rather flip burgers than to keep working here honestly."
bad,Working at Walgreens has been very pleasant. A very diferent work enviroment of where I have worked before.
bad,"It is a VERY corporate, micro managed company.....they pretty much script the words that come out of your mouth, and require that you SELL, SELL, SELL...whether it be the prescription savings club, flu shots/ vaccinations, candy, promo items, ANYTHNG!"
bad,terrible management and community leadership..... LOve the pay hate the manangement.
bad,on your feet all day not necessary
bad,"Unfair business, Unprofessional mangement, great co workers, great enviroment."
bad,I enjoyed my time at Walgreens Co. I would usually work in the photo dept which allows me to be involved with more customers on a personal level. I also get to learn about most of the technology that most picture printing companies use. My day is always full there is never not anything to do. I mostly had a good relationship with most of management but as in any other job no one is there to be ur friend even thogh you may develop a very good friendship with most. I mostly enjoyed the customers that is one thing that may keep you coming to work or leaving work.
bad,I learned how both good managers and bad managers operate their business. I mainly worked with a bad manager with a serious lack of people skills. It is a very hard nose business with hours that can have closing up at midnight only to open the store at 7 am. The employees that worked hard and had a good time made the experience enjoyable. Customers that appreciate your hard work offset the nasty ones.
bad,"not very good at training, or the pharmacist was not very friendly as yelling at someone."
bad,"Not an easy job to have if you have other things going on in your life like school, other jobs ect. Hours are not good. Pay is not very good and I never got enough hours."
bad,"I used to love working for Walgreens, but management changed, then tech hours were cut constantly, we were not give enough help, we were asked to come in 30 minutes early to get a ""jump start"" on the day, but were not compensated for staying late to help out. Could not get any days off. I was told that we could only take off 1 weekend vacation per year, the rest had to be weekdays. Work every other weekend, holidays, and never appreciated for the hard work you do, only critisized. If management likes you, you are ok. If for some reason they don't, watch your back constantly."
bad,"Loved working with the employees, some managers. Customers were my main focus. Walgreens as a Co. has a great setup for employees, its when you get a cr-z- manager, that makes working there very trying."
bad,I have worked with Walgreens for 6 years. The company continues to make budget and resource cuts. Yearly bonuses taken from management. Toxic culture. No support from leadership.
bad,"Walgreens overall is a good place to work at, but they do not care about employees safety. Will work with your schedule. Very good job if you are in school."
bad,"I had a death in my family and was told that I did not want to work."
bad,"My particular location doesn't offer much room to grow with the company. Photo has become meshed with the front registers, which makes it very hard to get work done. Walgreens is starting to merge photo and the front registers to ""save money."" You also will no longer receive a $300+ bonus check at the end of the year. You will now be rewarded 25,000 points to spend in the store, which is equivalent to $25, which expires two weeks later."
bad,"Walgreens as a company does not care about their employees.  I am sure it is the same as every retail establishment, wanting you to do way more work with way less hours."
bad,I started out at Walgreens as a Beauty Consultant excited for the responsibilities of my position and the possibility to move up in the company. I personally struggled with the management and feeling supported by other team members. Personally I feel that big companies care more about money and expanding business than they do about their employees.
bad,"Worst place ever worked, was hired and just felt like I was placed on an island. 98% of the coworkers were nice and of course the one I have to work with has the personality of a wet mop! No training or support was given when I started"
bad,"While I enjoy the work itself I feel like no one else cares about the upkeep of the store. It's just constantly messy and the shelves are usually pretty empty since there aren't enough people scheduled to do the stocking each day. There's also just this feeling of not being able to take a break with all the work that has to be done and the breaks are unscheduled. It is completely dependent on the workers to sort out who goes on break, which is difficult when there are usually only two nonmanagement people in a very busy store and one manager and no breaks allowed between 4 pm to 7 pm."
bad,I loved working the people but Management was not the best  I worked there for 10 years and feel they never appreciated my hard work and efforts  I trained a lot of other Pharmacy Technicians but Management always gave me a hard time
bad,"They used to be a good compaby but now they are turning into cvs. Bad customer service, no employee loyalty, cutting hours. Work/life balance is non existent if you are management. Corporates mistakes are being laid on the brick and mortar team members shoulders."
bad,"Any promises manage makes you need to get it in writing. Promises are not otherwise kept."
bad,"It always depends on your store, but for the most part, you’re overworked and definitely not paid enough. You MIGHT get a 50 cent raise from annual evaluations. Lots of pressure from corporate, poor management and communication is lacking. They’re also very lenient with call ins which happened often at my store. It’s not for everyone and I would only recommend to people who are desperate for a job."
bad,"As a student, it was an okay job. However, due to a fluctuating schedule, it was hard to plan ahead. I liked working there, however, because the people were kind."
bad,"It’s an ok job, management is not to bad. But the pay is horrible. They have some ok shifts once you have been working there for a while and your ranking goes up. But they pay you as if you’re in high school. I’ve been working there for 3 years and only have gotten a 87 cents raise sense I’ve been there. If you have real bills and kids to take care of this is not the job for you."
bad,"Pros: "
bad,"worked as a sales cashier for store located in Bloomington mn young managers were very rude and disrespectful to older employees, and at time to consumers. very understaffed and underappreciated for the time and work put in. Management very demeaning towards employees in front of consumers. This company lacks professionalism, respect, and common courtesy to fellow employees. Working at this location is like working in the getto!"
bad,Foreign Company has taken over and diluted the family values this company used to have.  Firing long term team members over stupid things just to save a dollar for the shareholder.  Shoplifting on the rise (and not just at Walgreens).  Too much to do and not enough help to do it.
bad,At the end of my tenure with Walgreens the company seemed to be having a nation wide cultural change. Skeleton crews and high expectations while management seemed to not do much of anything.
bad,Pressured everyday to make a rate. People in their 60s are required to keep up with people in their 20s or be fired. Benefits are not good for the amount of work you do.
bad,"I really don't have much good to say about working for this company. Being part time they were flexible with my college schedule and my mentally unstable child that was the only good thing. The training was not good at all, under staffed, and very stressful to work for when they only cared about the numbers than their customers."
bad,"Work culture all Depending on location. "
bad,Good place to work if not looking to attend college or pick up a trade. Discounts available as well as employee perks. Pop drug test is out dated and discriminatory practice
bad,Work at Walgreen was different everyday. someways it wouldn't be busy and it would be nice and easy going. other days it would be short staffed and hectic but we would still get everything done. Walgreen is a good first job for anyone. teaches you alot about cashiering and a bunch of other skills. i started off as a cashier then moved into the photo department and then became the main warehouse guy at my Walgreens. ended getting promoted to designated hitter for the pharmacy. It was all fun unbtil they started cutting everyone's hours and i was basically kicked out of my store since they only scheduled me one day out of the week.
bad,"I can't speak to the culture of the whole company, but their LEAP management training program describes and trains a culture that most employees would find rewarding, engaging and comfortable."
bad,Manager favors younger girls. If you were pregnant you got all you asked for. No team atmosphere. Manager was lazy as well as the assistant manager. Other shift leaders would expect you to do most of the work.
bad,"I worked at Walgreens for a Summer Youth Program, a 12 week part time job, and the managers were ruthless. Forcing minors to scrape gum off of the floor while customers watched and refusal to learn workers' names. This place ruined my entire summer."
bad,"Very stressful and toxic environment"
bad,I ABSOLUTELY hate it and wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy. I like my job but the leadership is terrible. Definitely feel as though any suggestions or concerns go into one ear and out the other. They talk to their employees as if we neglect common sense and are unaware of our rights as employees. Too many times I find myself contacting corporate due to the negligence of the Store Manager and the ASM. I feel as though they work us and sit on their behinds. Instead of sitting around watching camera footage looking for nothing how about actually working and not watching your store and team fail.
bad,When I started Walgreen's 15 year's ago I thought I had a career I just got out of college I was nationally certified and licensed in pharmacy as the years. Went on they cut our hours I couldn't afford to pay for my insurance so alot of us got a second job. It is a good job for someone who can only work part time. They are open 365 days a year so you work alot of holidays which I wasn't told .
bad,The hours are stressful. Your shifts are never consistent so your sleep schedule is always off. No overtime. Constantly asking you to do more while simultaneously cutting hours and resources. To make thing run quickly you are told to pencil whip rather then comply with corporate training. Don't spend any time with customers but make sure they give a good survey.  Get your training done but use several devices so it can be done ASAP. customers.
bad,If I had to go back to work at Walgreens I would probably want to work in the pharmacy area. The people on the floor deal with way too much stuff having to deal with theft and security.
bad,"If you work less than 20 hours, you do not get benefits. They work you on "
bad,"Corporate cut hours, so not enough staff to provide good customer service.  Very fast paced.  Never any down time.  You are lucky if you can get a break, even to use the restroom. Sometimes you can't get a lunch break. Not enough staff to handle how many customers there are. You are constantly running back and forth from the front register to cosmetics, photo, to electronics and diagnostics.  Sometimes outside to do propane tank exchanges and running back up to front with 5 people in line waiting and upset. No photo dept. person at night & photo is very demanding.  Alot of photo work takes alot of time to complete which you simply do not have.  Canvas', photo books, wood panels, wall hangers, the list goes on and on.  Only 2 people working at night several times a week, which includes one manager.  Customers on the floor constantly needing help and you can't get to them because the lines at the register are too long.  Upper management doesn't work nights or weekends, so they have no idea how demanding it truly is.  You are constantly being hounded about work that is not done, that is impossible to complete with the customer load.  Hardest part of the job:  Dealing with so many angry customers over wait times, photos not being ready on time, or simply just not enough staff to help them.  Also no time to complete paperwork or other jobs that need done.  Most enjoyable part of the job:  The relationships you have with some of your regular customers that brighten your day and actually try to help you deal with the angry customers because they know it isn't your fault, also, the"
bad,"Walgreens provides competitive compensation rates, but poor corporate management is requiring more work for the same amount of pay. If you work in a small store, be prepared to be understaffed for the tasks that corporate assigns and high pressure to meet their numbers. If you work at a larger, well staffed store, expect few hours and the same demands for results."
bad,I believe Walgreens spends a lot of money on advertising and buildings but do not compensate their staff well.  The beginning wage is very low and I got 5 or 10 cent raises per year.  I worked there 6 years and never made it to 10 per hour.
bad,"I'm an overnight manager at a 24 hour Walgreens. It is the most dangerous job I have had so far in my life. There's absolutely no security at some Walgreens. There's constantly thieves, mentally unstable, and homeless people, scammers, and irate customers. They don't care about the safety of their employees."
bad,"Working here, I felt like I was thrown to the wolves. There was very minimal training and responsibilities I was not made aware of when I applied for / accepted the job. On my first day, I was left alone after minimal introduction, which was quite stressful."
bad,Just stressful over all. Not much patience with me & not taking the time to train mw very well. A lot of favoritism & a lot of talking down on someone just because they make a mistake sometimes. A lot of lying & deceit.
bad,"I would get information and ask my superiors about it, and they had no idea what I was talking about.  You are just a number and replaceable.  Cared more about cutting costs than customers or employees, in my opinion."
bad,"I learned a lot while I was at Walgreens, in all the department though"
bad,"My store has been referred to as not your typical Walgreens people are usually unhappy working there but have gotten comfortable. Vacation hour cuts, Overloaded task on shifts, shifts leads are only referred to as management when convenient but whenever giving you commands will pose as management but when wrong is only a shift lead and you should've spoken to higher personnel. After a few talks, the employee {dissing} talking about each other behind each other back was fixed but I DEFINITELY was treated poorly because of it."
bad,"I have worked for Walgreens for almost 10 years and I enjoyed working for them in the beginning. With changes that came, (which I'm used to changes and don't normally mind them) the company is more worried about buying out the competitors rather than customer care and employee well being."
bad,"I was a ROP student at this site. My job was titled as ""Stock Clerk"". I would say this work environment was very quiet. There was not much communication. Management lacked in caring for the employees."
bad,"Wasn’t giving me hours , the manager was willing to give me more hours but she wasn’t, a lot of co workers was quitting, but it’s was a okay job......"
bad,The job was ok but required a lot of night and weekend hours! Mgmt doesn't take appropriate action concerning customer harassment!! Many Lawsuits have been filed against the company!!
bad,"Very stressful and exhausting."
bad,Unstable working enviroment for management great place for part time setting for college or high school level. Flexable schedules management willing to accomidate if needed
bad,"stressful work, the staff is too small, hours are not good for associates, at times it feels like you are stretched too thin, be ready for getting any possible shifts because some walgreens are open 24 hours"
bad,"Walgreens used to be awesome! But after working there 7 years they restructured and everything went downhill. Management used to be awesome but now they are unreasonable, purposefully wont work with you for special life events that may arise. Was given write-ups even if you could find coverage for a scheduled day. After 2 more years of working there I got several nonsense write-ups. They had drastically cut tech hours. We used to have lots of help in the pharmacy but after new structure we were working on a skeleton crew all the time. I think all the excess write-ups were because I was making more than their new structured pay-scale. Then I was let go."
bad,You will not have a life outside of work. They ask you to commute far away for a dollar or two more but at the cost of ridiculous scheduling. Management and co workers are nice. You only get to call off 5 times out of 365 days.
bad,Many people moved up that shouldnt have and left the store in shambles. There was always people talking behind your back. A lot of lying. Careless about your problems or schedule. And much harrassment just at our location and main manger wasn't the most helpful in those situations.
bad,Eill keep you busy especially if you work day shifts. Overnights can be a challenge especially depending on your store's location. Good Luck to you if you choose to apply.
bad,This company is Walgreens and i actially just started with this company. They bought out the company i worked for and added my years forward. Ive been moved 4 times as an assistant and im trying to grasp their way of the company. Once i get it down pack i may be okay. But what i see its okay in some areas and need improvement in others.
bad,"Why allow yourself to be bullied into working overtime and constant threats of losing a job that will kill you?  I stayed for 21 years and finally took my chance to do something meaningful.  It was like being brainwashed.  It took a full year away to finally feel rested and realize what a horrible job it really was.  I look back and hate that I wasted a good portion of my life there instead of the job I have now.   I actually enjoyed the type of work but the management .....  They act like they are in charge of machines not people.  I watched all my coworkers limp to their cars every day...  But they still go back for more.  Pay is great, but what is the point if you can't enjoy life...."
bad,Too many bad things as of lately and not to many positive. A ton of work to do with a skeleton crew to do it. Long lines and demanding customers with no time to stock shelves or give good customer service.
bad,"It depends on the store you work at. Some stores have strict managers that make you work the whole 8 hours, while some stores are more relaxed about stocking. Also customers can come in and complain about the discounts especially when the computer doesn't take the discount."
bad,"within in the last 5 years the company changed a lot and it was not for the better of it's employees. bonuses taken away from senior techs, pto days taken away, sick days are included in your pto not seperate"
bad,I worked while I was in school. The hours weren't flexible and in the summer I was working 40 hour weeks. The shifts are random and were always different. Raises only happened once a year and they were small increases (0.25 and hour increases or so). While the hours weren't great the people were friendly.
bad,"Everyone is out for blood in this company. They all pretend they care about one another and have each other’s back, but the truth Is everyone is fake and will stab you in the back to get what they want. Management all the way to the higher ups are hypocrites, and unless you are part of the in crowd watch out cause they will criticize everything you do.    The company is poorly run, and they try just pile the work on expecting you to perform miracles."
bad,Too political to be worth it. I wanted a future with this company. Too many people have favorite employees who get legs up. It's more about who you work rather than how you work.
bad,I would not recommend working at Walgreens. It can be very stressful. And you can be treated very unfairly. There are many times where you have to run the register and photo.
bad,I would find a job here at Walgreens if I was still in school but I am now finished and it does not provide much. I will be starting to help out with rent and I am currently trying to pay bills and pay off some student loans and Walgreens pay does not help balance that out because I am not even making enough to be able to save some after I have paid off my bills.
bad,"Pay was decent, but only because I have experience. Whole company culture is toxic, everyone is bitter and the patients can tell. Advancement is easy but takes forever and comes with an insignificant raise, hardly worth the trouble. Applied because they said they would work with my school schedule, but that never happened and I ended up failing some mid terms. 3/13 would not recommend."
bad,I work in the pharmacy. The job is decent when we are fully staffed but when we are fully staffed no one gets the full 40 they are supposed to. Corporate won’t give us our full hours but expects us to do EVERYTHING still and get our hours at other Walgreens when there’s a call off. I hate the company. Soon as I find better I’m quitting.
bad,worked 14.5 yrs for the company. was never asked to advance even though i done my job excellent and above average. (former employee) the hours are steady but they need security put in the stores. too much stealing. alcohol should of not been brought in. teenagers steal it and get drunk before they go to school.
bad,awesome nice outgoing easy fun friendly ok place to work learn a lot friendly staff growth available nice staff manager nice great awesome nice schedule
bad,"Walgreens is a fairly decent company to work for. If you are coming out of high school. But an fully grown adult with responsibilites could not make a living here at Walgreens. Management are good people. The problem is, there's no career advancement what so ever. There are employees that have been here for 15 plus years with the company, that are just order pickers. The raises each year are not good at all 15-45 cents at the most. 45 being the high end. Benefit packages went up a lot within the last year. No over time at all, at no time."
bad,Once anything goes wrong the store manager basically looks into a way to fire you if not possible for any little things you are doing wrong... fairly absurd
bad,"I’ve been working at this particular location for almost a year and a half, and I haven’t received a promotion or pay bump. I am a hard worker, and I always put 100% effort but management does not recognize my work. The Shift leads here are horrible, they don’t wanna help with any situations involving angry customers. Also, they have a lot of negative energy. However, my direct store manger is nice and caring. I  manage to get 35-40 hours a week, so I stay around for the good hours and they offer benefits. I have some pretty cool co workers, so that is always a plus. But I wish there was more positive reinforcement from management."
bad,"while its a regular cashier job, I feel that the environment is unsafe, there were always needles in the waste baskets and they had us take the trash out and fling it in the dumpster, making us at risk for viral diseases.  My manager told me to reach in the basket and pick out the needle first and throw then in a basket with my bare hands!!!! no thanks, I don't want diseases thank you."
bad,"Im a member of Leadership and I cant afford not to work a second job, which i am looking for."
bad,"I worked for walgreens for 18 years, I was in mgt for 14 years and learned a lot and gave this company my heart and soul.I worked hard and was willing to learn as much as I could to move up quickly, they offer benefits which is a blessing."
bad,"The job was great 12 years ago when I started, as the years advanced the workload increased, hours for the department were cut, and it got to the point where I could not have a life at home. The company eventually off boarded  our department off to IBM which is where I currently am. "
bad,"I left because of poor Management Associate relations. Was not considered for advancement, although all support staff recommended me.Work hours were spotty, averaged anywhere from 5-35 hours a week. District Management was not supportive."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was being follow while you was actually doing you job. Also, not get recognition for when you come into work all the time when people would call in or stay later to come the shift"
bad,"Nota bad company but one that is only focused on the bottom line...constantly looking for ways to move expensive (many weeks vacation, higher salary then younger pharmacist,etc)   The job has many challenges, but with hard work you can have a great experience."
bad,"Upper mgt has lost their integrity and ethics, they treat people as if loyalty and experience means nothing. The Europeans have ran the Walgreens Americans know and love into the ground, which is sad to see them go in this direction. Greed has gotten the best of them and a once debt free company is headed for bankruptcy."
bad,"Typically when you work the front register, you have other peripheral tasks as well. These other tasks include stocking assigned aisles, stocking front coolers, stocking impulses, stocking the front wall, putting up appropriate signage/price tags, scan-outs, help process photo orders, etc."
bad,"The budget drives everything to the detriment of work quality standards. However, the environment is generally friendly. Can be an enjoyable place to work."
bad,"always understaffed everywhere, even the pharmacist who has a doctorate is running around stressed. company didn't seem to care too much for their employees. the pay isn't great. and they give you united healthcare which is garbage. 4,000 in debt for using insurance"
bad,"Mainly provided customer service at front end, Workplace culture was not conducive to advancement. "
bad,My store wasn’t understanding about sicknesses and urged you to come in even if you I was sick. I didn’t feel like I had the opportunity to grow within the company or my position.
bad,Worked there before. Was able to pick back up pretty easy after being gone a good while. Some things changed but basics are the same. I am thankful to work there while I look for a better opportunity.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work here unless it is there first time getting a job. They pay is not that great and the schedule is very inconsistent.
bad,"Preparing medications for customers to pick-up. Management is OK. The culture is a ""put my time in and leave"" type. Hardest part is dealing with customers."
bad,"When I first started it was a nice place to work, but policies have changed and what used to feel like a family is now hostile, managers are no longer allowed to be friends with lowly cashiers and floor staff, so anamosity has developed, which is sad, because at one time those same managers were friends with the lowly floor crew, corporate has made so many new policies that the customer truly doesn't come first any more, and workers don't have any dignity."
bad,"I have worked for this company for over 6 years now and when I first started I was so happy. Everything ran smoothly and I had no complaints. They have changed so much that the store is falling apart and I'm afraid for the business because of this. Management is all over. The turnover rate is horrible. Unfortunately this is where I now have to make the decision to do what is best for me and my Career. The most enjoyable part is working for the customers and meeting special people who will forever touch your life in some way and vice versa. When you have a great team of workers this also makes you never want to leave no matter how hard it may get, but there comes a point when you say enough is enough and chase your dreams where a company is expanding and growing and you can be apart of a team not a company that works against each other and management is all over. One thing I can say is I'm grateful for how much I've learned throughout trainings and self taught hard work in order to train staff to have a better team."
bad,"Terrible staff, usually lazy. Compensation is pretty good, but benefits are starting to get cut. Payroll budgets are getting cut, so it’s a lot harder to find stable hours. Upper management like the district offices expect for people to do extra work without extra pay. A lot of stores play favoritism."
bad,"In the time I was at Walgreens they would champion how they were for the employees and how they would always look to within to promote first then go outside for hiring. At first, it was like that, however, as time went on they lost their way in which they try to champion they are for the customer and employees and that they are trusted since 1905. Now they pay below the market for employees while continuing to slash the budget. They say their focus is on helping the ensuring the customers are happy, but with the various piolet programs they try to run all the employees are running around just trying to keep up and help all the customers while completing a crucial task for the store.  When it comes to Pharmacy they try to promote as cultural of speed which leads to errors, and with the slashing of budgets throughout the store, this only leads to greater stress on employees. This causes them to lose valuable experienced employees."
bad,"Specialist that reviewed returned pkgs, inventory, dispensing, oe, outbound calls, specialty set up, C2 disposal, salvage.  "
bad,"It's stressful to say the least. I let management know up front what my availability was and they refused to work with me, but allowed other employees to have whatever schedules they wanted. I had two ASMs tell me that they couldn't ""cater to everyone"" but they planned their own schedules however they wanted. My latest ASM removed me from the pharmacy and had me working as a ""check out girl"" (as a customer called me) full time despite over a year of experience in the pharmacy. There were cliques within the stores I worked in, making it unenjoyable to go to work. I worked very hard on the days I went in, and only called in when absolutely necessary (IE my mental health was so low I couldn't move, or I was throwing up twice an hour- and even then I forced myself to work so I wouldn't be fired). The company cares that they have employees there to help screaming customers. They don't care about the employees one bit. The most enjoyable part of the job, though? Going home."
bad,"There was no room for real advancement and there was a lot of favortism going on, the bosses son worked there and he got away with murder, he'd be sleeping on the job, on his cell playing games etc with no reprecussions but single moms were hassled for having their cell phones on their desks"
bad,"Upper management for this company is out of touch with the staffing needs of the individual stores.  The company expects excellent customer service and outstanding NPS scores to keep insurance contracts, yet doesn't provide the staff necessary to accomplish either of these goals effectively."
bad,"Walgreens was a temporary job just for me to get paid while I was finishing high school. However, the hours made it difficult to get homework done when they would schedule me four evenings in a row even though they said school came first. The management changed very often and they all had different styles, making the store feel very inconsistent."
bad,making sure customers are satisfied. :I have learned that how to make all regular customer laugh.: I get along with all my management.: It is high we are all busy.: The heavy lifting like the cases of water and the sodas.: The customers who put a smile on your face and make you laugh.
bad,"Walgreen's is a good job if your not trying to do any hectic tasks or don't like working a quick paced.  I didn't mind the job at first because I was serving while I was working at Walgreen's so the change of pace was fine.  But once I got used to serving, Walgreen's became too slow and mundane for me.  Also, the pay isn't enough for a part time job.  Minimum wage job and they always give me night shifts on the weekends when I'm available during some weekdays and during the days on the weekdays.  I have nothing against the co-workers and managers but the job itself and it's paradoxical policy makes this job so not worth it.  Especially for the pay.  Too many requirements on having to take breaks, when I don't really want to because it just removes money from my salary."
bad,In the shipping department things are wonderfully managed. The work is smooth and consistent in the proper season. The other departments are based on weird schedules.
bad,"Typical day: stressful, not enough help at times-when call offs occur, can't expect experienced staff to cover call offs; high demands and long hours-highly task oriented; minimum work life balance;"
bad,"I loved my time at Walgreens.  I worked there for 17 years.  14 of those years were in tourist/beach locations which is where I really cut my teeth.  I learned so much from so many great people there over the years.  Growing multiple markets from scratch, implementing successful beach programs and watching people that worked for me get promoted were some of my best memories from my time spent at Walgreens over the years."
bad,I know the company does not believe in setting a higher wages for the employees .and far as safety with the high theft rate it is one of the biggest loss.I see they have no safety guide lines in preventing theft from the store.this store has open door were you can steal product and Merchandise and get away with it with no action taking.
bad,You learn as you go without proper training.  You will need to think quickly and go what the given plan to you to execute work.  Continue to provide a great service to all patrons.
bad,This is not a company I would recommend working for there treatment of employees.  There are lots of great policies in place but they are constantly changing and often not following anyways. There is no loyalty for long term employees like there use to be 10 to 20 years ago.
bad,Walgreens is very strict with their customer service policy.  It's too ridgid and its hard to remember everything you are supposed to ask the customer
bad,"I work as a pharmacy technician and I’ve been there for 8 months, just put in my two weeks. It is the worst place I have ever worked for. All of the people are great and that is the reason I’ve stayed so long but the job itself is terrible. Corporate keeps cutting our hours so everyone is down to one or two days a week. I can’t support myself with working only 8 hours a week. The computer system sucks and is extremely slow and freezes a lot! If your considering working as a pharmacy technician at Walgreens don’t do it!"
bad,Only plus....Great store manager!
bad,Very little training and explanation of what your job entails. Poor management and lack of communication between management and employees. Everyone just kind of guesses what their job is.
bad,"Walgreens was a great place to work at,  I enjoyed working here but I just wasn't getting the hours that I wished for and I just wanted some change to work more with interacting with customers."
bad,Bad experience working for this company. Started off with 2 days of orientation. 8 hours a day of learning about teamwork and taking tests. You start with a team meeting at the beggining of the shift. You have to keep a pick rate each department has a different rate 200-350 products a hour. They say. Your with a trainer for 30 days and only had me with one for a hour. Once you get the hang of it they will move you around departments and your rate will drop just because of the time it takes to get there. They expect you to keep your pace from the time you start to the time you finish and you usually work 12 hour shifts. On one floor i was picking above average and they never put me back there. They set you up to fail and even say in the orientation its not set up for you to fail.
bad,its was alright had to stop working because a family situation happened i tried to return but they would not let me so i went to go look for another job
bad,"Walgreens is very demanding: Store Conditions is the priority number one, Customer number two, but they don't care about employees conditions, dont go"
bad,Does not stand behind trusted employees who have been with the company for 10+ years.   Promotes employees who have been with company for negligible years.
bad,Flexible hours and good benefits. Good 401k. Nice environment to work in.  Management is very helpful  and make you feel like family. Everyone is a big family.
bad,"Store Manager did not care about his employees, people said he has a huge turnover because he is not good to the people that work for him. If you are not willing to help me out, I am not going to work for you. It takes a good team to run a store and he clearly is not doing it right. Sorry but is the truth"
bad,"It's always do more with less."
bad,"The culture is to try to get improvement constantly with lesser resources.  Management will cut hours in a store 10% or more and expect customer service, in-stock condition, and store condition to improve. Ten months later, they come and do it again.  I understand that payroll is the largest controllable expense, however, there are several layers of bureaucracy and wasteful, unneeded tech purchases that should be addressed before pillaging the stores. The majority of stores run with two people covering a 10k square front end area and one of those people, the shift leader or manager, is pulled back and forth between there and the pharmacy. It was a great company and could be so again if they invested payroll in the stores."
bad,"Varies heavily based on location and the people working with you. With a good manager, your store can be a wonderful and fun place to work. With a bad manager it can be one of your worst jobs."
bad,"When I started for Walgreens, a pharmacy company, it was led with pharmacists who did the right thing for the customer and for the company.  When non-pharmacists took over, there was little respect for patient safety if you could get around it to make another dollar.  My store manager became my boss and I was told that doing Medication Therapy Management ""took food out of his kids' mouths"". What?! That didn't even make sense. He fought and fought to stop MTM at our store and finally won when they restructured management so that he could be the one to make that decision.  I was not in charge of hiring pharmacists but I was in charge of making sure all the hours were covered at a 24 hour store where I managed, even though I wasn't the one who even created the schedule or granted time off.  Bonuses became more and more subjective and were completed by your store manager and became more and more out of reach.  It is good for a ""first job"" and get some experience under your belt, but you are very replaceable by newer grads who cost less and don't object to awful work environments.  Store managers have their technician license and are supposed to help when you need to catch back up but they mostly do not respond when you ask for help.  At my store and district, it was a constant cultural fight between store and pharmacy.  The district manager leads by fear, and bad example. I finally quit when I realized I bent over backward for a company who stiff-armed me.  Following my resignation, 9 other pharmacy managers in my district also resigned in the next 60 days, and 6 more in the next"
bad,I had worked there for 11 years and didnt get the advancement I deserved. The managers did not resect employees for the jobs that were perfomed. Overall I love my customers
bad,"The company is more concerned with money than quality of employees and customer service. My location, in particular, has a full staff of employees who treat both the customers and other employees very poorly. When I finally went to my manager for the 5th time concerning a hostile work environment, I was informed that it would be better for one great worker to quit from the strain of the position than it would be to fire those employees who caused the most problems. You receive zero support from upper management and get paid far too little for what you have to work through."
bad,Working at walgreens was satisfactory for awhile but I need a better
bad,Open 24 7 Everyone always called off. Management was ok to work with. Was getting my BA degree in business and the company showed no interest in promoting pretty dumb if you ask me learned a lot about drugs
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Liked the job but manager liked to schedule and give hours to the favorite employee. Not fair policy or performance scheduling,"
bad,"I worked a flag ship store which was always busy. There was always work to do, filling shelves packing out totes that came in making sure the the aisle where clean and nice and no was stealing from them."
bad,"Personal change very often. Consequently, is difficult to build a team.Task could be overwhelming since they are always under staff. Work ethic is not very highly."
bad,used to be a very employee oriented company
bad,"I don't treat my patients as numbers, but the management treats me so. No major issue but still let go. I thought I would retire from this company, it turned out I'm naive. What a great lesson learned !"
bad,Had a crazy manager who threatened to let me go. Luckily enough that person was let go but after I left. This manager couldn't run a store properly nor control their employees.
bad,"Walgreens wants to be the best pharmacy out there. Upper management's approach is to buy other pharmacies vs make sure every pharmacy is running the best it can. They ask for ideas on how to fix they company but never follow through even with customer complaints. The survey that helps keep the raise is unfair, annoying to fill out, and doesn't even accurately rate the store."
bad,"Job is okay for somebody without aspirations. The work is tedious, boring, and non-engaging. The advancement process is slow, arbitrary, and often times counter productive. I first started working there and I enjoyed the job, but the corporate umbrella started to rear it's ugly head and they had their hand in every single aspect of every day."
bad,Easy job with very poor management many people were always late. Not very much recognition or praise for a job well done. Lack of proper training hurt the staff.
bad,There were days during the flu season where I spent a solid 4-6 hours behind the counter in front of a full line getting yelled at by sick people nonstop before a pittance of a lunch break just to come back to do it all over again after. No one is happy at Walgreens. It’s a bunch of sick people who think that if there is any issue with there prescription it’s because you did it to them personally. It can be a beating.
bad,"I work at the store in Parkchester and the management was terrible. They are very manipulative and do not care about there workers at all. The rest of the team is great and when the managers aren't there, the store has great energy."
bad,"Our store was constantly robbed and held up, I brought it up to management they told me, ""It's too expensive to hire security."" When I ended up leaving they were installing bullet proof glass in the pharmacy. I never felt safe where I worked and was on constant alert suspicious of all guests. The management was fine I just wished we had some damned security guards."
bad,"Overall, working at Walgreens was flexible. I was a student at the time and they worked well with scheduling. Management and the training they receive could be better. Also, there isn't room for advancement with the company. I worked in a high theft area and that was probably the hardest part of the job."
bad,"I was at Walgreens for 5 years as a manager.  They had very little opportunities for growth.  Walgreens has already built all of their stores and now had competition like CVS, Target, Cub and so on."
bad,Its such  a nice place to live. It's a place where you can feel completely comfortable. The other thing I appreciated was an  emphasis on taking your career info/skill set to the  next level.
bad,"busy fast paced environment, poor upper management and very biased leadership, hours are ok, 3rd shift is the best schedule if you can get it,  advancement isn't possible"
bad,"9 years ago Walgreens wasn't a bad company to work for.  I had better, more affordable benefits, more supportive management, a senior technician bonus for working at busier stores, Christmas bonuses, and a more employee focused environment. Over the last few years employees have less respect, more duties with less pay and recognition, and worse benefits.  Customers can swear at us, make threats, be rude and disrespectful and we are told that it is our own fault.  We are understaffed and underpaid."
bad,"They are really trying to cut as much as they can, Including pay, benefits, help. It is a terrible work atmosphere and stressful! I cannot wait to get out."
bad,"How are you going to continue to constantly cut hours when customers always complain about the long line? Cutting help does not help customer service, safety, and efficiency."
bad,"only get a 30 min break for 10 hour shift. you have the option to take 2 15 min breaks but never are allowed to take them due to the lack of employees. Customer is always right when sometimes they take it too far. When weather warnings are issued you are still made come to work no matter the road conditions. Never get a cash bonus, always with reward points only used IN STORE. Company is greety and management agrees. Too many rules and regulations. Also not allowed to say Merry Christmas due to offending other beliefs"
bad,"Constant flow of customers, restless shifts in which employees are on their feet at all times and not allowed to sit unless on a break. Robotic phrases must be said to every customer and same movements with every transaction. Truly the most repetitive job I have had."
bad,"Only those who were the favorites got special treatment there.  The ones who the management didn't like, needles to say it was obvious they didn't like the person for some reason.  The supervisors there would walk around using their cell phones and not doing their job, then yell at you for talking to loud.  The management doesn't care about anyone as a person.  You are just a person in that seat.  What your problems are, they don't care. You are constantly under threat of how you treat the customers who are yelling at you, your points, how long you take for lunch, etc.  Makes you think you will get fired at any moment for any reason.  It is not a good way to run a business and keep happy employees there.  It is very obvious why they are constantly going through so many employees and can't keep any there.  If they treated any of them decent, they would stay.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone after the way I was treated."
bad,"I worked there for six years the place discriminate against minority, black and female. You need to be very friendly to the boss in order for you to stay,otherwise they float you from one store to another."
bad,"The job/work itself is easy, but the lack of staff makes it unbearable. If it weren't for my current manager I would have already quit. The culture of the company gives little room to care for it's employees with it's main focus being the customer/patient. The compensation I receive does not make the stress worth it, but I'm at the highest I can get paid in retail. I can honestly say that the hardest part of the job is keeping employees: with such low pay, high stress, the turnover rate is high."
bad,Corporate is always pushing a new metric.  Pharmacist and technicians are stretched to the brink.  Benefit packages are too expensive for what they pay.
bad,I would not recommed working here as it is now called Option Care.  The management does not praise your work and will take credit for work you have done.  The pay is good and the employees are nice.  No room for advancement and management is lacking experience.
bad,Not given enough staff to adequately meet the needs of your patients.  Management has never worked in a pharmacy therefore can not understand or relate to pharmacy needs.  This causes a lot of friction and problems.
bad,"A lot of pressure to reach goals with little help. Everything has a number attached to it, including the employees. some members of leadership target people they may not like."
bad,the coworkers I had at my store and the fact that they would work with my college hours is why I was loyal and stayed here for over 3 years. I was not recognized for my achievements or paid fairly for my promotions or time there.
bad,Under paid and over worked. Very intense and fast pace with not enough help. With experience more pay should be offered but it is not. Really not much room to grow
bad,Walgreens wants people to work hard but not expect anything in return. There are never enough people or budgeted hours to satisfy the demands and expectations. Walgreens sets stores up to fail the metrics and lays the pressure on thick.
bad,"I would not recommend. I worked at a store with poor management. long work days some weeks other weeks with little to no hours. The hardest part of my job was working alone on the floor while simultaneously working photo and cash register, helping customers, answering the phones and stocking. while there were 6 other employees were working in the pharmacy. I felt it was dangerous and overwhelming. This was not an isolated incident this happened on multiple occasions even after voicing my concern to management."
bad,"As a company, Walgreen has changed a lot.  The company used to be family oriented with the employees now it is about business.  The environment has changed tremendously.  Now it seems as though the company is gearing towards the younger generation which makes the older generation unappreciated.  Also our paid time off is now called PTO which is geared toward earning vacation time instead of receiving time off at the beginning of the year."
bad,"The typical day at this store is opening, then working freight, facing shelves, dealing with returns and making sure employees take breaks on time, show up on time and then if closing locking the store up, balancing all the drawers and safe and cleaning."
bad,"Walgreens use to be a great place to work, until they got greedy. We took on more insurance contracts for pharmacy, which meant a major increase in workload, but with less help since they cut our hours so ridiculously bad. We are constantly stressed to the max, have to move 100 mph to pound out prescriptions, which means less time to focus on each individual prescription, which leads to increase risk of mistakes on prescriptions. When it's time for surveys about our store, we tell the truth about how stressed we are and corporate then blames the store manager, who has no control over the budget. Corporate is the one stressing us out but they don't hear us or take accountability."
bad,Unrewarding in all ways but pay and very little communication with the people upstairs.  Work here if you want to feel like just another piece of meat.
bad,"Want to work in a face paced environment where there’s not enough help? Here’s the job for you. Do you like working a 10 hour shift standing with only a 30 minute lunch break? Having customers yell at you about the hold music? Having a pharmacy manager that makes 3xs as much as you do, and needs to be helped constantly  like a big baby?! Well sign up."
bad,"A typical day at work, never enough techs scheduled on any given day. What I learned is to never trust anyone in management. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to help the pharmacy customers."
bad,It's a good place to work but I have a little baby and I want a set schedule. Everything will be fine if we had security and I had a set schedule. I enjoy working with the customers.
bad,"I have worked for the corporation for roughly a year and I have received no advancement in my position. I have seen people come and go while I was one of the few that had stayed hoping for things to turn around. Nothing had changed and we had a new assistant store manager transfer in and she had tried to make things better while driving us to hate our jobs even more. we were understaffed and no one was doing anything about it as we were sent to work hours that we had requested off or work days we ""had off."""
bad,It is not family friendly and you are just a number to them. They are out to be number one and they do not care about how there choices effect you the just want work.
bad,been having a strange time at walgreens. don't seem to like when i dispose of expired foods or clean but complain i don't work hard enough at register
bad,"It is a nice place to start if anyone is wanting to get their pharm tech license as they offer classes and compensate for the exam upon passing, but other than that its a very stressful work environment and there's always too much to do and too little time to get anything done."
bad,I like the people I have worked with.  I did not like the budget cuts and hours cuts so that they can increase profit margin for share holders.  This decrease the effectiveness and efficiency and the pharmacy and jeopardized the safety of patients.
bad,My team was Fantastic. I would love to continue working there but I simply cant afford to. I was able to earn a raise with a Certification and it was a 1$ raise for several months of company mandated classes that were located over a hour away. I get along great with my team and we accomplish seamless transitions and wholly support each other. I simply just cant afford to work there.
bad,"I like the culture of the place, just a little stressful, due to lack of employees"
bad,"False promises,I was promised growth the store manager at this specific store would lie to all employees. Promising growth but never allowing it,hours here are very small and they cut corners as much as possible,extreme amounts of work for little pay. management views the team member as garbage with little to no respect."
bad,need to pay employees better like before they took $7.00 away from me to do the same job. New employees need to be trained better and not just get thrown in a job. Training is key.
bad,"Management was really big on the corporate way of doing things, and always keeping everyone busy. Yes, walgreens is a large company, but most employees were teenagers. The store culture was just stifling. Also, don't even try asking for a raise. No matter what the circumstances are, you only have a chance to get one once a year."
bad,"company cut hours and cut hours to the point you could not get all the work done "
bad,"At first, I really loved my job. It has the potential .. depending on yor managers. My manager almost seemed annoyed everytime i would ask anything and lack of employees made me responsible for EVERYTHING"
bad,"It is a job.  There are good people and good aspects of it, I enjoy some of it, but as a whole it was frustrating at times and never felt like a career or anything more than a stepping stone and job.  Things were usually short staffed, which could make things stressful.  The corporation dictated the hours and scheduling hours, not the pharmacy manager or senior tech, so that was sometimes in disconnect.  "
bad,"Would not recommend. Company is not flexible with hours when it comes to emergency situations, there is a limit to doctors notes they allow, they do not give days off basically ever if you're bilingual and make it a hassle to get PTO or any other vacation dates even if its in advance. Company wants to improve but their point system is ridiculous and childish. It does more damage than help."
bad,"They dont pay what you are worth as a CPhT. But different people have different opinions. I have met some people, who love Walgreen's and will work for them for the rest of their lives."
bad,"learned how to work a cash register, cleaned out back rooms and stocked shelves on my free time, management was some what unprofessional which is the reason i resigned"
bad,"I enjoy working for this company, however I don't believe the pay is fair. I spend a lot of time in Walgreens however my check never reflects it. I enjoy working around people ad well as being a cashier. Upon my hiring I was never informed I would be required to stay an hour after close to straighten the store. I never knew anything about having to unload a truck and stock the store. I honestly just feel the pay is not fair for the amount of work we are required to do. I spend over 60 hours on clock every two weeks and my check is never 500, that's not enough to support my son, bills or anything else as a single parent. I honestly believe the pay should be better."
bad,"A relaxed environment, slow paced and laid back. At time it can become fast pace depending on the peak of day.I enjoyed working for this company. I appreciated the opportunity. I enjoyed the experience."
bad,"Employees aren't trained very well.  Management doesn't really care about their employees (employees forced to work after vomiting or after a death in the family), but they do care about their favorites.  Hours are not steady.  One week you can have 8 hours and the next week, 25 hours.  Employees talk bad about each other and leave work for others.  Frequent miscommunication.  "
bad,"There were always more products or services we had to be pushing. We would have to meet unrealistic metrics while being understaffed. Executives don't have a clue about what's actually needed by employees, nor what customers actually want."
bad,Upper Management at this location is to power hungry. Her way or the highway no if and or buts. No Training if you want to advance you better find the time and resources yourself.
bad,"They do a wonderful job training technicians for others places. By that I mean that there is a very high turnover rate for a good reason. Once the technician obtains their training, state permit and national license, they move on to companies that will train them further and pay them so much more. They also get to move up at other places like insurance companies, hospitals, closed door pharmacies, and out patients pharmacies as well as many others."
bad,Walgreens never closes and its not fair to the employees working there. Leaving your family for Christmas and Thanksgiving is very hard work. You do get paid overtime for it but to me it is not worth it.
bad,"The overall job is super easy can do it in my sleep. The main issue i have is that no one is ever on the same page when it comes to processes you will get 4 different answers from 4 different people. Their policies are dumb and and it seems as if you will get wrote up if you stand up for 10 seconds. They pretty much want you to be confined to your seat and to never talk to anyone. If you cant handle MICRO MANAGEMENT then you might as well not apply. Pay is pretty good, overtime is pretty rare if you are outbound."
bad,A typical day at Walgreens can be summarized in one word: Hectic.  Our customers are very elderly and extremely demanding of their medications.  It is nonstop fun and the day goes by very quickly.
bad,"Decent job, just was promised that if I transferred to a store an hour away from my house that I would be promoted to management. Instead, they cut my hours. Overall the job isn’t horrible I just couldn’t afford to drive that far with less hours"
bad,"monotonous job, do the same thing every day, managers are not understanding at all, coworkers plot to ruin you. The GM was super helpful if it fit his agenda."
bad,This is not a company to depend on for long term they will change or terminate your position at any given time. My opinion this company does not care about well being of employees but more interested in dollar signs and how much the employee can bring in for the company
bad,"There was not much room for advancement for me. The people, employees and customers, were nice. The work was easy, not challenging though. The pay was sub-par."
bad,"First pharmacy job, so it was an okay place to work in the beginning. Terrible hourly pay for Pharmacy technicians.  Fast pace work environment. Great pharmacy manager at my location."
bad,"My day at work would begin by counting the safe and setting up the registers with cash drawers. The opening cashier would show up right about the same time as I did. I would then do a random inventory count, do any price changes that needed to be done, count waste, and begin working in my  section. Often I would be called for change, manager calls, and checking in the vendors. It was nice having a lunch break to sit down and rest for a bit but the up and down repetitive motion did my knees in. I learned about managing other employees and the do and dont's of corporate life."
bad,This is not the place for you if you are looking to get by while in school. Im not even making enough money. You are required to be cross trained in everything and will feel like a chicken with their head cut off constantly. I stress so much about the high energy environment. not for me.
bad,"Hardest part of this job is to no get any attendance, sick days, vacation days and late points , it takes 6 months before they fall off."
bad,Employees get only half an hour and not one hour break for a full day work. If you want to get one hour it's a hassle. Pay rate is low. Almost no benefits for part time employees.
bad,"Very disappointed in the direction the corporation has gone. More about profits for CEO than caring for the employees. I'm all about saving money, but at the cost of the team members that built and developed the company is wrong."
bad,"Sometimes i walk in not even looking forward to work, its stressful...i feel overlooked and overwhelmed. I feel like pharmacy gets special treatment than us working hard on the floor as well."
bad,"just trying to do better. With me being in college and graduating with a Business Degree in, management...I am trying to aim higher than just working in retail."
bad,Management was mostly poor and other coworkers would only think about themselves.  Not much team spirit.  The job work/life balance was not good either.
bad,"* Start up meetings, putting out cash drawers, and helping customers."
bad,"Walgreens is a perfect place to work if your looking for a simple, relaxed job. You'll get very bored easily but if you like getting paid for doing nothing give it a shot. If you work here long enough and start taking on bigger tasks such as Cosmetic sales or building displays, be prepared to be under appreciated and under paid for your efforts."
bad,I made life long friends with my coworkers. In my time there everyone was very helpful when I didnt understand something. They were very supportive but I wish management cared more for our safety.
bad,"There were employees drinking the wine on the job, management knew of it but decided to keep giving the person second chances and rehab options. But, were quick to fire a manger who mistakenly didn't pay for a mini lighter . The store manger ""accidentely"" took drops home but returned them ."
bad,I can't speak for all walgreens but I work in 3 different stores and  they were no different.  No communication within management or passing down to staff. The pay isn't woth the headaches between helping customers and dealing with staffs negative attitude.  Besides you can't really live off the pay unless you are an assistant store manager or higher. The only plus if you want to call it that to working for walgreens is you can't get fired unless you steal....... wait I forgot about the discount which is kinda of nice.
bad,"Nice Place to work"
bad,"I was an employee with Walgreens for almost 5 years. I was happy, but once I became a Certified Pharmacy Technician, it became clear to me that upper management shows clear favoritism and doesn't judge the employee on their actual skill but how much they like the employee."
bad,"I did not like working for Walgreens. It is a clicky environment. The pharmacist use to party with specific people. It made it for a bad work environment for those of us whom had lives and could not go to his parties. "
bad,No opportunities based on you work skills. Lack of training new comers. Untrustworthy employer such as store managers. Great customers and vacation and holiday pay.
bad,"The shifts change from day to day, week to week. There are no set schedules for shift leads. For the most part, the employees that you work with do the job with little to no supervision. The work is generally easy, if not monotonous. Most of the employees get along with each other. Company policy states that all shift leads need to be registered in the pharmacy. While challenging at times due to infrequent training, I am getting more proficient each day while working and learning from seasoned technicians and pharmacists. I have made friends at the job and feel as sort of a mentor to some of the younger employees."
bad,"I was at Walgreens during a very challenging period. The company was in a constant sate of lay-offs and reduction of staff. I really lived in fear that my job would be cut.  In addition, I was paired with some newer attorneys with whom I did not have the experience to teach, expecially when I was learning the job myself.  I was not comfortable in the Walgreen's environment."
bad,i did my intenship there . it was ok.. very busy nice people stood on my feet all day.. alot of costumer service. counted alot of pills. how to talk to alot of insurance companies
bad,"The company is changing rapidly. Retail has to evolve to stay competitive with E-Commerce, no doubt. The changes that are detrimental are to the team members that staff our stores. Compensation is being driven down, there is a lack of transparency with the changes being made, and to team members it's all about the dollars."
bad,"THis was an OK job. I enjoyed working here I just with the management at the store and corporate level was better. Overall, this was on OK work environment."
bad,"I worked at Walgreens while completing school, and I would never consider working there long term. While employed there, workers work in different departments in rotation....each department has zero organization. The management also rotates every few years, I was hired and a few months later the manager at the time was rotated. Walgreens does offer growth opportunities just like other retailers, but offers little financial growth. The hardest part of the job is the hours, being open as late as they were was inconvenient. I will say that Walgreens overall offers growth to the employees that seek it."
bad,"i learned various new things , promotion came after i showed great customer service skills. i liked doing what i did just did not like the fact that i didnt work around people that had the same pace as me."
bad,"Management was okay, Manager at the store I worked at was not an example you would want to set for employees. Wasn't told about opportunities to move up in company. Wasn't a pleasant place to work. Pay should have been higher based on the job that we were doing."
bad,"When I began working for Walgreens I was located in the city of Madison, WI, it was a lovely location with great customers. I then changed locations to Chicago IL, the location I was working at has taught me the importance in customer service."
bad,"My daughter was sick one day and couldn't attend school. Myself, being a single parent, had to stay home and care for her. They fired me because they said they were short staffed that day and needed workers."
bad,Corporate doesn't pay employees enough while they expect too much from employees. Difficult to support family when getting paid $8.50 an hour.
bad,"Great job for anyone in college with flexible hours. I'm given full time hours over every break, and part time hours during school."
bad,"As far as retail jobs go, not bad. Small town with few options, so that's what we have. Walmart, Safeway, Rite Aid, Big Lots, six gas stations and a few churches."
bad,Walgreens where i work is under-staffed but It all depends on the location. They pay well. Best starting pay for pharmacy technicians.
bad,This job was pretty fun at times I got along with almost everyone that worked the same store I was in. I liked going in early morning for truck. It made the time go by fast
bad,"Hectic and stressful."
bad,"I floated a lot, and the setting depended on which store you went to. But the company makes a lot of bad decisions and would rather cut costs by cutting personnel than cutting needless programs. The company is going under."
bad,"My time there was not all bad. The coworkers were great, but some of the management had control issues.  Also, company polices border on anti-employee so be aware.  They did just raise the starting wage though so there is that."
bad,"They do not properly train you."
bad,i worked there for 2 months i loved helping customers but wasnt given much room to do other things and didnt get much help was left in one area for too long
bad,"Its a very calm and steady environment, where you learn new experiences and its fun to work with one another if you like working with others. The management is pretty nice and friendly with their employees. Great co workers i worked with everyone and great people. There was not much of hard work, besides moving things in the back of the warehouse, but that was rarely. The best part about this company they are nice when it comes to working with one another and I do not regret working with them, i will always remember working with great and fun co workers and managers."
bad,It's too much to do at walgreens for all the work I was doing and the store was always understaffed which effects customer service which makes no sense considering how rich the company is.
bad,"Daily task at Walgreens were cashier at the front counter as well did the photos for the customers."
bad,Liked working there when I first started but now I feel that I get paid too little for what I do. I am also searching for a job that is Monday - Friday.
bad,Walgreen's it self isn't a bad company. A lot of people in this store gossip and talk behind everyone's back. management makes false promises. and the benefits are not good
bad,"Working at Walgreens in Stratford, has be a bitter sweet experience, I've been there for a few years but only because I've had trouble finding a new job. The job is good for certain people who love and don't mind retail but, its not for everyone. All in all I'm greatly appreciative of my experience, for it taught me much about the working world and what i can expect, and it taught me the value of team work and hard work."
bad,"The Pay is great but The moral of the Building is Honorable, Management/IO talk down to team Members. The room for advancement is not great you are stuck in the position you are until the day somebody is discharged or quits."
bad,Tedious job with high expectations.This job will teach you how to work with the public. It will improve typing speed. I learned how to process prescriptions and bill insurances electronically. I communicated a lot with doctors offices and other pharmacies. This position has much to offer.
bad,"A typical day at work involves helping customers and ensuring they are happy and well."
bad,"Cool business, but a lot of favoritism."
bad,"When I first started this was a good place to work. Good Co-workers, personable manager. However, in a 3 year span went through 5 Assistant Store Managers and 3 Store Managers. Upper level (beyond store) management was worse. One DM was OK, but the next two were bean counters that expected unrealistic results with fewer and fewer people. 24 hour store that never closed. If someone called off or didn't show too bad. You are still expected to finish all tasks as pre-determined by MGR or ASM."
bad,"Pharmacy is stressful, that is a given. I feel that with Walgreens, such an emphasis was placed on payroll that customer service suffered. Pharmacist hours were cut (little overlap); tech hours were cut; the number of side tasks were increased; and metrics were added. It made it difficult to effectively take care of people and was very frustrating. We were told by management that the cuts were needed to stay profitable, but given average gross margins in pharmacy, I don't see it. I believe we were lied to. In a caring profession, I find it hard to believe a company that doesn't care for it's own will continue to project an image to the public that it cares for them. Now they are firing those who can't keep up. They will end up with machines, not humans, to care for the public. The only reason they are financially successful is their bargaining power with suppliers and insurance companies. People are ""forced"" to use them by their insurance. Should congress impose a ban on that practice by PBMs and other insurance providers, I predict a fall."
bad,"N/A"
bad,"They started to cut hours and people which increased everyones stress leave went up. They also lost a lot of contracts with insurances due to there increased desire to cut, cut and cut. They also lost a lot of business due to being short staffed."
bad,"Working for Walgreens was okay. Most of the time, the store was understaffed. I would be the only person working the floor for over 4 hours on some days. Hours were all over the place. Some weeks I would work 30 hours, and some I would only work 15. And the pay isn't worth everything they want you to do. 25 cents above minimum wage. That went for people who had worked there over a year as well. They were just pretty stingy in general.."
bad,"Fast paced work environment with many moving parts. "
bad,"You will work alongside so many hard-working and dedicated people; but the culture of the company is not rewarding. There are opportunities for advancement, but the work-life balance expectations are not worth it. Very stressful environment that remains very hush-hush and secretive. Huge lack of communication from the top of the company to the bottom. Left the company on my own terms, and would not look to go back."
bad,"Started out as a cashier and made my way up to assistant store management.  There's a lot of nepotism in the company.  If you have a good store manager, the work environment is fantastic.  If not, you're basically screwed.  There's not a lot you can do and the open door policy is a joke."
bad,"Having worked at multiple locations I have found the atmosphere to be utterly reprehensible. Management staff commonly yell at and/or berate employees, dozens of employees have confided in me that promises of learning new things, being promoted, or getting a particular raise are made constantly but never fulfilled even after years of trying. Store managers perform very little if any actual work on a day to day basis besides answering e-mails and making a list of tasks that they themselves could have completed most of in half the time it takes to write the task down. Walgreens has earned its impressively high turnover rate."
bad,"A shell of it's former self.  Used to be a GREAT company to work for, with great benefits and a great environment that helped you balance home and work life.  Now expected to perform all of your duties and functions of management with least amount of hours as possible.  Recently cut hours across chain by average of 20 hours per store, going into the holiday season."
bad,I worked at Walgreens for a little short of 3 years. They had budget cuts and I was being sent all over the city to other locations to pick up hours which is the reason I am looking for something more stable. I liked being able to learn the basics of being a pharmacy technician but am ready to move forward.
bad,"I was in an environment where my boss relied more on me then his own managers and I was just a service clerk. The managers could not get along with one another and that affected a lot of how the floor staff worked and was managed. I went into work every single day dreading to go there. The only thing that was enjoyable was the few regular customers that would come by just to say hello. The staff were all amazing people, outside of work, but inside was completely different."
bad,"Doing the actual working was not very taxing. But talking and working with upper management was difficult. New regulations were constantly changing weekly by the cooperate office. Lots of store level changes were made as far as, lower level employees had less of a chance to move up and/or better themselves. Fellow co-workers were awesome to work with."
bad,"While employed at walgreens co. a normal work day would consist of putting away freight, processing photo orders. assisting customers in shopping and check out. I was able to print and create store signs and displays. I worked in the office with the managers to do the nightly till counts and drops. I was able to pick up on pharmacy tech procedures and work behind the counter to become a well rounded asset in walgreens. Management was management. I was unable to promote for the job I was interested in because the manager strait out told me he really liked me on the floor and because of that reason I stayed for a year and a half longer with out moving to the area I worked so hard to get to,  even though there were openings in the position I was interested in. My co-workers were fun and we always kept the place positive and an enjoyable place to be without losing focus on our daily tasks. The most difficult part in the job was leaving due to not being able to advance because management wanted me to stay in the position I was in."
bad,"I think it's a good place to work, but as far as management, I believe it's all a contradiction. Don't say you'll do one thing and then turn around and do the complete opposite. Co-Workers will forever be co-workers... The hardest part of the job is trying to keep your cool when certain individuals wanna blatantly be rude and disrespectful and turn around and lie to your face. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you have correctly followed the steps to having a successful sale and then you have built a relationship with that customer, simply smiling and being yourself, knowing you had put a smile on their face at the end of the day. Overall, I've learned that people will do what they want, to get what they want... even if that means false advertising and telling a lie.. All because they want to be over someone."
bad,"Overall my experience with this company was not too great. Just wasn't the right place for me. Some of my co-workers made me feel uncomfortable in the work environment, and ultimately that is what led to me leaving."
bad,"Walgreen use to be a great place to work. It use to be about family, but recently it been about cutting back on position and hours. Some store have less employee than it is to manage the place. It isn't normal to see the asm on the cash register."
bad,"Customers use to be important to upper level corporate, now its all about crank out as much as you can we don't care about mistakes and while your at it were going to cut your hours in half. If you are ready to age your self drastically join the team if you want enjoy your life stay away."
bad,Walgreens does pay well and they have excellent health benefits.  The management staff is more concerned about drama among employees then they are customer service.  Long hours are expected and no compliments are given for job well done no matter how hard you work.
bad,"You can learn a lot and they have a good training program for management. However, there is a lot of animosity from coworkers when you're hired from outside the company. There is also animosity from upper management towards its employees as well."
bad,The company has great benefits but low concern for employees. The companies mission statements are nice however they do not follow through with them.
bad,I did like working there because i have great people skills.  I would come in and run the register or twice a week i would need to help unload the truck and update prices.  If i wasn't on a register or stocking i would be working in the photo department printing out customers pictures or helping them on the Kiosk.
bad,"Upper management bullying,cutting upper management positions no room for promotion.Under staffed you are required to do three managers postions instead of one.Inconsistency in staff.Store manager threatens staff,very undesriable place of employment"
bad,its a ok place to work a lot of standing and walking bad for the knees but overall managers are just baby sitters to adults and a lot of rude customers
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of satisfaction while helping patients with their needs.  Management is far away and does not know you.
bad,the store was always understaffed so the employees available had to do whatever was needed.  I had to work much longer after the store closed because my manager forgot to finish stuff.
bad,"Every day requires being observant of employees, customers, and the store environment.  We must be conscious of safety hazards, floor displays, product placement and proper signage.  I have learned quite a bit about filling prescriptions and product placement on the sales floor.  I absolutely love helping people find the best deal on what they are shopping for and love the challenge of resolving any issues they may have.  I have enjoyed learning to work with people of varying personalities and learning how to coach them to achieve our daily goals.   The hardest part of the job is actually not the work performed but most times the working hours.  There have been several nights when closing the store, I have not been able to leave the store until two or three a.m."
bad,i love the customers that's about the store manger is cool lot of shift leads power trip. fast paced been there for over a year no pay increase
bad,The company was very great just gotten another oppurtunety.
bad,"the management at walgreens works highly on favoritism. As of 2013 their corporate goal was to have all part time , no benefits employees. They also fired all managers that did not have a college degree. If they want you gone they can find alot of ways to get rid of you. They like to call it 'not following store policy' which is only subject to who you are , or who you know."
bad,"Providing customer services to customers whether it be filling scripts, answering phone calls and questions, and calling insurances."
bad,"When i can help the nice, regular customers daily then my day will be a breeze, but nonetheless there is always a couple of rude customers who do not understand how to be courteous to the pharmacy cashier. Its either they dont want to pay for their medicines b/c the amount is too costly (i.e $3 or $7) or they dont have money on them and want to get they medicines for free. Then there is working at Walgreen's it's self. The pay is very little for such a demanding job (i.e people's heart, cancer, hiv medications) and when medicines run out of stock, the customers get mad at me when im not the one who orders the medication. Management doesnt really do too much depending on which store your at. Most of them just sit in the office for a couple of hours and then come out on the work floor just to see that the front end people are stocking the shelves and not having long lines. This is my experience based off the store that im working at."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job is making patients happy, especially when I am able to resolve an issue they may have. A typical work day includes a lot of multi-tasking which I am great at, filling prescriptions and assisting pharmacist. The hardest part of my job is working short of staff which cause customers to be upset and not satisfied with service. I go above and beyond to make sure each patient know that I genuinely  care. I enjoy helping others"
bad,"•	Use observational skills to help refer patients to the proper area of the store and/or the pharmacist in charge."
bad,"When I first started with Walgreens they were great,but as the company changed it increasingly got worse for the employees. They reduced pay and cut hours and didnt seem to care about there employees anymore."
bad,"It is hard work for very little pay, and most of the work goes unappreciated. Customers can be difficult but that is retail, it would be difficult at any retail store. There is very large amount of turnover and very little concern for one another well being."
bad,Hard to move up in any position. Work schedule is week to week. One day you work till 4pm-11pm and the next day you need to be at 7:30am exhausted.
bad,"You never knew what you were doing from day to day. They expect women to work like men with a lot of heavy lifting, and they are not very aware of safety issues ."
bad,"Too many changes in the company! It's no longer an enjoyable place to work. There are awesome benefits, but very low pay. I definitely feel overworked and underpaid."
bad,Great benefits.Not enough support staff.The company placed too much of a burden on the pharmacist.
bad,"I started with Walgreen's in 2006 as a Assistant Manager and in 2009 the company cut overtime out and in 2012 they started phasing out the Assistant Manager Position calling it ASM-T and u have 2 years to learn the position or u will get demoted down to shift lead position and your pay is cut. here are some things to know"
bad,"Data pulling and analysis. Distribute daily, weekly and monthly financial metrics to executives."
bad,"Work shift sleep disorder, coworker payroll envy, treated like a robot"
bad,Poor management and job/life balance. There are chances to really impact patient lives.
bad,"A typical day of work will include writing down all  tasks assigned to me for that work day and making a checklist. I have learned how to check-in vendors, scan items for inventory, pull store shorts, cash counting, making drops, operating photo machinery, making in-store and on-line purchases for customers, completing web pick-up orders, changing inventory counts, restocking basic items, creating store signage, learning new procedures and implementing new ideas. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with the customers. One special encounter can brighten up my whole day. I have not came across anything that has made my job challenging."
bad,one of my ex-managers had quit one day after coming in to the store and proceeded to steal alcohol and walk out I couldn't work in this kind place. most employees were friendly and outgoing but the management at Walgreen's on e26th and Euclid was embarrassing quite frankly. I would NOT recommend this job to anyone ever!
bad,working directly with customers and their everyday shopping needs
bad,On a typical day I would trying to make extra time to help the others finish their work by 7:30. Everyone including management was very polite and understanding.
bad,i liked working here but had to move because my mom had cancer
bad,"Poor quailty of employees, not very challenging, long work hours beyond scheduled shift"
bad,"The most enjoyable part of working at Walgreens was my co-workers. I could never have asked for a better set of co-workers. Everyone worked so well together, and there was no room for one person having to pick up someone else's slack. "
bad,The pay is not comparable to other jobs in the same field. They regularly give and cut hours without any warning. Very difficult to maintain a regular lifestyle working for this company.
bad,Walgreens Returns Center has so much potential to be a dynamic company to work for. The biggest issue is that the management there are totally unwilling to encourage a culture of inclusiveness. The employees there are wonderful for the most part and very eager to learn and to improve processes.
bad,"You have to interact with customers everyday. Each store is different. Some store can be slow with not much going on and then there are fast pace.  I leaned how to scan in vendors, file paper work, put in invoices, complete payroll, order product and much more.Management is different at every store, so if you leave one store it can completely different.  Co-workers are about the same in any work place."
bad,"Six years ago, this was a good company to work for, but now it's all about the numbers. Always giving too many tasks and duties with no help. The never-ending budget cuts get worse every time. And then they wonder why it's nearly impossible to accomplish everything that is asked of us. The company's answer to this is the Assistant Store Manager position, which is a salary management position. It is expected of you as an ASM to run the store. You are basically the store manager; you just don't have the title nor the pay. You can not leave until the job is done, which means you'll be working most of your days off. The average work week will be about 65-70 hours a week, but expect to work more during the holidays. If you are the type a person who needs a personal life or if you have a family you want to spend time with, don't apply here."
bad,"The benefits were very expensive with low pay. The hours were all over the place. We were often understaffed. There was not a sense of teamwork there. I did not mind my job responsibilities, I actually enjoyed learning about medications and medical terms."
bad,"It was a good job when I was in college I worked 23hours in two weeks very low pay."
bad,Its a good starting company to work for. You will work hard and have to assist customers in a lot of aspects.
bad,"Typical retail job.  and like every other retail company cutting hours, positions, and compensation.  Management is required to hold a degree.  What a waste of education."
bad,"data entry customer service, filled prescriptions. Terrible management. Very busy pharmacy and not enough staff. I did like the fast pace."
bad,"Come into work make sure shelves are stocked, make sure storage room is organized and cashier. I've learned how to handle different types of personality. My management was alright, they would make me believe that I would get a promotion and then give the promotion to a friend that was recently hired."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was being a minority, I was treated unfairly and like lower class. I was for example scheduled to work Christmas Eve and had to show up at 6am. When I arrived NO ONE WAS there, I called the Manager,& the Assistant Manager,I was getting ready to leave at 7am when other cashiers started showing up, finally the Manager arrived at 7:30and let us in,  We found out the Assistant Manager was ASLEEP locked in the office and overslept.Did I get paid for waiting or arriving to work as scheduled?NO!  Did I check the schedule to make sure we were opening at 6AM yes, customers even left from the parking lot as the hours were advertised. I was scheduled to work EVERY major holiday when the ""princess"" people were off and had less seniority than I. I was actually discriminated against for being reliable! I quit as soon as I found another job. Would I go back? NO WAY, Would I recommend NO WAY!"
bad,"Strong company, there is a HUGE disparity between what is preached and what it practiced.  With time it come."
bad,"It was an okay job for my very first job. I had a good experience there, and made a great relationship with my previous manager. "
bad,Little movement up with company. Little to no improvement.
bad,walgreens is a good company but their management team is lacking
bad,"A typical day was not only keeping the photo machines running, but to help out on the sales floor and to work along with co-workers and managers in maintaining a great atmosphere for customers.  The hardest part of the job was on an occasion dealing with unpleasant customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to be myself."
bad,For a health care company they had really awful health care benefits.  In-store managers were awesome.  The head honchos not so much.  They didn't look at you as a person but as a number.
bad,"manage all aspects of business which encompass personnel, ensuring proper department condition, preparing and analyzing reports and data, supervision, payroll, purchasing, inventory, cost-control, quality and customer service."
bad,"The amount of work is not balanced between members of the staff. Some are expected to work really hard while others are allowed to converse with eachother for most of the shift. Most of the management is very nice, but there are some managers that play favorites. The day does go quick if you stay busy and on task."
bad,-Everyday is different
bad,My review about the store overly is its pretty laid back and sometimes busy. The most distracting part could be that there are alot of thefts that occur and robbery and the secuirty is unarmmed which puts our saftety at danger.
bad,"They have you work in all areas except the one that was given to you upon being hired. Schedule requests for days off or working different days aren't granted. Pharmacy workers are rude, the managers, & coworkers barely assist you when needed. The pay is horrible for the hrs they give. If you're pregnant, they'll treat you umfairly & they'll replace you without notice, so dont expect coming back. They'll say you've abandoned the job, even if you were approved for maternity leave"
bad,"I do way too much work to stick around. There is changes coming around the company. Us assistants are taking a big paycut to do the same thing next year. As walgreens eliminates our position and calls us something else. But we still do the same thing. I used to enjoy my job. Not anymore, too many changes."
bad,"You are basically stuck in stores unless you are willing to move to Deerfield, Illinois."
bad,The goal is to bring good service and quick for the customers
bad,Make sure all the stock is done in our store. attend to customers when needed. Making sure the stock room is clean and organize everyday before my shift ends.
bad,• Very high turnover of employees
bad,Stable work environment. uninformed management. very limited compensation
bad,"Cash handling, managing over 20 people a day, making sure safe is correct, opening and closing shifts,"
bad,Walgreens is all about quantity over quality and that bugged me. They don't care to give personal attention to customers. They just want to get them in and out. It's overwhelming and it's too much work to do for the little pay.
bad,Shifts were long and stressful. Some days a lunch break could not be taken due to understaffing. Management always make you feel like you are doing something wrong. Co-workers were great and we always tried to help each other.
bad,Cut backs have forced the company to eleminate middle managemant store level
bad,"Responsible for filling and pulling prescriptions, created prescription labels, worked at the in-store counter as well as the drive through window, provided excellent customer service, answered phones, stocked shelves, operated the cash register, assisted pharmacist in any other duties as needed. Ensured cleanliness and sterility of areas, equipment. Maintained accurate customer profile with a complete listing of prescribed medicines taken by the patient, as well as dosage."
bad,the five years I have been employed there has taught me a lot. That is all I can say
bad,A typical day at work was filled with drama and people crying. There we so many people going back telling on each other for the tiniest things. Store manager not listening to others concern. Store manager picking people who he liked and who told him every thing that was going on in the store for high promotions. People going to others old jobs to find out why they were fired and tell all the co-workers. If the assistant store manager did not like you she would write you for the small things like register being 30 cents short or maybe a dusty shelf that was found in the middle of a busy day. Co-workers always went back and told if you were speaking to someone you know if the store was empty and the store manager wouldnt allow you to speak to the co-workers you were good friends with. If he caught you talking to each other he would write you up. Even if it job related. Co-workers got attitudes with the customers if they were trying to do something on the floor.
bad,I worked at the walgreens in orange. Manager for the store was not organized and people were not trained properly. That is why I was not there long. I quit about 10 months later to work for the walt disney company.
bad,"I did not enjoy working in a retail setting. I felt overloaded with overtime and little compensation. However, I did feel relieved knowing that I was able to move advance with the company."
bad,Exciting place to work. Most store can do better with a little more help
bad,"Mentally, forget working for this company. The Supervisors will be your best friend to your face, then stab you in the back. They are disorganized and unprepared. I stayed as long as I could, but its not worth the stress."
bad,- starts at only 7.75 per hour
bad,Good place to learn news skills but the pay rate not is the best plus the balance between family and work its a disaster
bad,The company is changing and not for the good. They are cutting the budget so low that there are not enough employees to do all the work. If they would just give the store more budget hours things would be better and everyone wouldn’t be so stressed out in the front end and the pharmacy.
bad,This was a great Warehouse to work. Had okay communication skills but they have some people will love they employees. I like they schedules they gave out I like the work effort in there but they need a little bit more communication skills with a managers and people that'trying to be managers overall I would love to work back with you
bad,"I love my co-workers, but you are overworked and there's no incentive to work harder.  If you slack off you get the same raise as if you bust your butt off working.  It's the definition of wage slavery."
bad,"Workers are great people, but it sucks when hours get cut due to low sales. Customers are amazingly great when you show them you are happy to assist them."
bad,"Tasks, pharmacy work flow, training, merchandising, customer service, inventory, receiving delivers, working with vendors, hiring, overseeing tasks, maintaining store operations"
bad,Working for Walgreens was the worst job I had. The managers didn’t seem to want to get involved or train others better to do their job. I was promised a promotion over three times that always fell through.
bad,This job is only good for people with little to no outside of work responsibilities. If something comes up with sickness or emergencies you will be harassed to show up any way. There is also no such thing as a set schedule or normal hours with this place and you have to work holidays because they never close. Mandatory Christmas or thanksgiving shift.
bad,Honestly It’s like being in high school all over again and they need to pay more since it’s both inbound and outbound calls. Also there was not a lot of flexibility.
bad,Coupons are a big deal and a lot is expected for quite little pay. The people who work there are great but other than that customer interactions might burn one out.
bad,"I can only recommend working for Walgreens for 6 months before you lose your mind. Ive worked at 24 hours store and a speciality one; in both cases you will have neurotic control freak management who will micromanage and yell at everything you do, and the only way to move up is to kiss their a—. Even came across coworks who yelled another so badly they werre crying they wanted tonquit.  Subpar training, meh benefits, meh pay, dont work here for 5+ years."
bad,"A business that focuses on customer happiness and monetary gain over all else. The employee or employee family care is minimal to none. It's a steady job and experience can vary from location to location. It's all about the management you work under. This company is open regular hours every holiday and extends hours before Christmas, up to and including Christmas Eve. Weekends and holidays are usually a must. Employer needs over employee. My personal experience."
bad,"Has the manager on duty doing stock work, the pharmacy, customer service and taking customers to the bathroom every 25 minutes at the same time. Then they will transfer you store to store that is doing worst then the last store you were transferred from. Exp: Store managers quitting, customers asking if the stores going out of business because of the empty shelves, two trucks in the warehouse unpacked, workers aren't properly trained, calling out and only having one stock associate a shift. This company simply abuses their employees! with no appreciation and no clear direction, its terrible, truly terrible! I don't believe the company is going to last long. They recently closed over 50 stores in the united states."
bad,"Pharmacy can be a difficult field to work in on the best of days, fast paced, constantly changing issues, customer service all the time. Walgreens does not provide enough resources in terms of technology and knowledge of the operating systems to meet the demands of an average day."
bad,Working for Walgreens will make you feel like another chump in the world who gets taken advantage of. The company will work you like a mule and give nothing in return.. except for that $10.00 an hour.
bad,"My work at Walgreens is very stressful, fast paced, pressure, the management gives you a lot of work to do in one day, if you don’t get that done, you have to text your manager why was that not done. Their promises are a total LIE."
bad,They value the wellness of their customers more than their employees. They overworked me because i was one their best employees and then terminated me over something that has already been resolved months ago
bad,"If you are looking for a decent job that doesn’t really require much from you to maintain besides being a decent employee, Walgreens is the place to be."
bad,No balance of work and family and every holiday was a NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!!!!!! Some people treated differently !!!Lots of favoritism and some employees act like children.
bad,If you really need a job you can take but i dont really recommend staying too long.( my summary is short i dont have that much to say about the job or more direct the location where i work.)
bad,Very fast paced most the time belts are turned up all the way cause the other departments cant get act together you load one full size trailer and quarter of another in a 8 hour ship by hand. Management nice but as far as human resources a joke big time deff not worth money here
bad,"Walgreens is a great place to work if you don’t have a social life or personal life."
bad,"Back in the early 2000s, the company provided better management at the corporate level.  As the company shifts and merged with a new global company Boots Alliance, management has changed, and there's room for improvement."
bad,Personally I don’t like retail at all to much stress but Walgreens takes the cake on that wages way to low for shift manager...........................
bad,"Management truly is lackluster, but the environment is overall a fun amd happy place. The customer-employee relationships are emphasized for good customer service."
bad,They will cut your store's hours and expect you to deal with long lines while also maintaining shelves stocked and the store itself spotless. Some store managers only care about their position rather than the people working for them. Only work here if you have unlimited patience. Theres too much drama for a Walgreens.
bad,"Working at Walgreens is like working at any other retail pharmacy inside a store. You feel like a glorified cashier. Forced to ring up toilet paper and batteries while in the middle of a consultation. Years past, working for Walgreens seemed like a great job and there was great work ethic, but ever since the family has given up the company to a the public with a CEO, the work environment has gone considerably south. We are always understaffed due to minimal hours allotted to us. Also, they have started to pay pharmacists less and stopped giving raises and bonuses, giving no incentive to stay with the company or want to be a manager."
bad,"No balance to family life. Horrible district manager."
bad,Upper management wants more from the staff with a decided inequity in staffing between locations.  The complete disconnect of the upper management staff and the culture of fear that exists handcuffs middle management into being able to assist in any way.
bad,"Lots of long days with widely varying shifts. Good opportunity for advancement, though. Pay is competitive if you work within Minneapolis. I'm adding this to meet the 150 character minimum."
bad,$11 is not worth getting constantly disrespected all the time by customers. Also we can’t do anything if someone steals from us they can keep getting away with it.
bad,When I first started it was a good place to work. Now it's just awful. It's a very toxic environment. Poor management. They pretty much don't care about you and no matter how long you stay with the company or how well you do they won't care at all. Company is also  losing money so pay is bad and hours get cut  ALL the time.
bad,It's your typical customer service position. Management is ok and your co workers are pretty nice. Pay is decent. Most customers are nice but will get the occasional grumps.
bad,It's been about ten years since I worked at Walgreens. I don't really remember much about working there. Not much sure what else there is to say.  It was a retail job.
bad,"Personally, Walgreens screwed me over and I lost respect for my managers and some staff. Bullying should not be allowed in the workplace and you shouldn’t be punished for running 7 minutes late, or going to the bathroom."
bad,My job was never perfect but it was decent for retail. Now they've prioritized people outside of the company over employees who have been loyal for years
bad,"Almost every Walgreens is under staffed.  I always left work with feeling awful because things were not done, but there were not enought techs.  They don't pay well for how much techs go through.  I was yelled at by patients all the time."
bad,"Not the best place to work no work life balance can't say anything to shoplifters  upper mgmt doesn't step up to make work environment  more pleasant, work overload for the pay"
bad,"I started as a cashier and moved up pretty quickly.  I did not have a degree, so I was hungry to move up and create my career.  However, I’m now at store manager, pay has been cut drastically for us, budgets are being cut severely, and I’m not able to run my store as well as I’d like.  I also have to wait 2 more years before a promotion to DM."
bad,"As a pharmacy technician, the amount of hours spent being forced during an entire shift to work drive-thru was awful. Coworkers think they are too good to work with customers, so they are okay with shoving people in areas of the pharmacy they don't like to work in. Supposed to be a workflow to follow, however, ""Senior Technicians"" are better than other techs and shouldn't have to work with customers."
bad,"A typical day at work is boring and disconnection between managers and employees. Managers are not necessarily friendly, nor easy to approach. Hardest part of the job is being in a disconnected environment, it's uncomfortable after a while. Most enjoyable part of the job were you get discounted items. I personally would never work at any Walgreens branch due to the lack of communication from managers. They want you to go above and beyond but, they pay you no mind until they need you to do something for them or if you did a task incorrectly."
bad,I liked working at Walgreens to help the customers. Walgreens has cut hours so much we hardly have time to ring them up. No time to ask about medical or medication needs and show our concern because we r rushed to help the next customer that has been waiting in a long line.
bad,Can be very stressful at times. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with all the side conflicts that go on.
bad,The company has raised expectations while cutting back immensely.  This has made it a much more stressful environment to work in.  The atmosphere is not what it was when I started with the company.
bad,This tries so hard to set itself apart from other companies that it actually hurts itself. Their prices are higher than anyone else's because they consider themselves more of a convenience store.
bad,no appreciation for hard work. all about numbers and no care for people. stopped raises and decreased working hours with no care to explain why.. only connected ppl get the benefits
bad,"reports, customer service, daily task. manage staff, oversee pharmacy, receiving, stock shelves, report to the district manager"
bad,"The minimum pay at Walgreens is not competitive with the market, but employees are expected to take on the same level of work as a manager. Raises are rarely given and when they are it's like a dime more an hour. Fast food workers get paid more than Walgreens employees, and yet management still wonders why the store has such a high turnover rate. Our shift leads work 40 hours a week and still do not make enough to meet the standards of living."
bad,"Managers can change around."
bad,"Busy x3 "
bad,i loved working there! i miss my co workers and every aspect of working there . great job to start off in for sure ! my manager was amazing !!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Overly stressful pharmacy environment. The work responsibilities keep increasing to the point where it's typically too much to handle for the given amount of pharmacists/technicians. It is very difficult to train new hires when there is barely enough time to get day to day tasks completed and it feels like you're working at a call center. Concerns have been expressed numerous times to upper management but no solutions or help have yet to be suggested or offered, leaving employees to feel hopeless and that the only solution is to leave."
bad,"A typical work day is being understaffed and given more things than you can possibly do in one day.  Customer service is supposed to be the number one priority, but the company will not give us that hours to provide good customer service"
bad,"Walgreens use to be an enjoyable company to work for but over the past couple of years they have changed a lot, between hiring freezes, lack of hours, and some employees even losing their insurances"
bad,This company has been run down by corporate and does not care for its employees. Pay scales have been decreased and stores are left with minimal hours for staffing with tons of things to get done.
bad,It has been going downhill since Walgreen family sold the company. Job satisfaction use to be very high and it was a great place to work. The new owners pinch every penny and cut hours dramatically.
bad,Walgreen's changed and not for the better. Our store used to value our customers and we made them feel like they were our family. It then changed to our customers are just numbers and statistics. I once got fussed at for speaking to a customer for too long. The hours are not flexible and the scheduling was horrible. The schedule would end on a Wednesday and you wouldn't know what you actually worked until that night. You couldn't make plans with your family.
bad,"My recruitment process was dishonest about the work that I'd be doing at the company. Once I arrived, the work culture and schedule was extremely strict and restrictive. Without the help from excellent coworkers, I doubt I would have stayed in the position for more than a week or two."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was all the interruptions I faced everyday."
bad,"I learned quite a bit from Walgreens and I am grateful for the opportunity I was given, however, the management environment was very unhealthy, which in essence did not make the job an enjoyable place to work. There were good days and bad days, as there are elsewhere, but this is not the best place I have worked, unfortunately."
bad,"Walgreens is a job for someone whos retired or feels there options are limited. you cant survive off of a walgreens salary. it is a wonderful place to shop, yet not the greatest career choice."
bad,"Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. They take, take, take from store employees. Annual raises are at the bare minimum. Less hours, more work. Vacation time cut."
bad,"Very busy environment and can become extreamly stressful at times. High turnover, but is expected in retail. Management is often underpaid for volume of work."
bad,"Walgreens wasn't a bad place to work. "
bad,Increasing prescriptions and daily functions with decrease in pharmacy technician hours. Pharmacy manager and staff pharmacists are salaried position. Workload required working a lot more hours per week than was covered by salary without extra compensation.  Pharmacists not given raises for 2 years. Phones constantly ringing.
bad,This job was a typical service desk job. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to learn about how a Walgreens store operates. The hardest part of this job was dealing with frustrated store employees all over the country and maintaining a friendly and customer oriented attitude.
bad,"Was great, now very greedy. If you go on as shift lead be prepared to work your butt off. Hours have been cut even management hours are getting shaved."
bad,It was a great place to start working at right out of college.  It's a corporation so you have to get used to the chain of command involved.  Weekly Pulse meetings on improving the store are almost impossible with the minimal staff hours you are subjected to.
bad,"Wile working at Walgreens it became all too apparent that the company was trying to run on a model that did not wish to thrive efficiently, but rather stay afloat with as few employees as possible while paying them as little as possible.  There was an astronomical amount of waste in time, food, plastic, etc...  A typical day at work consisted of doing the workload of three people while being compensated for that of one.  While working on the floor there are unrealistic expectations of what a work should accomplish as what a worker can actually accomplish as it is a retail store and there are constant interruptions."
bad,Working here is okay for a teenager or someone that is retired. I have worked here for almost two years and have not been given an opurtunity to advance.
bad,"It was not the ideal place to work, with strained work hours and stressful work environments. The management did try to help alleviate some stress by helping in the pharmacy, but a lot of times it just wasn't enough."
bad,The manager wasn't very understanding. I was dealing with a death in the family and my parent's crumbling marriage while juggling school and bills. I was also made a cashier instead of being in the position I enjoyed and was hired for. I expressed my complaints and ended up leaving because they could no longer work with my schedule.
bad,"Walgreen was a great company at one point and time. I have been there for about 4 years and have worked at several locations (south MS being my favorite). New changes occur then everything went left. Most management are disrespectful to lower ranked employees. Pharmacy is the money maker of Walgreen but management and corporate forces task on employees that are not reasonable to meet, and once they are met they will find something else to complain about. I felt like my co workers and I never did enough with the pay we were receiving on top of dealing with customers. And the statement ""the customer is always right"" was true because even if the is wrong in what the customer has said or done management will indeed throw you under the bus. And did I mention they do not pay well?"
bad,"We used to be able to order our own items based on store needs.  No more.  Upper management only concerned about the profit.  If that means forcing out long term managers for new managers who make less then 1/2, then that's what they do."
bad,"You felt empowered helping people getting the medicines they need to stay alive or continue in being a productive citizen.  But then it was difficult servicing those that was addicted  to the medication in the worse way,"
bad,Walgreens does not provide good work life balance and I feel there is little opportunity for advancement. I feel there is no respect towards employees and all the company cares about is the bottom line.
bad,Didn’t really like working here I felt that Walgreens as a whole doesn’t really care much about their employees. I think it should be more employee based and maybe people would feel better about working here. Also for the work we do I feel we are underpaid people have things to pay for!
bad,"It is just like every customer service job in New York. Fast paced and annoying. Very repetitive. And little room for advancement on doing an exceptional job alone. If you want to move up, kiss the managers behind."
bad,Worked as an EXA then ASM for many years. They do not want long-term employees anymore as they are paid more than the company wants to pay. The family feel of the company is no longer there and no one helps each other out anymore.
bad,"Started as a Liaison, moved into management.  Taught/assess candidates for home infusion services. Coordinated staffing for home infusion care services. Flexible schedule to meet patients needs. Work -life balance was considered. "
bad,ok place to work if you're looking for strenuous exercise on the job. there's a lot of overtime if you're into that. don't take criticism personally- patronizing is common
bad,"I worked at a 24 hour store. On truck day I would work till 10:30 pm the night before. Then have to be back at 4:00am to unload truck. Work 2-3 hours. Go home, come back at 2:00pm  and finish uo my 8 hours  "
bad,"Walgreens is your typical, corporate retail job. You don't get paid much over minimum wage to start. My store was pretty slow most of the time and I usually had the task of stocking shelves and ""facing"" the aisles. Since photos are a dying product, I ended up being a glorified cashier most days. The benefits were pretty good since it is a pharmacy, after all. I was told I'd be working 40 hour weeks, but that quickly changed to anywhere between 32-38 hours, even with half hour lunches."
bad,"Good benefits"
bad,"there is no life balance and you will get hired for a management position but you will end up carrying boxes all around the day."
bad,The job itself is easy but the hours and the way they treat their employees is not worth it. The schedule is always inconsistent and they give your hours away to people who dont even work sometimes
bad,Walgreen's was an excellent place to work. A rapid decline took place several years ago. They cancelled my insurance while I was in rehab from emergency heart surgery. I worked at over 50 Walgreens overtime and took great pride in my work. Patients are the reason we have a job.
bad,"cant make any mistakes or you will get fired. dont tell you certain things that you need to know but i loved the people i worked with. The people were very helpful for the most part, but they did not always tell you everything you needed to know"
bad,"I worked at Walgreens for about 2 years and it's only getting worse. (Lyons, IL) Pharmacy techs are well underpaid. I was making more in retail than this which is sad. Even fast food pays about the same! Not to mention crummy hours if you don't have seniority or if you're not buddy buddy with the people who make the schedules. Aside from that corporate keeps cutting pharmacy hours because makeup is more important than your medications! Yeah people need to open their eyes and look into the monster Walgreens has become! Walgreen's has lost it's way!"
bad,Work life balance is almost non existence at Walgreens.  The demands put on store management are extreme and which makes it a very stressful place to work.
bad,Store manager always had something negative to say. I did not like that employees that would get promoted would be the ones that did no work played around during work hours.
bad,"Typical Day:"
bad,Used to be  a great place to work but they have lost sight of any balance of work and home.  Managers were good but too many hands in the pot for guidelines leftist a time when he was all messed up.
bad,the hardest part about working at walgreens was the lack of training. i do not feel all employees are being trained properly which can cause alot of mistakes.
bad,Every day had different challenges.  I had to supervise and distribute work load and positions to full time and part time employees.  I had to deal with numerous customer complaints.
bad,"There was such negative energy at this location. there was a lot of gossiping and spreading of rumors that I did not appreciate. It was difficult working here and hearing the back biting, whispering and complaining that accompanied each shift change."
bad,An exercise in communication between management would benefit this company greatly. I worked for three stores over the course of several year and the same problems arose each time: a lack of communication and / or accountability.
bad,Pharmacy is extremely busy and often under-staffed requiring staff to work longer hours than scheduled.  Schedules are often not flexible.  Benefits are not available until staff is employed for a long period of time.  No extra pay for holiday work within the first 6 months.
bad,I don't recommend working here if youre a single parent or pursuing school. The day to day was being a glorified baby sitter. The pay was not at all equal to the work that was put in.
bad,"When Owner died, board of investors took over and the employees suffer from the new profit-driven culture. "
bad,It is typical retail pharmacy.  High script volume and low level of support staff in terms of technician hours.  Supervisors will not back you up.  Too many programs going on all at once.
bad,"The particular store I worked at was not treating employees fairly. They weren't giving the breaks (lunch/15 min) that were required.Working on the floor was good, but because the pharmacy was so busy, breaks were not given."
bad,i never liked working here i honestly don’t know why i’ve been here so long. the staff is horrible so is management i really wish i didn’t waste 2 years of my life that i’ll never get back at this horrible place.
bad,"Must deal with a lot for very low pay, such as customer service, retail work, etc. Management gave little help when asked, yet expected you to be 100% with everything."
bad,I love to help customers with there makeup selection and giving then the confidence to love the sound there in no matter what the problem is there is something that can help in one way or another
bad,"Poor working conditions on floor. Standing for hours was bad on back. Lack of recognition for doing a great job and doing extra duties without being told. Seniority status didn't matter, others received preferential treatment ."
bad,"Typical day for me was running the drive-thru in the pharmacy. The Drive Thru at times invited trouble since some people  brought things in that they need to do inside the store, which can create a line. The Store I worked at just simply did not give enough staff to keep the pharmacy running smoothly. They expected better work with no help along with getting people's medication done in a fast manner. Long story short, Walgreens is a starting point. Move on to a better organized company with a better workplace environment. This has made me less likely to ever work at a Retail Pharmacy again."
bad,"I was working at walgreens as a beauty consultant it was very boring very slow. Not too many people would want their makeup done and if you try to be helpful and ask if people need help, most would say they don't need help and then proceed to look confused."
bad,"Across the company, payroll hours have been slashed, leading to fewer people being responsible for more work. Managers often asked to cover departments, even the front register and pharmacy, when staff is low. Only opportunity for a raise is after annual review, which is done by direct supervisor. This job will teach you how to handle angry customers, schedule your life around your job, and recognize fraudulent coupons."
bad,Benefits are decent. Vacation time is fair. There is room to grow. Great job for college students and high school students. If you are looking for a career in management its a good place to gain that experience.
bad,The employees usually maintain a good attitude and are fun to work with. They fail to provide you with fair pay and good benefits. Advancement can be difficult at times.
bad,Walgreens has become a corporate machine that says it has regard for its people but continues to take more away from its long time employees. It changes so frequently that you cant get good at anything until it changes again. Lots of unhappy employees. Management pays well but everything else is below what they should pay for what they want.
bad,"Looking to further my knowledge in the pharmacy industry. Possibly in an in patient facility in a hospital setting, or compounding in a sterile environment."
bad,The organization is fast paced and change is the one consistent factor.  The organization has a clear focus and mission on where they wish to go to sustain the organization's growth and future place in the healthcare market industry.
bad,The people were friendly and helpful... leaned the whole store areas of work. There is no procedure for promoting it's just who they want and it's usually men
bad,"Working in a pharmacy is very stressful. You will see the worst of people and society and paid very little in return. At the end of it all, you have to worry about your job being lost to automation or outsourcing."
bad,"The hours working usually run from 7am to 12am for the store portion of the store. That being said I work the night shift due to the morning shift having a monopoly on the times they can work. Rather than shift everyone around to make space the management allows this to happen on a regular basis. 3:30 or 4 to midnight is a long shift. Most nights I don't have anyone to cover me for the breaks that are provided to me. Without the proper hours to schedule the proper people to close the store we often get robbed of products. It's usually a quick walk in and walk out because there's not a 3rd or 4th person working to make sure that the products on the shelves remain there. This leads to those who close to be over worked by making sure they attend to the usual customer needs and also be on the look out for scammer, thieves, etc. Many of the stores needs aren't met such as replacing the card readers, the mop bucket, receiving sufficient supplies, etc. Overall this doesn't lead to a very good workplace environment."
bad,"The biggest issue with this job was that the managers didn't do anything to workers who stood around doing nothing and would then tell those of us who did work that we weren't doing enough work when we were on the clock. Plus our manager never defended our actions on the job and always let us get written up, even when we did what we were instructed to do."
bad,Walgreens was a great place to work until the company started down sizing and started phasing out positions. I had to take a huge pay cut and was forced into a position doing the same work but getting paid less .
bad,"If you aren't part of the ""clique"" that is management, you have no future here. Also expected to work 15 hour days and bring your PC home to work more"
bad,"The pharmacy is not about healthcare anymore; it's about money; and how to get it while basically having no help.  The company keeps buying other companies to try to have the monopoly on retail pharmacies; but cannot seem to keep up with the expenses of making such transactions.  Therefore, they shrink the established pharmacies to less than the bare minimum in help/budget/resources."
bad,Management very hard to work with. Very negative and not encouraging or positive at all. There was no positive reinforment for a job well done at all and they were never happy.
bad,"Every day at Walgreens is different; you learn to be a chameleon and wear many hats from unloading  the truck early in the morning to taking in vendors, stocking shelves, helping out in pharmacy and helping take care of the front."
bad,"Walgreens is a good starter job for those needing to work while transitioning into a career. But other than that be warned. Corporate has made many changes to my knowledge and they have limited funding so everything takes a hit. Be prepared to work for far less than deserved, as well as working more than you may be originally expected. There is a lot of turnover in the company due to lack of employee relations and management dispute. The work place is not team friendly even though you are expected to work well with everyone. Management is tired, and stretched so they tend to ""overlook"" certain employee behaviors. However on the plus side of the job you do get a foot in the door for other jobs outside the company and have the opportunity to meet individuals who may help you further your career."
bad,"Senior management is sorely out of touch with the reality of everyday life working at store level, and they have shown the lack of concern towards their employees. A few examples."
bad,Walgreens is a great place to begin and advancement at one time was quick and rewarding but with time everything changes. Walgreens has seemed to have lost sight of taking care of its employees and making profits through sales they have transformed into making profits through slashing expenses which make the stores a terrible place to work.
bad,"Horrible, terrible, micro-managing to the up most, no chance for advancement, does not work around schedule, gossip and people talk behind people's back."
bad,"Walgreens is a bad company to work for. Especially for the last two years, with the management change, they let district manager and store manager control over the pharmacy.  Those district manager and store manager do not have any degree and they control pharmacist and technician the same way as they control their cashiers. In general, there is a heavy work load for pharmacist, no lunch break, very stressfull job!"
bad,"The store manager wasn't that great, but all the assistant managers were awesome. The benefits and the pay kinda sucked. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers."
bad,"This place can be great at times but it is like any other retail company. Employees are overworked, under paid and just another number to the big wigs."
bad,"* Waiting on customers, typing written prescriptions, filling   medication both refills and people waiting in the store."
bad,"Pay not acceptable for entry management with a company making billions in profit."
bad,"I worked at Walgreens for 9 years, I started as an MGT and left as a store manager. The company culture over my time with them became less and less involved with taking care of the employees and more and more about getting more from less. The company initiatives were completely and utterly unrealistic for the staffing available. It's not a terrible place to work part time for some money on the side or a student but I would not recommend this company as a career option for anymore. In the old days the managers were well taken care of and appreciated, store manager pay now is $15k a year less than it was when I started and the work load is 10x more."
bad,"I loved the nature of the job, but the employees are very unprofessional and do not train new trainees very well. The store managers complain about the company and it feels very uncomfortable."
bad,"The only thing I loved about my job was the customers.  Depending on the manager you have the job can be good or bad.  Bad managers equal bad work environment.  No breaks, constant write ups for small things, and constant criticism.  Absolutely no positive feedback."
bad,"The work, itself, is decent and the employees are generally great to work with, but Walgreens management is the worst I've ever worked for and the medical insurance provided by the company is an absolute joke: The copays are high, the insurance covers very little of any medical expenses, and is only usable at Walgreens pharmacies."
bad,"Things were decent roughly two years ago."
bad,"As a manager you are responsible for the whole store. You handle all the employees, merchandising, etc. You work a ton of hours to drive sales and complete projects."
bad,walk in clock in and see what notes do you ave for the day. complete all notes before shift and in between help customers meet daily sales goal and make sure you offer service or welcome everybody you come in contact with.
bad,It was a good job but they keep moving me to places I haven't worked in before and they expect you to know everything right away but it's not that easy
bad,"The pay is competitive but after 3 years all employees earn the same amount. The work is, for the most part,   not physically demanding. But given the position of the body when picking,  over time, it takes a tool on the body. Back and neck issues, shoulder damage, tendinitis, and foot problems are very common. They often say things are preexisting because an incident didn't cause the problem. They continue to make changes that are damaging moral and spirit."
bad,It was a typical retail position nothing special. there was no way to keep up with daily tasks as well as training requirements and the amount of customer service they want you to give. alright people.
bad,"Its a company that is expanding and changing, a lot of benefits changed and policies are upgrading, Raises for new hires are now a year after hire all employee raises are based upon"
bad,A typical work day at walgreens is very busy and always on your feet. Customers always ask for a assistants they are always satisfied with my help. I had to face 10 sections and also the front. I use to count all the fresh and dairy products and report it to the mangers.
bad,"This job was do-able, if not ideal, until I started taking college classes at the same time that new management came in - resulting in overscheduling, micromanaging, and constant handwaving of customers who abused the workers. After nearly two years, minimum wage was just not enough to put up with the unhealthy environment and long exhausting hours."
bad,"Job was overall fine, but they forced you to sell immunizations to keep up with weekly/monthly goals which didn't feel like we were helping patients but just ourselves. No proper advancement for technicians, and pay is deplorable. People I worked with were great though."
bad,"Management, if trained at all, seems to be lacking in knowledge and from my experience, are completely unprofessional. During pharmacy walks, they will comment only negatives, even if your pharmacy is doing very well. They will purposely understaff you to see how much help you can do without."
bad,"In the beginning I loved working for walgreens. After a few months of giving my blood sweat and tears, the store manager started treating me like the red headed step child. It happened after I called the anonymous tip line regarding some of the behaviors of associates and management. After that some things got better and some things got worse. The store manager stayed in lazy mode and only ever got involved when there were write ups to be handed out. Sure he helped on truck day occasionally, but only when he was bored of sitting in the office playing on his personal cell phone."
bad,Helping the seniors is the best coping with hot tempered customers is the worst.  Management is fair but its hard to arrange life outside of work.
bad,"I worked at several high volume stores. It was fast paced, but manageable. The hardest part of my work day was being short staffed on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part was helping peple improve their health."
bad,"Worked hard, harder than some of the other employees and it does not pay off. Just got disrespect. Management can be very unfriendly and treat their employees harshly. Favoritism occurs and the job can be very tedious and discouraging. Though I did learn to work on my own and be independent. Worked too closely with other individuals sometimes made for uncomfortable environment and long work days.Hardest part of the job was having to rely on others to do their part. Most enjoyable part was building relationships with customers."
bad,The company has changed. No real concern for the employee and their safety and happiness. Very big turnover. Salaries and benefits do not compare to the rest of employers in the market
bad,My experience at this job was somewhat disappointing due to the fact that most managers have a general disregard for the rules and only care about getting things done.
bad,"Take RX's over the phone, fax, and computer."
bad,"Fast paced and overworked . They have rules that they make up that are not applicable . I enjoyed my pharmacy co workers , but the store manager was unprofessional and unpleasant to work for. The hardest part of the job is doing all  you can do to help a patient and get nothing in return but yelling and telling you how to do your job when its something out of your hands. The enjoyable part of the job was the  structure and helping patients out who are friendly and appreciate what you do."
bad,"Too much work pressure, and it wasn't fair with hard work.They only think in doing money,money,money."
bad,"with little activity between employees and management, working here was dreadful. no acknowledgement of good work. focused more in shoving product down people's throats."
bad,"Walgreens was an okay job at first. The manager who hired me was the best. The manager would work well with my school schedule and not disrespect my availability. My current manager is not respecting my availability and when I got a second job the manager did not want to honor the fact that my second job is a night job. He demanded a night when I don't have any nights open! "
bad,"great to work for  have enough staff"
bad,My coworkers are fun and pleasant to work with but the management and training are below competency level in comparison to other places I've worked.
bad,Not an overall fun place to work. No feedback lack of advancement. Company cares too much about investors and not employees
bad,"While Walgreens is a great company, and they help out a lot of people and causes, they seem to forget about the employees. Managers are over worked and very under payed in every sense. Cashiers and department supervisors are in the same boat, being paid barely over minimum wage. The pay stays the same, but the hours and workload keeps increasing, leading to a somewhat toxic environment. While I do like working there, and the people are great to be around, new policies and management restructures kind of have me worried about the future of my job."
bad,"This Job was not only Tiring on my body, But the Workers including Co and Management Were petty. The Team Building Skills between everyone were so bad it pushed everyone into there own cubby hole. "
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 years and once my store manager transferred, I transferred because I couldn't stand the replacement. Then I dred going to my job entirely when I made it to a different, and busier store. The manager there was also the district manager and she was just AWFUL. I walked out for a dinner break one night and didn't come back."
bad,I would clock in and go straight to the register. My co-workers were close because they worked together for years so they treated me differently.
bad,The place of work was all about the numbers and management was very sucky. There was a lot of miscommunication. A typical day of work included providing customer doing your job and finishing someone else s work that they didn't finish. Most of my co-workers were lazy and were just there to be there.
bad,Not an ideal job for a teenager who wishes to achieve some sort of career advancement while making money to get through basic needs and expenses.
bad,"Unethical, lying, favoritism by the manager in the store I used to be at.  Played favorites, lied, criticized other management.  Poor attitude towards other managers.  I. myself loved dealing with the customers, co-workers, and vendors."
bad,"If they ever try to move you to Consumer Relations run. They only care about money. The corporate would make changes and tell us about them days later. Customers can curse, yell and scream and you have to take it. They do not provide enough info for you to answer questions. Run do not work here! Unless you want to save money and leave. They do not like you to ask questions. Training was unnecessary because everything was different once you got on the floor."
bad,A typical day at work starts by counting the safe and making sure the safe is always at five thousand dollars. Opening and closing registers and making sure each register has at least $300.Leading a team of employees  to achieve daily objectives and goals. Working for Walgreens i have learned how to better handle irate customers and how to work in a fast paced environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers after they would leave the bars around the store but meeting and interacting with new people made the job worthwhile.
bad,Enjoyed working at Walgreens when I first started. After downsizing the company went downhill and so did the management.
bad,The rules are made for certain employees and if you are in with management then you can get away with lots of things. High turn over rate in all departments.
bad,Since I am an ASM my day usually starts at 6:30 to 4:30-5:00pm. Work out a task list go over it with manager and then coworkers and other leadership. I have learned a lot a walgreens as a whole. This was my first full time job out of college but I think it's time to move on. The job is very physical lots of walking. Co-workers can sometimes be great and sometimes can be a hindrance. Most enjoyable part of the job interacting with the customers. It's always nice to help someone in need.
bad,There is not enough hours in a day to accomplish what was expected of everyone on a daily basis. Pay was good but does not compensate for safety and comfort.
bad,The best part about this job is the paycheck. Anything else pertaining to working here is a drag. Most of the days feel like an eternity.
bad,The most difficult thing I had to deal with at this was printing the photos and stocking the shelves. however it was also difficult dealing with the customers while printing photos and delivering the medications
bad,I was very stressed by the various task and drama that took place inside the work place.
bad,"First thing there is a five minute meeting to discuss sales and hand out work lists. Review the work station, print and file any photos that need to be taken care of. Then check your shelves (that consists of all beverages, cooler items and freezer items) for outs. Fill any outs that you are able, taking care of customers as they come and trying to finish your task list. When the check stand gets more than three customers in line you must open a register and help reduce the line. At the end of the night you straighten up your assigned aisles and check in with a manager before leaving. "
bad,"This company has so much potential; however, there is a significant lack of good managers. "
bad,"I was with Walgreens Pharmacy for 9 months.  This was my first pharmacy experience.  Although it was enjoyable, I knew I'd be a better fit with CVS Pharmacy."
bad,Typical work day would start with an hour call never set hours could be more or less. You will be rotated in different departments according to need. I learn how important team work is and how without it departments can not function properly. Management at Walgreen's can make or break you. This company is driven by production. Managers distribute work according to team member.  Most co-workers our friendly. The hardest part of the job was not knowing day to day when or if you will be moved to other departments and what time you are getting off work. Enjoyable part would be when you were given the opportunity to do something different.
bad,Company is very greedy and they are demoting people just to pay them less but still do the same job title. You aren't able to get overtime or work over 40 hours a week. You get a raise based on a grade but the raise is real low about $0.20 a year. During closing schedules they have little people work and inquire those who are schedule to do more work and labor. You don't get any real sick days no paid time off.
bad,It's busy during enrollment but at the end of the year work is slow.
bad,"It's a great job, being to help people is very good. The environment is fast paced and it requires a great deal of team work."
bad,"I definitely enjoy working at Walgreens. It is a positive work environment, however, new employees are not given the hours promised when starting."
bad,Store manager writes an unrealistic work list and lets you know about how horrible of an employee you are the next day when it doesn't get done. I have learned a lot but am never allowed to utilize what I have learned. Co workers are awesome some are like family.
bad,before I started Walgreens it was not what I expect low pay rate and not enough caring managers
bad,"I heard great things about the company when I started working there, but sadly, things went on the decline once a new CEO took over.  They don't care about their employees and scheduling (especially in pharmacy) was a nightmare."
bad,"A typical day at walgreens can be very stressful at times. Now don't get me wrong I do have my good days, but when it comes to dealing with ruled customers it make me want to pull my hair out. I think it would be a better place to work if the management was better. However, I do love my co-cokers in fact they make going to work better."
bad,"Work is fairly easy. Too many crazies to have to deal with. A lot of shadiness goes on with the HR staff. Lies, lies, and more lies. The work you crazy. Overtime everyday for like 6 months straight. They change your shifts whenever they feel like it. But it's a job."
bad,"I like the place where I currently work because every day there are different challenges from many different people, and you have to be very active to deal with all the situations that are created."
bad,"Good place to gain retail experience but not long term, downsizing of company made it difficult to transition into other positions."
bad,"assist with unloading incoming stock"
bad,Being a Pharmacy Technician used to have more benefits in the past. I use to be able to work over time which would allow me to get paid time and a half but that is no longer allowed. Holiday hours are no loner time and a half either.
bad,"Handle any customer issue, Shift Leads are not technically managers but are expected to do the same work and be up to the same standards."
bad,"Walgreens used to be an amazing company to work for. When I started there in 2005 they actually cared about their employees and compensated appropriately and it was truly fun to go to work everyday. When I left they no longer cared about the employees, there was constant job threats and only a handful of the managers in the entire district were enjoyable or worth working for."
bad,Company is confident that the culture that is being initiated will become successful and provide a brand that should become famously recogized by all
bad,A typical schedule would be not typical at all.  Made it hard to find daycare because the schedule was always changing.
bad,Spend 30 % of your time resolving third party issues for customers. Most of the time your technicians are inexperienced and staffing issues are a main concern. You are continually asked to produce more with less technician hours. Best part of the job is interacting with customers and helping them with their health care needs.
bad,"They are very customer oriented however they aren't very team-oriented. They make you feel ashamed or ""stupid"" for asking questions. As for actual work, your day was fairly busy up until about 7pm. After that time you are basically holding down the tiles and ""facing"" all the product on the shelves in your area. There would only be about 2 workers in the store and an assistant manager. I did enjoy interacting with all the various customers however I did not enjoy the ""down-time."" If you weren't busy you were to at least look and act like you were."
bad,back woods company. behind on all technical up grades. the systems are all very old school . cutting must of managers pay.
bad,"Customer care and satisfaction is most important to this company, which I admire. However, some stores fail to keep this focus by concentrating more on sales, which can in turn lead to a decrease in customers being the number one priority.  "
bad,"expected to work hard."
bad,I work with wonderful people. I help fill prescriptions and resolve insurance issues to give customers the care they deserve. I also help to check people out up front and unload trucks.
bad,"Walgreens is all about customer service and claim to be about development. Well, that is so for some people when it comes to development. The management tries to help you advance but there are some positions there where you're not going to get anywhere in such as greeter. In fact the job is downright boring and there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. The management is disorganized and does not communicate well with each other which affects the workers down the line. The people are nice and a few of the managers are too hard on people when they call out sick. I mean the ones that don't call out regularly. They give them grief over it when these are loyal employees that shouldn't be grilled because they're sick."
bad,Walgreens in my view does not pay their employees enough  money to make it worth while to stay employed with them. The management would reward extra productivity with candy or casual day passes. Yearly raises were a joke.
bad,"I worked as a third party merchandiser for Walgreens during their rebuild.  The staff were very nice and welcoming, however the work preformed was very tedious."
bad,"Lots of opportunity to learn if you take the initiative and learn on your own. You can work on projects with significant impact but acknowledgement and reward are very manager dependent. It's better to be the manager's chosen child than spend your time producing quality work. Most decisions are driven purely by numbers when there are more important factors to consider."
bad,great place to work budget cuts cons cutting hours and not treating employees good
bad,"Walgreen's Infusion was by far the most unorganized and unethical company I have ever worked for. Management in the Bethlehem office was extremely unprofessional. The communication between departments ie nursing, pharmacy, supply deliveries, is almost non-existent. Language used in the office setting is profound. Large amounts of money were wasted either by nursing staff arriving to a patients home for a scheduled visit and not having appropriate supplies and/or pharmacy mixing and sending wrong doses of medications (including chemotherapy and the like) because there are no processes in place  for follow-up, ineffective communication with referral resources and general disorganization. On over 50% of patient visits, I heard complaints and I myself was frustrated and even embarrassed to be a representative of the company. Management demonstrated unwillingness to have team meetings and be open to suggestions for improvement - instead participated in the gossip and blaming sessions."
bad,Walgreen has a lots of changes coming. Alot of good work that have been loyal to the company for many years.  Management is being  demote  with less pay but more responibitiies. Employees are olny part-time.
bad,"I started with Walgreen's as an intern 10 years ago while I was in my senior year of college. I was offered a job after the internship as an Assistant Manager. I received a great deal of training, and promotion opportunities in the first 5 yrs. However, the company started going through a really tough transition period starting about 5 yrs. ago until current day. Most of what I learned about Store Management and Supervision I learned in those first 5 yrs. with the company, back when the company valued and developed employees. I have worked in 3 positions, and 2 departments within the company within 2 states and 3 cities.The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people, regardless whether it was a customer or an employee. I genuinely got the most satisfaction out of simply helping people. I loved to cross train workers in order to help them gain promotions or a higher status within the store. I loved to work as a Tech. in the Pharmacy, especially during flu season when they needed me most. As a manager, I literally had to know how to do every task in every department within the store, from the basic unloading and stocking of warehouse, the complex details of filling prescriptions, to the hiring and firing employees. I have co-worked with very diverse groups of people from ""all walks of life"". When I married my husband in 2009, he worked in government law enforcement and that requires us to move periodically, as well as over 10 years, you meet a lot of interesting people(customers, co workers, supervisors, corporate VP's). Out of all the education, training, certifications,"
bad,"My time at Walgreens was short lived, mainly because I couldn't handle the unprofessionalism of the location I was at."
bad,"As far as your typical day at work day you would engage in customer service, and use a cash register."
bad,Company work well with you if  you are going to school. And great attendance policy
bad,"I did not learn very much, had little time to connect with customers, and felt unappreciated and unwelcome by co workers."
bad,"If you're expecting very much from this company, you'll be disappointed. Just a place to make a buck. Turn-over is insane."
bad,Used to the fullest with no consideration or your family life.You would need to be a single person with no responsibilties to family in order to work here.  
bad,every night is the same thing of getting done a typical work list that I have. The thing I do not appreciate is covering day-time people work because they were to lazy to do it then get no appreciation from the management level for doing it. Especially on a consistent basis with no extra help or encouragement.
bad,"The profit sharing plan is nice, but once I find a new job, I will never work at Walgreens again. Your hours can get cut mid-week and the only people that get the hours they request are pharmacy and management, and department heads. Every other employee is not cared about. There is a lot of favoritism and little praise for good work. The company is cutting pay, but expects you to work harder. Shifts are often understaffed and you need a manager to override the register to do just about anything. Employees are not treated equally and pay raises hardly even exist. This was my first job but my experience here has been absolutely terrible despite how much time and effort I put in to being a model employee. "
bad,"I like working in the pharmacy. A typical day consist of filling prescriptions, helping people get the right meds, or even help with their insurance issues. I like helping people, and even working with people. I enjoy customer service but retail pharmacy is a very high stress environment with a lot of responsibilities, and little help. I do not mind the responsibilities, but it makes it hard to do when so short staffed."
bad,"I'm grateful that I was able to have the opportunity to learn about medications, their uses and how to translate prescriptions especially having no previous experience doing so. A typical day at work consists of punching in,logging into all the systems and reference materials used during the work shift ( if they work). Receiving via computer scan image a copy of the patients prescription and typing  and or searching for the doctors name and telephone number, the prescription date, medication prescribed and doctors directions along with proper refills. All of this is measured in time handled and accuracy. I enjoy being able to help sick, elderly get their medications. "
bad,"I enjoyed working for walgreens,I wanted a change so I went to the hospital"
bad,"decent place to work if managers werent in such a bad mood on a daily basis, you can come into work happy and the managers will come and change that. They have a tendency to belittle associates"
bad,"the training was bad, the hrs for asst managers are bad."
bad,"Corporate culture has changed it the last few years. Walgreens no longer treats their employee's well. They don't believe you are a valued employee anymore, just a number that can be replaced. The long term employees that have not left yet or alienated and have checked out mentally from their job a long time ago."
bad,Very corporate. The pharmacy itself was nice because of the people. As far as the company it is a very stressful place to work
bad,"Hire to Fire unless you good at kissing mangers tales in the process, they always have a so called meetings everyday and we are left with no managment on the floor. ONLY there cause it pays the bills"
bad,Work schedule consisted of working alot of nights and weekends. I learned alot about working in a team enviorment and management resposiblilties. The best part of the job was working with part of team that all had the same goal in common. The worst of the job was not feeling like upper management treated lower managment properly.
bad,"If everyone would do ”their” job it would be ok, but the people that have been there the longest are constantly making the newcomers/temps do all the harder work that makes it hard to make the crazy rate. 20 minute breaks start when you leave your station & it takes 1/3 of your break to climb down stairs & get to cafeteria. It is a LARGE warehouse. Then you have to use another 1/3 to get back to your station. So that leaves you about 6.3 minutes. You never have time to eat! Day shift seems to never work overtime, but night shift shifts get prolonged all the time with very little, if any notice. You work so hard from the moment you get there, then when you think you're about to go home, they spring MANDATORY overtime on you. Lunches get stolen all the time & you cannot leave, or have time to eat on break."
bad,I enjoyed working with the customers.
bad,"Store manager is very profit oriented without regard to employee morale whatsoever.Very poor people manager and frankly, should search for a different career. Walgreens was once an employee focused company but has since gone the way of greed and often overlooks the needs of its most important assets in the name of the bottom line."
bad,"If you are a strong manager in this company, you get put into stores that were driven into the ground. You get to clean up after people in the same position as you, who are getting paid the exact same as you or even more. There is no incentive to work hard, other than getting promoted, but that can take 10 years. I put in 6 years for Walgreens and I think I would have been much better off had I chosen a different employer in the beginning. Retail is not fun no matter where you work and this is not the exception."
bad,"I would start my day at Walgreens by turning on all the equipment. I would then begin to develop all of the film that was left over from the day before. I would answer all customer related questions as well as ringing up customers who were are picking up photo's for that day. I learned a lot about film development at Walgreens. I had a great working relationship with the management at Walgreens, they were a good crew to work with. My co-workers were reliable and hard working. The hardest part of the job was learning all the different functions of the cash register. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers."
bad,"A typical day was running the cash register, answering phones, stocking, and cleaning."
bad,"There are at least two budget cuts per year. They're many techs that have to find another job or float amongst all walgreens locations for hours. Also, if you don't have 30 hours or more on average, you can kiss your health insurance goodbye. This company doesn't care about its employees, ONLY the BOTTOM LINE."
bad,"First professional job out of college. Walgreen's is a tough company to work for. As a manager for Walgreen's there is no work/life balance and the job is physically demanding. Many stores operate 24hrs/day 365 so you will miss out on holidays and work occasional graveyard shifts. One positive about the company is they had excellent benefits (health, 401K)"
bad,"On your feet all day,going back and forth all over the store."
bad,"Walgreens is so political. I worked for them for 1.5 years and it drained every ounce of me. I honestly could not find any college graduates that actually liked working for Walgreens. I had many problems with my boss to the point where I had anxiety issues. I did everything to be moved out of that store, but no one cared. I won't even shop there anymore."
bad,"Walgreens is a great place to work if you love kissing customer’s butts, being thrown under the bus by management and enjoy being treated like garbage. I don’t necessarily blame this on the store level. Walgreens up high loves to dictate what stores should be doing while sitting in their quiet offices not having to deal with the customer atrocities we are dealt ever day. Walgreens also doesn’t believe in Christmas or closing  on any holiday."
bad,"At the location I worked, the store manager and one of the supervisors treated their employees very poorly; very rude, harsh, would talk about people behind their backs, etc. On multiple occasions, I sought out help from higher ups and HR, and also tried to speak with my manager using the ""open door"" policy, but nothing ever came of it. They also don't believe in holidays or whether their employees get to spend time with their families, not when they might make a profit. The pay was decent for the work, but the company definitely DOES NOT make their employees a priority."
bad,"I am a shift lead at Walgreens.  You would think this means I lead a team.  Hah!  All I am is a key-carrying stock boy.  I spend all my time putting up sales tags, changing product pricing, checking for empty holes on the shelf (scan outs), and stocking the shelves.  I have to deal with customers who scam us with coupons along with customers that out-right steal from us.  Of course, I'm not allowed to do anything about the thieves but walk around the store asking if I can assist them.  What a joke.  It's no wonder the store is robbed blind.  If you are looking for a boring job where you are constantly stressed out and frustrated then Walgreens is the place for you."
bad,The main thing that stood out in the short time I was there was how inefficient the management was. I got the sense that they didn't know their job very well or how to explain it to others. Constant sense of chaos.
bad,"Store manager quit on a whim, store fell apart. I got moved to an even worse store where the employees were extremely rude and not interested in socializing with me at all."
bad,"Management put their work off on everyone else, had to work a lot of overtime because they did not have enough employees, it was awful when you didn't get a lunch break because there was no one to cover your lunch break."
bad,This place is heidious they are actually so racist and they have a lot of politics. Managers and some employs of them would just sit at the office doing nothing whil
bad,"Always happy going to work and assisting customers."
bad,Very unorganized and outdated. The pharmacy computer system is in need of some massive updates and it makes things much more difficult. Employees aren't always treated fairly and some of the higher ups are condescending and don't help as much to actually teach you what to do. I'm very upset that I left my previous job for this one
bad,"I don't want to be critical of the company that taught me success. But Walgreens used to be a wonderful place to work for, until the new European CEO bought the company and tried to squeeze every inch of profit out of it."
bad,"When I first started working, I was pregnant, my manager made me feel welcome. I was getting plenty of hours and I was happy at the time, but I didn’t like when the time came for breaks and 30 minute lunch breaks that I would get attitudes or hear complaints from coworkers about how they have to get pulled from the department that they work in just to relieve me. After I came back from maternity leave, I wasn’t getting hours like I was in the beginning, I was having babysitting conflict during the week and weekends and once I had put my child in daycare, I had no choice but to change my availability to Monday through Friday and once I told my manager about this, he pretty much told me to transfer or I would get fired, I feel like I was getting discriminated because he didn’t want to help me and I am a single parent working and trying to take care of my son. I feel like workplace discrimination against single parents is wrong and it’s not right. But I am glad that I left, I deserve better."
bad,"The problem with Walgreens is that it is a mixed bag. Usually the managers are burnt out workers recruited from the basic ranks. While this is good in a way, many of the managers of greater experience have become worn out and are careless or are extremely neurotic as they try to crack the whip to prove their worthiness of position. Some stores have great managers and they are very understanding, some stores have terrible ones and the managers are staunch and are unforgiving. Some managers will help you get advancement if you wish, others will him-haw and wont help though they promised to. Some stores are full of hard workers, some are full of sluggish people. Some are full of vibrant young people, some are full of crotchety old folks. Some stores are full of staff who genuinely care for their fellows and want to work as a team while others are full of gossipers and those who wish to tear others down. Its a mixed bag."
bad,As I have been working at Walgreens for the last few years many things have happened between myself personally and professionally. Walgreens has looked me over for many oppurtunities and ways to progress through the company. Although I am happy enough things like pay and managers are making it quite difficult to continue.
bad,I did not work at this company for long.  Working at the pharmacy was very stressful. Customers are rarely satisfied. That is just the nature of this job.
bad,"Just as with CVS, the expectation is not real for a retail pharmacy manager--way too much work and not nearly enough support staff is provided---dangerous for patients."
bad,"Stocking shelves positions "
bad,The pay does not match how much is expected out of your work. They are always short handed and continue to cut hours. They dont care about customers just numbers. The company has been going down hill for a while not caring for the employees or the customer and now it is starting to show. Most stores cannot get staffed.
bad,"Policies need to be stated in writing."
bad,"When I first started at this store, I was optimistic. It seemed more laid back than a previous store I had worked at. I soon found out that “laid back” meant “pass the grunt work to somebody else.” Between shift leads taking personal phone calls ON the sales floor (a no-no at my other stores) and talking for hours on end, to management showing up and leaving for the day when they felt like it, to being given NO notice if you were called in on an off day, I have to say this store is run like a poorly functioning after-school detention group. The customers were great, most of the pharmacy staff were great, and the regular cashiers/floor associates were hard working and on their task. But my God: do something with the bosses. I’ve worked in management before I and I was floored when I saw how this particular bunch ran the store."
bad,Had to deal with extremely rude customers alot. Management never stands up for you either. Would not reccomend unless you have very thick skin. Have to be able to run the cash register as well.
bad,"Frozen vacation time (only paid 70% of it)"
bad,"Don't get me wrong, the co-workers are cool, some of the managers are cool, even some of the customers are cool. But what this particular location is lacking, is the disregard for all the homeless people that hangout in front of the store. I initially thought when I got hired that I would be doing different tasks, but no, I am stuck at the register my whole shift, everyday. I don't like to stay in the same place all day."
bad,"The actual work part of this job isnt bad, I loved the kind of work it is. But there seems to be a problem with communication among all levels of employment."
bad,"Walgreens is a nice place to work for in general. They cut hours a lot and your schedule varies, so having a life outside of Walgreens is difficult. They do, however, provide health insurance and are a great place to work if you have daytime commitments."
bad,This was a great company when I first started. Now all they care about is profits. They cut as much as they can from the store level to reach their goals. My immediate bosses are wonderful. The corporate managers are disconnected from the reality of working at the store level.
bad,If you are young and starting out and would like to learn how to interact with multiple personality types and many customers this job can be a good starting place. The compensation is poor. Management varies significantly. Opportunities for advancement are slow and the work is not challenging.
bad,"When I started working at Walgreens 18 years ago they were THE retail pharmacy to work for. Fast forward to 2019 and this company has turned into💩!  Corporate management is horrible and is the crux of the issues here. The local(area) management is not that bad, but they have to do what corporate directs them to do. They have taken away practically every fringe benefit except for the basics. "
bad,The coworkers was amazing.. but it’s stressful and busy all day everyday and pay is horrible and the raises suck. It doesn’t matter how many experience you have as a tech they will start you off as low as possible.
bad,"I worked for Walgreens for about 6 months. The beginning part of the experience was great. My manager trained me and made sure I was ready before I was left on my own. "
bad,"It pays poorly, and requires a ton of work out of individuals. You get trained and are expected to do the job of management but without proper compensation."
bad,"A typical day as a shift lead can be stressful due to low budgets that affect how much work is done during a shift. The company has very high expectations including excellent customer service while tending to other duties around the store such as keeping shelves stocked, clean and organized as well as stockrooms and the pharmacy. Although this is expected out of most retail stores at Walgreens, the budget only allows for a small team to work each shift which causes all team members to be stressed. Often times it is just three people running the entire front end of the store.  These 3 employees are trying to check people out at the register, helping other customers on the floor, as well as finishing orders at the photo counter. Not to mention managers are given separate duties such as store call ins and resets and these are all expected to be done within a day or two even for sections of the store that are 40 feet long. The stress can and does cause there to be tension between employees and make working there unpleasant. Often times the employees feel unsatisfied and unaccomplished with the work they have done because it is often not complete and when it is they are often not praised due to management rushing to finish they're own duties while keeping the other employees busy. There is little to no consideration for employees who are of older age or employees who have medical problems, they are given the same expectations as a young and healthy employee. Overall getting a job at Walgreens means overworking and getting a very lousy pay."
bad,"All stores in our area got hit for 150 hours, leaving some full time employees with less than 10 hours a week. Management, and work environment is healthy, however bills need to be paid. Work is easy."
bad,"It was a good place to work at first. But eventually, the workplace and company went downhill. They cut hours but expected the same job performance. Some managers didnt help you at all but wanted to get out of work early. And they tried to get you to do their work while they hung out with other managers in the office and break room. Overall, it isnt a good place to work for the pay rate you're given."
bad,Bad managers throughout the company and very un organized.  That's all I really have to say so here is 150 characters for you omg are you serious you asked for feed back and make it mandatory
bad,I got let go of after seven years without a verbal warning prior.  There is no loyalty in the company whatsoever despite having years of seniority. Management unprofessional.
bad,Management expects you to know concepts that are not standardized. One manager will tell you how to do something then the next will tell you something different.
bad,Don't work here if you want a fair shot at management will hire for outside the company first. Not the best work environment either  think before you apply here
bad,Easy job. Not much room for advancement. Looking for a new job that I can learn and advance. I want to find my career for my family and myself. I been loyal to Walgreens for 10 years. But now it's time to move forward
bad,Good place to work. Customers can be difficult but other than that you have your regulars. Fast pace especially when doing truck 3 times out of the week
bad,"coworkers and shift leads were so messy and drama full. during holidays, everybody calls in and you have to slave two shifts straight because of people not coming"
bad,Not the company it used to be. Customers mean more to them than their employees do. Cutbacks cause stressed out employees. Mandatory 6 day work weeks of mandatory overtime during the holidays.
bad,"You can tell the company does not care about you as an individual. They cut corners and will do anything to make more money. The management was always unprofessional and lacked communication, causing lots of confusion for coworkers."
bad,Poor management that just walks around and talks about every employee to other employees or other people in management instead of working or offering assistance etc
bad,"I've been with walgreens for 17 yrs"
bad,"I love the people who worked with me there, it’s just I had been working there for 5 years and was never giving Anything other than being a sales associate, but I felt like I could’ve done more for the company. Just they never gave me a chance"
bad,"There is obvious favouritsm with managers. If you're not a class pet, get ready to have less than preferable shifts and hours given to you. Most of the employees get a long, but you have to be super careful who you talk to because there are a lot of blabber mouths."
bad,"The number of scripts doesn't go down but they keep cutting hours. Patients are getting very impatient and complain more and more about the staff. We are doing what we can with what we have!! Stop cutting hours and our effectiveness will get better it's that simple!"
bad,Too many budget cuts. Stores are always under staffed. Expectations are too high and the pay is too low. Very stressful. Those in charge just don’t understand. We’re expected to do more work with less help. How is that taking care of the customers?
bad,They have too many expectations they they put on you. I don't feel like the higher ups have a clue as to what it is likein a store. They rules are subject to change at any moment.
bad,"You would think that such a big company would be organized and well run. Wrong. The distribution center is run as a ""pass the buck"" process. The io's only react or interact if there is an issue. They are invisible any other time. The dungeon managers ""aka"" function managers pass all the hard work to the group supervisors but don't hesitate to reap the accolades. They rarely manage but can't really be blamed because it comes from the top and trickles down. You will be berated and talked down to because ""that's just the way (insert name) is. Unless u stand up for yourself, which will lead to you being an outcast. There are way too many meetings which all have the same result, ""tell us your barriers we will talk and basically tell u to figure it out yourself but your in trouble if you make the wrong decision because that's what you get paid for and we won't guide you"". The team members really run that place. They can pretty much do and say what they want and are protected by human resource at every turn. You have to jump through so many hoops to hold people accountable that sometimes you just give up. I have never worked at a place where there is such a lack of accountability for anyone except for the supervisors. The only thing good about that place is the pay but even then you only get paid once per month. Team members have no incentive to perform other than the risk of losing your job which rarely happens so the morale sucks. Team members performing well get paid the same as those that don't so why over achieve?"
bad,"Management was great when I started but manager got a promotion and new manager made the work environment horrible. He also wouldn't consider me for a promotion unlike first manager, he couldn't find someone who would do all the work I did for the low pay I worked for."
bad,"It is an ohkay place to work, if you don't have kids or a life. It's a good way to put your foot in the door and help you get certified and the experience you need to land a better career."
bad,"In a typical work day, we are always busy. No matter the day, or time... Working for this company has not been easy, but definitely not impossible, especially if you work well under pressure. The pro to this job was that I was able to learn and apply many things into my future career. I enjoy helping people out and seeing the smiles on ones face once they have appreciated the help you have offered them, however working retail is never easy. Having to call insurances for patients while they are rushing you most definitely was challenging."
bad,"managing needs some work, horrible hours, and unprofessional workplace. very slow paced and what they require you to do isn’t worth what they pay you at all."
bad,"The work is busy, but you can really learn a lot about the company if you focus. It is fun even though you are busy. Have met a lot of great people, and love helping the customers. "
bad,i feel like i was targeted after my 2nd store manager left. becky did not like me from the start and all waunakee people that worked there are no longer there.
bad,"I had to deal with a lot of rude customers and rude coworkers. Management definitely had favorites that got best hours and advancement opportunities, even got left off the hook."
bad,"Be prepared to work hard and independently if you work for this company.  It is best if you do your research on HIPAA, medications, and sig codes before getting involved."
bad,Working for Walgreens was a disaster. The pay rate isn't good enough knowing the type of people you have to deal with. There was no real training so basically you are on your own with little help from some people. I've tried to voice my opinion for future employees about ideas on how to train new people but the manager just brush it off. The only good things is the PTO and Holiday Pay.
bad,"In the time I have worked with Walgreens, they have taken away benefits from employees. We used to get time and a half as an incentive for working holiday’s. Now it’s regular time.  They capped pay so I did not get a raise for 3 years."
bad,I think the company is ok. But management is fairly poor lack . I think working for walgreens was ok but management was poor.Management picked employees they liked and I guess working I learned many things but was not giving option..
bad,they have great benefits. pay vrs stress is not worth unless u are looking for something temporary. schedule is very accommodating for people in school.upper management is amazing buy store management sucks especially at the Madison street location
bad,"While Walgreens offers relatively stable pay with some benefits, it's difficult to maintain a work life balance when you are constantly on call or working night shifts because the regular pharmacists don't want to close (i.e. being a third pharmacist at a store closing EVERY friday night). Sometimes it feels like a fast-food restaurant rather than healthcare because the company expects you to meet certain metrics without adequate staff support at times."
bad,Coworkers are usually decent. Manager are bad not trained for pharmacy. Hinder more than helps. Any decent technician will soon be drained and quit to lack of help or properly trained worker
bad,"The company has its good points but the Managers were very unproffesional and did not work well with employees on tasks that were assigned, Needed more direction."
bad,A very hard place to work. Very agressive and always beating down the employees. No thank you from upper management. No good relationship with upper management.
bad,"I can work any position at Walgreens. Over the 10 years I worked there I was trained in every department. But it still wasn’t enough for them to want to keep me or give me respect. Walgreens policy is caring for the customer. They should understand that happy employees = happy customers. And it is certainly worth mentioning that the 3 Walgreens that I worked at all had 1 thing in common, too many managers. I’m thinking that IS the Walgreens probably. Too many managers and no communication. I have literally 5 different managers telling me to do 5 different things and then at the end of the day they are shocked none of it is done. Did you forget I’m a cashier? Or a photo tech? Walgreens expects WAY too much. Yes your store is smaller than normal stores but from my 10 year experience we were always overwhelmed. 1 person calls in and everyone panics. Hire more employees!"
bad,"The only 2 good things that I can say about this place is I've made life long friends and it paid my Bill's. Also they will work with you if you want to take time off after having a baby , injury or death in the family.  Benefits are ok. But other than that they make unachievable goals and expect you to work like a slave to achieve them.  The equipment is shotty and something is always going down but you're still held to those unachievable goals. Don't make your goal they'll throw you on 3rd no matter what your home situation. They don't care how many years you've given them. Supervisors discuss personal information with other team members and managers. Alot of fake and shady Supervisors.  Don't get me started on the ridiculous favoritism"
bad,Walgreens has consistently chosen to deny my request for a different more suited position in the company for no other reason then it would be difficult to hire and train someone to replace me.  They did this even though on all my evaluation I i have received  exceeds expectations marks.  They fail to staff their stores to meet the needs of the store.
bad,"Good place to make money if you like long hours, but stressful working with dishonest co-workers.  When I started 8 years ago, it was fine, but stressful situations would come up with co-workers not allowing you to perform your duties because they wanted to steal your production. Good company, they would have cook outs for us and stuff, but towards the end no one like the food because it was cold.  Again co-workers would ruin it for everyone else by complaining about everything."
bad,"I've been at walgreens for 18 months now as a certified pharmacy technician. I can easily say it's an extremely high paced and stressful job and work environment. Pay for technicians is way below the national average, and it should be above for what we have to deal with. I've been there for, again, 18 months, and I still make the same hourly wage as new employees. Management isn't great and corporate doesn't care about the lower employees."
bad,"Fast paced  and stressful environment"
bad,Use to be a great place to work until the new management came is after the CEO's  had passed away.  then it went down hill. The managers in my last position there were not helpful at all. they cared about themselves.
bad,"I am going to be a single adult once again but it was difficult to get the days off that one needs to attend a child's special/school events. I would have been more excited about working for this company if the managers were not selfish and more flexible. It was not a pleasant experience for me, and I was promoted to management. I was promoted but overall disappointed with this company."
bad,"Primarily responsible for assisting customers ,although job duties typically include a variety of functions. responsibilities may include sales floor ."
bad,"When I started with Walgreens they did pay better than other companies (at least for leadership and management) but since minimum wage has been raised there haven't been any cost of living increases. With the implementation of Frontier they've added more to our workload without giving us any sort of compensation for that either, which would probably be fine if they weren't constantly cutting hours from our budget. They expect us to run the store with half as many people as we used to, and expect us to do more. I don't know anybody that actually feels valued by the company, but what can you expect when you work for such a huge company I suppose. One plus is that once they make you full time they can't take it away from you, and it's quite difficult to be fired from the company, so there is some job security in that. Health insurance through the company is expensive and not worth it if you ever need to actually see a doctor."
bad,"If the company listened to it's hard working employees, and provided the necessary staffing to appropriately care for the customers, it would be a terrific workplace... but it doesn't.  "
bad,"The typical day sees all levels of store employees deal with the grievances of outraged customers, completing tasks at a near impossible pace, being assigned practically degrading cleaning tasks, and all the while you are expected to present yourself as happy and willing to help."
bad,I only worked here about a year as a high school student. Despite knowing I had school next morning store manager would not want to let me leave earlier. Co workers were great management not so much.
bad,"They don't think about their employees as a person with a life.  They over work the employees in the store.  They don't care about holidays.  They don't care about the employees families.  Some of the stupid things they come up with and than replaces those ideas with more stupid ideas. They limit the amount of hours the stores have to schedule employees and can't understand why things don't get done, or customers are taken care of promptly.  And the scheduling puts employees at risk of being robbed or assaulted by shoplifters."
bad,"New management is horrible, he yells at his employees, throws fits like a two year old, calls his employees liars to their faces even though their not lying. Has nothing good to say about any of his employees, talks about them negatively behind their backs. Takes employees word over his management teams word. He sits in the office all day and gets mad about things not getting done, when he doesn’t even know what’s going on out on the floor."
bad,I liked working here when I started but the scheduling manger doesn't know what they're doing. The pay isn't good for the work you have to do. But I think the real problem is at the store I work at and not all Walgreens.
bad,"Good group of people very big on training,customer service,somewhat demanding at times the job comes first family is second. Reviews are done yearly but raises aren't"
bad,Walgreens is moving towards cutting payroll as low as possible which creates a very stressful enviroment where you never have enough resources to get the job done.  Walgreens wants the customer service of Chick fil a but wants to provide the resources of dollar general.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is going. If you're willing to do your job and your co-workers job as well, then this is the company for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is ending your shift."
bad,It is a high paced stressful place to work. Moving up through the ranks isn't easy. You aren't recognized for your hard work. You do a lot of things that will effect you later in life medically.
bad,It was an okay job. I felt like i was the only person working there was never no team work . but i loved the people that would come in mostly the. Elderly .
bad,"I was hired with the expectation of becoming a Pharmacy Technician. After being hired, the pharmacy technician hours were cut. I am now stuck as a customer service associate being paid $9/hr even though I am a Certified Pharmacy Technician."
bad,"Basically, do not work here if you expect management to back you up if a customer uses bad language with towards you towards things like insurance, early prescription drop off, and closing the pharmacy at the closing time. The customer is ALWAYS right, even if they scream at you for nothing, except for being a technician that isn't able to give them their drugs."
bad,A very fast work pace always keeping busy you're whole shift helping customers and running you're work station or task that was asked for you to do before the end of the day
bad,"Like most major companies, they did not care what the employees thought, especially when it came down to the store level, for improvements that could be made."
bad,This place lets the managers walk all over you and then they will let you go instead of the manager. Then they find out that the manager is dirty and then the let he or she go.
bad,"* Manage control substances inventory, overstocks, outdated, recalled and audited"
bad,"Nice place to work, if you are young. You must know people to get in. I was there a long time, and regret it. Wish I would of went elsewhere.. A lot of old timers. Pay raise are less that 25 cents"
bad,"I do not wish to comment about my experience with this company , other than it was a nice place 10 years ago but it has become less and less desirable to work there over the last 4 years."
bad,"Walgreens have a great culture, but where the issue is there is no way to move forward. I was even told “this job is for people that come and go.” I learned a lot of positive things, but with no advancement it turns into a deal breaker."
bad,working the register(s) as well as the drive thru window. management helps when they can tho they are understaffed as well. The computer system forces label prints at certain times as they feel you should be able to do so many rx's per hour regardless of what else may be going on there
bad,Manager was not there for support when needed.  On many occasions called & sent e-mails and a few text messages that never got returned or was not returned in a timely manner.
bad,I am grateful for the experience I received working for Walgreens. I learned many different skills while working there which got me to where I am today. I have no complaints about the management in the local stores. My complaint is mainly higher up in the company. It seems that they only care about numbers and not the customers.
bad,It was cool. I loved working on Homan and Roosevelt but when I transferred downtown that is when things went downhill. I hated working overnight. Management was very unprofessional wouldn't let me switch shifts or transfer out. Stupids! Hated them badly.
bad,i ve learn many thing at Walgreen which include getting to work on time and my work ethic. also keeping yu self busy is the way to go in there if you want to advance..
bad,"Walgreens in the epitome of a huge corporate pharmacy job. Benefits and salary are competitive, but it feels like being a cog in a huge machine where employees are just numbers and not valued as individuals."
bad,"The upper management of Walgreen has made some very poor business choices that result in employees benefits and wages being cut to recoup failing programs. The only way to move up in the Walgreen's company is through the ""good old boy club""."
bad,"The company does not care about its employees. That's the bottom line. You are required to push yourself to extreme mental and physical limits while being denied the ability to eat or even sit down. As a pharmacist, you get no lunch or dinner break. And you can't even be a pharmacist because they cut your technician hours and force you to be 50% technician. You are also the slave of customer receipt surveys. When someone is angry that the pharmacy was closed when they got there and gives your pharmacy a terrible survey score, you have to accept it."
bad,One of the worst managers i've worked for in my life. she was rude and inconsiderate and lets just say customers did not like her and complained alot.
bad,I worked there while I tried to look for work that used my degree but I ended up in a rut. Honestly It isn't all that bad but it can feel like you will never escape.
bad,"if you work hard they will work you even harder. Management has their favorites. I love stocking but they were making me work too many lines that was not allowed. Loved the fast pace and work flow."
bad,"Walgreens is a corporation, but there is no consistency from one region to the next, or even one store to the next. What was expected practice at one store has gotten me reprimanded at the most recent location I have transferred to. There is blatant favoritism from management toward employees, little to no consistency in training or disciplinary action is taken.. Unless, of course, you are not one of the favored employees."
bad,"The company is in cost cutting mode and it will lay off thousands of jobs. This company has no advancement opportunity and they have no support for their loyal employees.  It used to be a good company to work for, now it's a shame."
bad,Very small store stockroom up stairs and early mornings o truck days. Lots of transfers and you are typically not asked  if you want to be transferred.
bad,"The way things are handled at the store level is very strange at times. "
bad,Not the best but its okay. Pto hours adds up very slowly. It's ok depending upon what manager your under. Lately a disadvantage is that the company have less hours for employees.
bad,"There are rotations when you come into work, drive thru, in window, pull medications, fill medications, cashier.  This was the worst place for me to work due to no team work.  Everyday I would go in and I would pull other employees share of their work and it wore me out by the end of the day.  Many employees did not get along with each other and that is one part I dislike and the race card was always pulled.  Corporate wasn't able to handle the problem fairly.  I learned to stay to myself and work efficiently to do my duties and plus more and keep calm and just work.  Customer service was always the number 1 expectation and I tried my best to give that."
bad,"I was older than all of the managers and coworkers except for two. A very immature , gossiping, lieing and hostile working environment. Biased management who played favorites. One of the employees keyed my car! Had 4 relatives and 1 dog die all within 2 months and was not granted any personal time off. Always cutting and gaining hours. Was lied to about my shifts and they had me close 4 nights a week which led to never seeing family members and pets. Was lied to about the two days I could not work that they had me work. The customers were awesome! I knew a lot of them for over 13 years and they were why I stayed. No one was issued a raise after AZ minimum wage went to $10.00 hour."
bad,walgreens is kind  of laid back but I felt like I was being taken advantage of I do not mind working because that the reason I was there but because I was so eager to work I was given a lot of different assignments while other would stand around and converse with management
bad,Bi weekly pay. Lots of employment perks after being there a yr. good benefits. Decent working hours. There is plenty of room to relocate or fill in at near by stores as needed.
bad,Expectations put upon select few are unreal no matter how much work was done management only acknowledged the numbers we weren't first in in our district
bad,"Walgreens is a national drugstore chain where an individual who works for them has numerous opportunities to advance through its  ranks.  It provides an environment to learn new an interesting things,"
bad,Takes a special kind of person management puts alot of work on you they hardly follow through with there promises Christmas is hectic sometimes it's nice
bad,"Walgreens was a good beginners experience, gives you the basis of what you need to take on other jobs in areas such as retail, stocking, and inventory."
bad,"Staff shortage, not enough facilities for staff, salaries not satisfactory. management not well engaged, Culture is very rigid and not friendly. Only benefit is staff discount."
bad,"It varies from store to store but my experience has been if you have a female store manager you're going to hate your job. I have never had any issues with any of the male management, but once you get into a store with a female manager they feel like they have everything to prove and it gets really catty really quick. I thought that it may have just been my experience but my sister and a few other co-workers had shared that they had the same experience when working at a store with a female store manager. Their policies make being a shift lead difficult. If you dont do your job there isnt really any repercussion to it as long as you dont do your job consistently. If you go into work every day you will be punished for nnot showing up and doing that same quality work every day despite what others work looks like."
bad,A typical day can be very stressful as I can be very busy. At my store we are not given enough time to complete daily tasks. If you are given time it has potential to be a rewarding experience.
bad,"You won't get rich working in retail; especially when you are just starting out through a temp job to get a little extra money to get through college.  However, this is a good place to practice customer service skills and meet some really interesting people."
bad,"Walgreens is a very productive place to work and they teach you alot but they expect you to lie and cheat to get ahead, hint all managers do it. Manager eat food without paying,but will fire someone else. Managers steal money and cover it up. Managers take gifts in exchange for hiring someone not qualified for a position."
bad,"A day at Walgreens on over-nights is you greet the customer when they come in and give them a nice good bye when they leave. You build a relationship with the customers due to the fact, that it increase sales and you form a bond with the customers. clean then store and have it ready for the morning people."
bad,"working for walgreens as a pharmacy technician has been a great experience for the most part.. however when you raise the starting wage for a cashier to be about as much as a basic pharmacy technician it is not fair.. the pharmacy is the driving force of your business walgreens... you would think that you would also give your technicians who have to uphold a professional reputation in the medical field as well as a medical responsibility to your patients, community, doctors, etc where any mistake could potentially end someones life..you would THINK that we would get a raise also.. not cool walgreens, not cool. THIS is why i am looking for a new position be it another chain, independent, or hospital setting."
bad,"This company has a high - turn over - of employees. Many employees leave, and are replace by new people every three months. Check the job data bases online and you can see for yourself."
bad,"Job becomes routine. Management is horrible. There is no praise in the workplace. If you meet goal, you are asked why you didn't exceed goal. Co-workers are great which is probably the only reason I've stayed so long. Full time to Walgreens is anything 30+ hours. I have worked here 10 years and they are now only giving me 30 - 32 hours per week because they keep cutting back on hours."
bad,Walgreens is an okay job for what they expect from you.  You spend most of the time standing around waiting for customers to need something.
bad,Very busy atmosphere. Co-workers not team players. Management could use to update themselves on company policies.
bad,"Walgreens is an older company (100+ years) and they used to care more about their employees. The specific store teams would vary greatly and you could find good people at just about every location, but the corporate environment was not conducive to a good working environment."
bad,"Your daily routine was constant ever day which becomes annoyingly  repetitive. In addition to the racist customers, it was not a pleasant place to work."
bad,"It was hard to get promotions in walgreens, practically impossible. They had nice health insurance and the managers were always willing to help you learn (most of them) and scheduling was great, except the holiday season which is a given for any retail store."
bad,"Busy atmosphere especially around the holidays. Always multitasking and starting new projects. Management was very pushy about suggestive sales, that sometimes lead to aggravated customers. Felt that there was a lot of customers that returned frequently to shop there. There was always great buys and deals in our weekly Ads that attracted customers as well."
bad,"Walgreens is a good place to start but not something you want to stay in for a long period of time.  They do not have a family friendly work schedule and as you advance up the ladder the schedule only gets worse.  Working almost everyday in December for the holiday season and if you are salaried you will end up working very long hours but not getting paid any different of course.  Bonuses are okay but are soon to be eliminated, the benefit packages are not very good.  Overall the Company has changed a lot since I have been there and not in a good way.  I would recommend skipping them for a job in general for any position."
bad,"My hours were not stable at all "
bad,"Typically, we would either put up displays or stocks shelves. we would help customers as they came up to us or we saw they needed help. they paid us barely anything and told us to break company policies for customers to make the managers look better."
bad,I am a shift lead. Typical day is get all the work the other managers did not want to do. Bust your butt and get nothing in return. Many shifts where they have you close not getting home til midnight but then have you back for the 6 am shift.
bad,"Lack of training, unrealistic expectations set forth by management, and forced overtime hours without pay but you leave early on Monday or Tuesday instead. The job is very tough. I could go on and on throwing the management staff under the bus but will refrain. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work here."
bad,"Every day going into work is extremely busy, a bathroom break is few a far between. We are usually short staffed and are WAY under payed for what we do! The customers overall are great, we do have a few who do expect things that are outlandish. With being as busy as we are and being shorthanded we still need to make sure things are done safely, customers dont often realize that part. So we take a lot of grief from customers for wait times because of this."
bad,eh could be better the company doesnt really make you feel like your a valuable asset to them. you get overworked cause of short staff.
bad,"Management staff lack skills and leadership don't know how to manage a team. Act like they care but are only after takiing care of themselves,every one in the building had the  reg pharm lic were all copied from a tl who had all the answers, everything changed when the new manager of the building came in. If your you do not do what you are told your out of the building. It was a nice place to work for Walgreens pushes a family environment does not do a very good job employees go to work thinking that the supervisor will catch something wrong on a phone montering and will get called to Hr and get fired. Hr is a joke too."
bad,If you have good managers the company is awesome to work for and the job is very rewarding. I loved helping customers and the relationship you create with them is special. But bad managers make it hard for you to want to go to work. I had both.
bad,"Its retail so you're not going to get a set schedule, but you're not going to be recognized or appreciated for your hard work either. The allotment to pay salaryies in a store is not correlated to the immediate need of the customer which will result in long lines and an aggravation for the employees."
bad,"Walgreens used to be a really great place to work and advance one's career. In the past few years however, senior management has determined that pleasing shareholders instead of taking care of its employees takes priority. With the decline of annual store growth and the restructuring of store field management, long term career options are at best only available for a few people. There has been a tremendous upset as store positions have become more revolving door and the talent the company used to have is no longer available at store level. On the other hand, it does give first hand experience dealing with customers and learning the retail environment and does it well. Despite having an identity crisis for culture and programs, Walgreens does excel at achieving customer satisfaction far beyond its competitors such as CVS. Benefits are also decent, if not what they used to be."
bad,"A typical day at wok would be me preparing the truck driver route manifest pouches, releasing store trailers, billing stores, scheduling pick-ups and deliveries.  Assisting dispatch manager in clerical and receptionist duties.  Ensuring delayed product was delivered on correct date and out of distribution center on time.  Scanning Fed-Ex packages.  My direct supervisor was very relatable and responsive to questions I had about my daily work task. My co-workers were diligent, friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The hardest part of the job was working in weather extreme conditions ( no air conditioning in warehouse in Houston summer). The most enjoyable part of the job was the constant change and daily challenges in my role as a billing agent/warehouse worker."
bad,It's an okay place to work with minimal advancement opportunities
bad,"there are some very rude employees at my office. Manager does care as long as work gets done,"
bad,Long Crazy store management is horrible Pharmacy management is great. My co- workers are great and fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the ignorance from the some of the costumers. The most enjoyable part of the day is when i get to go home
bad,"Management would like you to voice your ideas in which is a great idea if they had took the time to listen. My problem was if you applied you idea and it works out, then it became their idea. But if it fails you are at fault. It was a game of cutthroat more the team work."
bad,"Jasons deli was my first job in high school. I learned a lot of great customer service skills, which I take with me everywhere I go."
bad,The little person is overlooked but relied on for the bulk of the results.
bad,"Would receive phone calls for new prescriptions, review new and refill prescriptions.  Counseled patients in store and over the phone.  Administered immunizations."
bad,"The good part is that they start everyone out a little higher than minimum wage.  The shifts are all over the place, sometimes finishing at 11pm and starting the next day at 7am.  Each typical employee did the job of six different people, including stocking, cashiering, sweeping & mopping the facility, and cleaning the bathrooms and breakroom, but was only paid for the job of one person.  Management was horrible because they didn't want to do any work for themselves and told employees to ask for help if needed, but when asked would ask why help was needed and act as though they did not want to help.  The store manager didn't even know how to run some of the equipment, like the equipment in the photo lab.  I don't know about now, but then there were no dedicated weekends off, so social and family life was almost non-existent."
bad,Too little pay for the amount of work we do. Was given responsibilities that weren't told to me in the interview process.
bad,"A typical day would include opening the store, making sure all cash boxes were at the right amounts. Making the front of the store look presentable for both customers and upper management, checking in vendors/trucks, merchandising, light to moderate accounting duties, inventory control procedures, training and mentoring the staff, creating game plans for the day with staff and management. The hardest part would be time management to ensure all tasks get done. The most enjoyable would be my coworkers, staff and customers. You never know what will happen in the day and that made the job interesting."
bad,"I worked here while I was a teenager. They pushed you to do promotional monies a lot. I didn't like the face that they would change my schedule and not tell me, and then call me when  I was supposed to be at work a 6am and ask where I was at."
bad,Long hours on your feet with no scheduled breaks. Unpredictable hours and required to be staffed on weekends. May be asked to work anywhere between 6 and 12 hour shifts. Support team could be skeleton crew on any given shift. Management will push on goals and additional tasks without giving needed help.
bad,"I did learn a lot in terms of what a pharmacy tech does, but the environment in which I worked was something I did not like."
bad,"A typical day at work changes daily. The hours are filled with maintaining store quality and keeping the shelves full and shoppable. Additionally, I am in charge of the store's cash managment, customer service in all departments ranging form cosmetics to pharmacy and managing a staff of workers. My coworkers range in ages, where some are older than me and some are younger than me but no matter their age they respect me as an authority figure. I would not say there is a particular hard part of the job, for I see every challenge as a learning opportunity. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the feeling of accomplishment after the shift is completed."
bad,"A typical day for me is filling about 500 to 1000 or more scripts, typing the same number of scripts into the computer to be verified by the pharmacist, and providing excellent customer service while ringing up customers. While ringing up customers I have to be courteous and caring and proactive in their health by offering flu, pneumonia, shingles, and other vaccines as well as registering patients for health testing."
bad,every one was tidy and neat and the store was full of wonderful employees
bad,"Typical day at work is hearing what I did wrong the day before and end up doing other people's work with no recognition. I have not learned anything else new after the first year of being there. Management is a joke. If one gets burned by the higher up, it ends up going down on everyone else as if it was their fault. Co-workers are the best thing for the company as they do what they are told yet not good enough for higher ups. Hardest part of the job is to actually drive there to get paid. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I leave to go home and apply to other jobs."
bad,"It is an ok place to gain experience and interact with people; co-workers were great, management ok. What kills this job is the terrible hours for some employees, management cared very little to zero about employees. Basically I went to work because my co-workers were awesome people and I needed money."
bad,No communication from upper management. No training had to teach myself things on the go.
bad,"A typical day at work entailed fast paced activities. I learned to work well with people, provide great customer service, and how to manage different personalities. Most of the management staff was great the only problem was the store manager was allowed to get away with activities that were either illegal or against company policy. Corporate was told many of these things and still they have done nothing. Co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the store manager and trying to not get caught up in his illegal and/or against company policy activities. The most enjoyable part was the people."
bad,the growth opportunity at Walgreens is not by performance base so it is difficult to get promoted especial female. 
bad,On a typical day i take care customers and make sure the departments looks good. As far management its okay. My Co-workers are very nice and easy to get a long with.The hardest part of the job is that i can't talk to my co-works for 2 minutes its a big problem i love to associate with people and i cant do that their
bad,Hassled by ignorant people all day. Learned plenty of communication skills. Management at times lacked support. Not an enjoyable job at all.
bad,"Although I enjoyed what I did from a day to day basis, I felt there was no advancing in the company which was depressing. I had no work benefits (that I was even told about that it) and I was never given the amount of hours I wanted to work. All my managers were very nice though."
bad,"Not so much a hard job, but very frustrating. Management hires low quality and unreliable people. Which just creates more work for those who can be counted on. The Store Manager, Assistant Manager, and District Manager are never on the same page. Over the course of three days one fixture was changed 4 times because there was no plan. The Store Manager and the Assistant also supervise nothing being achieved during their shift, leaving all the work for the junior managers and closing shift workers. The Store Manager and Assistant also both have an unprofessional work relationship which proves to be a distraction to the entire store."
bad,A typical day consists of clocking in and doing the same work day after day with management more concerned with why they can't climb the ladder than how they can help make the store run smoothly. My co-workers are trying to find a way to escape their job duties without being noticed by the managers. The hardest part of the job is being yelled and screamed at by customers and having to act as if I have no emotions when this occurs. The most enjoyable part of the job are the regular customers that actually care about the employees and don't just come in and bark orders. I learned from life at Walgreen's that I should always strive for more.
bad,it can suck...
bad,"job was very stressful with little chance of advancement.didn't like working conditions,worked hard and no reason to continue trying ."
bad,at first it was tough to work with customers and never being in retail
bad,If you want to a company that is flexible for student in collage that it is otherwise. Managment tend to have big egos and are usally abusive of there employees.
bad,This was the most boring job I have done. If you love standing around waiting for people this is a good job for you. When you have customers its not too bad
bad,"people you work with can be nice.depence in which store you are. lots work. management are nice too. they start you at 10.00 hr. and you get your 25ct increase yearly ,maybe. are we in the year of 2019 or 1960? look people: if you need money for rent,food ecc. and you're happy with 10.00hr go for it. if not,go for it and run as fast as you can.good luck"
bad,"I truly enjoy being a pharmacy technician all together, however, Walgreens does a poor job at recognizing a person's performance. I believe I should be paid what I'm worth period, especially at the stressful location I work at."
bad,"Overall, Walgreens isn’t that bad, though it depends on your situation. If you’ve had prior retail experience before, I suggest looking at other jobs, since the pay for a service clerk here is generally minimum wage. You can find much better compensation than that. If you haven’t, then this is a relatively okay first job. Which brings me to another point: employees are always coming and going. Since the pay is so bad (you can’t live on it), Walgreens tends to lose people fast, even in leadership positions (minus the manager). One thing to note is that this is a RETAIL job. I know that’s pretty obvious, but it’s important to note that “retail” basically implies that you’re going to be dealing with awful customers. Yes, some will be nice, but a lot with be rude, mean, etc. Not to mention the fact that people are constantly trying to scam you. Literally. Every week there’s a stolen credit card being maxed out on gift cards."
bad,It's a demanding job depending on where you work. Up front you deal with the regular day to day stuff where as on the pharmacy you deal with even more from insurance to medication being out of stock.
bad,"Over the past 10 years with the company, it seems the corporation cares less and less about the employees and more about money.  They say they want you to succeed and move up, but when you push for advances and express interest in opportunities, they are left by the way side.  As a company, they need to restructure and consider who they are hiring for people making big company wide decisions"
bad,"I worked here as my first job. It's a good starting job, but the lay is horrible for what you have to do. They never give raises there either, so your stuck getting payed the same."
bad,"Too much focus on selling drugs. Sure most are needed but I feel very strongly that our society is highly over medicated. Low pay for team members, most didn't care for job."
bad,"Political environment"
bad,I walk in and immediately manage the front register without any employees greeting me. I learned how to operate a register and basic on floor tasks. Management was good when I applied but after a few months they relocated and we got rude managers. The workplace is dirty and very quiet.The hardest part was to run back and forth between registers whenever they had technical problems. I liked my coworkers they were very kind but some managers were very rude when I had medical problems.
bad,"the work enviroment was resonable, I was my first job during college. during my time there I was exposed to medical information such as medications and their uses and side effects."
bad,Overall depending on the location (I’ve worked at other locations for overtime) the vibe is always good and teamwork is just second nature. The work load is fast paced must be able to multitask. The downfall is that the higher management doesn’t take concerns of employees seriously. Other than that general store managers do what they can in my experience.
bad,"Depending on what store you get, it may not be terrible. If you end up at a busy store thats understaffed because people  left, like at mine, it sucks horribly. Closing shift is the worst shift since most of your day is cashiering and fixing other problems that were left by the people ahead of you. All the while, corperate will be cracking a whip at both pharmacists and technians to do things that would be the equivalent of expecting a 3 legged horse to win a championship derby.(adding work even though we're short staffed)."
bad,"I got hired as a cashier when I was 17 and worked my way up to ASMT. i was with the company for almost 6 years and the first couple of years was alright but once I got into management it went all downhill. Each store has a management ratio it has to follow so most stores will be only allowed a store manager, assistant store manager, and 2 shift floor leads, 3 if lucky. It was so hard having a life out of this job because you could never call out, because if you did, another member of leadership would have to fill in and no one wants to do that when they're already working 40+ hours. Some times management would be forced to work back to back shifts (7:30am-10:30pm). Budgets getting cut all of the time. Customers were horrible, they abused the company way too much. Coorporate would force us to enforce certain policies to employees or customers but yet once a corporate complaint goes through, any policy we are taught is thrown out the window and makes us look dumb for even backing it up in the first place. Customers walked all over you. Employees are lazy. Hard physical labor, impossible expectations. I left as soon as I got my Bachelor's Degree and will never look back."
bad,Worked at the Walgreens warehouse in Orlando for two years the place is Really going under since now owned  by rite aid poor place to work limit advancement lackluster benefits dirty old equipment and working conditions  alot of drama and childish work environment good short term work but not a career
bad,"It's a hit or miss to work there depending on management. You will mostly be a float (floating all over the stores working different areas in the store and not what position you were hired for). Lots of empty promises and very unfair place to work. Lots of drama. Everyone knows about everyone's business. They promised me that I will get to start working Pharmacy but, one of the leads who asked after me got to go first and thats why I left."
bad,"Company cuts hours seasonally and yearly, pushing the limits on how low a staff stores can run on, causing employees to multitask and rush to get jobs completed while trying to maintain exceptional customer service. Pay is minimum and raises are only yearly based off of reviews, and even a good review results in about a quarter cent raise."
bad,This is not always the best pace to work. You don't always now what kind of hours that you will receive from one wee to the next. They have grown too large too quickly and forgotten their core values.
bad,Walgreens needs to  provide through training in the photo dept. The processing machine broke down often and customers orders weren't met for the holidays.
bad,"If you work at walgreens,  you have to learn fast who is your friend and who is not. Not everyone is welcoming and its hard to work there if no one helps you out or shows you how to do something new. People tend to keep to themselves and do their work but some managers do not take the time to teach new employees or new managers how to do their job correctly and when they make a mistake, they get yelled at instead of teaching that person in the first place."
bad,The major concern at Walgreens is security. There have been multiple robberies in the area and not enough has been done to mitigate the situation. Many are displeased.
bad,"Walgreens was a great place to work temporarily as it offered good pay for a relatively easy job; however, the management and job security leaves a lot to be desired and I would not try to stay permanently."
bad,cut throat high competitive corporate run. Work long shifts they select location you work. High goals to meet. strict structure to follow for work goals.
bad,Co-workers are lively and management is mostly professional. Yet there is not guarantee for a stable position. it can be monotomous working in the pharmacy constantly monitoring the phone and computer screens.
bad,There was a lot of good employees to work with and we had a great team...everyone worked well together.   Everyone was very flexible and willing to learn something new!
bad,Fellow coworkers and other staff members were great. Sometimes disorganized and lack of communication between pharmacy and front end when it comes to scheduling. I worked both as a pharmacy tech and front end. The official job title I had was designated hitter. The hardest part was dealing with the customers especially in that specific area but it is part of the job.
bad,"All the employees were a joy to work with, which is the only reason I stayed as long as I did. 35 years in Customer service industry "
bad,"I enjoyed working, but it was very hard dealing with patients. They were very demanding and unreasonable. The company does not have policies in place to protect the workers against aggressive customers."
bad,"I have worked at Walgreens for three years as an intern, and enjoyed working there"
bad,"I liked working there and I haven't had any horrible issues with management. Most of my managers have been really awesome people and staff is amazing. However, I don't receive enough hours. They put customer service over staff needs. Pay is barely more than minimum wage. Overall for the amount of work you have to do isn't proportional to the amount of pay you receive. You also never have enough time to finish what you need to finish and there is never enough staff in the evenings."
bad,Worse than CVS.  The workload is exhausting. There used to be a more structured Rx-processing work arrangement but it's pretty much gone by the wayside.
bad,The job was easy sometimes hard to please and reason with customers. Management at my location could have been better. Workers could have also been better. Not entirely a horrible job but there qere things that could have been much bwtter then they were.
bad,"The store manager had personal issues and brought them with her to work, which stressed all the employees out. Most of the shift leads didn't care about their job most of the time"
bad,"You walk in and start your day with that one customer that just gives you a hard time then you officially start your day. you get some of your tasks done that managers assign you then, there is always that one manager that just eats at your skin all day and then you finish off your night facing and then leave and come back the next day"
bad,"Apparently Walgreens was a completely different company before it went public--I'm not surprised. From what I experienced, Walgreens suffers from a lack of management effectiveness and efficiency. It is also an incredibly cheap company. In our department, we didn't even get free coffee. On the plus side, I met some cool workers. On the downside, many workers would fall asleep at their desks and face no consequences. Additionally, I rarely saw our department head and you never felt like we had a chance to move up in the company. And there wasn't enough work to go around."
bad,My Group Lead was great. Learned to drive Crown forklift and clamp.  Learn to Receive AS 400.Hardest part of working there was getting around road blocks they keep putting up.Best part was working for my Group Sup.
bad,"The programs they use are outdated.  Prone to crash.  They change your schedule in hours notice.  They don't believe in sick days,  though you shouldn't take a lot.  But any you take is unexcused.  And most of the supervisors have attitudes."
bad,"- My typical day at work: punctual arrival, clocking-in, check in with manager on duty for assigned location for the day"
bad,"Not too much room for advancement. One senior pharmacy tech. Drive through constantly broke down, and became frozen in cold weather. I felt I was paid too little, as I went to college for a year for pharmacy technician certification, diploma and license."
bad,"I come into work and my managers are lovely, however I feel that there is not much for me to do in general.  I feel bored, but stressed at the same time."
bad,"10-hour nights with no consistent break schedule"
bad,"Good environment nice workspace "
bad,The lack of compassion they pour upon employees is sad yet the customer should always be right. Management above store level is just pathetic. If you have an issure its brushed under the rug.
bad,I'm at work till Walgreens management that I worked with this horrible very demeaning picking on you always putting you down just a very hard place to work
bad,"My manager is great and tries to have a fun, less stressful environment, but with hours being constantly cut, hiring freeze and continuing theft, work isn't enjoyable to go into."
bad,Walgreen's bought the company I worked for and retained only a small portion of the management. It was a difficult transition for both Walgreen's and the employees that were kept. There were bad feelings toward those of us that were kept from both Walgreen's employees and management. The training received was inadequate. Within a fairly short amount of time almost all if not all of the employees that were kept were terminated.
bad,The overall environment of Walgreens was sad and lifeless. Everyone hated their job. I had to work every single holiday including my birthday regardless of if I had asked for it off or not. It was an easy and manageable job but not a stimulating or enjoyable one.
bad,A typical work day consisted of cashier handling and inventory stock. Management was not effective and fellow employees made the workplace culture a lazy and difficult environment to work in for the employees who actually did work. I would not want to give the company Walgreens a bad rep but this particular location needed a lot of improvement and the correct management skills to effectively demand the best results.
bad,Very hard to get time off to go to doctor. Having to compete daily for your desired schedule when the time comes to change schedules. Having to work every weekend and they are open 24 hours.
bad,"No challenges and nothing to look forward to on a daily basis. It's more of a push paper kind of job. They do have a bonus for goals. Not much of a place for advancement. Management has been there for many years and makes it hard for growth within the company. If you like a slower pace of a job, then this is for you."
bad,Good place to work for like a starting off job. Its a fun job the people around the work place are nice and around my age I get alone well with mostly every one in the work place.
bad,"A typical day at work is to help customers throughout the day, running the cash register, restocking merchandise, checking for outdated merchandise, and answering phones and directing the calls to the appropriate person, helping customers in photo as my time allows, and handling money, including cash, credit/debit cards, checks, refunds and sending Western Union funds."
bad,"they are just really expensive as a consumer and as far as working for them I didn't like it much, very stressful and the cashier does everything"
bad,Removal of HCT (nurse assistance) to help management a very busy walk-in clinic. Providers have a rotating work schedule for 2 weeks that allows for full days off.
bad,"great benefits  however, the management  staff was not organized and showed favoritism among the team. I would not reccommed any body to work there for the simple fact that they do not support education unless you are taking classes to benefit them as a company."
bad,I have enjoyed the customers they make it worth while to go to work every day. I would like to change out of the public sector and go into working in private settings with other employees. I have done retail work for 30 years and would like a change of just working in an office with interpersonal employees.
bad,"Your experience in Walgreens Pharmacy department depends heavily on your managers, for a pharmacy technician you can't advance, which is difficult to swallow because your Pharmacist will only be as good as their technicians allow them to be."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of stocking new items, giving the best customer service as possible, and making sure the store is presentable for the next day. I learned how to multitask with different customers and to sale suggestive products. Management told employees to do their tasks we as a team did everything. The hardest part of the job was the hours, their were a lot of employees working so it was difficult for everyone to have regular hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they needed, and inform them of what they ask, and mention other things they are most likely to love."
bad,I quit because management is unfair.  Co-workers are lazy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with co-workers and management.
bad,Working in the Bellevue office I was able to have a great work life balance. I could telecommute. My Co workers were amazing.
bad,Overall for for Walgreens was not what I expected.  I had little training and the training that was provided does not prepare you for what you really experience on the job.  It was hard balance work/life because the hours are all over the place and you get a 30 minute lunch break with no other breaks.
bad,It's very stressful not enough help and not getting paid what u deserve ..might as well work for fast food . I advise anyone who looking into retail pharmacy DON'T
bad,"Not enough money in it, but a friendly place to work.  A lack of labor (hours allotted for each store to use)  is way too low, and causes problems.  Then management doesn't know why there are problems in the store.  Hmm?"
bad,"Typically, I am all over the place. Every one and every task is never finished. Someone or something needs to be taken care of. Retail, I get it. But the never ending shifts, over worked and under payed feeling, it's tough. The managers are great, we are all friends but I do not feel like anyone gets praised enough for their hard work. Only critized when something is done wrong. The hardest part of the job is doing it all for practically nothing. Honestly, the best part of the job were the friends I made over the years that I work with."
bad,my personal review to Walgreen after a few years of experience is it lacks consistent training ability and preparedness for staff to be professional and ready to serve clients efficiently
bad,"Walgreens was my first job at age 16. Now at 21 I have been a pharmacy technician for 2 years. I appreciate this company for helping me gain knowledge in customer service and in the pharmacy but a retail job is not for me. People take advantage of you if you're a great worker and customers are horrible, some of them at least. There is no help from pharmacists or management. I do the work of 5 people and hardly ever leave when my shift is over and don't even get to go on break. Only have one day off because they don't want to train a new employee and I only make 10.75 an hour. As soon as I find aanother job opportunity I'm out of there."
bad,"The company of Walgreens has been around for a very long time and  stands for health and wellness, however they need to improve the process and way in which they train their employees."
bad,"There was nothing really good or bad about this place, it was really kind of lukewarm. Management was ok and understanding, staff was pretty cool. Definitely a good part-time position."
bad,I learned that people from other countries often do not blend well with cultural interfaces here in America and should open to modifying their cultural expectations before they take jobs outside their comfort zone.  I was completely unimpressed with the focus or lack there of on such a large project and rather disappointed in upper managements grip on the real end game.
bad,"Walgreen Pharmacy has you deal with patients, doctors, and insurance companies."
bad,"There was always something to do, but sometimes managing the employees when the store manager was out of the store was a hassle."
bad,"BEING A SMALL PLACE, WE HAD LOTS OF WORK, LITTLE"
bad,I worked the front register 7:00am until 3:00pm. I learned how to deal with different type of people. The management and coworker were pretty decent people. The hardest part of the job was stocking shelves and running a register at the same time. The enjoyable part was helping senior citizen and putting smiles on faces.
bad,The management is completely horrible. The corporation will screw you over without a second thought.
bad,"A typical day at work meant running the photo department, putting up the truck, working the grocery items, and working paper goods. I would say the co-workers some down to earth while managers acted like they were your teacher or principal. The hardest part of the job was doing photo and doing the truck and straightening the shelves before we left each night. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers of course."
bad,There are many good things as far as the benefits for the company. The corporate culture is just work and do what you are asked and we will keep you around. The employees work really hard and are not appreciated for the work that they do. Advancement is not prominent at the store level.
bad,"It used to be a better company when it was run by the Walgreens family.   Back then there was some loyalty from employees, middle and corporate managements.   Now many benefits have been cut to reduce costs.   Employees and store managements are all over worked with little hours in payroll to schedule for help.   Not the store managers faults!   Company made decision not accept Express Scripts and lost many customers to CVS and other pharmacies.   To make up for big lost in revenues company had to cut more costs.   Many assistant managers quite due to their pay cuts.   New name titles was created to replace old titles just to add more responsibilties with lower wages.   The company play lots of game with its employees and to store managements.   Store managements and employees are just doing the motions and staying on for the rides and no longer putting any dedications to their work like before.   Low morale work environment over all."
bad,"Assist an greet customers, cash handling, answer phones, merchandise, inventory, load/unload truck."
bad,"A typical day at work was to work the cash register, assist customers, greet customers, tidy up my area and stock shelves. I leaarned how to be patient with long lines and people who had certain attitudes. Managers waere nice and always came when you needed them. There wasn't a hard part of the job eveything you had to do came natural. The  most enjoyable part about the job was meeting new people and learning something new."
bad,"I was working there for almost 2 years.  Then they started cutting tech hours.  Since I was hired last that meant I would be the first to go.  Well there was an email sent out about a higher paying position.  Since I was qualified,I agreed to travel an hour and a half for one month where they needed a tech.  After a month, I went to the store with the higher paying position.  I worked there a week until the manager got back.  When I confronted him, he denied offering me the position."
bad,"A day at Walgreens involves opening the store and preparing for the day ahead. Starts out with cash management and balancing the books, then inventory control and counts. Planning out the day and delegating tasks. Checking in vendors, customer service. A lot of the day is spent multitasking. Have to know photo, pharmacy, need to be crossed trained in all aspects of the store. The hardest part of the job is training team members with the amount of time your given. Team members are kind of thrown into positions with minimum time training. They are constantly cutting hours and your expected to do more with less. What I love about the job is merchandising and executing a plan and see it come to fruition. I enjoy training when its an area I feel comfortable with."
bad,I am very greatful to have an oppurtintiy to work in the pharmacy through walgreens. Over the years i have come to realize how the company neglects the opinion of their employees. I am a very hard worker and i do not believe in quiting. I would like an oppurtunity to further my career knowledge and work in a different enviroment.
bad,"I work in the photo lab and there is way too many responsibilities put on this department.  The workers who are most productive are penalized with extra work.  The cosmetic department stands around doing nothing while photo department has to give front counter breaks and lunch along with numerous timely duties.  Another major issue is that cosmetics gets credit on their sales by whatever they ring up at their register no matter what it is.  Photo rings up all kinds of merchandise along with actual photo orders but do not get credit for anything that is not directly photo. This is so wrong.  Walgreens pricing practices are horrible.  Customers who have rewards cards still also have to clip coupons.  The employees most of the time have no idea what pricing is and customers get extremely angry.  Upper management is oblivious to reality.  We are all expected to greet every customer with ""Welcome to Walgreens"" and upon leaving ""Be Well"".  How insultingly hokey.  Honestly I don't know how this company has lasted this long with this agenda.  They are presently making more money than ever.  $60 per share.  This can't last."
bad,Assistant store manager for two Houston area retail locations
bad,"Probably the worst company I've ever worked for.  You pretty much get paid to have customers push you around.  Anything goes, and each store is different. There is hardly any consistency with management or rules on a store to store basis, so it's difficult to learn the basics. My training manager was rude, and demanding, and didn't seem to understand that he was 'training' me and that I wasn't an experienced store manager."
bad,"A typical day if your position was at the front end register was to ring up customers, answer customer questions by phone or in person, face front of the store near front end checkouts, and do additional tasks requested by store management. The hardest part of the job is to make every customer happy especially during the holiday season. My favorite part of my job was the customers since they made my shift a whole lot better."
bad,This work place is a very high stress job with little to no help from upper management. However if you put some effort into the job it is possible to surprise even yourself how much can be done in an 8 hour shift
bad,"Walgreens is currently going through a corporate restructure. Instead of management they created a new position called a store front leader(SFL). SFL's make much less than managers make but they do the same job. Walgreens is no longer hiring managers, only SFL's and they are forcing managers to take large pay cuts and become an SFL, get transferred, or get laid off. SFL's make little more money than employees. Because of this situation I feel that Walgreens is a good place to work at for college students because they work with your schedule well, but I do not see it as a career at all."
bad,"A day at work would be providing the best customer service and make the customer the happiest as possible. I make sure that I do the tasks of the day. Well, my coworkers are good workers and we always try to perform as great as possible but also we create a nice environment to accomplish the goals in a nice manner. The hardest part of the job is when I feel a lot pressure when unsatisfied costumer may behave in an improper way, for example, they may get violent. the best about this job is that has a flexible schedule and it is very convenient for me."
bad,Company is cut throat and willing to sacrifice employees to get the job done.
bad,"very demanding and hard to keep up with as a Paid Intern, as a Paid Intern you are very limited to what you can do, age is also a very limitng factor,"
bad,Woked 30 hours weekly caring for patients. Provided full-time benefit but was not happy with working every other weekend which affected my work-life balance
bad,"Everyone is out for themselves, they don’t care store managers get away with whatever they want, poor raises. Pto is okay, not too bad, they don’t schedule enough people at all for the customer volume"
bad,"I’ve been working here for a year & it’s been horrible. Between not following your set availability & the poorly trained management, this company is going downhill."
bad,"Pay is extremely low $10/hr, with horrible scheduling. They close at 10 and during the holidays they close at 12. Work is also not ideal, cleaning the restrooms almost everyday and putting all the dirty work on csa. Very high turnover rate. Also assistant manager is not fair with breaks. If your opening and it’s just you and manager at 7 they will make you wait until 2 pm when another employee arrives for you to take your break"
bad,hard stressful place to work with to much drama and lies and not enough working. People tended to slack off or were rude to fellow co-workers and sometimes even customers
bad,"If you've worked at retail then you know what to expect. There are career advancements if you work well. Some of my managers were good, some were absolutely dreadful to work with."
bad,"stressful work environment with high expectations and less staffing. management is horrible and biased, likes to blame staff about the goals not being achieved instead of being accountable."
bad,"Theft by customers was a common occurrence - some were recognized by more seasoned employees who knew what was going to be stolen: candy, small toys, OTC meds and more.  The location was in a poor location and parking by employees close to the building was recommended.  I had said in my interview that I was subject to back and leg pain but this was ignored.  I regret giving my notice hastily."
bad,"filled prescriptions, stocked inventory, processed insurance claims.-Prepared and processed medical insurance claim forms and records. "
bad,There was no interview process in my situation. My Rite Aid store was bought out by Walgreens. Transition was not easy and 6 weeks later is not any easier than the second day.
bad,"i dont know, i was just there for a month i guess the people were chill but dont listen to me bc i didnt actually work there I just did an externship there."
bad,"Worked there 5 years.  Management is difficult to deal with.  They drive you continuously irregardless of how fast you are working.  They are never satisfied.  Dont care about employees just the almighty dollar."
bad,"This use to be an awesome place to work but it has been slowly declining. I love working in the pharmacy and creating relationships with my patients. The job is honestly what you make it, but the company makes the managers not want to work."
bad,"4 shifts in I finally worked with the store manager,he had no time to let me finish my training nor help me with scheduling problems that arrived once I learned you were scheduled 3weeks out.  It's fine but let a newbie know so I can make real life work.i had two shift leaders,one was amazing he came from another store. He showed me everything that the main shift lead should have. It was a bother just getting my badge so I could actually work without assistance .  They don't have a cleaning schedule for their restrooms and clean it when it's needed that bothered me.  There was a blood stain in the ladies restroom for over a week. I wanted so bad to work at Walgreens because they take time and care for customers. But this store was nothing to be proud of and I know if I'm going to work somewhere I need to be proud of its employees and environment"
bad,"I worked in this company for over a decade, and terminated for very petty undocumented rules “that they say I violated”.  Walgreens in my experience doesn’t care about the well being of their employees. It’s all about the company success. I am just a number to them & other employees there. I dnt recommend this company if you have a choice. If you need to earn why not, but it’s not a promising career even a  job. I would not take my job here too serious because they can easily replace you. Yes, the company helped me to pay my bills, but in return they have my loyalty and hard working etiquette at work, but in the end they fired me for nonsense reason. I’m not bitter and I am happy where I am right now. I am just telling the truth and sharing a very important details regarding my experienced"
bad,So much to do so few hours! A lot of times you’re in the store with one other person or even alone.Upper management/corporate is only concerned about making money no care for customers or employees.
bad,The pay isn’t great. The won’t hire you full time because they don’t want to give you benefits. So it’s a decent job if you live at home & are still in school. If you have bills or are trying to accomplish anything; you’re better off finding a new job. The people are nice and caring but you can’t live off 30-20 hours or less every two weeks at 10$
bad,"I was hired with the understanding that I was a Beauty Consultant and what my role as a Consultant would be.  I quickly learned this wasn't just a Beauty Consultant job... I sold more non beauty products than anything. Covering the front register and stocking the whole store while I missed out on ""opportunities "" to engage with the beauty departments customers. The average customer knows what they want. They didn't want help with putting on makeup or suggestions. They go to the makeup counters for that experience. This position should be crossed off Walgreens jobs offered. It's a Drug Store. Where you have people buying alchohol at your so called Beauty Counter and selling more Wet N Wild products that don't meet your goals."
bad,Never enough staff pay wasn’t what it should be. They could have done way more got way more people and had better management the job is not that great of a job
bad,"Pay could be good if you are willing to work hard and work your way up to management. But with the continuous changes of the company they give zero care about their employees. If you don't like your job they will just find another newbie to take on your role."
bad,The job is a great started teaches you how annoying people can be and why you should get a good job that you do not need to be underpaid. And you can't make the joke that is under my pay grade.
bad,"Learned almost nothing in my short stint. it wasn't until I decided to leave that the store manager wanted to start training me."
bad,"It’s a good job to have while in high school or while in college, pay’s well enough to get by. Management could’ve been better when I worked there. The co workers were friendly."
bad,"Lots of over time in dedication to helping patients get their prescriptions filled thru either online or delivery services via Fedex, UPS or United States Postal Service."
bad,"Despite the rough ending with the gossipy managers, I liked Walgreens. My coworkers were nice, the work was easy, and the customers were almost always nice with frequent regulars making the day great."
bad,"The company's focus is clearly on profit and not the employees.  Healthcare options are poor, which is startling for a healthcare company.  Part of our annual review is dependent on volunteer participation, which is far more difficult for those of us with families and/or are low paid.  "
bad,"Walgreens , like most other retail pharmacies these days, is constantly under staffed. Every day the pharmacy is in a state of turmoil and confusion. The technology is constantly breaking down. The rules are  always changing. You will suffer"
bad,"I was with Walgreens for a few years. Within that time, I quickly realized that there were favorite employees that basically got away with murder and those, like myself, who weren't a favorite, did the majority of the work. The favorite employees were able to do pretty much as they pleased. It was a good place to work, but my final store with Walgreens was a place where communication was not used and I am not upset that I was terminated due to bogus rules."
bad,"It isn't that exciting of a job to work for. It is retail. Checking customers out is not that exciting of a thing to do. You also have to deal with managers that are not people persons. Always gonna be managers and coworkers who have the more prickly personality with the attitude. There are others who are more buddy like and easier to be around though. One thing that is bogus is how corporate makes us stay open on Christmas. Corporate seems greedy for money. Would be interesting if their idea backfired on them where they lost a ton of cash. I used to work at the location in Geneva, I recently transferred over to this location as it is much closer to home."
bad,When I began working here the management and corporate treated us well and showed employees respect and kindness. Since a change in management and corporate in late 2018 everyone is constantly stressed and threatened to lose their livelihood. It is unhealthy and miserable being in that kind of environment.
bad,"hours are random."
bad,"Walgreens screwed me out of money. I had my CPhT credential but i am coded as a DH. People who were coded as a pharmacy tech but had no credential behind there name was making more than me. This company will screw you if they get the chance. The pay sucks, and they take care of newer employees better than the ones that has been with the company for 5 plus years. This job is only good for high-school and college students. So apply at your own discretion."
bad,Pharmacists with Walgreens are ever tasked with doing more work with less help which leads to higher rates of burnout and poor customer satisfaction. Frequent evening and weekend staffing without reprieve makes for an unhappy work environment. People frequently call out sick in order to get time off from work.
bad,They cut hours to the bone even for senior staff in the summer and make you use all your vacation hours instead of using it for vacation just to supplement your income. I'm ending my career as SR. Compounding Pharmacy Technician because I was the last Sr. Tech that hadn't left last summer and was promised if I stayed that this year I would be guaranteed my 40 hours. This promise wasn't kept... so bye bye. No lunch or breaks and the harder you work and succeed they understand they can get away with less staff for the same results. No point.
bad,"There wasnt much work/life balance the schedule was inconsistent. Found myself working a week of overnights, had a 2 day break and then worked 11 days in row."
bad,"I learned a lot, including how to work under stress. its not the worst but i Wouldn't recommend as a long term job. Just get the experience and go. the pay also isn't all that"
bad,I am glad that I worked here because I found out very quickly that I do not fit into retail pharmacy at all. I am not ok with customers being about to torture me at work.
bad,It’s awful pay awful managers no hours and no one to cover shifts because of lack of employees. comapnay is going down the shiter. Not worth getting promoted cause they will expect more for not great pay
bad,"It is not enough technicians and it always struggle to finish job."
bad,"I'm sure this was probably just my specific location, but we were constantly understaffed due to call-outs and it appeared that my manager not only played favorites but had little idea on how to manage his employees. There were several times that I was left with a customer who was very upset and often threatening me, while I called for a manager's assistance. "
bad,"customer service "
bad,This one I worked at was open 24 hours but was very stressful due to some of the customers that came in and always caused problems. Also management didnt do too much of a good job supervising and delegating orders.
bad,Going from the Classic small town pharmacist where you knew your patients by name and knew what they needed Walgreens totally changed the culture of pharmacy to put a store with a drive through on every other corner and turning itself into a pill mill with less tech help and more of an emphasis on metrics over patient care.
bad,Enjoyable and Was Good for the most part but the job was harder than it looked but I accepted the challenge anyway each day it became easier and stuff for me to comprehend what was going on with each aisle and stock
bad,"Working at Walgreens was fun. Some of the staff was phenominal others were just tolerated. Some of the Store Managers didn't belong in their position, so they were just respected because of their position."
bad,The company overworks its employees while adding on more and more tasks. The corporation does not seem to care about the well being of its employees just the bottom line. Not having enough staff can be very dangerous to patients.
bad,Your days are busy.  If you have good technicians it is easily managed.  There does seem to be a high turnover or at least that was my experience at my location.
bad,"A typical day at my job consisted of getting yelled at and criticized by management every single shift. I would ask questions if I didn't understand something and it was always answered with a rude tone and attitude. The management doesn't take kindly to new ideas, and they are very cliquey. I would've loved my job a lot more had I felt like I was apart of a team rather then the outsider. I worked here for a year and absolutely dreaded coming into work because of the disrespect from management and the attitudes they would give to customers as well."
bad,"I met some very hardworking people at this entity and many of those I served in the community were very receptive of my individuality, duality and professionalism."
bad,Not a good company on the distribution level. Upper management is very demanding and negative towards lower management. Balance of work load and team members are not equal. Team members worked too hard with long hours.
bad,"This used to be a family owned business you could be proud to work for.  It is slowly becoming just the poster child for corporate america.  Leadership says one thing, but demands the other.  They tell you it's not about the numbers, but deep down that is all it is about.  There is no incentive to move up.  They are taking bonuses and raises away."
bad,Walgreens was a great start when you are just graduating from college and need to pay your bills. It became harder to adjust to hours when certain individuals did not come to work and you had to cover someone else's shift.
bad,"•	Followed Agile (Scrum) project management procedures."
bad,"Although i left on good terms, i left. I was hired as an ASMT (Assistant Store Manager Trainee) externally, no prior pharmacy experience. Upon arriving, i was notified by most of my peers that they turned down positions similar to mine, for reasons i discovered on my own. The schedules can be absolutely ridiculous, if you have children i would not recommend a management position at this company. Your daily expectations can be very overwhelming as well."
bad,I only worked here for the flexibility while in nursing school. I would never recommend working at Walgreens or any retail pharmacy. It's very very high stress with extremely low pay.
bad,The employees are very unprofessional. Make sure you lock up your items because some things will be broken or stolen. The management will not replace your items. The customers make the job easier with their hospitality. The management expects you to work multiple jobs that is under your pay range.
bad,"-stressful work environment"
bad,Its really nice working at walgreens doing what i do there and interacting with the customers but the managment & shift leads are un kind & can be very disrespectful
bad,"Very fast-paced work environment. Your day starts as soon as the windows of pharmacy roll up. On a good day at some locations you fill between 200-400 prescriptions. Rough day 450+. I have enjoyed working with some great co-workers and managers, lack of hours has created a lack of help and downfall in employee moral lately."
bad,"not enough hours and have to deal with rude customers."
bad,"Working at Walgreens has taught me a lot about myself. i grew as a social person and i was able to connect with customers as regular people."
bad,This is nothing against walgreens the company well besides the heavily outdated equipment they have us use. For example the computer screens used for cataloging information dont have a window its all console commands. This is more for the people it that come in thieves and drug addicts. So basically with no security personnel in place you better be ready to jump the counter or lose your job.
bad,management is poor they are unorganized and care little about the customers and the store. Items are constantly being stolen and they turn the other cheek as if they don't care. I am a very caring person and also very productive at work so to see people just be able to walk right out with items rubs me the wrong way also it sends the wrong message to the paying customers. there is no onsite security and police take hours to respond to a call and charge billions to come out
bad,"They have great benefits, insurance is great compared to other jobs, you get employee stock bonus, but not much room for improvement since the company is now saturated."
bad,Certain events such as Superbowl and MLK day had large amount of call offs to the automated line. On the day of MLK and post Superbowl you were guaranteed to do a 12 hour day
bad,Basically orders for different stores are made in 10 hours or longer depending on mechanical issues and amount of product stores want. Time seems to go by fast when paying attention.
bad,Productive and stressful sometimes when you go to work and you don know what time you getting off . You have to work until it is finished but the cant work you know longer than 12 hours.
bad,"Work in the store, in all departments but pharmacy. Help customers find what they are looking for and check them out in any area. Print out customers photos."
bad,"This is a good job for people in need of a job, but the pay versus benefits are not good enough to make it on your own. They will sometimes work with you. Overall the company sees you as expendable no matter what quality of work you provide."
bad,"Limited scope of practice, worked mostly by yourself at the clinic which meant you handled not only patient care but cleaning, ordering supplies, insurance, etc."
bad,Pharmacy was never appropriately staffed with too much emphasis on volume with patient safety never being of most importance. Staff was constantly in flux so it was hard to provide efficient service.
bad,"Micromanagement at its worst. Although it paid well they treated many employees like criminals. I loved my immediate manager and the travel manager was very fair. However, they promised a full time job in Helena. Turned out they just wanted a travel pharmacist."
bad,"Walgreens was decent to work for. Each person in charge treated employees differently. Some better, some worse. It was a job that I appreciated very much."
bad,Got the job through my school was a good company to start with but after 10  here’s the copy is not the same anymore They are more into the customers.
bad,"If I was told to do something, I was either too slow, or so fast that I was efficient enough. So I would have to go back over my task again. I was also criticized for my condition that I could not help."
bad,"Adecco is ok.  They are prompt in compensation, clear in instructions,  as a contract house, they're ok.  As a contract house, they are ok.  I don't have anything else to say."
bad,"Typical day of work consisted of stocking the store, cleaning the store and helping customers. I learned that I never want to work in a drug store environment again. The management was terrible. One of my mangers was fired because he was calling older woman that worked there inappropriate names to the other employees. The hardest part was having to deal with management. The best was being able to socialize with people."
bad,"Ya, its Walgreens. Busy, understaffed, few resources. I felt like I needed at least two more bodies to get the required tasks complete, but it is a learning experience"
bad,"Walgreens had me work long, stressful hours with no breaks for most of the time. But my coworkers were amazing and really cared about me. Sadly I feel as though the company did not care for any of us"
bad,Depending on you location you may or may not be as busy. I worked at a location where the volume was low so it was like you were able to complete your weekly tasks in one shift.
bad,"i would come in to work, clean, face my items in my isle, and restack. i would help the lady's in the makeup section, with restacking, and placing new items. i would also greet customers."
bad,Only one cashier. Other departments may or may not help. Never met a pharmacist that liked working there. Alot of annoying customers that never read the price tag.
bad,If you were a good worker you got sucker into picking up the slack for other employees and managers. It is high volume with minimal help from management.
bad,okay place to work for. it was a full time job but only worked there because i was in high school. I was waiting for another job at a nursing home to open up.
bad,"For a retail job, this one is not the worst. The management staff can really make or break the experience. If you have a rude manager, it just makes the whole place bad."
bad,"Over the years the company gets worse and worse. More work, less people. It's difficult enough to deal with customers who are always upset, but when your company doesn't have your back it's worse. Two fields that are incredibly stressful, pharmacy and retail."
bad,A typical day at a 24 hours pharmacy can be very stressful. I have learned insurance and data entry. The hardest part of the job is the low salary with the amount of work
bad,"I worked at two different Walgreens and the first one had amazing management, but my co-workers were lazy and a lot of the work fell on to me. This allowed me to show that I could work and I moved up to a shift lead position. I took an overnight position at a different and when I asked to move back to day shift at my old store they said okay, but they missed the time window to allow me to move back multiple times. I eventually quit as I was treated unfairly and made to do more work than everyone as we all wrote down what we had to do and what we did that day on paper."
bad,"I was a store front lead in which duties included money management, inventory management, helping out in pharmacy and opening and closing the store. With this position you have to have a license to work in the pharmacy."
bad,"Ran cash register"
bad,It was work. It was stressful and all guidance was handed top-down to stores with no potential for variance. It seems as if your opinion or stress of work didn't matter
bad,steady work did not care for prejudice from male hr rep. leads were lazy. supervision is strictly by the book . manager was very professional on one end.
bad,The job was alright the customers are rude when they want there medication and the management always think the customers are right. If you need a job to to just get bye apply
bad,Not enough techs employed. Stressful at times when there is not enough working throughout the day. Benefits are excellent and the managers are always willing to work with you.
bad,"I was fresh out high school when I worked here. 40 hours were hard to come by; it worked by seniority. Great job for a college student or 2nd part time job, easy work,"
bad,"A typical day at Walgreens pharmacy is getting yelled at by old people who don't understand how their insurance or any insurance for that matter works and have lost all social skill along the long road to seniority. As you quickly glance at the growing line and the elderly customer you have been explaining that they've already picked up this medication last week, the pharmacist asks you why someone is dropping off a prescription and your response will be 'i don't know"" every single time but they ask the same question fully aware you do not personally know the person who is dropping off a prescription or their reasons for bringing the prescription to YOUR pharmacy. There is a solution, as long as you have people who know how to work efficiently by your side then you will be great but as we all know you cant choose your coworkers. Management makes a big difference in Walgreens. I've worked with managers and teams that are great and we all flow with each other and I've worked with teams who had weak links at important positions. it really depends and I will say I have learned plenty about business and people having worked for Walgreens."
bad,"There are lots of good people working for this company and I was lucky to be working with a gread district manager and a very supportive pharmacy supervisor.  Unfortunately, the upper management lack integrity when it comes to employees and making sound proactive business decisions.  I have seen many great and experiences pharmacists leave the company or get laid off due to the current poor working environment."
bad,"Slow and boring. No room for advancement or pay increase. Could not schedule enough hours for me. I'm an adult and have bills, I don't live with my parents."
bad,Members of management felt they were exempt from certain things. Senior employees should need to be held accountable for lack of teamwork that can sometimes occur.
bad,"dont feel appreciated, overworked, reduced hours which means the current employees have to pickup the slack. lack of training and preparedness for now programs"
bad,"If anyone wants to work at Walgreens its a fine place to work at. Just try to avoid the night shift in most areas, but if you really need the hours night shift is the way to go. From my brief experience working day i was barely making 23 hours and that was on a good week. So i asked howI could increase my hours and i was meet with option the to work grave. Not a bad idea if it were not for the low income area the Walgreens was situated in. So every once in awhile i was had to chase away thieves and drug addicts who would make this Walgreens there stomping ground. It Just gets annoying that you can't do anything and even if its in self defense there is a high chance you will get fired."
bad,"When I began with Walgreens, they were all about the customers and serving them. Toward the end of my stay there the attitude changed more toward having a stale environment void of individual personalities."
bad,"Shows what a working in the real world is like. Quick paced, harsh environment. Each day is a different experience that show what the public is like.."
bad,Perfect opportunity for those wanting a job to work through school.  Company is flexible for those with a second job or school.  Not a stressful work environment
bad,Working here with bad management was tough. It's a fast pace job and very demanding. Your customer service skills need to be great but i loved helping others.
bad,"Providing friendly, courteous and efficient service to customers."
bad,"Once you are on midnights you are stuck there.  They are not good about scheduling vacations or promotions, etc.  Some of the supervisors were not at all good to work with or for."
bad,"Very fast paced with little help.  Must run register if short on help.  Drive thru plugs work flow.  Micromanages.  If you are not a favorite, you will be placed in a store for failure.  A 30 minute lunch, but most Rphs just left 30 min early.  The store managers are super special...they must be called Mr or Ms.......everyone else by our first name."
bad,They do not give you enough people for the amount of work that needs to be accomplished in a day. Very busy and need to be trained well to keep up with the fast paced enviroment.
bad,The managers start and keep the drama up. Two were caught beeing inappropriate in the freezer and still have they jobs. One of them is dating most of the girls there and they fight about it. The Pharmacy manager is a monster and non of the Pharmacy staff like her but they deal with her anyway.
bad,"The manager at the store I worked at was awesome, but the other employees left a lot to be desired. They tended to talk about everyone and put everyone down."
bad,"High energy job that can sometimes be fulfilling, but is mostly dull and soul sucking. Customers pick away at your patience and management tends to have unrealistic expectations. Little room for meaningful advancement"
bad,The company doesn't look at how hard you work and offer you a raise of any kind.  If you want to move up in the company you have to ask to do so.  Didn't feel like the amount of work I did reflected in my pay or in my position in the company and it did not feel like the company appreciated my time and work I put in.
bad,This is not a career. Its a great place to work if you still live at home with no major financial responsibilities. The photo department is the most fun.
bad,"I know that management is different than it was when I was employed there; however, the manager I worked under was nice. The store was clean, and I was bored, but not overworked."
bad,"the job changed a lot in the 4 years I was there. Cooperate was sold to Boots and they have an entirely different focus, A very hard job due to customers."
bad,In this particular job you need to find the environment that is best for you. In some locations the leaders are not the best and don't exactly know how to help the employee's within the work space. Also in some locations the people that lead may lie about promotions just for their own selfish reasons and leave you very confused.
bad,"Customers are pleasant.  There is pretty much all new staff.  The job consists of stocking, inventory, minor janitorial duties, & cashiering."
bad,"Had to go through a bunch of video training that I never really used. My boss was pretty uptight but it was just a part time job in high school so it was tolerable. Most of my teenage friends worked in fast food or grocery stores and it was definitely better than that. Sometimes on Sundays it would be slow enough that I could read magazines behind the counter, which was nice."
bad,Same as any other pharmacy great people but poor hours. just worked as an intern for a month. That's it. great great great
bad,"Hate that it's open every day of the year. Stressful job, poor pay, no room for advancement. Ridiculous expectations from management."
bad,Its a very good company but there isnt a lot of room for growth and they may not offer you your choice of major in my case Human Resources. As much as I learned from this opportunity I would not pursue any future opportunities with this employer.
bad,Wouldn't get promoted because I don't know the right people or haven't waited in line long enough. Skill set doesnt matter.
bad,"There wasn't much room for growth, in this company. I enjoy working but it changed my view on working in retail, would not recommend."
bad,The Pharmacist are often working in under staffed environment for the work they are expected to do. Technicians in pharmacy are under valued by store managers.
bad,"Good starting job if you are in high school or just need something that is manageable along with school. Flexible work hours, fun work place, pay is decent."
bad,It was okay. Working at Walgreens you need a lot of patience with thr customers. The managers also are very cautious of your work.
bad,"Not the most inviting workplace, but you know what will be asked of you from the minute you step through the doors. If you are reliable, show up to work on time and do what is asked of you then you will do just fine at this company."
bad,The scheduling was great. The co-workers are great. The company itself takes advantage of its employees by making them work every holiday without proper compensation.
bad,Just got drama and people always looking down at you. Never being trained properly for the job. co workers were always avoiding me and were never helpful.
bad,"a typical work day consisted of helping customers , stocking shelves and changing prices to the markdown prices. the most enjoyable part are your coworkers. least enjoyable part was the maintenance and cleaning of the workplace."
bad,"Not a good place if to work for the long term. There is no moving up unless you want to be a manager. It was okay for the most part, but a lot of work for not much pay."
bad,"this company does not value its employees to pay them enough to be able to live."
bad,"The distribution center in Pa don't care about their people like the one in Texas it was more like a slave camp for non white's if you were the kind that spoke up even if you did your job good and right they found away to get rid of you,"
bad,"i'm glad i don't work there anymore. it's a chapter of my life i choose to forget about. lots of poorly managed employees, favoritism, and managers mistreating/taking advantage of hard-working employees."
bad,"did the same thing everyday walked around, put stuff back in there places, clean and talking to people. it became very boring for me"
bad,"ok for part-time work, not permanent meet a lot of people management okay hours get cut sometime not a career job i didnt stay that long didnt learn much"
bad,This was a real different type of company I started at an CPO operations location that was not well organized so it was rough starting off then I finished working from home
bad,I learned a lot in the year I worked for walgreens. I started as a csr and moved to photo specialist and that was the best job i ever had.They also was able to work with my schedule.
bad,"Was once a good company to work for.  It's all about the numbers, even in the pharmacy.  Profit before patient safety.  Proof: Experienced pharmacists being replaced by inexperienced pharmacists, corporate-wide."
bad,"working here, you really get treated like the bottom of the food chain. really have to learn how to keep your temper and watch out for mystery shoppers."
bad,"i would run a register and help customers and clean and stock shelves.....print pictures ....customers service"
bad,"Stocking shelves as my position as a stocker, then I had to run the register as a postion as a cashier.   Then I had to assist customer in purchases with inquiries etc, as my position as a sales associate.   I had three postions with one pay rate which was minimum wage"
bad,"While the pharmacy was very disorganized, the fellow employees were very welcoming and kind. Though there weren't enough employees during shifts to keep up with the customers"
bad,It was good at first but the manager didn't care about his employees if it came down to taking responsibility for something.
bad,Helping customers find products and ringing on the register. Understanding products to assist customers with their needs.
bad,"I used to love coming to work every day. I love my job. I love making customers happy and seeing them smile just makes my day. I recently moved to South Dakota."
bad,This is an okay place to work. Met some great people along the way. It would be a good place to start or for a students first job.
bad,"Can be scheduled any day at any time. Can't control your schedule and you never can have just a set schedule unless you have been with the company for many years. The pay is horrible, especially if you have been with the company for a while because you can only make so much since they put a cap on incomes."
bad,"There are a lot of things that are disorganized here. Nothing is ever the same for too long, things and rules constantly change. There is a lot of favoritism. The 'lucky ones"" seem to get good opportunities. Other than that the pay is good."
bad,"I appreciate Walgreens for getting me started with my career in Pharmacy, but dislike how they trained me to treat 'patients'"
bad,"As far as drug store/retail/grocery stores go it was a fine place to work. There was very little stress. Not a lot to get excited about, but if you want a pay check this is a place to work at."
bad,"The company was wonderful years ago, but has gone down hill. The pay now is terrible and the insurance keeps going up. The company is firing people left and right, even those who have need there for decades."
bad,"Great work place with supportive employees. It's all about customer service everyday. It is a good place to grow in understanding a retail job. Hardest part about this job is understand that customers have to be right all the time. Its sad to think people actually speak horrible to our staff and employees and get away with it. That's the hardest part to deal with in retail, knowing you have to smile and be cool when customers lash out at you for no reason at all. The most enjoyable part about this job is helping people that need it and helping them understand things they didn't before. The best feeling is helping someone in need."
bad,"Working in photo was always busy. You had to take care of the customers in your department as well as the on the sales floor and the front of the store. Responsible for inventory in almost all the store as well as cooler/freezer and stockroom maintenance. They gave too much of a responsibility for the wage they give you. Co-workers were always eccentric. Each having their own personality which was cool because it showed a sort of ""family"" presence to the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you were able to help someone out that really needed it and they showed appreciation. The hard part was knowing that the amount of work that was given at times depending on the task list and they still expected you to be done even if you were assisting customers even though they said they come first but they should wait....they couldn't make up their minds on what us to do."
bad,people are nice love the atmosphere. manager just doesn't communicate well. shows favortisum. very cold in the office
bad,As a Photo Tech. I enjoyed interacting with customers and processing their photos. Some managers were very pleasant to work with and made the long nights go faster.
bad,Long hours with customers yelling at and cursing you because their order was messed up by someone at a pharmacy or warehouse .  The supervisors are NOT trained nor are they very helpful.
bad,"I liked making the customers smile, but at the end of the day, I was just another employee. I applied thinking and being told that the Walgreen's crew was like family, but my supervisor never learned my name. The only time she got it right was when she was scolding me."
bad,"providing customer service dealing with cash and customers and dealing with disgruntled customers, management is decent co workers are nice"
bad,"Being given to many task and not able to finish them. Trying to achieve your best, but it was never good enough. Scheduling you morning noon or night and the hardest part was being scheduled all day on Thanksgiving and Christmas not being able to spend it with your family."
bad,Customers are too demanding and act like you owe them something. They are very impatient. Your rarely have enough tech help so you have to   try to be a pharmacist and a tech at the same time.
bad,It is a fast paced work environment which I prefer. Most co-workers are friendly. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this job is providing a customer service experience which creates loyal and regular customers and lasting friendships.
bad,Hard workers and pharmacists are always there to help.  Great place to work if you enjoy working with customers and enjoy helping people
bad,"The place was really flexible with hours when I was going to college. Low pay, Customers aren't always the best. Had amazing coworkers. "
bad,"I worked at Walgreens for almost 5 years and almost everything changed and made it hard to work there. on a daily basis I ran the cash register stocked shelves, greeted customers, I was also a pharmacy technician"
bad,"Typical Day is reviewing of prescriptions (data/product), administering various immunizations, offering medication consultation (OTC/prescription), taking in voicemail and new prescriptions from other medical personnel."
bad,"16 hour days with little to no break"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of point of sales operation, stock, revisions, photo developing and much more. Over the years I learned how to communicate with others as well learn how to deal with different ethics. My co-workers were amazing we all worked together as a team. Management from my point of view could of possibly showed stronger skills, communication. The hardest part of working for Walgreens was learning how to adjust to constant changes within the store."
bad,"Assisted customers in finding their beauty products"
bad,"They are going through some major changes over the next few months. But, overall an okay company to work for"
bad,"I did not enjoy working at this place due to poor management. It didn't matter how hard you worked, or what ideas your gave to help improve the store, management already had their favorites and those favorites got by doing the minimum."
bad,"Walgreens has been a good company for me to start my pharmacy career with; however, after six years I am ready for a change.  I thrive in challenging situations, but the lack of help allowed in the pharmacy budget makes good patient care difficult.  I am constantly running and different directions and focusing on multiple things at once.  Even with the odds stacked against me I continue to make drug utilization review and patient focused care a priority.  I am ready for a job in which I focus all of my attention on the task at hand and delivering the best healthcare I can, whether that be in patient care or hospital care."
bad,"I come in, fill the cooler, work on the photo department developing and getting orders ready, fill the water and drinks, paper towels and toilet paper. I checked people out, and did go backs, did facing and interacted with customers."
bad,"Pay was was not equivalent to the signifcant amount of job duties."
bad,"I enjoy going to work because I am actually a peoples person. Some people can try and be hard on you sometimes but, I can work under pressure as long as I am in a professional environment I have the ability to do anything. I love work no matter what."
bad,"was pretty laid back and easy, dealt with tons of customer's and figured out what suited their needs.  I also stocked items and labeled prices."
bad,already stated this good people i worked with bad cutting hours
bad,"My workday typically started at 8:00am and ended at 4:30pm, however if I worked the late shift it started at 2:00pm and ended at 10:30pm. I worked in the photo lab as an assistant, helping develop peoples photos and film and problem shooting the machines that did so. I also was responsible for running the front cash register and stocking the shelves everyday we received a shipment of store products."
bad,"It was pretty good. I worked at the beauty section, grocery and photo."
bad,"When I started working for this company I was very young, I had the opportunity to move up within the company very fast. There was always something to learn. However, as time changed the company changed, if it were't for my some of my coworkers and store manager I would have given up a while ago"
bad,"A topical day at work is coming in with everyone ready to jump in and start working on refills, Intake  Coordinate calling for morning meeting to let everyone know what on the calendar for the day, any new in coming patients are discussed, any new devices we are getting in, etc. Our management tean on site are working managers, they are in the IV room, in the warehouse working right along with you. My coworkers in the Pharmacy are family,  their are my sisters and brothers, we  get along great, from helping each other,  going to lunch together. The hardest part of my job is the lost of one of our patients. The most enjoyable part of my job is the patients."
bad,"no life balance while in management, work all holidays, not appreciated, cut our pay by 5.00 an hour, not family oriented anymore,"
bad,"Worked there long enough, time for a change. Little to no support by middle management.  Too much control by store managers."
bad,Walgreens has great pay and advancement from within. There are more locations to move within and advance.
bad,Manager's expectation is too high while they lack in training. I find this place as a toxic environment. Majority of my co-workers are negative and back stabbers.
bad,"I handled calls dealing with several departments within the Walgreens Corporation.  As such, some could feel stressed by the pressure of needing to be skilled in a variety of subjects within the different departments in order to be of satisfactory assistance to the customer.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed the fast paced environment of being able to assist the customer with all of their needs and concerns."
bad,Busy store that I work to and pay is not great. Walgreens company is ok but not for an career.
bad,"It was ok working there, but there are some shady people that work there also."
bad,need to stay focused 100% out of time. Customers keep you on your toes for sure.
bad,"Prepare medications under the direction of a pharmacist. May measure, mix, count out, label, and record amounts and dosages of medications."
bad,"I loved the people that I work with and the customers. Thats where the good things end. It took almost 2 years to be placed in the posistion that was promised to me. We had nearly 30 people come and go from the time that I started including complete management change 3 times. It was near the time that I was getting ready to have my weightloss surgery and corperate postponed it because of a technical issue. They didnt give the insurance company the proper info in regards to requirements until a week before surgery. I would have to wait 6 months longer. The problem is though that at the beginning of the year they made us switch insurance. I would now have to wait even longer. During this time they elimitated a posistion and also gave FAR more responsiblites to the Photo Departnment. between our daily photo responsibilities we also had to give breaks to the front cashiers, stock, unload truck, do out dates, for cooler, freezer, and all other food items on top of the numerous shelf resets and monthly date checks. garbages for the whole store, inventory and an lot of other things that were not our responsibility before. No extra time to do these new jobs and no pay increase."
bad,I totally enjoy interaction with  employees and assisting in thier benefits within the pharmacy
bad,"Everyone that I work with is like my family, I love them! The regular customers that come in are great as well! The management is okay. I feel like they walk all over me, I'm like the backup! The best part about my job is helping customers pick out new make-up and seeing their face light up with excitement and joy, just like they are excited to try something new. It's a great feeling when I make someone's day."
bad,"very poorly run, bad customer service, rude employees, they treat you like they just don't care"
bad,"Its always non stop busy, the customers are rude and horrible, the staff is easy going and so is management. The hardest part of the job is keeping hours and the most enjoyable part is that I get to go home at the end of the day."
bad,"Most days you feel drained of life. The easiest part is being like a machine and the hardest part is pretending to be human. You do get paid money for this, however."
bad,"Long boring hours behind the register"
bad,"The different functions keep me learning and able to do anything in the store.... Holidays hectic but time went quickly,,, coworkers mage the job even better"
bad,"This was the job that made me decide I did not want to go to pharmacy school. It was incredibly stressful being on my feet all day working with people who are already not in the best mood. I am a  huge people pleaser and with this job, it felt impossible to accomodate everyone, everyday the way they requested. I felt like I was just thrown in without a whole lot of on the job training, so after a few months, I still felt like the underdog and not where I should be at that point. This accounts for the hardest part of that job. I did greatly enjoy working with medicine though, and learning about how it works in the body."
bad,Love the customers and co workers. Do not care for the management style.
bad,"Lots of things to do, no boring days. Keep everything documented and keep it on file. Nice to work with co-workers but to nice to people who strike you at the back. Hardest part is to satisfy the management and enjoyable part is satisfying customers."
bad,"Greet costumers, block and organize store, and work on the register."
bad,I mostly just filled medications and did some data entry. the coworkers were nice for the most part. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with some people that were not very friendly.
bad,"A typical day at work for me consists of customer service duties, cashier duties, cleaning duties, and sales. I've learned a lot at my current job such as health care tips and procedures, time management, how to read charts and tables pertaining to sales numbers and goals, and most of all how to provide excellent customer care and service. I have a wonderful management team that I feel comfortable confiding in. I love my coworkers. They really get me through difficult times at work. I have such a wonderful bond with all of them. We're really a good team. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the low employee morale. As an employee, Walgreens as a company doesn't really give me any encouragement or motivation as a worker to go above and beyond. The best part of my job hands down is my customers. I get to interact with so many different wonderful people everyday and I love it. They really make work enjoyable for me."
bad,"stress out, to many empolyees on one shift, and less employees on another shift."
bad,You come in contact with a very broad spectrum of people and you just have to know how to handle anything that comes your way including major multitasking when others don't perform.
bad,"filled prescription all day long"
bad,"As a customer service rep, you are mostly alone in the front, working by yourself, which can be dangerous in some situations. "
bad,Getting to know and work with different people was definitely helped shape me into the person that I am today. The management team also mad my job much easier and therefore I was able to be more efficient at whatever task I was assigned to. 
bad,"Expected to do everything, all at once."
bad,"typical day depends on which department you work in. you either do phone sales, customer service, refills or sales support. no parts of the job are enjoyable and you will feel underpaid. co-workers are okay but some of them will turn on you and lie for no reason."
bad,I am nice easy to work with. I'm always on time and I just love to work
bad,"A typical day of work at walgreens would be processing customers photo orders, taking inventory of all my products, building displays for items that went on sale. I learned alot about the responsibility of a lead of a department. My co-workers were great to work with, never had any issues with management or supervisors always got along with everyone. The hardest part of the job was shift changes."
bad,if you enjoy retail management then this place would be a great place to start.
bad,The co-workers were fun and friendly. The management was poor.
bad,Here I established my sales skills and got involved with the world of customer service.
bad,"I learned a lot about teamwork and delegating with this company. Upper management created too much stress but was manageable. I also learned how to motivate people to be productive. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was meeting all the new people, customers and employees."
bad,"Walgreens may be a good place for some people, but not for me."
bad,I've been working for a year and coworkers are excellent. Its not always busy but sometimes it got crazy because is only one tech working with Pharmacist. Some customers are nice and educated but others are nasty.
bad,"cash register, handling moey, dealing with customers, stocking shelves, answering phones, costomic counters, cleaning"
bad,i did my intern at walgreens
bad,"This company has a poor work/life balance. They do not close for holidays so get ready to work christmas day, thanksgiving, easter, etc. Top management is out of touch with actually working with the customers and has unrealistic expectations."
bad,My job is somewhat okay I'm not complaining at all I really thank god but its time for something better and advance. A typical day a work is people contantly ask for the restroom that means I have to stop what I am doing and go open the restroom for them because there are codes on them. I've learned at this job is to keep a strong and open mind and great personality also to be helpful as possible.
bad,"The pharmacy has undergone many changing since the beginning of the year. The script count is down which means in turn hours have been substantially decreased as well. A typical day the pharmacy does 200 scripts. I have learned how to talk and communicate with patients, other medical professionals, and co-workers in a productive way."
bad,i only worked here a couple of months. and it was ok i got to meet a lot of nice people
bad,Most days start off slow but have lots of things to do the most that i learn everyday is how to interact with different customers most of the assistant managers avery good poeple and work very hard and are good at what they do. There very few of my co-workers that work hard so do nothing and get a lot of recognition and others do a lot like my self and get nothing in return. The hardest part of my job is trying to get some many things done at once i have to run y photo lab take care of customers and do whatever my co-workers didn't do and at the same time i always have a very large reset or revision to do that had to be done by hte end of the ellk that doesn't usually get done on time because of the work load. The most enjoyable part though is closing time.
bad,Pretty easy to work here. Overall the people are pretty nice.
bad,"Working at walgreens quickly became a mindless job.  My coworkers were very nice, but the enviroment was slow paced.  There were such few workers there, that you had to shape your environment yourself"
bad,"Walgreens has changed tremendously. They now seem to focus on its managers vs it’s employees. There is no care. If managers support their employees, the employees are happier the morale is high, and customer service is out the roof."
bad,"For anyone looking for part-time work, it's not that bad of a place to work. Management always tries to work with everyone and have been very supportive. For people who like helping others, it can provide a great opportunities. However, anyone looking for employment here should be very aware that corporate very rarely gives any information on changes made to there policies or business practices. This can lead to both frustrated employees and customers."
bad,My store is way too busy to be understaffed and traffic is crazy. Training for Pharmacy Technician was okay and there’s so much they want you to know without really going through it fully. I may transfer stores after I come back from maternity leave or just switch to different company . It’s not worth it.
bad,this job is good for youths entering the work force. Gives a overall lesson in the work force and teaches young adults how to coordinate and organize work duties and tasks.
bad,Love working there because of the coworkers and managers are extremely friendly and feels like family. Only con i have about it is how the company doesnt pay any importance to theft.
bad,When it rains to hard the system shuts down and there is no one to call.  You have to just wait. Customers are pretty cool about it.  For this company to have bought Rite Aide they should have invested more into the infrastructure. The training is supposed to be a month or so they crammed it into a week or so.  Over all the employees and management are great the system just seems to be unorganized  and unstable.
bad,"Shift times are completely up to your manager and you are given no control over them. Often you will end up working consistent 10-12 hour shifts on minimum wage, and most of the time alone on your designated position (cashier, etc.)"
bad,"waiting on customers, stocking shelves, assisting customers with finding the right product. the most enjoyable part of the job was stocking it was something I loved to do."
bad,"When I initially started working for this company I liked it. I was mostly just happy to have a job. Everyone was very professional and took the job seriously. As the years went on management began to deteriorate along with the employees. I felt like each year they expected us to do more and more tasks, but no increase in pay. I would clean the bathrooms, I got shopping carts, I changed the outside garbages, and sometimes mopped the floor. And this was all done if you were in the photo department, not to mention all the other tasks you had to accomplish by the end of the night. It was exhausting and definitely not worth the pay. If this is a short-term job for you I would go for it especially if you're on the register or in cosmetics. But I wouldn't recommend this job as the long haul and I was there for 6 1/2 years."
bad,I worked there in the summer after my senior year of high school. Liked it because I knew someone I worked with and we were very productive together. Mangers were nice.
bad,I am very fortunate I left when I did. The company continues to ask more of fellow former co-workers while not providing the facility to complete work
bad,"Working at Walgreens for over 10 years, I did not have the opportunity to advance as much as I would have liked. I worked on a team where senior level staff did less work and got promoted. I would not recommend working in It for them."
bad,"I worked in a very busy store, in the center of the city it's very busy at all hours of the day. I learned team working skills and how to provide better customer service. Store manager is terrible, but shift leaders are awesome. My coworkers were the best part."
bad,"Labor type job, more than retail should entail. Pay is a less than needed to live off of sufficiently, unless working there for a number of years. Excellent benefits, however."
bad,Overall the customer's were pretty laid back so long as you knew what you were doing. The staff is all very knowledgeable and friendly. The pay cap is a bit on the low side however. They also tend to pay you more for hopping from place to place.
bad,The managers were rude and only liked certain people. If you weren't able to work a 10 hour shift because of your schedule they would barely give you any hours at all.
bad,ASM plays favorites to the people he likes and not the hard workers. Did really car about the job being done as long as he doesn't have to do it. Hard guy to work for
bad,Managers dont solve peer to peer issues in the team unit. Communication is practically nonexistent. Good luck having your needs or thoughts received by your superiors. Pay is decent and hours are there but the hours arent worth the money when the construct of the store is laid out minimally.
bad,"A typical day a work is a pretty relaxing environment. I've learned many new things including great customer service. Its a very diverse atmosphere so there's a lot of personalities you'll encounter on a daily basis which may or may not be a good thing at times. The hardest part of my job was nothing. It's not a difficult job at all once you've grasped the concept of what your required to do. I enjoyed going to work everyday. My co workers were amazing. The only negative side is the pay and the fact that Walgreens NEVER closes, not even on holidays."
bad,"During my time in working at Walgreens, I didn't have the best experience. The supervisor worked for was very dismissive, condescending, and very arrogant. Instead of trying to uplift, and encourage and work with me knowing that I have hearing loss and ADHD, this supervisor did the opposite. However, this supervisor understood that I have school and was very willing to work with my schedule, which is more than I could ever say for any other employer I've had in the past."
bad,"Walgreens fail as a company to treat their employees with respect and when something goes bad, they're quick to point fingers without any reliable proof."
bad,"I was a ""Customer Service Associate"" or cashier, basically a typical store worker that you'd see in Walgreens. It'san easy job, but it gets extremely boring FAST. The best thing about this job is stocking up items from ""truck"". The pay is not worth it. As far as co-workers and management, it really varies by the particular store. I've worked  at one where the work environment was very unwelcoming, and I've also worked at one with GREAT managers and cool co-workers."
bad,With the right people this place can be very fun. Other then that it is very difficult to move up in the company. They have very strict standards and have changed a lot from when i first started for them.
bad,"Typical is just helping the customer a lot. This job its self is good. i feel like the only problem is that I work very hard, super hard and only got paid a little. I Don't mind working hard and i do love working hard just little paid and it seem like they use all that money for store set up and all these extra programs when i think they should paid workers more. The job its self is crazy but i like it."
bad,"The company of today is not the company of yesterday. Walgreens bought Boots, but Boots is making all the decisions.  Focus is on money. Period."
bad,"come in the morning greeting my coworkers and managers.I worked in the photo department after I clocked in to work I will get my department set up for the day which includes setting my photo machine up make sure I have photo paper in the photo printer. balance my register . greeting customers as they enter the store. managers will have a list of things for me to do, I will work on the list . when a customers arrive I will stop what I am doing and address the customer needs first after finish up with customer . will continue to finish up the list. I enjoyed my co-workers we worked as a team.hardest part of the job was standing around doing nothing never had to do that cause it was always something to do which I loved very much. I enjoyed helping customers"
bad,"7 years with the company and I have seen people who should have been fired for multiple reasons, keep their jobs, and the best employees/managers, get fired for the most ridiculous reasons. This company is all about politics and there is no opportunity for advancement with all the changes they have been making throughout. For shift leads, the compensation is not worth the work you will be doing."
bad,"It was probably just the store that I had been employed at. Other stores had much better reviews and happier customers and employees. Training was practically non-existent, and the employees were less than helpful to give pointers or advice. Leaving me to fend for myself in a job I have never done before. Six months into the job I was still learning things I should have known within my first week there. It was very disappointing in comparison to other places I have worked. And frankly, embarrassing to watch most of my co-workers and management in how they handled their daily or nightly routines. The most difficult thing to deal with was working with people who simply did not care for their job, or the customers."
bad,environment was great however the pay was not so great employees would work hard lifting more than the required weight. vacation time and planning was usually not what was requested
bad,"Customer Service: Assist customers with finding products/Cashier, (money handling)/ Order (telzon) and Stock Cooler and Freezer Foods/ Organize food bays in the Stockroom/ Fill and Face Food Isles."
bad,"Seem like the company is changing for the better, but most people that work there hate their jobs."
bad,"Overall the workplace is great, stays busy and great people to work for. The down fall I would say is you have corporate people all over you trying to pushing flu shots and theres no great chance for advancement within the company."
bad,"Walgreen's was a great place for me to break out of my shell after college. It gave me tremendous real world experience, and my supervisors really helped to shape me into an even more well rounded person. It gave me the chance to interact with customers of all tiers of life, and showed me how to deal with the most unhappy and aggressive customer, to the most pleased customers. I was allowed to implement my own strategies in running our store, one that has doubled our customer count, our sales, and gross profit in just a short year."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping costumers with problems they had.
bad,This company I's pretty good I liked my co- workers and the management. I would recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Walgreens is not that good, I did not like this job. They made me work overnight a lot, and they did not pay that well. I quit because there was no order in the store I worked for."
bad,"I enjoyed encountering everyday customers but the pay was for rather high school students and people looking for a side job. The work environment was decent, people are nice and also very respectful well to an extent."
bad,I loved my co workers they were basically family however the upper management in the district settings had a very high need of authority and power and treats his employees as garbage
bad,"great pay, hours are horrible. have to work nights, weekends & sometimes holidays. we are overworked & constantly busy, but hiring new technicians isn’t in the “budget” & scheduling more techs a day isn’t in the budgeted hours. corporate likes to pay visits & criticize everything."
bad,A typical day would include both managing and stocking departments and also working the front/cash register are of the store. I learned a lot about merchandise and managing one as well during my time there. The managers of my location were all very nice but still took their jobs (and yours) seriously. The hardest part of the job were the customers but it all depended on the day. The most enjoyable moments were assisting customers.
bad,"Walgreens used to be a family company. Those who remember knew what a real company used to be. Now it's just a corporate giant and doesn't give a s**t about anyone. "
bad,"The work is very repetitive. Once you've been there for two or three days, you'll find most calls to be second nature. Being friendly with the right people will carry you far. They hold many employee events and special days, so there is a lot to participate in."
bad,"The job used to be centered on customers and is now more focused on meeting scores, Walgreens used to stand above the competition in having some of the best customer service but now they are more interested in telling customers that they can't have x or y to meet scores.  For example in the pharmacy customers that wait in store are put at a higher priority than those who leave and come back, well Walgreens wants there to be a specific number of people waiting and would prefer us to not let customers wait if we are already at the number that they want."
bad,"Working for Walgreens is a some what easy task, the work isn’t difficult and the customers are not that bad. You liking your job depends on the team you have with you."
bad,"I would recommend this be a temporary job , if you are fresh out of school. The pay is very low and you have tons of work . Also they make you work up front outside of the pharmacy."
bad,everyday is something new.  Great team work. Working has a unit makes the company work more efficiently. Customers leave satisfied and happy.
bad,"Walgreens is infamous for it's low wages. My position was no different. Even coming in with over 7 years of retail experience, they put me at nearly minimum wage, and only raised me once in over 3 years by $.05 ."
bad,You have to stay productive but the customers were great.  The holiday seasons were the worst.  They have decent discounts and the co-workers were cool.
bad,the only two things I didn't enjoy was shipping day when orders come in and when it came to restocking the freezers...... I felt like a pop sicle
bad,co-workers are great and always a pleasure to work with each and every day
bad,"I love Walgreens as a company, however I do NOT like the Pharmacy management at Bellevue location. I was told when I was hired I would get between 20 to 40 hours per week. The truth is I was only getting 8 hours per week after about a month."
bad,"Management didn't listen. Never knew when you were getting off work, if you had work to do at all."
bad,"Walgreens is what is expected of a typical retail job. The pay is decent, the benefits are decent, the management is typical retail management. Management tends to be pushy on the suggestive sales."
bad,"Management at my home store is somewhat okay. Although the management at another store that I have worked at is very disrespectful and unkind. Working in a high-speed environment, technicians often need breaks. Unfortunately, I had an issue with a Pharmacist where she wouldn't allow me to have a restroom break."
bad,"Store Manager was unorganized, racist, not professional, not a team player and wanted everyone divided worse experiences ever ASM and Shift Leaders were great"
bad,you bicker all day like husband/wife or siblings.the regular customers are amazing for exception of a few. management sucks doesn't know when to put his/her foot down and is very spiteful if you try and speak up on certain things or stand your ground
bad,Worked at a floater with Walgreens and hence the typical day differed depending the location and shift worked. The company has the most advanced software but the focus on patient satisfaction and engagement is very poor.
bad,job was driven by sales and the bottom line was all management cared about whatever you did was never enough and the salary did not compensate well for the demands they have
bad,"At first I lived my job at Walgreens, but everyone went downhill very rapidly over time but especially when the store manager quit. We are often short staffed which causes managers to be on register a lot instead of helping customers."
bad,Walgreens is an awsome company to work for but the management is poor and under staff and night shift hours all the time is draining. With management don’t value employees
bad,The job is easy to learn but can be very confusing the first 2-3 days. You work at a very fast pace. Management expects you to get your rate in one week. The 2nd day I was there my trainer was being rude and pushy. He told me to speed up a couple of times. I was working as fast as I could but he was not at all happy. It was my 2nd day and he was upset with me because I was not going as fast as everyone else that had been there awhile.  At quitting time I left in tears. I don't feel I was properly trained. The company is not organized. They do things backwards!
bad,This job is good for those who need one now and are looking for another.  It gives people a chance to meet others and explore their skills.  The toughest thing is the amount of duties that they offer.
bad,"no family time "
bad,"I would go into work to develop pictures set up photo lab help customers up load photos ,help them find any and everything they were looking for, check them out on pos register, load and unload truck work  out products into the appropriate isles"
bad,"Walgreens isn’t the worst company to work for. Good benefits and they’re accommodating with scheduling..ie school, family. Within in that past few months I’ve seen many store cut hours and people, even at busy store. I don’t how people are suppose to support themselves if they are only 2 or 3 days out the week, plus it’s terrible for customer service. But hey whatever to save money!"
bad,"At the store level, I really don't have any complaints. I love the people I work with and my boss is good at his job and a good person. My major gripe is the fact that ever since I was hired, the amount of hours our store is budgeted have been steadily declining and we're now at the point where we barely have enough time to do the most basic of tasks."
bad,"Working there was good the first couple weeks. Pay was great, work was great, hours were perfect, as you get comfortable the management was terrible and the co workers were even worse! So unprofessional. The managers and coworkers say when the first meet you “I am here for you and we are a team etc” but they treat you as if you’re an outcast as if you don’t belong there. They terrible talk behind your back and act as if you should kiss their behind ."
bad,Everybody works together and helps one another. Companies insurance is great. I had a great time working for Walgreens.
bad,At first they are really nice to you until you're there for awhile . they get really competitive and bossy. They want to be the only ones receiving positive feedback but they need help and they are rude to you... They don't like new employees. They feel it's a threat the dont listen to you and they make you feel like you have a problem with yourself.  One of the worst places. I really liked it there too... I wanted to stay.
bad,Its a good job to start off with but u dont get really much hours nd when u wants off sometime u can get off but i love the people there they can be nice
bad,When My location I worked at closed I really didn't feel walgreens any more I felt like I was let down with a company that I enjoyed and built a family with
bad,This was one of my first jobs doing security and it was great meeting new people on a day to day basis.
bad,"For me it was very stresful, the manager there was great it was just the pharmacists that I had an issue with.  They just always seemed to busy and to help with any training."
bad,"Worked for Walgreen's for 4 years, started off as a BA Beauty adviser. My job was to take care of customers find what they are looking for, and make sale suggestions. I loved what I did and felt the need to move up so I start to get curious and learning new things. I then became a manger, my job tasks then became to be; making sure my crew where all working in a task, getting my own personal tasks done from what the store manager wanted done and as well our assigned bays as well as sections in the store, I had to learn how to do resets, scan outs, inventory, cash reports as well as closing and opening a store, receiving warehouse and sending things back to the call center, checking dates to food and medicine, helping the pharmacy. The hardest part of the job was probably moving all the floor displays when they had to do waxing. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my employees."
bad,I love my co workers but I am ready to move on and keep growing financially. My Manager is one of the most amazing persons I’ve ever got to work with and I wish her the best.
bad,"Working there was okay, but the only problems was the RATS in the stockroom they were horrible. I used to clean uo at night and be scared for if the rats would come and get me."
good,A good place to work part time or full time. Starting out salary is above minimum wage. Job can be stressful and rewarding at times. You learn new things in different departments.
good,It was not What I expected from it being Walgreens CO.  I lead a little more experience with working with customers on the telephone. I have more experience in hospital and compounding.
good,"Hated the managers.very micromanaged.worked on days I was very ill and the managers asked was I still coming in when I called out sick."
good,There are better companies to work for in beauty.  You aren't taken seriously by co workers and treated with little respect as other employees don't understand the position.
good,I work hard for the pharmacy. Those who arent even certified gets better schedule than me and get away with a lot of stuff. I cant finish a project and I get smacked down hard. No room to grow playing game of thrones.
good,walgreens claim to care about employees and they dont. walgreens claims to want to help and always an advancement opportunities. ALL LIES. walgreens is full of b.s. and a money hungry company
good,Better than fast food. Still a bad entry level job with bad pay and high expectations for their apathetic employees. Expect to be on your feet the entire 8+ hour shift  except for break. Invest in nice shoes.
good,"Working for Walgreen's was an very fun job at times, the core values were loosely followed. I was looking for more of a structured position that allowed room for advancement."
good,All the employees play mind games. They  do not give hardworking employees hours. Management is lazy and expects for their workers to be hard working. They do not appreciate workers enough.
good,During my time here (almost 4 years) i noticed alot of favoritism. No advancement in the company was available. Pay sucks. Employees are overworked and ALWAYS short handed. Corporate wouldn’t give us enough hours so we were always short on staff. Schedule sucked. Only the senior tech and one other tech had a set schedule which was unfair. Management sucks because Walgreens corporate is ran by people who have never worked in the pharmacy a day in their lives.
good,"Typical day is either stuck at the register or if your lucky, on the floor. You will develop strong bonds with shift leads on your shifts and will want to work with them."
good,A typical day at work for me consists of people stealing everyday and the assistant managers would just act like they're doing something important but tells you do their work. Very poor management.
good,As a beauty advisor I was familiar with most makeups and made it key to always try to look approachable. they should enforce training more because some of the advisors were lost.
good,"My main reason for leaving is they continue to under-staff and overwork those left. They put a lot on us without raises or incentive to move up. There are a lot of changes in the company that I am not a fan of. I feel like time and money could be used in better ways. In my store it is hard to get breaks, and chores are not distributed evenly between day and night shifts and individuals."
good,"Horrible management that treats you negatively because of your gender. Would not recommend even to people I don't particularly like to work there, store manager and assistant will sit around gossiping rather then help with truck and not address work performance issues to other employees simply because they like them more."
good,"Walgreen's is the worst pharmacy to work for. Corporate is constantly cutting hours to save money for themselves. And expect you to have so much work done while running a busy pharmacy. Also the customers suck, always complaining and arguing. I get into at least 5 arguments everyday."
good,There have been a ton of changes such a reduction of hours and pay. Change of positions have really imapcted one's abaility to advance.
good,I was there to work for my 125 hours for school in order to graduate. Its a fast pace environment. It was one techs there I had a feeling that she didn't like me. but oh well I'm not there to impress her she's not signing my papers at the end of the day the pharmacist is.
good,"shareholders are more important than the employees . The employees are understaffed, underpaid,unprotected  and run ragged with many things to do .empoyees very stressed"
good,Was a good place to start got some experience. Was only there for an externship. Didn't get much experience because I was just helping. Management was good.
good,"Clean, stock, greet, thank. Loyality and hard work don't count. Management seems to lean toward youth. Regular customers are the best part of the job."
good,"good hours, nice coworkers, decent pay, lots of over time, long weekends, worked 4 days then off 3 days, could use more room for people to advance up in the company."
good,The managers had their favorites and if you didn't click then they were mean to you and made you work the worst schedule. I wanted to move to a different department but wasn't allowed to because they didn't like me
good,I don’t feel Walgreens is a place where single parents of small or young children should or can work not very flexible with schedule for some people but for others they are willing they tend to play favorites
good,"While I was employed with Walgreens, I would often offer suggestions as to how to make things work more smoothly. My suggestions were often ""swept under the rug"" if you will. When I was told to make my own skmatic for an end cap my manager told me that it was horrible and completely wrong."
good,Most stressful company I have ever worked at. Expect their employees to do way too much for far too little. Lack or organization and follow through across the board.
good,"I worked the cash register"
good,Walgreens was a fast pace facility long hours but not enough pay for seasonal  employee like myself that wanted the opportunity to grow within the company but need more to benefit from to support my family
good,"I just want to apply not review, do waste your time if u like being happy and free. Customer are crazy and Walgreens systems are outdated and fossils."
good,This is a good place to work if you want to work part time but you will most likely be asked to go in on your days off as they are always short staffed. Management is often unprofessional and accountability varies from each employee. I have heard that this store has one of the highest turn over rates and from what I have observed this is true.
good,"Super unorganized refuses to work with college schedule, and the discount takes a couple cents off, max. They also make it impossible to take all of your breaks."
good,I think the people that's work for Walgreens is under payed and over worked  not enough hours and no benefits most of the management team are not team players
good,I worked there for ten years I got  pregnant  for this to be my first child I became ill more then most  hospitalize many times couldn't barely stand instead of putting me on light duty they let me go
good,"Management was antagonizing and rude, few benefits, horrible work culture. The KOB was stressful and not worth the minimum wage. No one ever wanted to do their work, so good luck getting a day off. They almost didn't let me go to my own graduation."
good,"The boss will get at you and make YOU do a lot and if you need help, you won't get any."
good,They didn't care about you as a person. You were just a body there to watch the cash register or restock. One of the managers refused to learn my name until I had worked there for a certain amount of time.
good,"Less employee support and more protection of management's positions. Employee family and work life commitments are heavily skewed towards whats best for the company and less towards what the employees family needs. IF you are a single parent, it is very hard to keep a balanced family life when you have young children."
good,Bad neighborhood.  Too many people begging for money every day. Employees act like you r bothering them if there is a question. And forget about any breaks.
good,The job was ok benefits were ok could have been better Manager was a really tough person to work for my typical day was going in looking at a computer to see if there were any kind of pricing changes and also looking at a telzon through as400 and seeing if there was anything that needed to be counted to make sure inventory was correct and the rest of what i did was on a list made sure people were on task and doing as they should
good,"For what you do and the pay, it is a nice place to work with room for limited advancement.  Coworkers are a joy to work with.  Always an adventure when you work."
good,"Work is too much for the terrible pay, I loved the customers and working with them, store needed a major overhaul internally as well as externally."
good,"customers are easy to deal with"
good,This is a very poor company to work for. The companies lack of compensation for the work that you are required to do and the certificates you are required to hold are under industries standards.
good,"What I've learned is advancement was very hard to get, you had to know someone in order for you to advance. Although it was a job that always kept you on your feet and busy that way the day goes by faster."
good,"At Walgreens, of course the co-workers were great, but management was very harsh. I had asked for my husband's birthday off a month in advance, and when I asked them to fix the schedule because they had forgotten, even though that to do the schedule, it shows up because to ask off you put it in the computer, I was told if I ask for another day off, she would purposely schedule me to work and if I missed, I'd be fired. Upset at this outburst, in front of customers no less, I finished what I was doing and took lunch. I cried and tried to talk it out with my sister. I tried to stay and work, I worked that day and maybe for a week after. Then, after a pure week of being off, because the manager intentionally cut my hours, I called and said I wouldn't be coming in that day or in the future. It was a horrid place. The back was completely a mess because of a lazy manager. Also, the Pharmacy had a line at all times because they didn't schedule enough people, so people were always waiting at least an hour."
good,"Expect PAs/NPs to function at 100% level of expected capability less"
good,"It's a decent job to hold while looking for a something better. The hours are good, if you need more all you need to do is simply ask. Very nice 25% discount on Walgreen brand items. "
good,"Go into work, mostly at night. Get yelled at by managers for having to fix previous shifts work. No breaks during the 5-6 hour shift. Co-workers just stayed in the back stock room and didn't do anything."
good,"Get yelled at by crack heads for no being allowed to sell them photos they edited on Photoshop due to US copyright laws."
good,"Assisting customers, Learned the ins and outs of running the store, the management was horribly ran, only had one co worker, i worked over nights. The hardest part of the job was dealing with uncooperative customers. The most enjoyable part was having three days off"
good,"Typical day to provide excellent customer service, translating, and handling money with efficiency."
good,a typical day consists of helping customers find things and ringing them up at the register. working in the photo dept I take in film and develop it. im also given a list of things to do during my shift. I enjoy the people I work with for the most part. management makes it hard for me to do my job. you never get the breaks that you are supposed to because they run it so shorthanded that there isn't anyone to cover.
good,The job wasn't what it was made out to be. Left to find a CAREER
good,"The hours at this job is too up & down. You can hardly get 40 hours a week without going to multiple stores. The pay is $8.00 per hour that's not enough for all the things you do at the store from cashier, photo lab & stocking you pretty much do everything but pharmacy."
good,It was a very busy place to work between the counters and drive thru. You had to know what you were doing at all times. The hardest part of the job is making sure you asked the customer to spell his name before giving the medication to that person. If a mistake occurs your immediately terminated.
good,"Walgreens was overall an ok place of work, my co workers were great, I just could not handle the way managment delt with certain issues that started to affect me personally"
good,Getting all your task done is the key for store success.
good,Typical day at work is slow and repetitive.  Opportunity for advancement is very slim.  Competitive wages?  Not really.  Cleaning and sanitizing the restrooms is a requirement regardless of job title.
good,its retail and a drug store. cool place to work if you want to maybe become   a pharmacy tech or pharmacist or are in college and just need something to get by
good,"The job was wonderful when I first began working at Walgreens. The managers were awesome and still are. I tranferred to Walgreens in Hattiesburg,MS  and it was a total disaster. It was nothing like what I was used to. There was no teamwork, cooperation, poor customer service, bullying and moscommunicating. The workers argued a lot and the managers didn't handle any situations well as leaders."
good,I had an ongoing issue of disrespect and belittling remarks with my pharmacy manager. I brought the issue to my store manager several times without any improvement or actions taken. It got to the point where I was so stressed out I developed a stomach ulcer. When I applied and interviewed for the job it was done so under the impression it was a full time position. Then hired as part time.
good,"get list of all the different areas that needed to be filled."
good,Horrible management. Confined to your desk. Won't hire enough people to balance call load. Write ups for missing for emergencies. This place needs renovation in their management.
good,"I’ve worked for Walgreens for three years and currently do. Everyday is a different day. Training is a joke, you are held to very high standards with very little training. Expected to follow specific directions for managers."
good,Throws you through a loop to get a question answered by management. You aren't able to give ideas for processes because you aren't management there. poor work place
good,"Every district is different and the district I worked for is not great by any means. With the buyout of Rite Aid, the company dropped the ball and failed their customers. Loved working for Walgreen's until the buyout."
good,"The hours for a department manager average 10 to 14 per day. Pay is high for the work, but the medical insurances is very expensive. The corporate leadership has completely changed the direction of the company from caring about customers and employees to only focusing on the dollars while operating under the cloak of caring for employee. The disability initiative that gained the Supply Chain so much notoriety has gone by the wayside."
good,I gave my 17yrs my all despite how my life was changing. I wish they would have given me a warning or like I said before written me up but no they took my 17yrs and I have nothing to show for it. Smh
good,while at wall green your day will fly by in a blink of an eye. from the moment you start working till the moment your times is up you will find many different situation while dealing with customers. you wont have time to think about how long you have been standing. by the time you realize you have been standing all day ; oits time to go home.
good,The pharmacy is a strict environment where there is no help for staff and is not cooperative. The pay is not up to par and there is a salary cap after a certain amount per hour.
good,"Would not recommend Walgreens , to much favoritism ,lack of work ethic and attitude issues . Manager was very racist , very obvious ,"
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work for students, especially the ones that are interested to become a pharmacist. Other than that I would not recommend it to anybody else."
good,most enjoyable time is making friends. meeting new customers and helping them find exactly what they are shopping for. learning new skills and cascading the information to all team members.
good,Needs better management & communication skills. If I request off in the computer a month prior to my desired vacation days I would rather not be the only one knowing about it the day before my actual vacation.
good,Walgreen's pays too low for all the duties expected to perform. Management nice except for when Walgreen's managers cut my hours. Walgreen's promised me full time-40 hours and every month the stores have budget cuts and reduce hours to part-time-very unfair and I couldn't survive except to work at 3 Walgreen's to get 40 hours. Walgreen's over loads employees with too many tasks for low pay. Customers some are not nice over returns. A lot of shoplifting by customers.
good,Walgreens was my first job expirence back then I was still a quiet kid and I tried to do my job and at the end I realized Walgreens (no retail)wasn't right for me
good,"Everyday, I was responsible for the overall safety and security of the building. Typical shift duties included department maintenance, cash handling, resolving customer/patient concerns, task delegation to crew members, post orders and invoices, food safety checklists, vendor processing, and overall store conditions.  Walgreen's has a very comprehensive management training program on paper, but with it's best and brightest people leaving in droves due to issues behind the scene, the company has no choice but to fill the void with something less than it's best or it's brightest.  This along with other factors has contributed to poor morale among employees.  Customers/patients are beginning to notice that what used to be a welcoming healthcare facility has become a high pressure environment.  Hence why people are leaving.  They are smart enough to know the same, if not more, money can be made elsewhere in a significantly less stressful workplace.  I loved my customers, I enjoyed teaching and developing my crew, but an increasingly stringent labor structure, coupled with the job becoming more labor intensive, had siphoned much of the love and the enjoyment out of the experience."
good,Very mean managers have no  idea how to treat employees. Rude don’t care about you or your life only there because they hate their life and jobs and need money.
good,overall I rate it a five for my experience working there. I disagree about the shift changes and pay rate. I got a great feeling serving our customers while at work.
good,Its alot of work and pride that you have to put to the side in order to make it in that environment its alot of sick/ill people and elderly that come in to make your day gl bad but its up to you to follow or ignore
good,Difficult to move forward in this company after becoming a certified pharmacy technician. Some pharmacy managers do not provide fair schedules. Corporate Walgreens does not provide decent raises.
good,More for people who is in school and dont have kids . They never close. Stay open even in bad weather and the customer are always right they never got your back.
good,"Laid off for going on medical leave after a family emergency, wasn’t apply to get my job back even though I never called out and worked on a broken ankle. I was never late and always worked when called in"
good,Management consistently changing so the place isn't ranned efficiently and managers aren't very professional. If you get sick sympathy isn't taken upon you cause their business doesn't run without everyone there. There's no privacy there and literally everyone knows your business cause people gossip too much. Security isn't very professional and does things against the books so it gets out of hand.
good,"the job is very repetitive, after being there for about a month you can easily tell there are many issues with management and store quality. people get away with everything from hiding on the clock, talking on their phones on the sales floor, bullying other staff members, and when the issues become addressed you then become a target."
good,The job isn't bad its the people. when you have a store manager that out right shows favoritism and makes excuses for one specific person it tends to affect the whole team.
good,Management was foul. Coworkers carried the weight of the store. Working while pregnant made my job expectations difficult. High turnover. Never enough crew to run store smoothly
good,"I found the job to be stressful when management could not get on the same page to know what was going on in the store and know what employees are working and what needs to be done,"
good,Nice staff. Couldn't make a living though. Staff was very nice and Very unorganized.We  went through an all new staff the first month I was there. they worked me like a dog as I trained all new staff.
good,Doing them work of 10 for the price of 1/3. They do not give you the tools needed to even think about advancing. Managers are awful and have no communication with the higher ups.
good,I was head of two departments at once. I liked being busy and alot of work got done. Not all stores are the same but the one I worked in was not very good. They played favorites with the employees. If you were not liked then you were over looked for a promotion. They want you to come in to work even when you're sick. And safety is not their number one priority.
good,"Type prescriptions with the correct customer information then, fill Prescriptions via machine or hand count depending on availability."
good,I liked my job and my job family. The overtime burns you out really quick. The communication from management to employee was not great.  There was no flexibility in the hours for a working single mom and the demand for the job was intense.
good,"The job is ok but the accurance system is not set to help the employees only the company, They make their money off of medicine but they dont except doctors notes or if youre sick it counts against you with or without a note. This place is NOT for anyone with a family or life."
good,"No loyalty, a lot of changes in roles and reduction of pay, benefits, hours but more responsibility. Company has forgotten about its employees and focus more on its investors. Dead end unless you are prepared to be a slave and even then unless your favored will doors open for you."
good,"Worked overnight, easy cashier, stock, etc.  but manager always in back, had unsafe, scarrey customers.  Felt very very unsafe. people shoplifted all the time. yet they did not care about my safety or the common customer. THEY NEED A SECURITY GUARD"
good,When I first started the job I loved it! After they replaced our manager the new manger was very odd. He spent too much time talking about his & our personal life. They would switch hours with no notice and then constantly try and get rid of old staff.
good,They Don't Really Care For Their Employees. They Make You Feel Like If You Aren't a Manager You Don't Really Matter. They Also Tend To Not Give You Credit For The Good You've Done.
good,"Must handle inventory early in the morning or it will not be done at all, work flow must be consistent or productivity is stifled entirely. It is not a good environment to learn because it is too fast paced to take the time to learn. Most learning must be hands on."
good,"I enjoyed working my way from being a regular team member, to becoming apart of the management team. I gained management skills and learned how to supervised different type of individuals."
good,"Ours vary. NO set schedule. Any day of the week Sunday through Saturday. Opening to closing varies. Lots of turn arounds. If you close you will be opening the next day. Closing can be as late as  midnight and opening will be as early at 7am. Pay is not what you deserve. Lots of hard work. No room to grow anymore. Benefits are great. Health insurance. 401k is the best, $3 matching for profit sharing. PTO time accumulated is better then other places. Hours constantly being cut so managers have to do it all. Front cash register, pharmacy, cosmetics, photo...you name it."
good,"Bosses too close to employees, no advancement opportunities, hard labor for only certain employment, lack of professionalism, lazy"
good,"I worked for this company for six year, and in total worked at nearly one dozen stores. There were several issues regarding equity during my time there and I experienced racism and discrimination on multiple occasions. The company was going through a lot of changes, and budget restrictions, which put more work on lower level and mid level management. I also learned a lot from working there, as I learned how to be a good manager of people and maximize my time while under pressure."
good,"I worked for Walgreens for about 3 years. In the beginning it was a fun place to work but that was only because of course workers. As time went on and I became more advanced in different departments I was forced to do more work for the same pay. Eventually I transferred and every Walgreens front there was down the drain. Poor management, No opportunities for growth, horrible hours and pay."
good,I really enjoyed the time I had in the pharmacy. I didn't work there for as long as I would have liked to. I learned a lot! People are crazy when it comes to their meds!
good,"This was decent place to work, but was eventually laid off. During the first round of lay offs the work load remained the same although the amount of employees decreased."
good,"not a great place to work. to busy. under staffed, not enough hours for management to staff enough employees to cover the horrendous amount of scripts that come in , not to mention the constant lines of customers, yelling at us all the time that it  is our fault when things go wrong from Dr offices and insurances.. customers standing long lines complaining all the time. NO training from absolutely no experienced employees because none work there. Managers are inexperienced and do not no how to deal with these issues so they ignore them. Wishy washy. I just want a better place to work that I am appreciated and taught to do my job better"
good,"From what i remember working for Walgreen was a OK job, at the time i was in high school. One the of the bad things when i worked there was, i had to always close and stay late and past the legal crew, the mangers didn't seem to care about the employees that much."
good,Didn't feel there was a lot of room for advancement but overall not a bad place to work. All the employees were very nice and great to work with.
good,"Strict work place with lack of communication with management.The key to success is keeping the customer satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers and making sure they're satisfied. It's a growing company, but the pay isn't so well."
good,"Go and show up for work do your required duties and help out where needed. as well as being polite ,and treat all people as you wanted to be"
good,The typical day at work was to go in and do what was assigned for the work day. I would do management jobs and also train new employees. The hardest part of the job was doing my job and other jobs that were not required of me with minimum pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and interacting with the customers.
good,"I've worked at Walgreens for about 9 months now,"
good,"The pay was decent at Walgreen's. However, the management was horrible and so were the hours."
good,This company is going through many changes currently.  In the future it will become more and more difficult to move into the store manager role as they stop opening as many stores.
good,"Probably my least favorite job.  High stress, low pay, and poor management."
good,I really enjoyed the opportunity of being a pharmacy technician. I enjoyed interacting with all of the customers and my co workers.
good,"Pay is really low. Hours are good. Managers are rude, coworker's have bad attitudes"
good,"Walgreens Corporate is an ok place to work. If you are looking for a job to work at for the next 20-30 years of your career, this is your place. Expect to be 20 years behind others in the same industry."
good,You will deal with a lot of customer complaints and advancement is based on who you know. they claim for equal rights but when it comes down to it. Its more like if you don't know anyone then you will be a cashier for the rest of your life.
good,horrible work environment I would be lucky to get a break let a lone a lunch break
good,"Each day was pretty much the same day to day, didn't have a lot of options when your the only cashier. I learned how to operate the film developing machines, along with developing better customer service skills. Management was good, but could be better at making sure each of his employees are treated right by each employee. My co-workers were okay for the most part, but it was all for one, we weren't much of a team per say. Hardest part of the job was learning to deal with the customers that thought they owned the store, they had a grumpy attitude towards you no matter how happy you could have made them. My most enjoyable part of the job was making a few new friends."
good,I didnt like management because they werent very accecpting of me.
good,"Walgreens is are located every where now,the advancment  process is very slow."
good,"With the cut in staff, managers are expected to work twice as hard and do not actually manage any processes."
good,There is a serious disconnect between management and employees.
good,"Demanding hours and management, with no thanks whatsoever. Working every holiday without question, including Christmas"
good,"day starts early work never ends till shift is done good overtime offered most management were okay,coworkers easy to work with there were no hard parts to the job the most enjoyable part of the job was the doing the work."
good,"Didn't know after 15 years if dedicated service that you are not appreciate at a job you gave your all to a company worldwide, just don't understand."
good,i really liked walgreens at first but then they started messing with my schedule trying to make me work when i needed to be in class. the schdules arr by no means flexible. once i complained about the schedule i was pulled from the photo lab to be a cashier when i hated that job. i was passed over for a promotion when i was the one more qualified for the job. i ended up having to teach the other girl how to do everything and she still never learned all the things she needed to know when i left 2 months later.
good,"I realize times are tough, but as a company they are simply bleeding employees dry. I was sad that I had left, but now I wish I had not gone back. It's just sad."
good,There is no typical at a drugstore. Every day is different. I have learned alot about the computer programs and different computers. I have learned that I have the capability to comprehend and fix most issues that arise.
good,This company is not the best to work for. There is no job security because they did not accept a big insurance company for 2012.
good,"I was the beauty consultant at my Walgreens for almost a year. They say they want the bc to be customer focused and knowledgeable about products, but they Treat you as if you’re still a csa."
good,Not as good as when I first started. Some of the management staff is a bit rude. I’m not a fan of working every weekend like they have been scheduling me.
good,"While they are a great company I struggle with my coworkers. My manager refuses to hire help so we are swamped with work, my coworkers are calling out left an right completely out of spite to my manager to get him to hire someone. All they do is gossip about eachother it's honestly like I'm working with high schoolers."
good,"Good company with a good culture, good work life balance however very difficult to grow as they do not provide the feedback needed to make progress. Not motivating for employees"
good,"Was hired as 40 or very close as a full time employee. Hours changed to less than 30."
good,At Walgreens it’s a nice place very very strict on rules. Insanely boring and repetitive. Garbage and cleaning all up to the employees. 11 pay and 15% off food nothing else
good,Hilo store is the worse location to work at unless you don't want to work as a team. No help is given; training is minimum to none. Customers always get ignored.
good,Walgreens is as a whole a good company to work for under the proper leadership. Unfortunately for my location that wasn't an actual thing. I was burnt out working weeks at a time due to staffing issues with no days off. I would get in trouble for overtime but was not allowed to hire which was ridiculous.  Due to being burnt out and sometimes unfunctional I was not able to work properly and I made a very large mistake and owned it all. Had i gotten the proper assistance from the higger ups this never would have happened. I was told my store was nothing short of a headache and I had no common sense. All I was trying to do was run the store the best I could. There are store managers that trash other managers and employees and my training was not the finest. I was did what I could and to the best of my abilities but myDM would tell me he was not going to micromanage me and to figure it out. Being I was new to the roll I was just seeking guidance from him. Which I none of. This was disappointing and an experience I know Walgreens do not want on their shoulders but I am bring transparent here.
good,"Unless you're in management or have seniority, be aware that your hours are going to get cut a lot. Corporate has no response as to why the cuts keep happening. Corporate focuses a lot on the numbers that do not help your day to day tasks. Schedule is created by an algorithm that has proven to be off the actual number of prescriptions that are done daily but they keep using it."
good,Working at this Walgreens was the worst time of the best years of my life. I was here from 2009-2014 - 5 years too long. This place made me develop crippling anxiety due to a toxic work environment and condescending management. I don’t recommend working at this location in Orange unless if you’re okay with being treated like a peasant while management hangs out in the office doing nothing while the rest of the staff is slaving around on the sales floor trying to suggestive sell stale candy. This company has a lot to learn about leadership.
good,It is not a fun place to work. Employees come and go. No one person has lasted a year there. The pay is not enough.  They dont pay even close to what your worth.
good,"some pharmacist lack the training to perform in the pharmacy outside of the school setting. The patients that come to the store are rude and entitled, so be prepared to be bossed around."
good,"Was with the company 13 years, and over time it went from being a great place to work, where you were valued as an employee, to a micromanaged, metrics driven, stressful environment.  Corporate changed hands twice during my time there, and each time things got worse. Kept reducing store payroll budgets, while work level increased.  Do more with less became the theme.  Pay grade is decent for leadership levels and pharmacy staff, but lousy for front end staff.  Work and life balance doesn't exist, although corporate claims it does.  Due to put poor staffing, existing employees have to pick up the slack when there are callouts, but overtime is not allowed, so you have to make sure you shave off any extra time before the pay week ends or risk facing progressive discipline.  This is a vicious cycle, because when you have to lose hours to stay under 40 hours/week, someone else gets shuffled to fill the void.  The pressure and micromanaging from corporate have most of the staff in my district wanting to leave."
good,"All employees talk bad about each other, no team work at all. Managers also gossip and leave work behind for others. Nobody does there job and complain about it's too much work so they make night shift do all the work."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work for the student life. However a single mom trying to provide for her self and two kids, it just isn't enough. There were advancements, however when the whole store is being trained on Pharmacy; takes away from the ability to set root in as a carrier. Good people, just not enough for a struggling mother with two kids."
good,I been here 4 years and no change. I would love a job that just appreciates my time and effort on the job. A simple thank you for your hard work would be nice.
good,Walgreens is a nice place to work if your just starting off in the job market. Some of the management time are friendly and helpful. The staff can be a little stand offish .
good,"As someone moved to up to pharmacy technician from photo specialist. Being a pharmacy technician at this store is hard since all the customers are babied,and demand thier prescription be ready by the time they get there."
good,I worked for this company for only 11 months and I loved what type of job I had however the attendance policies were horrid. I was recently called on my day off and got fired for my attendance because I couldn’t provide documentation for my absences due to migrianes.
good,drama gossip lies. store manager very lazy treats employees like friends show favorites. hours are decent. work with personal life situations. ghetto staff.
good,At Walgreens there are many sick people coughing in your face or handing you germ invested money to pay for their medicines. There are no chairs to sit if your feet hurt or get tired from standing.
good,"working at the pharmacy department was great even though it was a stressful and fast pace environment it was a great work place. answering phones dealing with insurance problems. "
good,"Very hard work. Stocking shelves all the time, changing prices and resets all the time. Unloading the delivery trucks. People are not all treated equally."
good,"My store provided a job security for me for years. However, the way Walgreens is choosing to go with the company, is not for me. I was able to start in the beauty department & move to shift lead. From there I was stuck & could not move around further."
good,"The position is a good way to build up your resume if you're passionate about makeup and skincare,but I wouldn't recommend for long term.There are no management positions or other opportunities to grow with in the company beauty wise."
good,"The turn around is not what I expected coming from a company that is well over 100 yrs old.  They are also lagging in their ways of thinking and keeping up w/ the times.  Not willing to allow remote working (at least in law dept), and limited flex-time arrangements.  Management leaves something to be desired as well.  Go work for McDonald's."
good,"Very political organization. Does not value the person whose performance is exceptional. Values individuals who stroke upper management's ego."
good,"The discount was really good, and I met some coworkers who I still talk to you, but the job is not right for somebody with a full college schedule.  They trick you into thinking that you will get promoted sooner if you work on the graveyard crew, but then they promote the people on days."
good,The Walgreens in my location is poorly managed by the lead managers. The trouble I have is scheduling problems. I have put many times in my schedule for days I can't work and I have been scheduled anyway. I have also been interrupted at school many times by the company asking to work last minute. They are very understaffed and have favorites which are the ones who don't work on weekends hardly ever and rarely unload truck when it comes.
good,"A typical day at work depends on what you were hired for. If you are working the front end of the store expect to run the cash register, photo center, stock, and cleaning the store as well as doing resets that come in. If you are going to work as a designated hitter be prepared to be in the pharmacy a lot. I actually enjoy the fast pace of the pharmacy more than the front of the store. It makes time go by a lot faster. But only expect to get one 30 minute break when working pharmacy and not a 30 plus your two 15 minute breaks like you do when working the front of the store (that is if you are working a full 8 hour shift). In my personal experience it isn't a great place to work if you love spending time with your children or family. It seems like I am at work way more than I am home. Also, you only get one holiday off per year. You are expected to work ALL other holidays. You have to sign up on a sheet and pray that you get there before anyone else to sign up for what holiday you would like off. Also, take note that you only get 5 total days a year to call in. After that you will be written up and eventually fired. In my opinion, it depends on who the manager of the store is as to how the whole store is ran. I've had experience with well over several managers and have to say that some run the store, and treat employees better than others. To get a better feel for the exact store location you want to work in just ask several employees honestly how do they feel about working there at that particular store. More likely than not they will be open to telling you the pros and cons"
good,"Only speaking from experience. If your hired as ""the help"" your treated like ""the help"". "
good,"Very stressful, your entire life revolves around your job. You don't get paid enough, and it is hard to get a decent part-time job because of the inconsistent schedules."
good,If you like spending time with your family or working a set schedule this place well not be for you. They also stretch you very thin between the photo department pharmacy and being a manager.
good,"it can get very busy, limited staff, weak management team, unfair duties, unfair work scheduling, favoritism by manager towards associates. inconsiderate manager!"
good,"no advancement in workplace, company hired new instead of promoting from within, as a floater you are being evaluated by your manager at your home store but he/she barely know about your work at other locations, no feedback from management, got big deal when there is some mistakes but company kept cutting tech hours and expect employees to do more and more."
good,"It was personally just my store I don’t know how well other stores run. Corporate was caring and willing to work with me on issues I had with my store, but my store itself was lacking in structure and I was treated unfairly to people with the same level of job as me."
good,"the job Is very people oriented, you have to have lots of patience not only with the customers but with other employees.  I learned many things at Walgreens."
good,It’s a good experience and a good place to work. The upper management is tolerable but can use some improvements in how they handle certain situations and treat employees.
good,"Very Busy, made work/life balance difficult, almost always worked over 8 hours"
good,Assistant manager and Store Manager are horrible! They are cold hearted people who only care for them self. They don't care to listen to the employees Idea's or suggestions and promotions are out the window if you wanted to advance.
good,fine for first job. not for people with families because of inconsistent scheduling and day/night shifts. company needs to decide on what it wants to believe and stands for.
good,"This job use to be fun, I work overnight there are crazy people out here and no security. I don't feel safe and the other employees don't feel safe either."
good,"As it stands presently, I wouldn't recommend working at this specific Walgreens (Chester, md). They're understaffed which forces hectic work hours and sometimes makes it difficult to do all the requirements of the day. Schedule also changes without warning; don't expect to take a picture of your hours at the start of the week for your schedule."
good,There was something always to do. Management was always super nice. They always made sure I was okay. I always enjoyed my coworkers! Customers were always great to.
good,"Work nights putting up truck, scanning department for out of stock items, customer service and cleaning bathrooms."
good,"I did not work there for long, but it was as a typical retail job would be. The times I was scheduled had not been per my request as I had mentioned during the interview, so I could not work the hours posted."
good,It's a great company but I wish the pay was better. I also wish people that  Actually do there job could get paid   Advancements and pay raises.Some things that people get away with is dead wrong.
good,"When I started  Walgreens cared about its employees. They were important and we felt that way though out the years we became cannon fatter for the almighty dollar. Hours were cut and full time employees could no longer make it on their paychecks. They cut pharmacy tech hours as whole and this lead to stressed out pharmacists and pharmacy managers, some of which had no experience as a pharmacist let alone a manager. So many mistakes were made."
good,"-Stocking shelves and doing different layouts of a store is a monthly ritual."
good,"Just like most big corporations. Walgreens has lost touch with their employees and THEIR treatment and respect.I was hired in with a great opportunity.... Upon my hiring in I had ZERO wal-greens experience. But came froma long list of Manager and other retail experience.They rushed through A LOT OF TRAINING and I was closing and opening oN MY OWN within 2 weeks..working and learning departments with ZERO TRAINING. I almost felt like  I was given a quick basic session so management could take time off. They will throw you out to the wolves. "
good,"Very Stressful environment.  Enjoyable work and enjoyable customers, stressful metrics.  Not enough lead time in getting work schedule.  Not enough help during peak work times.  Too much help during slow times."
good,"The job was fun at first but then being the closer all the time and not being able to switch with people if I wanted to come in early, they wouldn't let me. No rotation for schedules. Benefits were great though I would have to say. I had BCBS."
good,"This place was my first place of employment. It started out fine, but promptly turned into chaos. Between bedbugs and managers not taking actual time to develop and improve your skills. If you even knew who your manager was. They have their own cubicle fortress, that half the time they are not at. Despite the pay, it's not really worth it in my opinion to work here."
good,"There was always work to be done, so the days wouldn't normally drag. There were some Managers that were easy to get along with, and some with sour attitudes. Hardest Part of the job was working with the bad attitude managers. Most enjoyable part is getting to know your regular customers and building relationships."
good,The work environment was good at times things started to change after we got 2 new managers I liked it because it was always busy and made time fly especially during the holidays
good,"Limited advancement opportunity. Pay and benefits are lacking for what is required and demanded of the position. Double speak very common, say one thing and do another."
good,This location does not keep people employed very long. The turn over rate is high. Not enough help causes stressed situation. It was not fun being there during the rush and being yelled at by customers
good,Walgreens is constantly evaluating you and this company has changed from a wonderful place to work to a place that is so stressful that it is difficult to engage with your team and build the business. It seems they are always under crisis management.
good,"Walgreens is the biggest Pharmacy corporation, but not a good company , they use to be better. There training program for pharmacy technician is only 2 weeks, thats why I didn't stay with them."
good,"opening the store and taking in deliveries, helping customers with a great attidue. doing resets and revisions. helping employees when they need help."
good,"Overload of work, without the hours or assistance to complete all the tasks within the scheduled timeframe. Lack of management assistance for ic3 calls, difficult patients"
good,"Managers that are good at their interpersonal skills get looked over, management is so competitive they will use people to get ahead. No appreciation for jobs well done, no proper training yet the expectation is there."
good,"Very fast pace. Management was okay, but would often get as stressed as the workers. Not enough staff working. Always a high turn over rate. Pharmacists don't bother to help the techs even if we're slammed. Great discounts. The health insurance was a bit high, but overall wasn't too bad. Hours fluctuate according to how busy the store is. Thus, hours are not fixed. One week you can work 40 hours, and the next week 20. When I first got hired, one of the pharmacist I worked for was very vindictive, belittling, and down right disrespectful. She would constantly yell at the techs and would call us names such as stupid, dumb, you have no common sense. These things would bother everyone, but no one would report her. I figured everyone just got accustomed to it. Thankfully she wasn't there too much longer after I was hired. Walgreens on summer & perkins"
good,"making sales"
good,"The manager is trying to satisfy everyone. Nice place to learn, it is busy all the day and the co workers are helpful. We trying to improve our customer service"
good,They hardly ever have hours to offer their employees and they prefer you to be on call instead of actually scheduling you to work. They needed better management skills and should schedule those who are more willing to work instead of scheduling those who are not and being inconvenient for those who are. They claim you are suppose to get a raise but that only really happen for the male employees.
good,Let me start off by saying anything negative you've ever heard about this place is true. HR is terrible. Management cares about petty things above your performance. Other supervisors will look for ways to cut your legs out from underneath you if you're doing well and not on their team. They recently instituted a new dress code where you cannot wear tennis shoes or anything HR may deem tennis shoes. That's right they care more about what you wear on your FEET to work to sit at a DESK than they do your actual performance. HR runs this place and they simply don't care about you.
good,The management at Walgreens could depend on which store you go to. This Walgreens had horrible management. There was non stop smoking breaks and gave coworkers more leeway than others even though they do more work than the other
good,"This was a decent job however I have a very rude and unprofessional manager, you never get raises. The only decent thing is if you work more than 20 hours a week you accumulate PTO."
good,"I love the job...Just was not anywhere else for me to go up in the company. I love the job and hated to leave, but being at a job for 11 years and not seeing any growth was just a deal breaker for me."
good,I worked there for about a month before I left; the hours and consistent lack of help was the biggest reasons I left. It started ruining my grades and I quit
good,"Very male biased workplace had a male manager that sat every night in the office while every other female manager would help. Told store manager several times, as did others. Nothing was ever done"
good,"Not much to say."
good,"Since WBA became about and the company is no longer Walgreens, you can see the changes.  The company now worries about the bottom line, expectations are beyond reasonable, feel your job is threatened, continually talking about the need of new DNA and new blood flow to the company, no life/work balance, very politically correct environment, feedback is not important to them, they have an agenda that they will execute at any cost and currently all they want to do is cost control to meet targets."
good,"Walgreens is open 24/7 365 and doesn't observe any holiday. It's hard to get a raise. A lot is expected from the staff, more than what they are paid for."
good,some of the managers changed there views on what the company needs and so they have been out to run everyone out the doors and they have made working there a nightmare.
good,"While the staff member were great people, the over-work environment was difficult to accept. Employees were hostile due to added duties that were not originally in job description. A cashier was obligated to also mop floors and wash windows, a cosmetic specialist was not only to cater to customers but had to work in pharmacy stocking orders, etc... I personally thrive on a fast paced environment but when one person is doing the work of two or more people constantly it wear you thin quickly."
good,Walgreens sells you that is for sure but I wouldn't recommend working there. There is favoritism in who is promoted and I was fired due to absences because I was pregnant ! Definitely NOT the corner of HAPPY AND HEALTHY.
good,"a work day consists of printing photos, checking dates on products, stocking shelves, giving cashiers breaks, cleaning restrooms, taking out trash. always greeting customers."
good,"Constantly busy with few to no breaks."
good,"I didn't like the environment, and working a cash register for long hours. This job just wasn't the right fit for me. I hated working with barcodes and putting stuff on shelves."
good,"Too many inconsiderate team members, but the great thing was that they focused on making the customers happy, Healthy , Well. It was a okay but stressful job"
good,Overall it's not a bad place to work. I've noticed a lot of ethic issues but what place doesn't have that? The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find a product that they can't find.
good,"Company is on a downward trend after being bought out by Boots. Company is trying to cut too many costs and also cutting payroll, which is hurting customer service."
good,"A typical day at work is getting tasks done on time while interacting with the customers. On another note I enjoyed helping those customers even if they were rude to me out. Nevertheless, I did enjoy working with those who were nice to me."
good,This company is ok. The pay was not good for what you do.  The training needs to be better there to help us stay longer with the company.
good,"OK to work there, but management changes every 6-8 months and that can cause problems. Also the parent company, Boots Alliance, micro manages and restricts hours."
good,A job I took in highschool for some extra spending money. The hours were long and the pay was dismal. Management wasn't the greatest.Thankfully I had some friends working there otherwise I would have hated it.
good,I enjoyed helping the customers in any way that I could. I learned a lot from co workers and some of management  when it wasn't a bother to management. I also enjoyed working with co workers and some of the people in management.
good,"This location of Walgreens was very busy, customers were frequently very agitated with long lines and lack of staff.  It was a difficult place to work front line retail."
good,"A typical days work at Walgreens was keeping the store filled with product and building great customer service relationships. "
good,A typical day is same routine day in and out stand at a register clean area if your not with a customer even if its clean look like your cleaning and maintain tobacco products and keep them stocked.
good,"Once the company got bought out when Mr . Walgreens died. The company went down hill, you got treated poorly. The managers made you do their work while they sat in the office and talked about employees. They cut benefits and hrs, the store manager cut hrs around the holidays so their bonus would be bigger. It was ok for them to make you come in early and stay late, but if you're late or have a family emergency they wrote you up."
good,"Working on the floor was fun and relatively simple. My coworkers were patient and knew what they were doing. The management, however, was rude, and not willing to work with my schedule or take time to teach me knew things."
good,Walgreens was once a great place to work. As the years have gone by employees benefits have been greatly reduced. Their constantly changing attitudes on management and policy strain the productivity. Managers now seem to be encouraged to focus solely to improve numbers with little regard for the well being of their employees. This is not a safe place to be and there is little room for growth especially as a pharmacy technician.
good,Im a photo specialist by job title but i have not worked in that department since July or August they forced me to cut my hours from 32 to 40 plus hours a week to just 12hrs a week. at the time i did not have a car and my girlfriend was pregnant with our first child. they wrote me up twice with in 30 days which by policy they can not do but they some how did anyway. I look for other jobs desperately to replace the one or both jobs but no luck.
good,"Picking and packing orders for hallmark stores...I learned how to load trucks. Management was good, co-workers was fun to work around, i enjoyed racing my co-workers who can get all they orders done"
good,"The only reason I am looking for another job is, Walgreens has Cut Photo manager across all their stores, and cut our pay. They merged with Alliance Boots a year ago and are making many changes for the worst. It breaks my heart after 7 years of dedicated service"
good,Walgreens is a fast paced job you will need every retail skill available for this job. the only down fall is that the benefits are not to great for part time workers.
good,I did not really enjoy my job because my co-workers lacked sense of togetherness/teamwork. I work better in environments where there is a sense of teamwork and everyone is willing to help one another in order to provide quality customer service.
good,"Some days were very slow and I'm happiest when I'm busy. "
good,"When I first appear at this place I felt uncomfortable The employees here at this Walgreens didn't make me feel at home. I thought they acted like they've never seen an Asian person before. The Pharmacist here were nice but the manager was too strict on her employees I can tell because one time I had been pulled to the side because I answered the phone in a wrong way. I also felt like the manager showed favoritism toward me. This place was too slow for me to the point where I could fall asleep standing up! Overall, I only did my externship here sort of glad I don't work here."
good,"Typically I would run to work after school. The hours were long and sometimes we were not given much direction as to what was needed next of us. Our management had a priority of our pharmacy due to of lack of pharmacy technician hours being available. Other than these few negatives I enjoyed getting to know customers and helping anyone who needed it. I trained a little based on a personal interest in our printing and photo department, when my co-workers needed the help I always wanted to be there for them. I would probably go back if my education didn't interfere with scheduling."
good,stocked shelves helped customer. My favorite pat was getting to know all my customers i knew most of them on a first name basis
good,"Overall, its a great company to work for. In my 10 years, I have had a great experience. I really enjoy the people I work with."
good,"The best part about the Walgreens is interacting with so many diverse people. Even if you have one person who lashes out at you because they aren't having a good day, it doesn't impact the overall experience because they are hundred more customers in that day who are just so amazing. "
good,"start with counting register, facing and rotating stock for freshness of products, learned how to use a telezon, and product placement throughout store. other associates are friendly, yet lacking in training, which makes it harder to complete some tasks. enjoyed working with public, and seeing regular customers coming in, which in turn helps build rapport with public. hardest part of job is having to do other associates jobs because of lack of training."
good,"Walgreens is the number one pharmaceutical company in the world. Leading in multiple areas. The customer service in store, online and via the phone are disgusting. The culture is horrible. Management doesn't do their job or help you accomplish yours. New rules and regulations are constantly added yet you won't be notified until a customer comes into the store or calls you over the phone and makes you aware. Management doesn't like stepping in and doing their job when needed and that causes the company to suffer as a whole. Customers would call in and ask questions yet no one within Walgreens had the answer or took the initiative to research or resolve the issue or question. Even the higher up management lacks common sense and general knowledge about the company. I was employed for two years and received one raise of 60 cents. I was constantly a top performer in my line of business and the only incentive i received was a 20$ gift card for providing outstanding customer service. Working for this company changed me for the worst and once that begin to happen i resigned."
good,Worked for Walgreens for over 6 years since I was 16 years old. Recently there was a change in the company which has a negative impact to the employees. Cutting of hours and changed the way the give annual pay raises. They no longer take care of their employees and worry about how the corporate part can make money.
good,"Good for a new Pharmacy Tech, Learned alot from the Pharmacist that I worked for."
good,"Responsible for the management of the Photo Center; Maintaining the film and paper processors; Order expense items like chemistry, paper, envelopes, labels and so forth in order to operate the photo lab; Minor repairs to the processors;"
good,Co Workers were fun and energetic managers were nice and playful at time
good,Managers think they are Gods and try to control their employee with threats and being fired !
good,Its a good job for a student not a person that is looking for a full time position. To much budget cuts and and that equals no money in your pocket.
good,"I started with Walgreens in 2001 and I started at the bottom and worked my way up to pharmacy. Walgreens did give me the chance to learn all  about the store and "
good,Working in any retail pharmacy is a challenge but it the end as a Pharmacy Technician we are there to assist the pharmacist and help the customers.
good,"I enjoy making sure the customer's are satisfied, and making sure they get the prescriptions they need."
good,The boss was horrible. The pizza was delicious. Free beer after work.
good,They are not consistent with their employee. The managers are friends with some of the employees and give them certain benefits that others dont receive . Some employee call in when they are not sick but dont get punished. While others will get written up or fired.
good,"When I first started here I was offered a greeter/security position But a few weeks went by I was already in the registers and working all over the store then I was placed in main register till one of the floor's guy quit and they tried to give me his workload which was Heavy labor  most of the day and on Truck day it was only 2 people to unload the whole truck ,I found another job spoke to management that I found a job that gives me the 40 hrs guaranteed but I could still work on my two days off from new job manager said ok no problem,BUT after 2 weeks went by they took me off the schedule without an explanation I called and spoke to manager he said he will try to squeeze me in schedule which never happened SO I stopped begging them."
good,"I worked for walgreens for four years. I was literally hired to help put together the store before opening. I was hired on as an Inventory Coordinator (SIMS Coordinator), and in the four years I was there, my position transitioned at least five times. I was promoted by one store manager, then demoted by another when the first manager was fired. The benefits were great at first, but towards the end of my employment with walgreens, they were in the process of transitioning the benefits structure. Gone are the days of set paid vacation and sick days. Now there is a flex pay system (starting January 2014). The cost of insurance keeps going up, but the benefits of said insurance keep going down (In four years, I have never met my outrageous deductable). All of this might not seem that bad unless you've ever worked in a place like a walgreens. All employees (including management) are constantly around sick people, run around the sales floor like marathon runners (walgreens just can't seem to afford a full staff), and toss heavy products from great heights in a mostly uncooled stockroom. And I haven't even made it to the complaints of the pharmacy department! Instead of paying real pharmacy technicians, walgreens would rather take employees from off the sales floor and give them a rudimentary training before tossing them into the chaos that is often the peak hours of the pharmacy. These employees (called ""designated hitters"") do not receive a raise for these extra services and responsibilities. The combination of having a single stressed out pharmacist, another stressed out ""real"""
good,The company is organized however the management does not abide by the rules and have very low morals which clash with employees who have high moral standing. The job is very enjoyable when the management don't stop you from doing your job to do things that are not is your job description but they don't want to do them so they make you do them. Then try to order you to do things under duress. 
good,"I started in 2006, was a great company to work for, things have gone down hill with the new corporate culture moving away from the community small store culture."
good,"Customer service, Stock, Process film, I learned how to do store reset's and revision's. My co-workers were awesome(well Most of them), the hardest part would have to be lifting heavy things, the most enjoyable part is the growth in my experience, and my ability to handle the most difficult customers."
good,-Phones were busy
good,"Was just informed today that all hours are being cut, only 3 workers per shift, if you can work what they want you to work it's your fault, if you do have health insurance but can't do the days they want you to, your hours will be cut below thirty. I have a feeling in the near future a strike will be in order"
good,·Photo specialist
good,"Job description: supervisor a stuff, monitor all orders and specialty items like photo calendars, films, and mugs. Doing 300 to 1000 photos a week, The photo department is a vital part of Walgreens. I’m also train in Picture Care Plus system. As a service clerk, I am “the face of Walgreens”. Providing friendly, courteous and efficient service to customers, also responsible for everything from cash register operations and customer service to merchandising, store inventory and maintaining store signage and displays. Well spoken, reliable, responsible, prompt and honest. multi task and has well organizational skills. Conducts store opening/closing/shift change procedures."
good,"Though it is a fantastic envrionment, the company is new and lacking true direction as it transitions into this field of pharmacy."
good,"Management had no respect for the Pharmacy, and looked down on all the Technicians. Not all the Walgreens were like this, but the store that I worked for had a big problem with management."
good,This job expects more with less help and it's getting worse and worse withe everyday!
good,"Store Manager is up tight and it rolls downhill to assistant managers, to store employees. Everyone who works there hates it but has no where to go. Most are looking for other jobs."
good,"Every year the company makes lots of changes, eliminating positions, eliminating bonuses, making you work longer hours, they even try to get people to sign a waiver so they don't have to pay them overtime. They try this with threats of losing your job."
good,good company to work for but very hard to advance in and always on top about customer service which is good and always worked very hard day in and day out
good,"A typical day for me was getting up not knowing weather I was supposed to work or not and if so where. There were no set schedules and when there was they were incorrect. I was a floater, meaning I pretty much worked at a different store everyday. I did learn a lot, not as much as I should have within the year that I was there but enough. My co-workers for the most part were not team players. The job called for individuality but in order to get the job done you needed to work together as well. The hard part was having to learn the flow of a new store all the time since I was a floater. What I enjoyed was when I worked at a store where the atmosphere was enjoyable."
good,"Salaried employees could be mandated 13 plus hours without any compensation,  but their regular salaried pay which is a 9 hr day. No support from higher ups."
good,While working at Walgreens I did enjoy my job and the duties that came along with that. I did notice the higher up in the company the more rude the men were. This company does not care about its employees. They’ll fire anyone just like that and investigate any lie told. I felt harassed on the job. I ended up leaving for what I thought would be maternity leave since I was having a baby. Walgreens reassured me that I would have a position with their company when I returned. Well that did not happen. I even had to go through the hiring process again. Then they informed me that my availability would not work for them. They knew before hand what hours j could work. This company does not care about its employees!
good,working to unload the truck and make cosmetics sales its just made you unable to help customers and do checkout and help people with the questions they need. but we all still did it and customers were happy and it is importent to help customers.
good,"I loved my job for the customers. Beside a bad egg here or there, customers were what kept me there for so long. Worked for 14 years. When I first started, had great coworkers and awesome management but as the years went by and corporate took over more, the job became less enjoyable, co-workers became younger and more disrespectful and not wanting to do their jobs. Once they changed management and went to SFL everything went downhill and they only promoted people whom they liked not based on work ethic."
good,"Walgreens is a great way to get your foot in the door to the medical field, but it is very draining and there is a lot of micromanaging. Management is always on you about metrics that are unobtainable and threaten your job when you can’t meet them. There’s no incentive to want to do better."
good,"working there was good, and slow paced. Training was provided and was really fun, however it was a job that required excellent customer service skills."
good,My job as a pharmacy technician was draining.  There was a lot at stake for the very minimal amount of training that is given for such an important role.  A lot of work drama went on most of the time.
good,"Come in the mornings clock in "
good,"I'm just looking for something different. I went on maternity leave for almost 4 months and when I came back, the staff changed entirely. I'm just not used to it and would like something new in my life."
good,"While some things make this place a more desirable option (full time, benefits, pharmacy starts at a higher rate) it usually isn't worth it."
good,"Do not work as a shift lead or cashier...you don’t matter.   Being in pharmacy or upper management is what is important.  Cashiers can be stuck at the register for hours without a break!  One cashier will page “manager needed at register one for customer service” just to buy a drink!   After all, she is a customer when she buys a drink.   Shift leads are expected to follow every rule & regulation.   Pharmacy & assistant manager are exempt"
good,"You might get overworked you, you might get under worked, it depends on the store your at and how busy yall get. you'll probably need another job but they are very good at randomly calling people in."
good,The managers are the biggest problem at the Walgreens I work at. They will write you up for your first time calling in with no verbal warning before. They don’t care if you have a personal life they expect you to make Walgreens priority. The manager is judgmental. And the assistant manager is just as bad. The shift leads only half of them are decent. I only have 1 shift lead I actually respect and enjoy working with.
good,"Typical retail environment. Indifferent management, below living wage pay rate, and pervasive knowledge every employee could be replaced in less than a week."
good,"Was an ok job, but could have been way better.  Management could have been better only thought of them selves it takes way to long to get a raise and it wasn’t a fun environment."
good,Was an alright job. Eventually got to the point where the amount things I had to do outweighed what I could actually get done in a day.  The large amount of drama was also rough to deal with
good,The work place can be stressful because of the bad communication and being understaffed. Our shift leads are good communicators but the store manager can be inconsistent. It is typically fast paced and is frustrating closing because we are understaffed. I enjoy most of my coworkers and talking to customers but the stress over weighs the benefits.
good,A day at Walgreens is typically a very steady workflow with competent help and little support from management from the front end of the store.  The most difficult part of the job is getting accustomed to the archaic computer system.  The most enjoyable parts are the customers and occasionally staff members experiences.
good,"Poorly mismanaged in several areas. Just to name 1 is the fact that they will not let the trained employees get hours in other departments, even when they are short staffed.This alone makes them pay more for a new employee, salary ,workers comp,etc. When they could utilize a trained employee thats a great worker that needs and wants the hours. To go from 30 hrs a week to 20 is a punishment and huge difference in income.  I was taught to cross train so you can utilize the help you have in all areas of the business."
good,"I worked here for 4 months before walking out.  I couldn't handle the ride and snide comments from the staff pharmacist.  Not to mention, the workout was never followed.  I was always stuck at the out window/drive thru because of staffing issues.  Understaffed and underpaid."
good,"Highly demanding, no equal pay, poor general managers, depressing work environment. The pharmacy is very hectic with little organization. Clean environment."
good,"Walgreens is not the greatest to work at but its okay. Standard retail bs where management can make or break store. Often it was 2nd shift doing most of the work with 1st shift leaving even before was able to clock in despite being early a lot of times. "
good,Not the same as it use to be. More focus on metrics over customer service. Management is not supportive of pharmacy while working very shorthanded while volume increased.
good,"This place will stress you out and it is NOT WORTH IT. I trained for management for months strait and they ended up just hiring someone from outside the company. This happens very often so if you’re looking for a career, look somewhere else. The only good thing about this job is they work around YOUR schedule and you still get decent hours IF you’re a good worker so it’s a perfect job for students. District manager will also not have your back in any decisions you make. A customer could literally spit in your face and the DM will apologize to THEM just to keep the customer happy. Work here temporarily, don’t hurt yourself trying too hard for this company. Only real opportunity for advancement is moving to pharmacy but the hours there are a joke so it’s not even worth the pay raise."
good,"Distribution not good. The don't follow there code of conduct policy. they broke OSHA rules bad managers made a good situation bad If they followed the policies I would have worked there tell I died or retired which ever came first."
good,"This place was just a job to me. No career advancement, not a great place to work,but doable.The employees where good! Most of them made the job worth while."
good,"I started out as a front end cashier, it wasn’t bad for the pay at the time I was receiving. If you’re on register your focus is the customers, straightening (if you’re night shift) and maybe a simple task or two. If you end up working the floor you just have more simple tasks to complete and with other front end people. But once you start advancing, you start seeing Walgreens for who they really are. Management is always stressed out with unrealistic goals. There’s no work life balance.. you’re expected to put Walgreens first, no matter the situation. Advice: don’t move up. Stay front end or make your way into the pharmacy."
good,"Company only cares about numbers, you are to be super customer friendly when managers are jerks, including upper management. Total stress to beat the numbers game. Advancement is not gotten by hard work, it is gotten by favoritism. "
good,"This job is very by the book, your job is not guaranteed. You have to come in on time and leave on time. You have to do your job and follow the managers instructions. If you listen and follow their lead you'll be fine."
good,There was never enough employees scheduled on the floor I was always stuck running full front register and photo booth. I had to leave because of a family emergency and they said I was a no-call no-show even though I called all of my managers to let them know I was leaving.
good,Up and down schedule. Not very understanding about personal issues. Very demanding and loves to under pay employees. Employees always look unhappy and are being overworked. Always short employees.
good,"If you don't mind work trying to call you in every single day off that you have, Walgreens is for you. If you cherish those days off to relax and see your family, don't apply here. I haven't had a day off in almost a year without work trying to call me in. Even on days I work they try to get me into work hours early. Management doesn't do anything but point fingers."
good,Observed racial profiling and racism reported it but never anything done this was done by leads most fellow team members were great really loved the customers company has great deals just not good managers
good,"They dont care about the little guy, only the bottom line. If Walgreens actually returned to what they were 10 years ago I think they would be doing much better. But unfortunately right now... "
good,I loved Walgreens. I worked at walgreens in one form or another for 17 years. I worked through many changes and embraced all I could. Toward the end payroll kept getting cut to the point that everyone that worked there was doing the job of 2 or 3. I loved working with the team and customers. The demands of the job took me away  from this leading to ever increasing bad service. It was a horrible damned if you do damned if you don't situation everyone and everything competing for your time and attention. It took a lot for me to realize it was not going to get easier it was only going to get worse and by the time I did I had lost what I loved in the job and every bit of support was long gone.
good,"very easy sometimes fun job. my coworkers were awesome, we were like family. the work is simple. 30 min lunch breaks, discounts. met awesome people while working there. wish I could go back, just doesn't pay good enough"
good,"Most of the people being promoted to asm and store manager, are people that do-not not want to do their own work, or just don’t know how to do it, but except you too, and also are the most cruel people you’ve probably ever meet. It’s had to find good management in Walgreens thats a good team player and actually believes in Walgreens mission: Care, inspire, work together. There is also an incredible amount of favoritism even though it’s not friends and family. The only good thing I can say is if you get DH get certified and leave. I barely spent time in the pharmacy as I’m require to as DH and when I was back there they just through me places and some how excepted me to know how to do things. It get very frustrating at times."
good,"Just like any other retail corporation, money is all that matters at the end of the day. Not you, your safety, your happiness or anything else. As long as you are making someone else rich, that's the only thing that matters."
good,"I'm not sure about other Walgreens, but the Walgreens I worked at after my store (Rite-Aid) was bought was not well managed and not enjoyable at all. "
good,Nice people and worked with my schedule. Hours were good. Always had you doing something. And management was okay. And idk what else to put so yeah that is
good,"Not enough time is allowed to accomplish tasks assigned.  Incentives are minimal.  Opportunities for advancement are rare to none.  Basically, the corporate structure is unconcerned with employee issues."
good,"My overall experience with Walgreens was limited.  A typical work day never changed in most cases.  Walk the store, team meetings, managing and stocking inventory, and insuring funds and customers were always in tack."
good,"Greeted customers when they come in, restock go back and returned merchandise onto shelves and check out customers when they are done shopping at the register."
good,"we filled close to 1000 prescriptions a day. Management did not do a good job of rotating people so they would not get burned out in one position. no opportunity for advancement, they keep you were you are valuable to them even if it doesnt benefit you."
good,"The company was awesome when I first started, then I transferred to another store because we discussed a promotion. I get there and was treated like garbage the day entire time. They lied about the promotion, and god forbid a single mom have an emergency with one of her kids she cuts my hours just in time for Christmas!! Can’t pay bills and buy Christmas clothes with 20 hours a week!"
good,"My time at walgreens has never been an particularly plesent experience. I spend most of my days arguing and fighting for fair treatment across shifts. My manager believes that we have a one store mentality, then has different expectations and policies dependant on which shift is working."
good,"this was an interesting job of looking for things or destroying them, i didn't learn much at this job but i did strengthen my customer service skills."
good,"Corp. just cut all bonuses to 50 percent payout with no explaination in a year where we made more money by billions, than any previous year.   We made those extra billions by cutting expenses in stores.  Cut expenses equals cut hours for employees.   It is clear that the senior leadership does not care about its most valuable people.  If you are thinking about applying, don’t as a career.  As a job, it’s fine."
good,"It was a great first job.  However, I am very excited to move on to the next stage in my career.  Some shifts were painful, others were fun.  It really depends who you are working with.  The experience was very helpful at helping me learn how to deal with all types of people."
good,"I loved to meet the public and provide assistance to them.  Work schedule was so inconsistent you could not plan any off work activities.  Pay insufficient, benefits so-so."
good,i understand being under staffed some times but going in every day knowing there would not be enough staff to take care of the patients the way they deserved made the job unbearable.  along with being bullied by other employees i grew to dread going to work
good,"Management played favorites. If they want to get rid of you, they accuse you of doing something or not doing something so they don't have to give you unemployment after working for them for almost 10 years."
good,hectic and long days. most days worked from open to close by self. not enough other management. job had good benefits but couldnt afford them regularly
good,Walgreens is an okay place to work. I had some issues with a store manager and reported them to corporate. They transferred me to another store but did nothing to the manager.
good,"Because of management issues, the job isn't the best. In a pinch it will suffice. Ever changing store policy causes friction in management and the staff has a high turn over rate."
good,This job was interesting dealing with both the warehouse and the resolution center for inbound/outbound contact for prescriptions and medical work. The workplace can have its ups and downs.
good,"Associates hours have been drastically cut, which in turn, is affecting customer service. They preach Great Customer Service, but employees do the best they can with minimal hours, and that sometimes falls short. Employees are blamed for everything. From lower management to cashiers!  The scariest part, the cut backs are happening within the pharmacy itself, so staff and pharmacists are pushed to the max....most pharmacists work 12 hour shifts with little  or no breaks. Management is not properly trained and the company is begging for assistant managers because current employees do not want to be promoted!!! That is definitely a red flag. Incredibly stressful!!! You are required to work, nights, weekends and ALL holidays!!!! The longer I am with the company, the more horror stories I hear about how this company has been going down hill over the years. When associates are only staying because they are just waiting to retire, that is so sad."
good,"It's a job. The people were nice, and I had a really good experience with most of the management, but there isn't much else to say. Not the worst, hardly the best. If you want a minimum wage job, they have those."
good,"The company in Miami Lakes is a call center environment where the agents are not truly appreciate, no consideration for their needs. "
good,"A typical day would mostly consist of running the register (including cigarette sales), giving sales information to customers, asking if they have a rewards card and signing them up if they don't have one and would like one, and (if you work the shift that ends at 10pm) taking turns with each coworker doing basic cleaning duties (bathrooms, store floors, garbages, etc.). I learned that it was pretty hard to deal with rude customers. That was a small part of the hardest part of the job. The hardest part was being the cashier and having to deal with and be around people at almost every minute. I liked to stock the shelves, work in the photo department, and replace sales tags for each month. I would recommend working here to anyone who doesn't have bad social anxiety (it will affect you quite a bit)."
good,"a typical day starts @3pm and ends at 11 or 11:30 pm, So all you""re doing is working each day by the time you get home its the next day. I learned nothing new from what I used to do at another company. I learned a small piece of photo but I was supposed to be doing the pharmacy training before anything which was promised by my hiring manager which she did not fulfill entirely. Management is draggy and sometimes lazy and not on top of the work like the can be and this is because of the atmosphere created and the lack of regular employees. The hardest part of the job is standing up and being a robot for only 9$ and hr for an 8 or 8 1/2 hr shift. The most enjoyable part was the 15% discount --which by the revenue that Walgreens make is a high disappointment for that in which it gives back to its employees."
good,I worked for Walgreens for close to 10 years. The last two stores I worked at was a joke. All manger and pharmacists need to be fired. No one stands up for employees.
good,"As as cost cutting technique, Walgreens does not like to keep around Store Managers for too long.  As a manger's pay goes up, so does the amount of scrutiny Walgreens puts the veteran manager under.  Ironically, veteran managers with lots of accomplishments over the years are terminated at the highest rate of all managers.  Why? They can be replaced my lower paid managers."
good,I worked with some outstanding people in my tenure at Walgreens. I left because the culture of the facility changed with a change in the management creating a negative and hostile environment. I really do understand the exodus of good people especially within this facility.
good,Demands on finishing your task and others tasks. Could not possibly finish tasks and the countless others in a shift while maintaining customer service. Pay was not acceptable and advancement was not attainable. The good about it was my co-workers. They made the day pass and we all tried to help one another.
good,"Where my store is located, there is no room to grow. I love working here because I have made many friends. I genuinely love to help people. When the company to me does not want to help those who is STRUGGLING to HELP themselves; it HURT everyone."
good,"Your work place environment  will depend on your who shift leads are  and who your manager is runs the store. Other than that the job is boring and menial. The only thing that will make your day better is the customers and the people you work with, so if that is not good then you will hate working there."
good,"Walgreens was an easy job. They worked around my school schedule some of the time(wanted me to get all my classes on 2 days). The work was not very hard only on truck days because some of the totes were way too heavy causes the back problems I have today. The downside is there is not that many employees like it used to be maybe 3 non-management employees there. You really cannot get the work done because there is always one person at the main register, if they helping a customer find something or are on an isle trying to stock the truck they cannot see the customer, while the other person in photo is helping their customers. You tend to get irritated customers you call for management to help and they ask why do you need them where is everyone else. They need to have extra help on truck days or when a reset needed to be done."
good,"Good job, but if you don't click with manager you will not be given opportunities to use your full potential and will only be given menial tasks. Your requests for time off will be denied and you will be expected to fill in any time they need you to."
good,Walgreens cares about Walgreens not about its employees. As much as we enjoy working there it is hard to work for a company that does not support in the security and well-being of the employees yet they want to be known as a caring incorporation for the customers.  Employees matter too.  cutting hours and employees gives us more chance to get robbed.  The people that make the decisions or not people that work in the store they are the people that just are looking at the numbers work in a store for two weeks see what happens.
good,A typical day of being a manager at Walgreen's is pretty stressful. You have to not only worry about yourself and your staff but the employees and manage the entire building by yourself. I constantly worry about the safety of EVERYONE. Not only that you also have to get a boatload of work done while maintaining ordinance within the store.
good,I started off as only a cashier and then moved to beauty advisor. They expect you to be able to run all departments (photo and beauty and run a register). Unrealistic sales goals for the beauty department especially when you factor in the amount of time you spend covering other departments and how little foot traffic some stores get.
good,"I am presently a sales associate with Walgreens and it is a limited job at best to describe."
good,"Employees would walk in late while I'd be about 20 minutes early, not once did I see them get reprimanded whenever they'd be in late. I was late once and immediately got a verbal warning then my hours cut, the management is unstable and scheduling relies more on how many interests you share with them rather than actual work ethic. Absolutely awful."
good,It was a good job to work but I just couldn’t work overnight anymore. I moved up to the manager position in lest then 9 months and fell in love with the atmosphere. I am looking for change. Something diffrent.
good,walgreens doesnt have a same everyday thing its something new everyday today it could be really slow and tomorrow really fast and tiring day. some days are really fun and then again we have those days when we cant wait to get home
good,"A good job to first start out at, but not the type of job most people can do for the rest of their lives. Not enough pay for the work and not enough advancement opportunities for employees."
good,"it is my personal experience that Walgreens does not care for its staff as much as they let on. Customers are frequently allowed to verbally abuse and harass the staff without management standing up for them. The stores, especially in small town settings are plagued by Gossipers and Favoritism. Advancement is not performance based as per company policy, but based on whether or not your immediate supervisor is your best friend. It is not a professional work environment and those who attempt to think for themselves instead of buddying up with the managers are often treated as though they are not members of the team and subject to frequent and, often times, unfounded disciplinary actions."
good,The hardest part of the job would have to be not being able to do my job during operation hour. Having to constantly wait for the weekend to do minor repairs to equipment to make it run efficiently.
good,"It's the typical retail tasks: facing, answering phone calls, customer service, cleaning. Management was ok when I began then it just went downhill from there. It's an exhausting environment. I work 3rd shift and all the problems from day time fell down to us because no one was doing their job. Therefore, not a great place to work at."
good,"Pocas horas, pocos empleados y exigen muchos resultados para las muchas funciones que hay que ejercer. demandan servicio al cliente con unas expectativas ireales a las condiciones de vida actuales. El descuento es bueno y lo que pagan."
good,"I was trained in a variety of jobs from cashiering, stocking shelves, answering phones, photo applications, checking inventory and dates, to training new personal, and of course assisting customers in all aspects of questions and product searches. It was difficult to have a actual routine as procedures and emphasizes were constantly changing without notice which lead to much discord among the employees. Management seemed secretive or just lacked knowledge  of changes until the last minute and then threw everyone into a panic to learn and implement new procedures. A lot was expected of you for little pay, and the longer you were there the bigger the separation was between expectations and compensation. The hardest part of the job was covering a void when another employee called out (we always seemed to be short staffed [poor moral]), but by far the best part of the job was helping the customers and establishing a good relationship with them."
good,"Manager treats bad, no communication, lack of organization, pay low heavy job carrying things too heavy no respect for people. need a big reestructure"
good,Its great if you wanna use this place as a stepping stone. Once you get hired you start off as cashier/pharmacy clerk work your way up. Company pays for your PTCB. No room for career growth but the experience you get dealing with customers is good.
good,"My general manager was absolutely fantastic but the assistant was really cool at first & then changed. She would sometimes be rude, leave earlier than she's suppose to, would create schedules to her benefits. The walgreens I worked wasnt all that great but walgreens in other locations may be great. I didn't really have a great experience working here."
good,"They have pay caps  and the expectation to take crazy from any customer.  If you're a customer, know that your satisfaction will always come at the expense of the employee."
good,I was a cashier attendant and then I was promoted to photo technician. Glad I worked there to get the experience and have some money in my pocket while I was in school.
good,I just feel that I was working beneath my abilities and education in the work field. I worked the cosmetic counter. I was told that part of my position was to clean the bathrooms. Not acceptable. I worked hard to advance in the work field. to just end up cleaning toilets.
good,"I worked at a 24 hours store, the shifts were very long to be standing. You would go to lunch an hour after you got there. They only train you for one place."
good,"as a pharmacy technician, there is zero growth. The pharmacists dont work at all and the technicians end up running the pharmacy with not enough compensation to do so."
good,"You'll never know if you have 25 hrs or 5 hrs a week."
good,The customers are hard to deal with and the management expects too much to be done in one day.  Very fast paced and if seen standing around you get scolded. Must serve all customers and finish all work by end of shift even if it was super busy that day or they get disappointed in you.
good,"Too much transition and rewiring of roles leading to uncertainty and lack of career advancement opportunities."
good,The Walgreens I worked for had a very good manager. He always was personable but ran a tight ship. This was an excellent job for me as it was additional income and close to home
good,Typical work day started at 6 AM and stopped about 7 PM. I learned a lot about the products and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with DC personnel. Being able to help them to be safe and secure while doing their jobs allowed them to work at a fast pace to get the commodities in the right bin to be trucked out to the store.
good,"Highly stressful, low pay, never  40 hours per week always say that they have to cut back but you have to work twice as hard. If people are stressed out mistakes happen and in some positions that cannot be allowed. And heaven forbid you get sick."
good,"My biggest complaints are the below national average pay and the lack of leadership within all management within the company. From staff pharmacist to the district manager, all lack the skills to do their jobs effectively."
good,"A typical day at work, is I go to work expecting to have a good day and be the most productive. I go with a good attitude and always try to have fun at work. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and the employees. I have learned a lot about management and leadership, I've also learned a lot about merchandising and cash management."
good,"Worked at the DC in Windsor Wis for 2 decades and this was a premiere place to work until Boots took over the company a few years back and now it is the bottom of the bucket place to work."
good,"A lot of favorticism, only those who are favored are allowed to advance. The company restructures constantly which leads to no job security. If you provide constructive criticism and it is not agreeing with management you are not allowed to excel and it is taken against you.  Management doesn't care for you as individual, they only care about saving money and your feedback is constantly ignored. HR does not do much to address any issues.  The plus side to my dept is the schedule flexibility which is the only thing that keeps me there."
good,Overall it was pretty cool. I liked the fact that the managers always were open to our opinions. But not very much security. The pharmacy got robbed and I've been paranoid ever since.
good,"If you're the sole provider for your family this will never pay your bills.  It's basically a minimum wage position with the most erratic schedule I've ever seen. Some weeks I'm scheduled 13 hours, others I'm scheduled 40.   I worked both in the main store and in the pharmacy. The co-worker drama is actually minimum.  Any place has gossip, but there are actually entire shifts without gossip, which is rare in tight work quarters, in my experience.  It's an interesting job.  No real training when I came on, but they've been working on that."
good,"This was a fairly simple job and a great change of pace for myself. the hours were alright considering i work second shift most of the time. However, i was still able to have some free time to myself"
good,"𝑻𝒉𝒂thank you, but I will refrain from making any personal opinions about this company on an inside view .  Working in any department wether it be in the main store or in the back pharmacy ."
good,"Overall, this was just a job. Never really enjoyed it because of the basis that you had to do way more than what was your job description(clean dirty bathrooms, take out trash, etc.) The only thing that made this job worth it was the employees. Not the management, but the employees."
good,"I was  hired for a part-time position as a Cashier,and customer service. I worked afternoons and evenings hours. I learned what the customers needed and assisted them in finding the items and checked them out at the registers. I worked with mostly part-time young adults.the workplace culture was generally tense due to the managements style, the hardest part of the job was dealing with the store manager who did not tolerate senior workers very well. The best part was being able to serve the customers and to feel like I represented the store in a positive manner."
good,The leadership is aggressive to force employees to leave if the employee does not listen to them. The workplace is not safe because many homeless people come in to steal stuff during daytime and midnight.
good,"Walgreens is a good job for teenagers who still live at home with their parents,  a nice summer job, and good for retirees, but not for a single parent who's in college looking to purchase their first home like myself..."
good,"poor pay and no raises"
good,This job taught me how to process film and be apart of many individuals most exciting moments.  I was able to here many of their stories.  I also learn the importance of privacy and the laws that affect  what images are allowed to be printed.
good,"your favorite managers get moved to different stores and your left with new managers that think they know everything when they don't, and you have higher ups that think the employees do nothing all day but steal. Plus you have to do with frequent hour cuts"
good,walgreens is a great company more on the retail side but behind closed doors in corporate it was not the best. employees were rude. managers were never around. when you had questions you had to run around the whole warehouse looking for one person. it just wasn't how it was described. if you want attitudes and lack of organization that's the job for you!
good,"Great company with growth opportunities and business resources. Once the company is updated and modernized with  current Pharmacy laws, it will be ready for further growth."
good,"Hours for stores always decrease, company doesn't care about employees, and pay is not what they should be paying. Hard to advance past store level but even working up to shift lead is not work the little extra pay that you get compensated."
good,Low pay. Management at the store I am employed is very degrading and unsupportive of it's employees.  This is not a job for anyone with children or that may want a life outside of work.
good,"they hired me over the phone and did not tell me that i would be a float. they are on a budget when it comes to hours and that is because they are funded. I was not able to drive to most of my store locations and my schedule was made with out my approval because I was a  float. if I was not assigned anything for that day and the manager found something, he would call me and expect me to drop whatever it was that I was doing to report to the site. Alot of the pharmacist had bad attitudes and expected the technicians to do all of the work including most of theirs. some stores were very dirty, bathrooms filthy with plumbing issues."
good,Compensation is fair for pharmacists. Quality benefits. Pharmacists are not given breaks. Minimal staff help. Corporate culture is rapidly changing and personnel is marginalized. Low retention rate of employee;s.
good,New hires starting pay is more than the existing employees.  Walgreens should accommodate the salaries of the existing employees as well.  Fair is fair!! What about the loyalty and respect of an existing employee that has put in the time.
good,"The job isn't hard, but the hours can be bad. Closing at midnight, leaving the store at 12:30 and then having to turn around and be back at 7:00 am the next morning only allows for about four hours between shifts. That is not adequate rest and can lead to bad mistakes that you are then punished for making because you're overtired. The work enviroment and teamwork is really good. The management overall does the best they can, but there is always room for improvement from everybody."
good,"I worked as both staff and PIC. Walgreens is a company that loves efficiency and structure. If you are that type of person, you will enjoy working there."
good,"The workplace was good at first, but very bad as of recent months. The people that are getting hired are constantly calling in sick due to being high school students that want to work whenever they would like to."
good,"There is a lot of favoritism, and I consider myself to be afavorite; however, I am a hard worker and thy take advantage of those who Put in the effort"
good,Needs to work with others work hours better. Hired me and then wanted me to work every holiday. I started there when my son was 4 months old and coming home everynight at 11:30pm wasn't helping with being a single mother also.
good,I had a store manager who was out to get me. I worked the photo booth and we were almost always pretty busy. On top of those duties i would be given extra work to complete in my regular 8 hour shift. pages of stuff to do that i could never complete if something went wrong in photo. several writes up and id had it and left
good,It is a job that pays the bills and allows me to provide for my family. I am fortunate for the opportunity and intend to keep trying my best to be as valuable as I possibly can.
good,Started out the best place to ever work at before being bought by Could be very good place to work for the right person. You need to have the right frame of mind in this business.
good,"Leadership very scattered not all on the same page, a lot of confusion due to this. Overall an okay place to work temporarily but long term there is no place for advancement."
good,The most unprofessional call-center I've ever experienced. Employees often used profanity to other department while transferring calls. The environment is like being back in High school with a bunch of cattiness and disrespect from management and employees alike.
good,I have worked for this company long enough. I have seen this company start off as a great thing but turn into something really horrible. All management cared about was that they were making money they never cared about their employees at all.
good,I will not give a review of this company and the work atmosphere that the company provides. I feel that the  ratings stars given will provide enough information.
good,"The daily operations of working within the pharmacy department consisted of promoting store brand products and hitting goals which I feel takes away from the patient care."
good,"Store managers have very little requirement to be on the floor doing work.  If you are an assistant manager, expect to be able to run the store with very little help from the manager.  It is part of your training.  If you can manage that, you'll make a good store manager."
good,"A typical day at work is full of surprises and you never know what to expect, ranging from the employees to the customers. Just go in with a positive attitude and your day should flow nicely. It is very hard to keep workers including management at my location so it is not very stable as far as maintaining employees. The hardest part of the job is all the task and work piled on any single individual."
good,"It's easy but no opportunities for advancement, work place culture is full of drama. It takes 5-6 years to get promoted, no recognition"
good,"Busy clinic, Epic system, hardest part of job is to accommodate every patient that walks in without an appointment, management is understanding, enjoy meeting people"
good,"The pharmacy was severely understaffed the entire time I worked there, this led to chaotic work days and being unable to provide good service. Rather than the manager try to help out, we were consistently reprimanded and punished."
good,"Retail pharmacy duties, handling customer prescription needs.  Co-workers were friendly and always willing to help out in different departments."
good,people are friendly most of the time customers can be fun and amazing most of the people I work with are fun others act better than you. Having a manager who is not there and when they are there they still are not there. Most important to me are the relationships I have established with most of my regular customer
good,"I'll say if you need a job at the spot and have the chance to get a job at Walgreens is great. But staying there for a permanent job, I wouldn't recommend it."
good,"high volume of customer of interaction, improved my customer service skills, co-workers and management were occasionally acommedating"
good,"Being a Walgreens manager used to be a very rewarding position. In the last five years I have seen the integrity and care of employees take a huge dip. They have made consistent decreases in all of employee benefits. Taking budgeting hours away from both pharmacy and front end, forcing Pharmacist and salary management to work with no lunch breaks in order to keep up with customer demand and meet corporate goals. Lowering profit sharing match and decreasing affordable health care options. The best part of working as a Walgreens Manager is being a team leader. Getting to know my team, showing my appreciation for their hard work as they learn and grow."
good,"title says it all hard work means nothing, its all about sucking up to the managers. pretty typical of retail really. I will say its not all bad there is some good people working there that make it bearable. "
good,"Walgreens is not the ideal place to work. I work 5 days a week but I'm not considered full-time I get less than 80 hours. I've been there for 2 years and I can still only working straight weekends. Management sucks the managers plays favoritism, especially the manager who makes schedules. They say the schedule has to do with seniority but that is BS because I have been there longer than some people and they get better hours and not all weekends. He'll also deny keep denying your availability change requests"
good,"big companies dont really care about their employees , hours get cut all the time , very short break very long shifts, it used to be a great company until management was changed i dont wanna work for a company who think of me as a machine rather than a human being, you're supposed to enjoy work not feel like you rather do anything except being there"
good,I can not sy many things in particular that caused me to lose interest in growing with the company besides the fact that I was not able to juggle my life outside of work due to the stores ours hours
good,"I was paid minimum for being able to work almost every dept, and also not a very safe environment. There was not enough staff to help out with all the duties of the days work. Co workers were very nice and freindly, i was able to build a relationship with them. I did enjoy lunch breaks when i could get a break from all the work and customers and have 30 min to myself."
good,Walgreens was a great job loved it. I just couldn't see how some people became management and why no advancement opportunities where given to me and certain other people. this company need to do better with supervision training and the way they are taught to talk to people. Most complaints that came in were about management.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job, new items, and helping others. Managers and staff very helpful to one another. Why must i say more. It is a large company and growing larger everyday."
good,"Walgreens was/is by far the worst place i ever worked. I dont know what anyone here is saying about it being fair and a nice place they are most likely paid/forced to give a positive review or are just managers. Lines are disgustingly long."
good,"this job was fair, but the management was inappropriate. there was an incident when a quickchange artist scammed us, but then i caught him and he ran. i got wrote up for allowing this to happen but company policy for thefts and robberies was one of complete compliance. my manager punished me for following company policy appropriately. however my experience with my coworkers and everyone else was good. i liked the customers very much."
good,"- a typical day at work"
good,"I would wake up and go to work thinking how I can avoid working today. The work they would assign the new people was just boring slave labor. My managers were nice and cool however the work was the boring part. They would assign clean this, clean this, take the trash out, stuff that anyone could do, but i was promised to work in Photo Lab only."
good,When I would call the managers for help they would take forever to get to the register and would simply upset the customers as well as making me impatient. The co-workers are cool. The discount is handy.
good,"Once at work,"
good,"very stressful atmosphere - pharmacists work alone most of the time and are required to multi-task (wait on drive-thru,wait on counter,answer phone, give immunizations, fill rxs,put orders away, clean,talk with docs et) all without making any errors. store managements likes to call the shots in the pharmacy - district supervisors unfair"
good,I started this job when I was a senior in high school and it was great helping me get through my last year in high school and make it through college. Definitely not career material unless your in corporate.
good,Working at Walgreens used to be great. Hours have been cut to the point where there is not enough help. It is very hard to maintain enough hours to be considered full time.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for if you are looking for job security. It is extremely stressful on a day to day basis. The workload is high and the about of help is low.
good,"Opening and closing the store. I managed money, sales, customer service in both the store and pharmacy. The company has always been about being well and taking care of your customers. I believe that it should also be about taking care of your employees."
good,"Some good managers, a lot of bad ones.  They delegate too many tasks to one associate.  Then they expect you to meet and exceed targeted goals, but how can you do that if you have about 10 things doing at a time. The break room  is disgusting. Most employees are miserable.  They pay is poor unless you are a store manager or assistant store manager"
good,"A commitment to customer service, inventory, and maintenance. I learned how to use a Fuji-film processor. It makes 4x10, 5x7, 4x4, and 8x10 pictures (Matte or Glossy). Management in the workplace was cheerful. The co-workers lacked pride and joy. There were no hard parts to this job, it was very simple. The most enjoyable part was making jokes with co-workers to make the day go faster."
good,the store I worked at was always cutting hours but continuously adding work to the stretched to thin staff. The co-works were the best part once everyone learned to work as a team.
good,This job was very stressful. The Pharmacy was not given enough support to keep up with all of the customers. The customers would get very upset when their prescriptions were not ready. The management was no help. They created a situation where it was impossible to keep up with the work.
good,A day at work consists of dealing with customers and other responsibilities that the manager ask you to do. I learned to be patient and a great teamworker.
good,With all the robberies around Indianapolis you would think Walgreens could do better than a time-delay safe. They care more about their insured C2s than their employees.
good,However; If you make any mistakes you're out! A little too much attitude when asked for help and very deceptive in promotions and advancement.
good,Walgreen's has long shifts with little to no breaks. It was understaffed and overly busy.  My co-workers cared only about themselves and were not interested in doing anything more than required of them. The hardest part was dealing with customers who didn't speak English and having no breaks on holidays.
good,"Stores were increasing revenues and work loads, and simultaneously decreasing number of employees, therefore forcing"
good,"First day of work: no paperwork done including I-9 or W-4, thrown straight to sales floor after promises of training, was unprepared for register, sales, and stocking because I wasn't trained in company policy. Never given an employee orientation, managers were both new to store and had no idea how new hire process worked at this store. Overall, very unhappy with my experience at the store. Was promised a lot and after I was hired, they never followed through."
good,"typical day was being micro managed by store management , I learned how to bite my tongue that's why I quit , management is horrible just down right horrible ..."
good,The Management did not care about your family. You had to week 40 hours a week  for a year with no time of for vacations. Only interested in profit and no work life balance.
good,A typical day was stocking shelves and interacting with customers. Solving customer problems . The best part was the friends I made and the small perks of managing the cosmetic dept.
good,"On a day to day basis it was always the same thing. Come in, great customers, put stock away, check out customers, face the store and do closing duties, repeat."
good,"Assisting customers with online accounts, placing orders and checking order status, troubleshooting computer and website issues.    Great co-workers and some supervisors.  The hardest part of the job is the shift bids and difficult customers.  The best part of the job is helping others when able to."
good,co workers were always fun and easy going. management complete opposite. didn't get paid enough to deal with half of the things I had to do
good,"I enjoyed working here for the most part. The pay was really small for all the work that we have to do.  "
good,"New Retail Pharmacy in Edmonds, WA.  I really enjoy the challenges of retail!  Walgreens is a great place to start, but the company relies a bit too much on centralized corporate decision making, without taking a hard look at the front line. They train their employees to react like robots with customers, but I see their intent to promote a customer focused chain drug environment.  I plan to advance my career in customer service, however, I am seeking a company that is not only passionate about their customers but their greatest assets, their employees."
good,"My duties included cash handling, suggestive sales, assisting customers in search of products needed, telephone answering and directing callers and stocking shelves and arranging displayed products."
good,They would not work around any family issues or children. The most enjoyable part was being able to help people get their medications so they could start feeling better.
good,when I started at Walgreens I was happy but once management changed the sore changed hours were cut.
good,Not alot of room for improvement and management is not very passionate.
good,Overall Walgreens is a great company and has plenty of room for advancement if you are a dedicated person
good,"my day .. setting up photo area, making sure machine strips all come out right, Co workers are great and learned something new almost every day.the hardest part of the day, being able to stay in my area, because I have many more things I have to do.the best part of my some job, just meeting new people and bringing a smile on their faces."
good,"Great upper management, but there was no movement or advancement in the store itself. Other than that it was a decent experience that allowed me to further my customer service experience."
good,"It is not easy being in the graveyard shift, got to know the retail industry and more things to be managed and it is a vast area of study. The management was a little bit into favoritism which most of us do not appreciate."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers however it was a very stressful environment.
good,"the company taught me that you have to be very strong, for it to be a team setting no one worked as a team"
good,"When I started, 6 years ago, Walgreen's was a place I could grow as a manager. Sadly to say, this has changed. I have been reluctant to leave, because I really do love my store, but it has slowly dawned on me that this is not a company that I can be promoted with."
good,"I learned a great deal from working as a Pharmacy Technician and I am very appreciative for a job. However, patients are frequently angered by our productivity and declining facility. It is not uncommon to go through a shift without being yelled at for being incompetent or slow. Corporate officials have refused to provide hours to employees to deal with the influx of patients from the neighboring hospital."
good,"nice place to work, except hours provided. management is helpful, customers are polite.mostly clean workplace."
good,Overworked and under paid. Company expects too much and does not provide adequate hours to staff pharmacies.
good,"CEO/Board has sold out to Wall Street. This company used to care about its' employees and took care of their own. That is no longer the case. While Walgreens earns record profits, the executives are lining their pockets with fat bonuses, while they slash budget hours and eliminate positions."
good,"a lot of hard work, always something to do. you may get enjoyment helping customers. fellow co workers. often times breaks are minimum."
good,i had more duties than anyone else at that company and wasn't appreciated for the work i did since i started working there
good,"people were always frustrated and would blame it on me"
good,A typical day at Walgreens is Hell..!!! The customers are very rude and needy. The mangement was ok except for the store manager was never there. My co-workers and I got along pretty good we perform workflow very good.
good,I liked working here but the management is unfair. They will keep your hours below 40 so that youll be considered part time and wont be eligible for benefits.
good,One manager is very rude to the employees. Another manager is extremely lazy sits in the office eating chips and watching movies even falls asleep in the break room while all the employees get his work done. The store manager is never in the store and really doesn't care about the well being of the store. They will work you crazy hours where you cant see your family. The walgreens company is a great company but this key largo store is a bad location. You will end up quitting because you are treated like a dog instead of an employee.
good,worked for retail before this is not the best of places to work
good,There were many scheduling conflicts and poor communication between employer and employee
good,"a typical day- answered phones, worked on incoming referrals, scheduled appointments, worked reports. Handled all Spanish calls and patients. Collected copays from patients and went over benefits."
good,Management lack attention and constant reminders. My co workers were a mixed bunch. I learned that there is always room for improvement and dependablity is not valued with this company.
good,"Had great relationship with co- workers, I learned more about being a team player and how to adjust to change. Management was fair. The job was not stressful and the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my co- workers everyday."
good,"If you are a loud mouth smoker then you can get a promotion. Also some managers are capable of stealing from the store and never get caught. Being a manager is great because you are allowed ten to fifteen, twenty minutes smoke breaks, and you can bring a friend! Also managers can sit on their fat butts in the office and read or play games for half the shift. Lunch breaks are as long as you want! I'm sure not all stores are like this, but the one in Newnan is not where you want to be. Thomas crossroads and peachtree city are great, Newnan is not. "
good,"-I've been on the register an on the floor multiple times, and though we have a steady customer basis there is always room to do other activities. While working on the register I've done other activities such as: cleaning large glass windows, vacuum, organize, aisle maintenance, and generally what needs to be done."
good,"I worked a lot of mid shifts and night shifts to secure my morning hours, halleluah when I achieved that!!! Outstanding customer service comes naturally to me and I love the opportunity to talk to different people every day as well as my regular customers. What I learned is that you never assume anything about anyone. Someone might treat you poorly one day, but you have no idea what is going on in that person's life. Always treat everyone with the same respect no matter what. The hardest part of my job was not being able to get all of my chores done on really busy days because I feel that I have to finish whatever I start. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I made a difference and touched each customer's life in some way every day. I once had a customer tell me that when she came into the store she was in a really bad mood, but after talking to me I had her in stitches and she said she was going to go home and have a really good night. That certainly made my day too!"
good,"New management came in and changed everything. I went from 40 hours a week to 15. All management nit picked and would ask you every ten minutes ""What are you doing""? It became very stressful and was asked to do to much during a 8 hour shift while focusing on all customers. Co workers were great. Learned great customer service."
good,"inventory counts daily, working with customers and maintaining department daily chores. To make sure each and every customer is taken care of from the moment they walk in the door."
good,I really like that Walgreens promote good health and wellness. They have great customer service and the customers are familiar with the atmosphere. I really like working there because you create great relationships with most of your customer and that makes them loyal.
good,"I learned alot from my time at Walgreens. I feel that they pay far more than other retail pharmacy in the same category. However, I feel that as a company they are losing sight of what their customers really want out of their pharmacy experience. I have also come to be very disappointed in the management. The management structure and discipline policy is virtually non-existent."
good,Leadership are pharmacists vs. true business people and make near-sighted decisions. Little accountability.
good,I have been with Walgreens for 6 years and I have an education background and I really believe Walgreens do not promote from within the company.
good,"walgreens is taking away most of all bonuses for managment pharmicist, senior pharmacy technician,at my store they throw you in the pharmacy and say learn it with no training at all. Then they yelled at you for not knowing the job.I only work here to make money so i can pay my bills, so now i'm transfering to another state where people are nicer in hopes that all walgreens stores are not run the same way..."
good,Been working at walgreens for three years feel that its time ti expand my learning experience in a different field in a different career
good,"Cash out customers, customer service, stocking."
good,"Managing, people, time, company cash and other resources."
good,"opportunity to meet and overcome obstacles on a daily basis. something to learn everyday which encouraged me to become a better person, and better emplotyee"
good,"I decided to become a pharmacy technician because of the service at my local pharmacy. I was privileged to be hired even before I finished school, and learned quickly how to navigate their systems. Many of my coworkers were very good about teaching me not only what I needed for my job, but the things I needed to advance. Most of my pharmacists were very good at gently correcting my mistakes (which every new employee just starting in any new field would make)."
good,Everyday I check my cash draw to make sure the money is all there. Get ready to answer any question(s) from any customer(s) or co-worker. I have learned how the store run and watch each individual customer that come in store. I work well with the management and the store manager and sometime with some of the co-worker.
good,"typical day.. very fast-paced-sometimes very chaotic. I learned great knowledge of medical terminology and facts. The management was typically friendly, sometimes distant. The co-workers were trained to work together, but was very difficult at times due to high stress. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the co-workers, and insurance issues. The most enjoyable part were the customers."
good,"This company is very strict on how it handles its employees. You are constantly micro-managed to accomplish more duties than physically possible to cut corners and costs for the company. I worked as a cashier and they are treated the most poorly. Aside from obviously checking out customers, you must stock your area (which includes all aisles up by the cashier) while maintaining a watchful eye of the register, clean the floors at night (while your open!) and perform several duties that spread you thinner each day. All the while, your breaks and lunches are highly monitored and you are constantly encouraged to take less that thirty minute lunch breaks to avoid being written up. This company is also highly inflexible for providing days off and for leaving work early for special circumstances. Management positions are handed down mostly by a ""who you know"" basis and from what I saw, the men are preferred in those positions. This is a high stress environment, especially if you are employed in a busy area. I'm sorry to sound so bitter but I have never walked out on a job before or since this one. Think carefully before you accept a position here."
good,Very productive gained a variety of retail experiences
good,"it was ok when i started working there because i needed the job BUT in the end its not worth it... pharmacy act like they own the world... SOME customers racist, the job is depressing... ask u to do too much"
good,• Read and reviewed prescriptions; evaluated for missing information and processes data entry into the system.
good,"this is a company that continually shows market growth yet it plays take-away with promotions and pay increases and any upward mobility. work schedules are designed to keep employees from seeking alternative employment. enslaved to the company and the benefits (health care), the only way out is quit or be fired"
good,"Work is technical, but title is CSR so they can pay you less. Attendance policy sucks. Only allowed 5 unexcused absences per year, including sick days. You have to use your PTO if you call on sick."
good,Compensation for role and responsibilities did not match market store managers start out at 40k depending on what part of the country. Hard to get raises and you will never get a bonus because of the scale they used to calculate
good,"After working for Walgreens for more than 4 years, I've seen more people come and go from the store than I ever have anywhere else. I love the people I work with, but management makes the job awful."
good,"Depending on the store and their managers they’ll work with your schedule, bad thing about this company that I’ve witnessed Over the years, is that when a member of management had been accused of inappropriate behavior the company makes sure to transfer that manger to another store so the cycle just continues, a great example of this is  a manger that is greatly involved in their  toy drives"
good,"Main branch location stays super busy. The management under staffs, and does not give enough hours to pay bills and in general live off of. You are given multiple tasks in several location of the store at once to all get done pretty much right that minute. No matter how hard you work you are always ""coached"" that you are essential not good enough and won't make it during the holidays. They make it sound like even though you are running around non stop the entire shift that you are sitting in the middle of the aisle twiddling your thumbs and ignoring everyone. They throw you into things without training that you are not comfortable with with the excuse that they are paying a lot of money for you to be there. There are sneaky shift leads, some that talk down to you and treat you as if you are a child and others who tell lies to upper management about you."
good,"Walgreens used to be for and by the employees to help and better a customers visit. Now it’s all about compliance, don’t worry about the customers worry about the compliance duties and task before anything or anyone else. It’s a very down grading feeling when customers ask for help and you have to either ignore or very quickly take care of the customers needs. It used to be customers first shift task second now it’s shift task first customers when and if you can."
good,It is a great place to work but hard on the body from standing and bending over all day. The pay is not horrible but should be better for the amount of skills required for the job.
good,Very fast paced and alot of computer work with insurance but it is a very good company to get started with a career and get your certification in being q pharmacy technician ..
good,Management will not teach you anything.  Everyone is out for themselves.  They are never satisfied and always expect more.  Management also is not allowed breaks.  Just dont get your hopes up.
good,"The money is in the pharmacy learn that you get paid more being a cashier is lame. The job wasn't hard just tedious like any other retail gig, it's a decent job for beginners shows you how toxic ppl are."
good,Just a stepping stone job. Should be looking for another job; work hours are up to their whim. Job can also be gone at any moment if someone in the higher ups disliked you.
good,"The actual work was enjoyable and not stressful, however, the management is really bad. The store manager is actually great and he would always help with everything. Unfortunately, one of the managers was the complete opposite and would always talk bad about employees. The discount is okay I guess."
good,If you are still home with your parents this is a great job for you I worked there for four years and never got a chance to move up in the company the schedule was not good enough
good,"i learned a lot here. job was easy to do. management was difficult to work with at times. job isn't stressful. i learned cashiering, after that i was taught to do the photo lab. stocking is easy but has to be done in a timely manner"
good,Everyones experiance is different. I was able to get some critical training that aided me in my next stepping stone but I was upset or uncomfortable most of the time. I had a great experiance with the company in Illinois however after my transfer out of state I found it difficult to feel like a true part of the team.
good,"If you are not your store managers favorite or kiss up, then you will not be getting a promotion. "
good,I worked at walgreens for about 5 says. On the 3rd day they had me join the pharmacy sorting/counting/separating medicine. I had absolutely no pharmacy training and no college. It was way too fast paced with no training and too much on the line if it was the proper medication. Mgmt couldnt handle employees making the work place miserable. All of the people working there hated it and I didnt want to be one of them in a few months time. Shopping there is great but I would look for something else.
good,The job was easy but as a college student I want looking forward to closing at 11 every night and then having to wake up early for school. It is a good job if you can work the hours they give you
good,"Work/life balance is of no importance at this company, benefits are good, management is good in some departments, the hours are not good for family life"
good,"In management work is extremely stressful. Very few times you will leave work feeling like you finished all you had to do. This can have an effect on your work/personal life balance. "
good,"Expecting too much from pharmacists with no help, compensation sucks.  Management doesn’t care. Company too number focused and could care less about employees."
good,You can grow at this company if you apply yourself. The opportunities are there but hard to accomplish without the help of the right person. There are some very good people there to work under and learn from.
good,Shareholder value is the only thing that matters to Walgreens Boots Alliance today. It was once a special place to work and grow but has since been bought and employees are no longer considered a valuable asset.
good,just like I mentioned above they keep people that don't do anything because they have been there to long so you find yourself working three jobs for one person
good,"No work-life balance and salaried employees expected to work all hours and days of week."
good,"The store is a great place to work but management needs improvement.No security,no communication between management and associates. Multiple task for one employee because the store is short staffed"
good,"This company used to be a great company to work for until it was bought out by someone else. Less pay, no compensation. More work with no bonus, or anything. Customer base is great and you will have your fun moments working. Just requires quite a bit of patience. There are some good stores and some bad. All depends on who the store manager is and how the store is ran. They don't take care of people who have given their time to this company for so many years."
good,Walgreens has completely changed since they merged with Boots. The people who run the company do not have a solid business plan. It’s a high stress low pay occupation now. It hasn’t always been this way. Sad
good,"I love my job. The job was never the issue. Low pay, favoritism, not being able to advance, lack of organization, poor Management..those things slowed down my drive and motivation."
good,"I would advise that you be very flexible. There is no set schedule and if you need time off for something, put it in as soon as possible. There is a lot of stuff to do, and they have policies in place for just about everything."
good,"I enjoy working with the people I work with but at the end of the day, I get paid Customer Service pay and do SFL work like it’s okay. I don’t get paid for it, I don’t want to do it. But in order for me to advance I have to give them my all."
good,"-A company routinely adapting to deliver on the Customer and Patient experience in a shifting Industry environment.  "
good,"working at wags is stressful, most managers are helpful, the pay is low promotional opportunities are rare but the medical insurance is great! most coworkers are lazy and push work off on others and managers don't seem to care."
good,Some managers will try to hold u back in the company. My area there is a lot of bias individual whom will never have a good review when raises are concern.
good,"Good part time for a college student but there is alot of nepotism within the company. In addition, it is very fast paced which is a good thing and a bad thing."
good,"Manager needs to make sure employees do their job and confront when lacking. Employees need to show up to work and work, not show up to work and do nothing. Supervisor acts like the store manager while supervisor does nothing."
good,Not such a nice place to work for. If you were not a favorite you got treated poorly. All the top management didnt want to take responsibility for themselves. Made it a hostile work environment
good,"Over the 21 yrs I worked in the pharmacy I learned alot about medication,  good recommendations on over the counter medication. I also made great customers that became loyal to me and enjoyed my help. Most customers would travel to my store cause they enjoyed my customer service. "
good,It not the best eviroment. Not flexible hours or constant hours. No good people to work with. A bit of a mess most of the time in my expierience..........
good,"Now I will say this. There are some wonderful stores out there. That being said, that number is probably only in the double digits. Most stores are run like franchises prices vary at stores as do the rules the managers choose to follow. Where I worked there was 0 accountability. One guy did basically nothing called out over 12 times within his first 6 months and lost thousands dollars of merchandise. He is still working there. And is not performing any better. They don't care about anything as long as the day to day continues. There is also a huge budget slashing so walgreens corporate offices can keep their bonuses. The hours are lower than they have ever been and will not go up any time soon. All walgreens is concerned with is cutting employee benefits to buy back their stock to keep themselves profitable. They just announced they are slashing vacation time by almost 80% and if you don't use what you have within the next months you lose it all. They are also constantly pushing out people who worked there for a long time to avoid paying them benefits. Also customers are jerks in most areas. Also when the minimum wage increases walgreens doesn't compensate others so new people can make just as much as people who have worked here for years. Also the pay caps are a joke. 4$ above starting pay and a 50 cent raise every year IF your lucky."
good,the management at my store was terrible but the job itself really isn't too bad. The chance for advancement was also slim so this makes for a nice side gig to make a little extra cash.
good,I wasn't respected or even liked. My name was always something different no matter how many times i reminded them of the correct way to say it. They just didn't care.
good,Once the day stared it was busy ether with customers or inventory. everyone was willing to help when in need. Management was understanding when a problem arose.
good,"Managers and assistant managers just have bad attitudes against their employees  Manager is all the time slamming doors, slamming the cash register’s,"
good,"Co-workers pretty cool, Managers are cool too but want to work you to death. Walgreens is a job for someone that isn’t in school or is taking a break from school. If you’re young/in high school or college don’t work at Walgreens. They don’t understand the meaning of being flexible I literally basically had to threaten to quit so they can lower my hours because I was falling behind on my school work really bad. Customers are rude and nasty they treat you like you’re not a human and don’t have feelings."
good,"a typical day at work is just come in clock in and get a report on what needs to be done this is typically written on a clip board then the manager is supposed to give a 5 minute meeting that breaks down sales of the week, need to know info. like watch for bad coupons, e.t.c. then you would have the Shift leads tell you what needs to be done, on average you cant find a telson (item scanner) so you wont be able to do much till ones available. then you would just put items on shelves and ask cusomers if they need help. if your a cashier then you got it made. all you do is check people out and maybe restock the first 2 isles if you got time. the cashier is the best job to get unless its management. if your a floor worker good luck to you getting a promotion or any advancement."
good,very friendly people. Constant resets of merchandise. Numerous ware house deliveries each week. must be able to work multiple counters at the same time.
good,"Sadly,  very good place to work but the hours are not there. The one I worked at the management was very good and very well ran. But Walgreens in general the hours are messed up."
good,"Was thrown into Assistant Store Manager position without receiving proper detailed training.."
good,not a bad place to work. if you have good management then you will be fine. if you have bad management that is bias then it can be tough. would recommend and see how you like it
good,Do not work for walgreens. My walgreens treated me really badly. I was assaulted. Racism. Made me work that i was never trained for. NEVER work for walgreens.
good,"Walgreens was always a comfortable and happy place to work. However, recently the company began making changes which made work and life balance almost impossible."
good,"Walgreens as a company is a very easy job, however the managers and higher staff tend to target associates that they don't like, I worked for Walgreens for 3.3 years and during this time only one manager I've worked with made her store feel like a team effort and not like high school social clicks the said part of it all was during this time a lot of the quiet employee always housed the best ideas. While there i felt if a manager didn't like you personality or interest it was like walking on eggshells until you could find a transfer. I am so glad to be out of that job, but i will definitely miss the friendships i made throughout the district. I wouldn't recommend this company as a place of employment. The pro however to this job ultimately are training for your Tech 1 and tech 2 license. Learning how western Union work and policies, Overall Pharmacy Training,  Photo Services Training and Most importantly the experience."
good,Walgreens is not that bad of a place to work. It’s a place to start off. They pay decently but the hours are very inconsistent. The managers depending on who they are could either be fair and nice or horrible.
good,a typical workday can be described as either cashiering or getting tasks done as delegated by the shift lead. I learned how to properly cashier and how to run the photo lab. Management was rough after our former store manager left for another store.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for its just a little too task oriented and not enough associates on the floor. The biggest problem is in the pharmacy.
good,"I did not feel great after knowing that things were not be apprreciated including me for, I place things in the right places. My superiors do not. For, I was penalized for not having my game on. and so, I lost working there and I was so mad because, I was comfortable there and there was no getting around it."
good,"Was a great place to work until late 2000's - upper management forced by large equity investors to focus more on shareholder returns than on running a company where all felt like ""family"".  Lots of tricks to maximize dividends for shareholders at expense of employees. Stores now run by corporate ""bean counters"" rather than by local store management.  Lowest-level cashier/stocker paid below prevailing ""starting"" wage for area, but doesn't have much responsibility.  Management seeing compensation/opportunities for advancement steadily eroding, as managers are now being hired from outside the company, rather than being developed and promoted from within."
good,"It's a decent job, impossible to get full-time before they just hire someone in for full-time. Cant really advance unless you're hired as full-time. Tasks are quite tedious and repetitive."
good,"Constantly understaffed, while dealing with aggravated patients. Work atmosphere was tolerable. Co workers were friendly and would help you out. If you worked in the pharmacy it was a privilege to use the bathroom or eat a meal on shift."
good,When it was family own they cared about there employees. As soon as corporate industry took over cuts and less employee care. Now you cant find any help due to those cuts thinking to save a dollar then give customer assistants.
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work at. It has its ups and downs though. Like inconsistent hours, nobody is on the same page, and bad team work from some co-workers. "
good,Was an ok job but could have been way better management could have been better only thought of them selves it takes way to long to get a raise and it wasn’t a fun environment
good,"This job did teach me how to lead people, learn to take on responsibility for a whole store. These just was not much help from store manager at all. She just wanted to micromanage and the store was failing."
good,Opportunity for growth in the company and a great learning experience. The store is always short staffed and the scheduling leaves little room for a personal life. There is no set schedule.
good,A company that values a person by how they look. I was in the Marketing department doing finance. They allowed racism in the company. I never complained but these racist individuals complained constantly about me. So much I was forced to write a complaint in defense. I just did my job. I was however aware of how people where acting around me. Overall where I worked it was extremely racist. I think in other areas its not so bad. But even when trying to move out to other areas it became impossible because the management was afraid of losing their job. It was a lot of reorganization when I came in. They did not handle the change very well.
good,Ok place to work. Don't stay more than a few years unless you plan on moving up in the company. The work is the same at all stores. The difference will be with the people you work with. If you're lucky you'll get to work with people who actually do their job. If not you might get stuck with co-workers who are lazy and incompetent and like to gossip and complain about co-workers who actually work.
good,"depending on your position, its nothing more than a simple retail job working at the register or stocking shelves. Your work experience will honestly depend on your manger as that will either make it a fun or bad experience."
good,"My particular Walgreens went through a round of managers during my time, the only competent engaging ones ended up going to different stores. As a part time worker I got it pretty easy but it was unnecessary stress and uccooperative coworkers that really killed the job for me. Evenings ended up having 3 people run the whole store and that just doesn’t work and would end up having to stay late to clean up. Incompetent shift leads that milk the clock forcing us to stay until midnight ended up causing terrible lack of sleep for a full time student. But like I said, the competent ones left, so I was left with that garbage."
good,"I am currently still working for the company going on 9yrs but am looking for a better job, hopefully something comes around soon. Too stressfull especially when the thieves come in and there's isn't a thing you can do about it"
good,"Ok job for anyone who needs to make money. Hours are debatable, hard to get good daytime hours. Short lunch no breaks. A lot is expected of you. Training is not very good, i was expected to learn the photo lab during Christmas season because the main person was out for medical reasons so i had very little training and had to teach myself through many mistakes. I was asked to work in liquor even though i did not have my certification to sell in that department. They had to shut down liquor on a busy day because the person who was supposed to work that day called in and i refused to work in there so they were upset that they lost money because of this. They also wanted to start cutting hours so it was hard to stay on a five day a week schedule."
good,Communication between management and employees can be somewhat frustrating. Store managers tend to believe that the company runs according to their personal policies.
good,I hate my job. that's why im looking for better employment. there isn't enough men working here for the things they want u to do. the pay is very low and they don't give annual raises or any for that matter
good,They want to improve the work enviroment inposing the lean culture to all employee discriminating to people who dont care about that type of culture thank you
good,"I really enjoyed greeting people when they walk in the store and as they were leaving. Helping people find what they needed, letting them know when things were on sale and so much more."
good,"Not enough staff due to strict budget hours."
good,Productive workplace due to they budgeting it becomes stressful when its not enough employees working. A ton of work is put on one person an it becomes overwhelming. Plus they not paying enough to even go through all the stress. Only thing keeps me there is my flexible scheduled I receive now an it was a lot to even get this scheduled I have. Guess you have to be grateful for a job some people don't even have that. Just want a better job making more money more benefits an a comfortable place to work.
good,The hours are as good as you want them to be. But occasionally you can be given a lot of hours or too many hours. The benefits are decent. But the management is beyond terrible.
good,"The company overall is ok, but like all large retailers, they are cutting hours in their stores in order to cater to shareholders. It's fine if you don't need a lot of hours, but don't expect much more than that."
good,the assistant manager was really weird and he has no respect for personal space. The job is without a doubt the easiest job you can get. My store manager has mentored me the past 3 years and has helped me tremendously in my military and civilian life.
good,"Pharmacists and pharmacy managers are under strict liability per state pharmacy regulations.  In order to protect a pharmacist license and shield the company from loss, good teamwork is required to accomplish daily loss control tasks."
good,Very good culture to work along side people with disabilities and engage at high levels every day.  Benefits could be better being this is a company that champions health and wellness.
good,But it all denpends on the people you work with. If you work with harding people who understand the concept of working as team. Then it's not a bad place to work.
good,"Is a easy job to do, the payment is not the best but not the worst either. Is not a good environment, not transparency on policy."
good,I would say it has it's ups and downs.  My sift was switched. I was told I would be working the morning sift and I waited about 5 months for the shift.  I never got it.  I was scheduled mostly afternoons.  I had no time with my child.  Meanwhile they had employees whos children were grown working the hours that parents needed. They do have great health benefits.
good,Seemingly never-ending hours of doing monotonous things. It was boring and it seemed like the only fun part of it was buying food at a very limited discount.
good,A lot of the culture of the company was in transition when I was working there so there was a lot that they could have improved on. One of my PICs unfairly passed a lot of great techs for an additional raise that was approved by corporate.
good,A productive environment with a high turn-over rate. Minimal training required to be a floor associate. There was more exposure than in other work places to theft of merchandise.
good,"Walgreens is a billion dollar business and I have enjoyed working for them for many years but there is a problem within the corporate makeup of the company that makes working there a challenge."
good,"i work in the evening"
good,Pay doesn’t match work. Open all year round and there is no excused sick days. Dk I if this goes for all stores but management is immature and loves to gossip.
good,"Walgreens was okay at times, awful at others. The company kept trying to do more for their customers while forgetting about their employees. The pay wasn't great, hours were all over the place, management was lacking. Corporate wanted to be able to do more with less, even if it meant making their employees break under pressure,"
good,i was a stock and cashier clerk there and this place really needed good management which never happen while i work there. the employees there were a great to be around most ot the time. My duties were not overly bearing and most of the time i was happy there
good,the fact that now a day you have to watch everything you say and do is so bad to work in public not say one word out of thanking or welcoming your customers
good,"The day consists of checking-out customers, stocking, organizing shelves, and cleaning. Learned how to work with people even when they make it hard. Management was initially poor, but new manager treats us with equality. The work culture is lazy, but i love to always move and work. The hardest part is working with people who are unreasonable and being criticized for small things."
good,Bad communication between managers & employees not much training low paid it could be a nice place to work but currently is not. I think it just needs a whole new management staff.
good,"Though i have learned alot with this company, there are many reasons why I seek other available options.  The most important issue that I have with the company is the lack of advancement."
good,"Learned lots of different things. Hardest part was not strangling people, management and customers. Management told lots of lies with false promises. Didn't actually care about employees. Lots of drama. Loved working in photo and making things in photo but that was about it."
good,"My place was wonderful, I was family with all my coworkers and life was good. It was a great place, but then we got new managers and people and the store went to the bottomless pit. Thats why I quit walgreens, but depending on the people you get, you'll enjoy your life there. We got raises upto 9.50/hr for cashier or CSA. Which was good however, new managers, no hours. I only got 1 day a week and had to look for new jobs."
good,I worked for Walgreens for 3 years.  Assistance that took the store manager's car for a wash and paid for it would get promoted.  The hours were all over the place without consideration for PTO or special circumstances. I was called in often on short notice to cover for a sick co manager but would be forced to work while sick myself due to threats of loosing my job.  This could have been the culture at this one particular location but it was still condoned by corporate HR even after documentation and complaints were handed in by multiple assistant managers.
good,Walgreens was a good job to have while being in college. They were very flexible with hours and worked around my school schedule. Unfortunately I had to leave because it became overwhelming.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work at. They offer benefits for their employees, they work with you on scheduling etc. I really enjoy working there a lot."
good,"This place didn't listen to their employees. Also, wouldn't take back the opportunity that I had with them. I was able to move from Photo Specialist to Shift Lead in less than 6 months."
good,Typical day at Walgreens is busy. The company isn't terrible. Payrate needs to go up and maybe hire and train within before outside. Walgreens has taught me to be a lot more patient. The hardest part of my job is not being able to help every customer.
good,Walgreens is a good company itself. But not a lot of room to grow or move up in the company. I dont feel like they appreciate their employees as much as they say they do.
good,"I think it had to do with the location being at soutel  walgreens, but the managers didn't like to help when there were problems only management could take action on, there were many rude customers so I really appreciated the nice customers twice as much as normal. So much work to do for the little amount of pay, I was a cashier, beauty advisor, photo specialist, stalking shelves all in one day because we were short of employees and none of the managers would come to help."
good,"Good benefits and flexible hours."
good,"The environment depend on your management, the management where I worked you wasted time doing small little task they could've fixed walking by but make you do it. The only positive was flexible works hours."
good,"The location I was at had very few shift leads who would come out of the office during their shifts, some who were never on time, and others who would spend the entire shift in the office on the phone with their friends or family.  Most of the managers at my location were also very likely to pick favorites then sabotage anyone who was attempting to go after the same promotion as their faves so that they could help their friends get the leg up, even over people who had been there longer."
good,From open to close it is like any other retail store. From stocking shelf to helping people all around okay. Managers are selfish and makes the schedule around their own personal gains and when they feel like working instead of keeping it fair. They never keep promises or try to move you up in the ranks.
good,Working at walgreens really depends on the manager and location. I worked for walgreens for 3 and a half years and recently quit due to the manager. Give it a shot if you get the opportunity too
good,Customer care product overview cash handling product placement stockroom clean unload trucks receive deliveries post all deliveries in the system do price changes make sings
good,"very clicky company in Florida , not the company they where 6 yrs ago , they hire outside the company and from within. pay is not good for leads/asst.  managers $14.50 cap and do to the restructuring of management promotions are limited .3-4 per year in a county. ""leads to assistant store managers """
good,"Management was immature about handling the staff,was very ""High School""esque in the manner in which employees were viewed or treated. I learned that I had been very naive about what the ""healthcare"" field really cares about as far as neighborhood pharmacies. The hardest part of the job was the politics of not only the workplace but dealing with the Insurance companies and their various policies in what is covered and what isn't. The most enjoyable part of the job in my personal opinion was when I would call home and have either my wife or two kids answer the phone and I would tell them I was on my way home."
good,"I work very hard. I show up on time, I don't miss work yet my hours get cut without notice. I am paid bottom dollar for my field and after my annual review (at which I was promised a raise upon hiring), I was surprised to learn that there would not even be a cost of living raise for the year. It is a high stress, laborous job with very little reward. I recommend finding any other place to work if you are trying to be a pharmacy technician. They care about company profit not about employee's well being. We are all disposable and replaceable. They are now cutting most full time hours so they can cut benefits most likely in a ploy to cut loose some of the higher paid positions so that they can hire a new wave of pharmacy staff at lower wages. Also, they create tons of garbage every day in just one store alone I would say about four 30 gallon cans full of paper are just wasted. They do not recycle any of the plastic bottles or the paper. If you do the math.. there is a walgreens roughly every 3 miles across the nation and none of them practice any recycling of their tons of garbage created every day. Bag after bag of plastic bottles and huge piles of paper just tossed into the trash several times a day. It is sad. All they are concerned with is profit. And if you try to speak up, you are replaceable."
good,"You learn a lot about nothing really. Most of your day is spent running around like a headless chicken dealing with stocking shelves, unloading trucks, helping customers, relieving cashiers and being yelled at for not doing enough, not being in two places at once or not wearing their stupid shirt (when it is freezing outside). They don't pay enough and most managers are egotistical people."
good,The company now cares more about what everyone is doing and not about the employees. They do not take the time to listen to the employees and it makes it hard for employees to want to keep positive.
good,`walgreens is a place where nothing is ever fair in my experience i was treated terrible never honored my pto even if i put it in months in advance it was just stressful
good,"personally my experience wasn't all that good, especially when there is more than one manager on duty and they want you to do many different things at once, and have bad attitudes."
good,They need more structure and guidance. The manager hardly new what was going on. People would come in and steal things and nobody did a thing  Really needs to hire security.
good,NO breaks. 30 minutes lunch.  Stressful.  Management  does not back up employees.  Workflow is not as good as it should be.  Customers have attitudes as soon as you say may I help you. But I like helping when I can.
good,"Starting out is good the managers put you with someone so you can shadow them until you get comfortable and you do a bunch of online teachings to get you prepared. However the longer you are with the company the less opportunity there is for promotion. At my particular walgreens store the work environment is very negative and my coworkers do not support the walgreens motto of teamwork and the management does not work to improve the areas that need it. Also, if you show you have a good hard working attitude at my store the management team will rely heavily on you while others get by doing the bare minimum. Now I know not all walgreens stores are the same and if you are looking for part time work and want to give them a chance I would say go ahead. However given my experience at my particular store I would not recommend it for any long term career."
good,"No balance between work and real life. No flexibility in scheduling. Hired in as a beauty advisor, but in reality they want you to be loss prevention. Training in beauty department that you never actually get to use."
good,"Training classes were never fully available"
good,"I am open to discussing my opinions about Walgreens in an interview. I did work there for a few years, and because of this I had opportunities to work under different management."
good,"I do not enjoy the idea of continuing to need to work for this company."
good,"Always short of staff and not enough help. Also, not enough  hours for all employees. Break room is used for overstock of anything. No breaks if you do not ask for one."
good,"Communication is something that was always lacking at any location I worked at, one manager tells you something but someone else comes and tells you something different. You could also always tell who their favorite employees were (which I am aware that this is something that is normal in the workforce) but they had no problem making it obvious and making the rest of us feel like children. Some of the management would put their work off onto some of the associates because they felt they had more important things to do. They also did not really believe in teamwork, micro-managed on the unimportant details and they also showed they did not trust any of their employees."
good,It takes a lot of sacrifice of time and emotions to work there. I started to get panic attacks because it's high pressure for little return of interest.
good,"Like every other retail setting. The job is not worthwhile unless you have good management and people will actually pull their weight. I do, however, like how accepting the company is."
good,My pharmacy manager is amazing and the best boss I've ever had but the current store manager is a joke. The pay is not worth the hassle that you have to go through.
good,Total employee benefits diminished from year to year. Training for job was good. Requirements to meet yearly goals for all management levels was nearly impossible.
good,"Good job but hours are not good and inconsistent. It is a good job, but often stressful. Customers are nice, but some are very demanding and sometimes abusive. Workplace culture needs improvement. Sometimes employees are not always recognized for their good work and management needs to be more responsive to the needs of employees. Best part of the job is seeing the babies and I love babies. Worst part is the afternoon shift. A lot of thefts go on there and there is not enough security. I want to go someplace with earlier hours and better benefits."
good,Fast paced job if you're working overnight you have extra work to do. It wasn't for me I think it's more for students. It's an okay place but I rather not be there
good,"I worked there for a very long time and they treat you poorly. You get very small raises. They say that they are a family oriented job but when you call out for bereavement, good luck at getting any kind of time off or sympathy"
good,The manager would cause so much drama between employees and the employees being all female would always start unnecessary drama and it made it difficult to advance because everyone was against each other.
good,"the days go by fast. I did learn a lot about ordering, scheduling, and inventory Management was investing in seeing me succeed in my position as a beauty advisor. I also went to classes on skin care and make up"
good,"I worked one day a week a this job while going to school. There is no option for advancement, pay is minimum wage, you are always on call because so many workers call in. Bonus was the discount on items and the employees and management were friendly."
good,"Although they did try to work around my school schedule before I graduated, Walgreens always came first no matter what. Management would listen, but there was never any follow through. This all depends on what store you work at. I had highs and lows with this establishment. For me, this was a good learning experience but not something permanent."
good,The higher up bosses don't care about you. They feel as you are very easy to be replaced and it shows in everything they do. I worked there over a year and never received a raise on my evaluation but people working there a few month that did nothing got a raise. They did this when they found out I was going to be leaving after I had my son.
good,Fun experience. Stacking was a challenge but overall it was good. Good people friendly and helpful. Had a good time.Cleaned and organized lots of work.
good,"its a good starting place to get into the career but it isnt for me, felt discriminated and was singled out alot. it was very understaffed and the training wasnt the best."
good,"As a younger associate, working at Walgreens was a very dull job. There wasn't a lot of opportunity to move up in the company or to learn more about the job itself."
good,A few months into working for Walgreens the management suddenly changed. We went from being one of the best rated stores in the area to one of the worst very fast. This trickled down to the employees and soon I found my self struggling to even hold a weekend job which in of itself shouldn't be a thing. I had to leave that place.
good,"Walgreens was not my favorite place to work. They did not discipline insubordinate employees and let poor managers keep their positions. They also do not care about their employees, only putting more money in their pocket."
good,I used to love my company. The pay was fair and the benefits where even better. Nowadays under new owners they are nickle and diming everything and cutting out most of the benefits.
good,"Good starter job, however as a older guy who has been ""allowed"" to retire early (I'm 62, and feed up with my IT jobs being offshore outsourced), its ok. Working as a retail CSR. Have been told the insurance benefits are ok, but as I just started I won't get any insurance benefits for another month. I have a physical disability and the attempts at responsible accommodation are left lacking (at least in the store I work) . I was told to buy my own stool to sit on while manning the register, or us a stool to  low to allow for proper ringing and customer interaction. "
good,You never know how many hours you will receive. The company is always cutting back. Do more with less seems to be a relevant theme. They only have one full-time Pharmacy technician and the rest are part time.
good,I started out at the store on boonville and I loved it. My assistant manager was amazing and my co-workers were like a second family. They very understanding and took the time to talk things out. I transferred to the store on 29th and the managers are less than understanding and passive aggressively cut my hours without talking to me.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consists of checking out customers, restocking the shelves, and maintaining the stores cleanliness. You receive a 30 minute break every shift."
good,Walgreens sole focus is profits at the expense of work/life balance.  The European influences and catering to what is perceived employee retention for millenials has changed the corporate culture in three short years.  I live 60 miles away and there is no consideration for this.
good,"Favoritism is extremely prevalent here. It doesn't matter how much product you sell or how much you up sell, if the management isn't friends with you, you will not advance. There is little to no training. The best part of the job is the small corporate rewards for meeting goals.Good luck getting decent benefits."
good,"Print out photos look to see they are they meet the Wlagreens standards, stock shelves, help customers, cheek out dates every day, stop people from stealing and make sure other employees have work to do/ have help if needed."
good,"overworked & underpaid"
good,The demands of the pharmacy technician are extremely high. There is a high turnover rate due to the stress of the job. Corporate does not want to hear your complaints. They focus on the numbers and keep demanding higher returns.
good,"It may not be the best pay, but for a part-time job, it's a decent one. It always is going depend on your management, though, and that one is up to the fates."
good,Management was very judgmental and not very understanding. I asked multiple time if I could have more hours and never got anything not even a yes or no. They kicked my boyfriend out of the store when he was there for my lunch break.
good,"As a customer service employee and photo specialist, I printed and edited photos for customers as well as checked out customers buying essentials. I learned a good deal of customer service skills as well as how to work a range of different printers. The management was an inconsistent mix of fantastic to destressing, many having conflicting views about how tasks should be done, which only comes back to bite employees. The workplace feels unsafe when customers become aggressive over thing out of your control, but most people are fairly kind. The most difficult part of the job is standing for eight hours straight, and if the store is understaffed it can be hard to get a mandatory break in.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is helping customers print photos as gifts or for personal decoration."
good,"Store mgr is in control of pharmacy.  There is a heavy emphasis on both production and creating a ""good culture"" in the workplace. Depends on store manager but mostly Technicians are given most of the authority when it come to workflow and production weather or not it is efficient or productive but the rph is ultimately responsible and usually ends up working extra off the clock or burning themselves out or both."
good,This is not a job for an adult unless you try to get into management. The pay is not great. The work is way too much. The job is mostly dealing with kids.
good,"Working at Walgreens had its ups and downs the company is an overall good company the co workers are always a pleasure to work with, management needs to be restructured because they do not care about the well-being of their associates only to the benefits of them. The job can be much at times but has its perks."
good,- good place to learn how to work and handle large sums of cash. working the photo counter certainly helped to learn how to handle confidential information.
good,"There were never enough employees working at one time.  So much work for so little pay. I liked working with my co workers, but management was always taking something away and adding more work load for too few employees, which resulted in angry customers."
good,"working at Walgreens is a team oriented job if everyone doesn't do their part determines how the day will go for instance when you have a schedule set for 4 employees and one manager and only two employees show and that manager for that shift chooses to slack off that day well that's a start for a stressful day."
good,"A great place for new workers or high school students, but not a good Job for people with families. Rate of pay isn't enough. And hours are very limited."
good,Bajo salario y en el horario nocturne hay poca seguridad en las tiendas
good,Hectic work schedule. Your experience depends on who your Store manager is. I had some great managers and some very incompetent ones. The local corporate headquarters was not very responsive to complaints or very open to promoting peoples during the time I was there.
good,The managers would not work around my school and started giving my less hours as I was working on enlisting in the Army. It was unorganized and very non consistent.
good,"Walgreens is basically a good place to work, but it depends on the mix of millenials and seniors.  For me, I found that most of the millenials with whom I work are not respectful and kind to me as a senior citizen.  I am 65 years old and the eldest on the work staff, but some of the staff in their twenties treated me unkindly and were often rude.  It tarnished the work experience for me."
good,"Depending on your head manager, attempting to change your schedule can be next to impossible and other employees are less than willing to help cover your shifts"
good,The hardest part of my job was getting everything on the selves that were in my section and also making sure you were up front to check customers out. It was very hard because my selves were not close to my register.
good,"There is no set schedules.. you cannot work at a Walgreens and be able to live a normal life. "
good,"The pay is good , and thats about the only thing going for you at Amerisource, they are on a point system , one that doesn't allow for you to have a unfortunate life situation, and doctors excuses aren't accepted"
good,"Job security good, but not really work life balance. Hours sporadic. Holidays working and no time with family. Some employees get a way with little to no work while others go unnoticed and are passed for advancement."
good,"I believe this a job for teenagers not someone who is trying to fullfill life expectancies. The pay is not suitable for a grown person with financial responsinilities, and/or children."
good,"The company was willing to host a manager that had previously been caught sexually harassing an employee, my management team was barely willing to work with my scheduling needs, and many of my part time employees had to choose between going to work and spending time with their kids."
good,It's a very stressful place to work. I would only recommend it if you want to get pharmacy or management experience. Management is very shady so you need to be extra careful.
good,"It might just be the Walgreens I worked at, but it was poorly ran. Communication was not great and they kept hiring awful people. At one point the manager kept hiring only females (and we were all pretty short so some of the truck work was too hard. Corporate would make crazy requests and expect us to follow them. They would also send too much product, I think at one time we had about 25 humidifiers and no where to put them..."
good,Days were sometimes very long because they were slow but I learned a lot about customer service and how retail worked. I also learned how to use varies photo equipment.
good,"This company is too large and makes anyone who works for it feel as if they are disposable at any point in time. Our district manager cant even talk to our employees face to face, he is afraid to confront people about matters that are very important, such as being forced to moving locations because as a manager you signed up for it when you took the job even if you got hired at one location."
good,"Great place to start a career in the Pharmacy, Walgreens will train you and send you to become certified in the Pharmacy Technician.  Never a dull moment or same day here, however once a Senior Certified Pharmacy Technician its like the ladder to climb is done, unless you go to school to become a Pharmacist.  "
good,"Walgreens employees enjoy benefits, a flexible schedule, and arguably decent pay. However, management is almost always a problem. I worked at two different stores and though the management was completely different they were both awful in their own way. Because of this lack of good management most employees tend to feel that they are not valued. I believe if Walgreens would put more effort into finding effective leaders and not just ""managers"" it would be the best retail job out there. Every job available (other than upper management positions such as a store manager) is significantly easy as long as you're willing to move around. Everything you do either involves customer interaction or store/product management."
good,"I stood for 7 hours a day at the front register, non stop except for 1/2 hour lunch, with a continuous line of customers in a hurry to check out.  It was even hard to get a 15 minute break."
good,I love the job just sucks that this company doesn't help you when your struggling or helping you get a flexible schedule.
good,A typical day at work was always busy. I never stood still. If I wasn't receiving truck or vender I was working on displays and merchandising for the store. It never took away from my number 1 objective and that was customer service. I learned to better manage my time and to lead a team of workers to have a joyful experience at work. Work doesn't have to be hard or boring. The culture of the work place was always the same. To push to be the best and do the most you can and make each customers experience memorable and great so they keep coming back. The hardest part of the job would be the hours. A lot of hours and time away from family and church leaves you wore out. Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Meeting new people everyday makes for a fun time.
good,"It's decent, nothing to stick with though for a long time. Even if you try your best for a job that wouldn't require you to work that hard it still isn't enough for management or employees, it requires a very bubbly mindset to not need to put in an effort."
good,It was a great place to work as a job but management needs to be changed. There was always lots of petty gossip among most of the management team and it was unprofessional.
good,"I loved my job until I was fired over the phone on my day off . For having my tire blow out the day before.  I was with the company for 15 years and never a write up , until I came to the store on the corner of Wickham and Post rd. in Melbourne , FL."
good,"I trained as an assistant manager which I enjoyed. I learned to create fair schedules for employees, on-board employees, and gain additional experience with employee conflict and resolution."
good,it was definitely a fun place to work alothough the rules and and policy you may not agree with  they are overall a nice job to work with but then again every store has their cons
good,"Pay you less, increase expectation of workload. Your children and spouse do not matter, holiday's and other important events in your personal life are unimportant. An emotionless robot is the prime candidate for an employee."
good,Great company to work for. Easy job. Very busy at times. Love the employee discount. Okay hours. Not so flexible with scheduling.
good,Walgreens is  a decent company but lacks with competition when it comes to pay your required to work at a non stop fast past at 10.00 a hr not enough for the work that's required
good,"Good company to work for and a typical work day flies by. I developed the skills necessary to be a successful manager. I had the pleasure of working with countless other team members, and enjoyed them the most. I also enjoyed the fast paced environment, and that every day was different and challenging. The hardest part after 11 years was the inconsistent schedule."
good,"Responsible for cash register operations, retail, provide excellent customer service, merchandising, store inventory and stocking."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens includes the completion of daily tasks (taking in truck, putting away truck, doing scan outs of the store, etc.) along with prioritizing the customers. This teaches great time management and negotiation skills."
good,This company as a whole is a great experience but the management team changes and things happen and you are not anymore important.  I loved the job but now I hate it.
good,"I am extroverted, and I converse with as many customers that I can at the register. I also implement suggestive selling to increase their sales volume at the store."
good,"Its wonderful that Walgreens likes to enforce Job culture but I feel like Managers don't care all that much about it. It seems more so that they are more focused on better numbers that they forget other things that contribute to them. I worked there for half a year in two locations and didn't enjoy it because people could not separate their personal life from their actual job. Higher management is wonderful though, well to the lower employees that worked on the floor but the store manager was always just too worried about numbers. Kinda sad to think that there your just another number to them."
good,management was not management there always seemed to be issues with the workers and the manager . Typical day at work i always worked drive thru because i was the best and the fastest
good,"This was a great place where I could gain experience in the area I wanted experience in. I learned management skills for 2 years, and also the pharmacy. They provided my training and certification payments to complete my National Certification to be a Pharmacy Technician. That was one of the best parts. The pay after certification is very low at this company and they do put ""caps"" on wages so that you can only earn so much after so many years. The management changed many times where managers had to relocate, or switched positions so it was hard to get to know the management for needed reviews. It is very diverse with people of all ages and backgrounds with all experiences coming together so it is a great atmosphere and you can feel safe as they have a hotline for if you have trouble with some co-workers if needed. The hardest part was the hours were not flexible and they were early, late, in between and it was hard to have a work/life balance if you want full-time. The most enjoyable part was the training is great and they try to back you up as much as they can though they are still a corporate owned company."
good,"Walgreens really isn't a terrible place to work for the most part. You request off work and they usually give it to you. Management needs a little work though, they have favorites and give certain people every day off they ask for and that person can do no wrong in their eyes."
good,"I originally applied for the Pharmacy Technician position, but was given the CSR position. I readily agreed to the position as a start, in agreement that I will be able to move to my desired position. But, instead the position was given to a manager's niece after all of my tests came back clean. I learned more about the pharmaceutical position due to on the job training. My coworkers were nicer than the managers, there is nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new and old faces each day."
good,"unloading trucks, inventory ordering, store openings product knowledge, merchandising, inventories, ect.  They are well rounded as far as training employees, loss prevention and rules and regulations. Co-workers are pleasant."
good,"At Walgreens unfortunately, they like to put more on their employees that we can handle. I have worked 12 hour days, not gotten everything done, and because of it, I was written up. They never had enough people working for a single department, and when it all comes down, the management was never there to help, or understand."
good,"i had to sort items that were returned from other walgreens all over the country.scan each item and place in specially marked boxes,place on a pallet,shrink wrap it, then scan it again and ship it out!my co-workers and management were a big help,showing me how every thing was done.I`d say the hardest thing about the job was the constant lifting of the cartons all night that varied from 5-50 lbs! there really was no enjoyable part of this job except clocking out!"
good,"The company was a great place to work years ago but recently all they care about is filling about papers.  We feel like robots, the same thing everyday with little change.  You feel like to come to work any day and be told you no longer have a job, Good for someone who just needs a couple hours a week and not to make it a career."
good,"I can only speak to the particular location in which I work. The store associates, as well as Pharmacy management team are great to work with. Eager to work together to achieve goals and five star customer service is always delivered.*Unfortunately behind the scenes in the back offices and out of public view, there is a very negative environment. Poor communication and no acknowledgement or constructive criticism. Just overbearing micro managing and actual direct personal criticisms. No training, and job doesn't reflect the position interviewed for."
good,"decent pay, all in who you know"
good,"A typical day of work in the pharmacy at Walgreens can be pretty fast-paced and hectic. However, I prefer it to be that way. I enjoy the constant on-the-go flow of the pharmacy. I have learned that when working in the healthcare field, it is important to understand that you are responsible for the health and well-being of the patients you care for. It is important to maintain a positive attitude. The hardest part of my job is seeing patients in bad health and only being able to do so much to help them feel better. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that I know about 90% of the customers that come into our pharmacy by name. I like that I'm able to make them feel like they aren't just another ""sale"" when it comes to choosing a corporate chain pharmacy to fulfill their medication needs."
good,"Typical day consisted of sharing information with clients to help them make decisions building displays to bring attention to the products, and cleaning and organizing of sales areas. "
good,The money they paid was not worth the stress.  They never had enough pharmacy technicians working to meet the demand.  Could not stay caught up and constantly fell behind which infuriated the patients/customers.
good,"Wait on customers. Put stock items up. welcome to walgreens all day"
good,Customer service is priority.  Every store seems to have different guidelines.  I have been transferred 10 times to different store within the past seven and a half years.  Help the pharmacy with patient drop-off or pick-up of prescriptions when needed.  Daily vendor deliveries.  Filling prescriptions as needed.
good,This was the first retail job I had. I was still living at home during this time. I mainly learned how to talk to the general public and get over my timid and shy attitude at the time.
good,"Daily I start by running queries and reports to obtain the days work.  I then assign my team as needed per the data.  I manage the department daily, maintaining a good work flow in and out of our area.  I feel that I have as great relationship with my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is the balance of work flow.  Interacting with my co-workers is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Typical corporate position.  You are number in the company as opposed to name.  Not much room to grow.  High turnover rate can cause tough communication between team members
good,Workers are typically expected to work longer than their shift without over time. Managers typically give more tasks than feasible in the time-frame allotted and advancement is based more on relationships than work ethic. The benefits are less than desirable as well. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customers and being able to help out other members of the team.
good,"pay was horrible and didnt give enough hours. The managers were okay, very understanding. I learned alot about the pharmacy."
good,Meeting and greeting people interacting with different cultures. I've learned to manage and keep a professional appearance to maintain good work ethics. Some co-workers assist and some didn't. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers and helping them in the right way and they still was not satisfied. I enjoyed mostly helping others and providing them excellent customer service.
good,"The Walgreens that I worked at was extremely ""Clicky""  I enjoyed the work, just not the atmosphere."
good,"When I was employed at Walgreens it was a family run business,"
good,Management is poor in all aspects of management. Co-workers may seem friendly but are not. Easy Job. Break time is respected. Customers are hard to serve because life and well being  is involved.
good,"A typical day at work can vary A LOT depending on your department. In the photo department, there will be a lot expected of you and rarely anyone to teach you. If you're willing to tackle the challenge and learn the ropes without much guidance, this will be a rewarding experience. If you prefer to be walked down a well traveled path, the photo department is not for you. You WILL need to repair the machines, excel at customer service, work with outside technicians and get your hands dirty. All of this needs to be done, in between stocking shelves, cashiering, and cleaning the store."
good,"Management changes a lot, but the co workers are great.  Also flexible with working from home depending on the department you work in."
good,A good place to get exposure to global opportunities and experience working with team members from various departments.
good,"I work part time primarily as a cashier and secondly at the photo lab and sales floor."
good,Walgreens is more and more becoming about the money and less about the employees. A reverse of what it had once been. They stay open through the holidays regardless of the employee family situation. They pay employees less and expect them to do more. They only care about suggestive sells and pushing people to buy things they do not need.
good,"I learned how to use the computer to enter prescriptions, look up prescriptions, write the already entered prescriptions, and answered phone calls."
good,They don't train their employees very well. They have you train on a computer but don't allow time for the training. Instead of showing me how to do something they just did it for me.
good,Hardest part of the job is rush hour time when doctor's offices close and people get off from work. Most enjoyable part is learning much of medical terminology. Management and co-workers vary depending on who you get to work with since it is a revolving door of people coming and going.
good,"Work at Walgreens is much like always feeling under appreciated.  No matter the work you get done with the amount of time you have the company always wants more and more out of us. I've learned with a little bit of patience with the clients at Walgreens you can really make a difference in their lives. Making it just a little easier and help out as much as you can and they will likely remember that. "
good,the company has alot of kinks to work out to make it fuction better but i would say over all i like working here. the management puts everyting in the store on the photo people instead of helping. the photo people have to put tagss up in the entire store every week. they have to straighten the whole store. get certain code. help customers and sweepthe entire store. also they have to do thier job of running photo.
good,Pay was standard. The work was tedious at times. The most enjoyable part was the benefits. Skills I learned were primarily dealing with pricing.
good,A very fast past environment where multi- tasking is required. Laughter and providing great customer service to all my customers at all times.The hardest part of my job is laughter. I love my customers.
good,"The corporation itself is built to be a good workplace, but doesn't often pan out. The quality of employee life with the company has progressively diminished. They have had some changes in management organization that left a lot of people out to dry with large pay cuts. The quality of benefits has diminished, and management will try as hard as they can to schedule you beneath the required hours to receive benefits."
good,A typical day would be putting away shipment and ordering the store. I've learned how to strive to give the best customer service. Management and coworkers work good together and push each other to be better. The hardest part would be the pay rate. The most enjoyable part would be meeting new people.
good,"To tired, can't balance work and school with a graveyard shift. I go in at 10 pm and get off at 8am. I used to be a cashier but now I am the floors person. I just fix the store, respond to help, and restock items, and also deal with customer and help them."
good,"typical day at walgreens would consist of both good and bad customers.. a wide variety of different faces and ages."
good,I am blessed  to have a job. They have three shifts and i have worked on all three. And the best shift is the one i am on now which is 2nd shift. I have to say that my manager try to help me learn all that I ask about.
good,"Working in the highest volume pharmacy in our tri-state area, we receive the same hourly pay as the slowest volume pharmacy in our area. In the most recent buyout of a local neighborhood pharmacy, the technicians there were receiving pay as high as $18.00/hour. Our pay at Walgreens ranges from $10-$14.00/hour. Walgreens gave the technicians of the pharmacy they bought out the same pay they had been receiving while our technicians that have been with the company for years receives poor pay."
good,"The management wasn't helpful. it was very pick and choose. No one listens to your opinion, or offers to help you. Some staff got special treatment."
good,"I enjoy working with all of my co-workers.  We work together as a team and help each other resolve patient issues.  Be prepared to work all shifts even late evenings and holidays.  "
good,"I truly enjoyed the product education that came with being a beauty advisor. while working in this department I was able to assist the customers on a more one on one level. To me there was nothing too hard about this position. I truly did enjoy all aspects of this job."
good,"Management is bad, pay is barely above minimum, depending on location they will work with student schedules, coworkers can vary"
good,"I worked with this company for almost 2 years and everything was fabulous when chris conelly was the store manager. He was a very understanding boss was caring towards his employees and customers. Plus when your boss actually notices your hard work and often compliments your good efforts, you tend to enjoy your workplace. However I also had 2 other store managers in both branford and east haven Conntecticut. They were terrible. This man does not deserve his place as store manager between the constant rudeness to the ignorant ways he tried running the store. The job itself is great! I've made so many friends associating with other employees. This made walgreens a fun and friendly environment. My favorite part of working there was being promoted to a photo technician. It's very simple work and you learn alot photo technology. My favorite part was being able to see and edit customers photos. Also when you work for such a company you have the responsibility to ""face"" during your shift. If you like to organize than you'll enjoy facing the products in the isle.Filling the cooler is also nice because you get a chance to relax by yourself and do things your way without all eyes on you. Being a cashier sucks. Mostly because you have to stay in one place and do the most interaction throughout the store. The Cosmetic and Photo departments are the way to go!"
good,".I really liked working there but the hours, personally, were not all that great. They do have wonderful benefits though."
good,"Worked there in 1987. I worked 3rd shift. I had a baby. Could not work 3rd shift anymore. I needed to stay with my baby. If you are married, it can be a dead end job."
good,"Poor opportunity to grow, a constantly bickering management, almost no opportunity to get a pay raise, terrible hours."
good,Working at Walgreens was an interesting experience. I observed that many employees only cared for themselves and no one took the initiative to go the extra mile.
good,"the overnight management was really good for the overnight hours but during the day was unprofessional. "
good,Management needs improvement and dont count on advancement
good,"Okay place to work. Lots of duties required of all departments, and a little bit understaffed."
good,All I can say is don't work here if you can keep from it. When you hear about corporation that do not care about any of their employees? This is one of them
good,"Walgreens demands high expectations from the pharmacist as far as minimum wait times, proper billing of insurance and other programs like 340B and CMS services, but provides minimum support staff. The support staff that is provided has limited knowledge on the different programs available to bill medications to provide the best price, also limited knowledge on insurance. All qualified pharmacy technicians eventually leave walgreens due to lack of hours or unable to obtain full time status with benefits. Walgreens really likes to save money over employee satisfaction. Pharmacist are over worked due to the high turn over rate. A pharmacist can work 70 to 80 hours a week if they choose."
good,"Everyday is different then the day before, you never know whats going to land on your plate. Whether it be customer Question, comments and concerns, or even from the staff, its always a toss in what may happen. While working at Walgreens i have learned how to, manage a team effectively and productively."
good,I worked in a bad area and had to deal with a lot of stress on the job. Employees were expected to work long holiday hours with no extra pay.
good,"There is always a steady flow of business. I've learned how to compound medicine, and multitask a few things at once to get what needs to be done in the day."
good,I left because company decided to offer demotions and eliminate my last position
good,"A typical day included cash handling, receiving, completing the daily work sheet. As an assistant manager, Walgreen could transfer you to any store. I learned how to work with different types of people. I like challenges. I would volunteer for jobs others did not like. I chose the two hardest aisles to maintain because I enjoyed the challenge. I will always remember, with the fondest memories, my days as a photo technician. People are always excited to see the memories they are building. I moved into the pharmacy because it brought on new challenges. After being in the pharmacy for a few years, I applied for assistant manager, so I could learn new things."
good,"The store manager I had while I was there was not the best.  The store was not run properly, everything was disorganized and the responsibility fell on the shoulders of the shift leads and associates.  Everything was organized last minute.  I believe Walgreens does not put the right people in the store manager positions.  Even now the Walgreens I worked at has a new store manager and I have heard that she is just as bad.  The store managers yell and are really rude to their employees.  They act as though they are back in high school with the drama that goes around.  Sometimes, if you don't agree with the store manager they would punish you by giving you the worst shifts weeks straight or they would just cut your hours altogether.  Favoritism is a main problem in the organization, it's not based on hard work or experience.  It's based on how much, excuse my lack of words, but it's based on how much behind you kiss."
good,"Managing day to day operations including accounting, payroll, inventory and ordering of products."
good,"I started this job as a way to keep income while in college. It was great at allowing for me to tailor a schedule that is conducive to my scholastic commitments."
good,Went from bad to worst...hardest part of the job keeping good employees on staff when management puts them uncomfortable situations.
good,it was based inside of a correctional facility it wasn't my cup of tea
good,"A typical day at work includes, talking with customers, helping them find exactly what they need and doing what ever you can to make sure they leave as a satisfied customer."
good,Enjoyed my job but too much politics in the company. My store manager had become hooked to crystal meth and the company didn't want to do anything about it so I quit.
good,the job is pretty cool the employees are fun people but management sucks.
good,i developed film cleaned machines stocked store unloaded trucks
good,"Working here has definitely shown me different types of leadership and lack of communication. This company has more employee complaints than any company I have ever worked for. Compensation is next to nothing at this day in time. I do love working with customer base as well as most of the employee staff. Direction and leadership isn't always concise, however, when work isn't done properly it falls on you. There is never a good word given but always criticism."
good,"Was a department manager. Daily job is coming to work, checking stock and inventory, stocking, cashiering, and cleaning. Micromanaging management and lack of open door policy made department control hard."
good,Customers can be very nice.  Management is very supportive.
good,"Answer incoming customer calls. Take patient's orders for CPAP supplies."
good,Its a good company that standing the test of time.  The prices are a bit expensive and the quality of employees has decreased in some neighborhoods not everyone has to speak English but they should speak and understand both.  All locations should have a close time when it comes to holidays.
good,"coworkers are great to work with"
good,My particular manager was the worst. She was a micro-manager and would constantly watch you and nit-pick and everything you do. She questioned me once about why I threw trash away in the break room versus the stock room. All that should matter to her is that the trash got thrown away! The company itself was good. Good long term benefits. Retail is never the best option.
good,"Walgreen's can be a great place to work or it can be a nightmare, depending on management."
good,"Good company "
good,It had a very productive environment and was always busy. Never had time to take breaks. Always room to obtain knowledge and meet new people
good,Well I came in the pharmacy with plans of moving on into management. I was never properly trained. Many I worked with were rude and not helpful at all.
good,i like it here at walgreens.  Its a fast paced work environment.  great management experienced.
good,"A typical work day consists of processing photo orders, filling and restocking shelves. Making sure merchandise is available to the customer. in the job field i have learned how to deal with happy and unhappy customers to ensure they're shopping experience was great. the hardest part of my job would be performing a reset. this is pretty much taking everything in a department and moving it from one place to another. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that customers are happy with the service i am providing them with."
good,A typical day was constantly doing transactions and customer service. I learned several transaction functions and decision-making skills. My co-workers were young and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with constant complaints and stress.
good,I muti task often and work with a good group of team members.  We work with the public and don't always know what is going to happen next.  The hardest part of the job dividing time between doing projects and taking care of the customer.  Working with the public and helping customers with their needs is very rewarding.
good,Company made changes in respect in the stock market recession and it caused management to work more hours
good,"i Have been with the company for several years and every time a well desereved worker tries to move up in the company, they decide to down size just to build a new store and still want there workers to do more work for less money"
good,"Was not a bad company, just has some bad management that sneaks thru the cracks."
good,"My store wasn't 24-hours, so I worked closing shift in the Beauty department. "
good,"Very tough expectations of their store managers. Having a family and being a store manager is near impossible. The upper management is always changing therefore there is no real direction but, if you don't perform, you're out. Great pay though. Bonuses are a plus but, they too are going away."
good,"I worked the night shift so from 9-7 I was the only employee there other than the assistant manager and pharmacist. I would take care of all the customers in the front, checking them out or answering questions along with answering the phone through out the night. I would develop all of the film that was left over from the previous day and get it ready for the the next morning. If there were any returns I would put them back I would also take out the trash clean the bathrooms and sweep and mop the store. I made sure the shelves were stocked with appropriate items and I would face them. The hardest part of the job was getting everything done before 6 and the best part of the job were my co-workers."
good,I had many different jobs there. It was fun it's was a different job eveyday. Some management was nice. Had problems with a couple of them. The hardest part was trying to sell extra stuff. 
good,"Overall, the company isn't all that bad to work for but it mainly depends on the location and who runs each store.   My immediate supervisors are great and run a tight ship with a great team.  The real problem with the company is the district and corporate level.  They contradict themselves constantly while trying to set up policies that restrict employees from completing the job that they want completed.  The largest issue I have had with Walgreen's is their ""Fair Scheduling"" policy.  Understandably, working the same schedule everyday is unrealistic especially in the retail setting.  However, more than once new hires have been brought in, given better schedules leaving the more experienced team members to pick up the slack.  While the new hires do their best, it's difficult because there is no time to properly train them with the constant budget cuts.  Another issue, why hire people and then cut half of the payroll budget.  If they were planning on doing so it would be a more intelligent move to just not hire anybody. "
good,"Was not the best place I worked, the pharmacist did not care about the customers and their well being "
good,"Although this is a call center, unless you have a strong pharmaceutical background, the job can be difficult at times. But more than anything else, it's tedious & repetitive work, so at times can be hard to keep motivated."
good,lots of work with minimal resource. None stop work. There is always something to do
good,no communication
good,Vision is to be the provider of health and daily living solutions for all of America
good,Benefits are not that great and high priced. Shift hours rotate and pay is low for work and hours required. Hours are being cut as well.
good,"My duties as an Assistant Manager included daily supervision of 6 employees at one time. I've learned how to balance safe money's along with money found in all registers. I've learned how to balance an inventory sheet, and prepare pay roll. The hardest part of my job was dedicating long hours with little to no days off. The most enjoyable part of my job was serving the people. being able to help them was the most enjoyable."
good,bad management some what good hours but always had your travling to diff stores
good,this job was very hard because it was my first and they made me work a lot of OT and being that my store was open 24 hours that meant going home at 2 or 3 o clock in the morning. i also had one horrible manager (no longer there) that would make me do all her work while she sat in the office and watched me. very annoying!
good,"If your have nothing else better to do with your time or life then this is the place for you. Walgreens CPO is brand new to the e-script system that they are still getting use too. There prescription services is has been doing well the past 5 years and Human Resources and Management still don't know how to build a better relationship with there employees, they let the system handle all of that, from average handle time to mandatory breaks and no overtime if any. Workig there Team Leads to the ground and also the average worker there is either burned out or disgusted of there time there."
good,"Management changed too many times. Not always fair, not family oriented like I'm used to"
good,"Ill be as honest as I can. They are following different models to run the business, unlike before, where they were the one leading. I was really shocked to see how they fell behind in many ways and things but most upsetting when corporate stripped away that family feeling looking towards business is what we are about now. And it was evident when you saw former employees who had moved up, into corporate seats, then saw the positions being eliminated within the stores and those who had corporate seats, coming back to their once humbled positions. Mr. Walgreens must be rolling in his grave."
good,"always be polite and kind to the customers,never rely on others to tell you what is going on, especially the management.Always have your own back,do your work to the best and get the things done on your list for the day and get out and go home..Get depressed about being open and have to work for the holidays""Thanksgiving and Christmas days "" these should be family time not going to work missing everything with your family..I guess the almighty dollar is more important to some..With such a big company it would not be put them out to close on the most precious holidays, this is depressing.The job has no set hours, it's hard to make Dr. appmts. and hope you will be off for that time.The hardest part is trying to keep co-workers happy..The most enjoyable part is seeing my day to day customers and having just a very small chat, they like that and I like to see them leave happy...Especially not happy with the low pay that is insulting to the employees for all they do."
good,i enjoyed working with customers. but overall i feel like i didnt matter to the company. they expressed tghe anyone could easily be replaced.
good,annual maximum percentage raise is less that of inflation.
good,"I worked with customers, be it corporate or personal to make sure that their photos and gift items were gotten in a timely fashion and at a price that was affordable to them and profitable to the company. The creative freedom I was allowed by customers when making scrapbook-like gifts or working with Photoshop-esque programs felt very rewarding."
good,"A typical day very busy, filled about 300-350 prescriptions per day,non-stop phone, i learned how to be very patient, management was very unprofessional, communication was horrible, some co-workers were ok, but they mostly faught almongst each other,didnt seem to want to help the new people out. The hardest part of the job was keeping everyone happy, most enjoyable part was helping the customers, and how fast the day went by."
good,Walgreens has friendly workers. Good customer serivce and they make you feel like you belong there.
good,"a typical day was stocking, cash register, cleaning. and problem solving for customers."
good,The store I worked at was really busy so you had to work fast. The pay was a little low for the amount of work you did but it wasnt too bad.
good,Typical evening went very slow and not enough business. Management rarely selected from within company.
good,Walgreens is a national company that requires a lot of dilligence and patience when working there. I was able to challenge myself and succeed in my goals.
good,The best part for me was my schedule I was still able to drop off my son at school and get off in time to pick him up from school.
good,The company is restructuring so a lot of changes coming. Good pay good benefits.
good,Walgreens was a fun and relaxed atmosphere until they recently hired a phamracy manager who was not understanding when it came to personal life or medical conditions.
good,"Was at work having medical complications with pregnancy and since we were short handed, the assistant manager wouldn't allow me to go to ER. So in order to save my unborn childs life, I walked out and claimed unemployment until now!"
good,"overnight cashier position, met different charactered people and definitely learned true customer service here"
good,"Pull, stock, and run the photo lab"
good,People called me with serious concerns and I was able to help them and received over 300 customer compliments directly to supervisor. I really felt good at the end of each day being able to help so many.
good,"A good company to work for, tho if you are very family oriented or have sick immediate family this may not be the company for you."
good,"If retail is not your career choice then it is a good place for working evenings while attending school. Although late nights, working holidays, can get tiresome."
good,It isn't a bad place to work. But there are no hours and no full-time opportunities. As well you are never given a chance to learn more and grow within the company. The workers are great and everyone works hard. It isn't a job you can make a life-long career.
good,The management at my specific Walgreens store has been difficult to work with but this is not saying that all managers are this way. I believe that Walgreens could be a good opportunity for people as long as they find the perfect environment for them to work in.
good,The hours we very demanding not only on weekends and holidays. There was a lot of pressure from the District manager calling all hours of the night. Job security was a major issue.
good,"Walgreens corporate makes the most money. Sure, you will find great relationships with some people in your workplace, but the company itself, nah. They literally will let you go for the smallest problems to avoid any payment. They value the customer and their money entirely too much, with no balance relationship with its own employees."
good,Suffering from severe depression and management actually seemed to care for my wellbeing. However it always felt as though if I acted on my depressive thoughts they could always just hire a new cashier.
good,Worked rotations. 80 on 80 off with two days on during your rotation off. If you worked hard they just made sure they kept all the work on you. But don't get sick  and put in the hospital because they will still call you to come into work even though your in the ICU!
good,All task put on managers no employees to help and not compensated for what they do. Would only work there a shirt time. Always working holidays and no time for family
good,"During the day, slow paced, easy to meet locals and see regular customers. During the night, very quiet, few customers, more focused on organizing inventory."
good,"Walgreen's runs lean on staff while expecting high output. We are expected to fill prescriptions within a specified time frame but management doesn't understand the barriers that can arise. Third Party rejections, out of town customers who need an entire profile built, drugs needing PA from doctors.Phone calls to insurance providers. Each of these problems can set you back by a significant amount of time. Meanwhile while you are expected to keep up with the data entry, you have to wait on customers as well as answer the phone, receive and put away the order, complete OOS and PFL orders, and various other duties. It is my opinion that each and every member of upper management should spend 1 year ""on the bench"" to truly understand what we are expected to do, as well as the verbal abuse we take from customers."
good,I was only there for 9 months because some of the pharmacy staff are verbally abusive. The hours were not steady & the pay was low. I couldn't continue being stressed at work.
good,Doesn’t pay enough to meet cost of living in area. High expectations and relatively low compensation. No life work balance. Manager doesn’t manage well
good,"I loved the customers, and my coworkers. However, the lower management staff was often overworked and underpaid. One manager verbally harassed both her employees and customers on a regular basis with 0 repercussion from management and would claim insubordination to upper management if you inconvenienced her and she was short and quick tempered. I didn’t mind working there, and if not for her I would have never left"
good,"Poor management, limited to no formal training, learn as you continue to be put on line. Management is very negative, not interested in any type of advancement with company."
good,I started at Walgreens PR and have been in Phoenix for less than a year.The company is good but you don't have a balance between your personal life and work.
good,"Walgreens is a good job to start working at if you're a student, but there is little to no advancement available in the workplace. The 15%-25% discount is good."
good,"Very busy location. They expect to much from the cashier, as a cashier i spend multiple hours straight standing and cashing people out which gives me little time to get other things done yet, they expect you to complete photo orders, fill the cigs, fill candy in the front, fill cooler in the front, sweep, and many other tasks all while your trying to check out customers i cannot step away for 2 seconds to do any of those tasks without a customer needing assistance, and then the managers get mad at you when you have not completed everything they told you to do by the end of the day"
good,Well where do I start. I was with Walgreens for 13 years. I started at 21yrs old as a photo tech. I was promoted within 8 mos to management. I was promoted a few more times to Store Manager within the next 7 years or so. I was a top performing Store Manager for multiple years. They placed me 2 hours from home and refused to transfer me even though I was a top performing manager in a top performing store. I had to leave after 6 years of that commute. I couldn’t handle the commute anymore. Walgreens used to have a great culture of caring. However now they seem to care less about the leadership unless you’re an area manager or higher.
good,"Your basic retail drug store job. You're called a customer service associate or something of similar-sounding value, which just means you're paid for 1 job but do everything. (I.E. You're the cashier, janitor, photo lab assistant, floor worker, cosmetic sales, inventory work) It is a stable paycheck of a predictable amount."
good,"Walgreens was a satisfactory company to work for, and they provided me the ability to learn.  At times the company appeared more focused on dollar amounts than customer satisfaction. It seems that the customer satisfaction would come first, which in turn, would increase the dollar amounts."
good,"What's crazy is I was with the company for 7 years and I was making 1.5 dollara more then my staff. Oh and I wasn't allowed to take classes for a better job. So make 12 dollars the rest ofy life? No thank you, that's a slap on the face to my kids."
good,From the beginning the learning process was rushed.  Patients waited in long lines. I didn't feel the corporate environment was for me. This ultimately lead me to change my career path.
good,"Was a great company with stability. Not these days, the last 10-12 years has so much changes. Middle management that was promoted is disconnect to real practice, employee is only a number and totally replaceable."
good,"Walgreens use to be one of the better paying retail drug companies, now they depend on cheap labor, cut hours, absolutely no overtime and decrease in pay all across the board for Managers, Assistant Managers, and Shift Leads. They take care of their Pharmacists but everyone else they could care less. Not to mention all the shoplifters and criminals employees have to deal with on a daily basis."
good,Position eliminated 2 years ago. Corporate gave up on the department after our department manager retired. I feel like no one wanted to make the department work. When our store was aquared. Walgreens was different from when I left. Its a shame that all the changes didn’t really make the company better.
good,I loved my co workers but hated the job.Constantly under staffed and under paid for stress induced depression. Turn over rate is high within first month.Constantly asked to pick up at other locations but no extra pay to cover gas. Training is severly lacking.But why invest in training if people are going to leave anyways. I wish breaks were an hour.
good,"Team player. "
good,This is a great starter job or more of an in between jobs job. You are more seen as a body to do the work than a person Really no room for advancement.
good,"Working at Walgreens was alright, however my coworkers were not great. Coming from a 17 year old boy, working with all older women is not the most fitting for me."
good,"Challenging if ur just starting "
good,Company used to care about it's employees at a store level. Now it's all about satisfying corporates deep pockets. Budgets are consistently getting cut so managers are overworked and underpaid. Their measly yearly raise is a joke of .09cents to if your lucky .50cents.
good,"Never enough staff because corp doesn't give enough budget hours. This causes turnover rate to be high because the pay isnt enough for the amount of work put on employees. Not worth it, find something better unless youre desperate for a job"
good,"You have to work days, nights, and weekends. We have paid vacation time but it takes forever to accumulate any time. I enjoy the customers, most of them, they are the reason I'm still there."
good,With the merge with Boots the company was not the same company I started with. They forgot about the people and made things very hard to balance work and home.
good,Walgreens is for young adults to gain experience. After awhile you have to leave before your name is ruined in the workforce. Just my experience thoug
good,Working there wasn't to bad I had my good days and my bad days but I was always on game when it came to working and very respectful towards my co workers
good,"Nothing complicated, you just ring up customers, stock, and print photos. My managers were unprofessional and lazy at times but I didn’t really care I was part time and going to school. What really bothered me was being to told to help in the pharmacy when pharmacy techs are trained AND make more the retail associates."
good,"It could be better, it could be worse. "
good,"When I started here, I was looking forward to investing myself into a company that valued hard work, rewarded reliability and work ethic. Now their corporate overlords dictate everything you say or do and could not care less about anything going on with their employees on a personal level. Store management is treated like a barrier between corporate and store level employees, meant to feed down corporate decisions no matter the fallout and then be face all the consequences of those decisions. Employees overworked by corporate cuts and closures and its effecting morale and productivity. Well get those unattainable numbers up or you're the one in trouble. "
good,I loved the team that I worked with but the training was slim to non. It was challenging for me to grasp when to help team members and when to just stay in workflow. Priorities always seemed to change. The pay was not good enough to read minds and play guessing games.
good,"We were located in a bad part of modesto. So we got all the ""fun"" people. There were a lot of thieves, and the company wouldn't let us do anything about it. We should just sit there and let them steal from us. Lack of security that is allowed to do anything"
good,Company unfortunately is suffering losses this year over 30% so customers and staff have been suffering due to changes in structure and heightening prices for products. Would recommend to individuals that do not have other responsibilities. Would not recommend to individuals that can not handle the stress of customers or the drama that may unfold between veteran employees and new personnel.
good,"I have been with the company 15 years, I have seen our salaries freeze, pensions removed, benefits diminish.  The company as a whole has made a few poor decisions which has cost it alot of money in fines, which has apparently trickled down and affected our stock.  To keep shareholders happy ( I am also one), they are trying to cut costs (benefits, hours, jobs) to keep from continuing to slide down.  I am not a happy shareholder as these decisions affect my livelihood and job security.  We keep getting more things added to the work we do, I am supposed to be filling prescriptions, but find I am also making close to 30 phone calls per day due to trying to keep patients adherent due to the Obamacare changes that have changed the insurance reimbursement fee structure, and still find time to immunize and consult patients, and supervise staff."
good,A typical day at work is you clock in and then you are assigned to a line to pick on. You then are picking that product into the totes all night! They are heavy lifting! One person will be inducting the line. Which is you put the totes on the line for your other workers. The rest will pick the totes.
good,"I enjoyed my job for the most part and was excited to advance in the company, however was not trained during the 3 months I waited before I gave my 2 weeks notice. There was also a lot of what I would call high school drama between managers, and employees. I can't speak for all Walgreens, but the one off of 29th and North Ave in Grand Junction is a location I would not go back to."
good,"I worked with some very nice people at Walgreens but felt very unsure of my responsibilities.  I was trained on the registers, but little else.  No one instructed me on how to answer the phone or transfer a call, no one instructed me on what other duties I was suppose to do when not at the register.  I wanted to work approximately 24 hours in a pay period, but they kept cutting my hours."
good,"When i first atarted vs when i left, things took a downturn. They don't treat managers very well, which leada to not treating mployees very well. They used to have big incentives,  now small."
good,It can be a nice place to work but unfortunately the area I work at could do with better management and better advancement. I wish they would understand that we do have an outside life and that they wouldn't expect us to be married to our job while they can spend their time lollygagging and just sitting in the office. There's also A LOT of workplace drama and gossip which can make the work just that much more miserable.
good,"While at Walgreens, I worked the job of three people for the compensation of one. My position, though specialized, ""doesn't exist,"" and Walgreen's was constantly cutting budget, so I was not paid fairly for the work I did. Customers were generally okay, but due to policy, we were not allowed to stop shoplifting, and were then reprimanded for allowing people to leave with merchandise. The coworkers I have are, in general, great people to work with, but management does not let us work together often.The most enjoyable part of the job are my coworkers, and the discounts we receive."
good,"it was an interesting experience, no one help when you need help, only one or two managers working per store, so they can't help you neither, the employees have this stupid idea that for some reason women have to be only cashiers and beauty consulters and anything else, and men have to do all the heavy work relate with warehouse and pulling."
good,No happiness working here. Dead end job. Only good for first timers needing job experience and retirees who have no need to advance and are just looking for a supplemental income
good,I learned a lot working at Walgreens for 5 years and I thank the company for the skills they gave me that I did not have. my customer service skills was excellent. I no how to take care of my customers when they are satisfied or not and they leave my store happy. I knew most of my regular customers so its not hard to have a bond with people.
good,"When I started at Walgreens a year ago all the managers were very helpful and willing to help me learn a lot of new things. When I got hired I had no work experience so I was really grateful for the job. The location I was at had a flow of people constantly coming in. The hours were cut so only 3 people (shift lead, cashier, and cosmetics) at night while 5-6 people were put in the morning shift. On top of only 3 people being there, each of us were given tasks to do which we were unable to finish because of constantly being pulled aside by either customers or closing duties. If a task was left undone, the night shift would specifically get very poor treatment the next day and it became a very hard environment to enjoy because of the ridiculous expectations that were set by only ONE manager. The assistant manager at the location I worked at has personally caused 4 other employees to quit because of how she treats us."
good,"When I first startes to work for this for this company I was happy with everything. The employees were great. the team felt like a family. the managers were nice and helpfull, But then alot of the managers were shipped out of my store and replaced with some people I don't  like and I feel like my store (family feeling team) has gone down hill.  The corporatation treats us more like expendable slaves when it comes to hours we have to work and days that the store front is open, but the pharmacy gets a break. Communication between team members has decreased along with moral."
good,"I've been with this company for 17+ years and use to be a great company to work for.  Very employee focused, until bought out by Boots, inc..  Now , not so sure."
good,The management was really awesome until the last manager was transferred there that I worked under. The customers were so sweet and kind. Truly enjoyed them.
good,"Prefer not to say on the basis of my constitutional rights,lol. Just do your job,do extra if you can,makes the day better,it may not necessarily get you ahead,but don't do extra to get praise,do it to make atmosphere better for you and your customers!"
good,A good place to work part time or full time. Starting out salary is above minimum wage. Job can be stressful and rewarding at times. You learn new things in different departments.
good,I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and creating a relationship with the regulars. it always felt like the management used the over night crew as the reason the store was bad or work didn't get done. I fell I could of made a difference if given the chance.
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is getting to know my customers and assisting them with their needs. Most days are boring and the same thing and a lot of changes in the laws and hard to keep up.
good,"Way too much favoritism!!!  Management is weak at best.  The real young employees get away with murder. The older ones are expected to pick up their slack...."" After all the young ones have to be taught, and they are very tired from going to school"". What???"
good,"I've worked here twice at this point and I'm really not sure why. The pay is OK, but not that awesome given the hours and the ridiculous charting and surveying and of course, the awful public. Well, this is the pharmacy experience for me at least. Save your soul, try something else first. :)"
good,Company cuts in budget come down to the instore staff being required to work more but less compensation. Asking us to do the work of two or three people. Not the same company I started with .
good,"High stress and time management necessary. Difficult oftentimes to manage work and life, however manageable. The salary makes up for the stress you deal with at work."
good,"Worked in a touristy location where every customer was from a different country. Difficult to translate languages, store was always a mess and people had no manners."
good,"Walgreen was a great experience I enjoyed working their, though it was through a work ability program. For this same reason I can't speak too much about the actual company, because I was not hired through their. It was a great job experience."
good,"Walgreens started as a fine company to work for in the beginning.  Post merger, the micromanaging began.  "
good,"It’s a pretty good job , pretty easy , good pay, just the people there that made things a little different. Overall a good job do recommend this job, since it was my first job ever."
good,Long shifts where you just stand there and time stands still. Did not enjoy this job at all and dreaded going into work. I would not recommend Walgreens to a friend.
good,"Walgreen's isn't as bad as a lot of corporations, but it's still a corporation. Compensation isn't bad but not commensurate with stress levels and expectations. Corporate cares little about the well being of its store personnel. Opportunity for advancement simply isn't there, as they'd rather hire off the streets."
good,I had the pleasure of meeting some very nice customers and working with some very nice people. I still shop there and consider my ex-co-workers as friends.
good,Lack of clear consistent direction conflicting direction. Constant fear of retribution from upper management. Blatant age discrimination that was constantly swept under the. Veiled threats of retaliation after giving statements to HR investigators.
good,"It was good! Everything depends on the store manger and the pharmacy manger relationship! if it's good, then the pharmacy will work as good."
good,In the beginning the environment was an amazing and fun work place. I used to love coming in to work and then one day the store seemed to lose its touch.
good,I believe that I was terminated on an unfair basis do to a miscommunication but documentation is all that was required my explanation was not valid. I also feel that Walgreens is is not about patient safety for patient care they are just out for money and capitalism.
good,"Walgreens is a very interesting place to work. You meet a lot of people, meet amazing coworkers and work with pretty decent management but the job is a bit random and doesn’t flow. Nobody ever knows what’s going on and it’s hard to stay on top of things when you don’t know what’s supposed to be getting done. It’s also rare to get a good raise which is terrible considering how hard everyone works."
good,I learned a lot over the years with this company. Your experience with the company will depend on your manager and District manager. A lot of hiring has been external which discourages current employees for future promotions.
good,"Shift leaders do a lot of the work with very little pay. "
good,"HEAVILY depends on who you work under. Make sure you learn everything you can about the leaders in the store. Clique mentality can be toxic to your work experience. District Managers encourage ""managing upward"", but"
good,Walgreens is a company that focused on you being great in your Customer Service Skills. They should've focused a little more on the relationships between Supervisor and Employee. There was a lot of favoritism within some regions of this company.
good,"Walgreens is a strong company that will always be around. When I started the benefits and pay was great but as time went on they took from the little guys to give more to the big guys. Meaning the investors. Paid less and wanted more. No work life balance, hard work, stressful environment. I excelled there, I am grateful for all I learned in business with Walgreens. Ive met a lot of great people there, many I still speak to. For me personally I wanted a new environment after 13 years. I could of stayed and moved up but I didn't love my job as I once did. I am happy o took the leap of faith and left. Good company, greed pushed a lot of good people away."
good,In the beginning it was a great place with great people but now i feel like they dont care about any of there employees and cut costs and overwork us.
good,"I love the people I work with. We know how to work hard and get our jobs done. The company has changed since I started there and they have seem to have lost their way. Not only are they making things harder on their employees by cutting budgets and adding tasks to those who work, they are also taking the benefits away from their customers. They are looking at the bottom line and not seeing what is missing in the middle."
good,"Walgreens has dropped the ball on backing up their employees, walgreens use to be a better place to work than other drug stores, but the past few years it has gotten worse."
good,"I left this job because they hired an abusive ex of mine and refused to put us on separate shifts and told me to ""get over it"". So I left, I really liked the job but I value myself more than putting myself into a toxic situation."
good,i learned a lot from working at Walgreen. did not really agree with the upper management but it was great run. i love our customers . i really wish i could've worked at another location.
good,"The job itself as a CSA at Walgreens is easy enough. Ring up customers, process photo orders, be nice, be friendly, clean, do what your supervisor tells you to do, etc. Your main source of frustration is usually your customers, but those issues don't typically last more than a few minutes and you'll likely forget about them within a week."
good,Not the best place to work. Too many shift managers. Slack workers. Not enough hours. Favoritism. Fellow employees were lazy. Constant issue with fellow workers actually doing their cleaning lists.
good,"If you like to work with clients and help your neighbor, then Walgreens is your number option. But poor management and a heavy work atmosphere for the leaders leaves you with a bad experience at work."
good,"Honestly while working within Walgreens, I learned basic people skills and how to fake it until I made it. It’s great for a first job because it’s not that hard and it also is great experience."
good,"They rush you through training because they are short staffed but because i learned quickly i was able to adapt easy. poor management, everyone struggled to work with one another most of the time but we had some fun days as well. my store manager was great but his assistance was not so great. the benefits are good and the schedules are flexible."
good,The overall atmosphere of this walgreens was horrible. the managers did not care about their employees. they did not respond efficiently enough and the customers would leave in frustration.
good,No motivation and no appropriate work-load versus personnel balance. The DMs are not fpr the Pharmacist rather looking for mistakes and not motivated to promote employees.
good,They always seamed to have a reason for not giving up raises. Shedules we're changed all the time without much notice. You couldn't have a life. You were not aloud to my personal plans .
good,"Not a horrible place honestly, you have good times and bad times just like at any other job. Yes things can become very hecktic and tempers do flare at times. With the hours being taken as fast as their given is horrible. Making stuff that needs to be done everyday a hassle."
good,"My time with Walgreens was from a retail position. I loved the management in the Bartlett, TN store and I feel they encouraged me to get my certification and once promoted to senior technician there was no other opportunities for advancement which is the reason I left."
good,I loved working at Walgreens bc my cashiers and staff. Management was/is terrible sneaky conniving and untrustworthy. They don’t care about disabled. I was approved for FMLA and then I started being treated different even to the point I was replaced. They only care about themselves and not the good of the customers or staff. I was told several times “Walgreens will still continue whether you are here or we get a couple bad reviews”-GM
good,As a floater pharmacist I have the ability to make & accept a personal schedule...the company is generous with hotel & meal accomodations...they also provide hourly travel time & mileage.
good,"I do not have faith in the direction they are taking the company.  Many of the complaints people have made of the top ten worst companies to work for seem to be the foundations for their new business plan.  They are cutting back hours for associates, they are cutting back benefits for part time employees, and all around making it harder to do the jobs required of you."
good,"I Was A worker for wall greens "
good,"Retail pharmacy is not for me!  The amount of work put on a tech versus the pay is NOT worth it!  The tech has to do EVERYTHING but verify medications, and a person can only take so much from the patients/customers, until they have had just too much and move on to a better job.  I felt like I was disposable at Walgreens."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens, until I had my son and could only work on certain days. Advancements were offered but took forever/didn’t happen like they were suppose to."
good,"busy in the mornings and the evenings, customers will always ask for the higher up, managers are on some weird power trip, scheduling is inconsistent and if you have an issue with it you'll be threatened with termination or less hours"
good,"Working their was great, co workers were awesome. never worked with the store managers only saw 1 of them maybe 10 min every few days. communications was poor on that part. Fighting among floor leads was a big issue. Down grading employees infront of customers and other employees was bad."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is working with our patients. I enjoy the fast pace of the pharmacy.  I have grown as a leader and mentor for new technicians.  The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day on an essentially concrete floor.  I feel like my opinions and suggests matter.
good,What I liked about working there is the opprotunity for advancement was present. You got training and everyone was willing to help/ i learned how to deal with difficult people while remianing calm and still offering good customer service.
good,"Store manager was extremely unreasonable. He cut my hours because I was in the National Guard and couldn't come to work 2 days out of every month. Assistant managers were all okay though, good people and easy to work with."
good,This job helped me earn money. I do not feel connected to the people there or the store environment. I am really looking forward to finding something new. I have worked there for over a year and have never been offered a raise. I am an excellent employee and I am not ever recognized or thanked for any of my hard work.
good,Really nice owners. Good place to learn and understand Independent  Pharmacy Practice. Good place to work and learn. Good culture. Great owners. Great place to work
good,Walgreens is a good place to work if your in school or do not have many other things in your life to worry about. Not a good place for parents you have to work too many late nights and all weekends.
good,"The average recommended employee staff count for each shift was never followed. The closing shift had little help to get managerial duties done since only 1 to 2 employees were scheduled each night. A lot of the cashier duties had to be done by management because of this. The assistant manager and store manager lack human empathy and treat shift managers like machines. Never was able to take a clocked out 30 min break, because of lack of staff. When concern was brought up, it was ignored."
good,"Walgreens once treated its employees very well. However, now Walgreens is moving in the direction many other retailers also seem to be; store managers are given less and less control of their own store with a growing focus on reports, set numbers, plans, and displays. It is more important every store is the same versus store managers having the option to run their store in a way that fits with the store location and other socioeconomic factors. The lower level managers are given more and more tasks and responsibilities without the compensatory pay. Customer service associates are hired as part time and still have their hours cut while not being offered competitive pay or benefits, and they are expected to do the work of three people at once. CSA'S are given the option to be a designated hitter to work in the pharmacy when needed, but management is not given that option, and so management sometimes spends their entire shift in the pharmacy. To advance in the company, you have to have pharmacy/PTCB licensing, but the stress and added responsibilities far outweigh the meagre pay raise."
good,"poor management always nosey in other peoples lives, likes drama. feels like you are back in high school. hardly disciplines employees for calling off or not showing up for scheduled time. very improfessional"
good,"There was never any set hours, I was salary so if I was asked to stay or do an overnight I didn't have a choice. There was no work\family life balance because there was never a set schedule so you could never plan anything with your family because you didn't know what your schedule was going to be the next week.  Management didn't give enough recognition."
good,"Walgreens is a place to get experience, but as a long term job it can be too stressful. At a corporate level i do not believe they realize how the store runs, they need to give more payroll hours"
good,This is your typical part time job. It was bad but it also wasnt great.  Didn't learn or felt the need to grow within the company.  This was basically a job that helped pay the bills while in college.
good,"They should split vacation, sick and personal time.They said that PTO is covering everything but it doesn't they use vacation time to cover everything"
good,Worked here for a long time and most of the advancement were only based on hiring favorites. The pay was not very competitive and the company couldn't figure out how to employ a better scheduling strategy. The managers and employees are underpaid and also over worked for their work duties.
good,"Working as tech is so soul crushing its hurts. This company only cares about money. the stores are so unorganized work wise, its a mess. I canonly speak for my store but the work is outrageous and the compensation is peanuts but they expect you to be perfect. yeah right."
good,"I loved working there at first but the employees that were there already were cliquey, and made me feel like I could never fit in which made work not enjoyable."
good,"When I began working at Walgreens, it was alright for a high school student. However, the longer I worked there, the more responsibility I was given. That isn't an issue, but the pay increase did not match the work.The store manager I started with was relocated, which isn't uncommon. The new store manager was very difficult to work with and there was a definite feeling of tension when he was around in the store."
good,"Upper management/corporate has a complete disconnect from what happens at the store.  They constantly ask you to do more with less.  They don't value their employees.  Recognition beyond the store level doesn't happen.  Long term employees consistently asked to do the same job for less pay because of ""restructuring""."
good,This place is awful. The company is so unorganized and they have no idea what goes on on the sales floor daily. Higher-ups have no idea what they are doing and every change is idiotic.
good,The company has changed over the past few years but it continually develops talent within. Due to dynamic changes in the market the opportunity for career advancement is much more difficult. It is very difficult to plan ahead of time as a floater pharmacist because you do not have a set schedule.
good,I just wish that our security was better and that we had the proper buget to help get more personnel. More often then not we are just swamped with customers and it makes it really hard to properly attend to them if we dont have enough people because of buget cuts.
good,"The place I worked at had a handful of nasty customers as well as employees. The pay rate was as expected and the hours were flexible, but those were the only redeeming qualities about the job."
good,"Work anywhere from 5 to 10 hours a day, and overtime is few and far between. Depending on where you are located, you can either be dead all day or very busy. The customers are part of the reason why I am still there because many will come in and specifically ask me to help them with photo products. However, it can become an incredibly hostile work environment when management just wants to hire bodies without really watching their work ethic. We've gotten stuck with a few employees with very poor work ethic and they have stepped out of their boundaries with many coworkers. When addressed these workers don't stop. I find that incredibly unfair and it makes me not want to work for Walgreens ever again. They will also give raises, but will not honor them if minimum wage goes up. Same with promotions, the pay does not match the level of work done."
good,"Great technology, at the forefront of the industry. Not a lot of diversity, minorities barely move up the ladder. Driven to please shareholders at the detriment of employees. Will cut hours of both techs and pharmacists making a work day or customer service next to impossible."
good,"I think the copany needs to work on comunitcating with there workers on how things are done or how they like it , an more training in diffrent areas in the store."
good,"For all the trouble this position entails, they do not compensate well enough. Store level management can be okay, but senior management=nonsupportive"
good,"I loved working for The Wag when I started. They took care of the employees and I was promoted pretty fast. After the Walgreens family backed off the everyday procedures, it slowly went downhill. They took away our Christmas bonus. Started with the store staying open until 12 am the week before Christmas Day. They didn't allow the store to close for any holidays at all. Only time it was closed was when we had a hurricane headed our way. We switched districts more than once which changed our pay dates. The Dm we had in the Mobile district was amazing, he went out of his way to help us and get our store in the right direction. when we switched back to the new Orleans district, we went bad"
good,"Kind of a chaotic place to work.  Not enough employees much of the time.  Good benefits and some nice co-workers made it enjoyable at times."
good,"It was fun to work at Walgreen's, but there was a long drive to and from work, and I was never guaranteed hours to pay all my bills and the gas to get to and from work."
good,"In a culture of ""the customer is always right"", it makes the consumer bold and aggressive.  Customers had some of the worst behavior I have seen.  If you can tolerate taking the blame for everything and constantly being understaffed, then good luck."
good,Management changes every 6 to8 months ....you start to get to know your management and they send them off only to start over with new manager then your review doesn't to me get some right
good,"All phone work,,, Mandatory OT. Sometimes a hostile environment. Management dose not care about issues. TOTALLY focused on profit. Get the order out the door,,, no matter if correct or not."
good,Because it is a call center it can be somewhat intense. I did enjoy helping people. The hardest part of the job was not being able to completely satisfy each and every person. The most enjoyable part was being able to help people.
good,The pay is not bad if you were to actually work 44 hours a week. But every store is different and some require many more hours than others. With that factored in than for some stores your are not paid enough for what you do.
good,"At my store there were multiple managers who gave conflicting instructions, and one manager in particular played favorites with the employees that they were friends with, never helped when help was called for, and yelled at me in front of other employees for something that was out of my control and on another occasion yelled at a customer for getting mad when the manager messed up."
good,"It's actually decent if you are single and have no children or obligations. But as someone with a family and life outside of work, it just wasn't fair and practical or understanding. Still, overall it was an ok place to be."
good,"I believe that Walgreen's is a great company with the potential to be an Awesome Company. But I believe that treating your employees fairly and paying them fairly is also IMPORTANT. Love the work and I love the people, just not the pay."
good,"A lot of the work load was out onto one-two employees, not staffed enought, 2 employees a night when 4 is actually needed, shiftleaders were supposed to take 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch, we never got those"
good,This company took all I had and then asked for more. The supposed praise always came with a catch. Management communicated poorly and it made me question if I wanted to go into healthcare at all. Management would choose who to terminate based on who they did or didn't like for attributes that did not have to do with their performance. The wages did not reflect the amount of work that you had to do.
good,"typical day at work as a cashier/customer service rep includes all janitorial duties including cleaning bathrooms, emptying waste baskets, out door garbage bins, sweeping outside the store's entrance, cleaning eating facilities/training room and that garbage can, stocking shelves, scanning items for inventory through different methods used, assisting with unloading inventory brought in truck twice a week, loading truck with empty bins, posting and removing sales tags. sweeping and mopping entire store, answering phone calls, making announcements/paging, processing Fed-Ex transactions, processing, Western Union transactions, validating customer identifications as required by law for tabaco and liquor purchases, processing photo orders, checking for and removing expired inventory, assist in closing out registers and maintaining appearance of store."
good,Fast paced work environment. Sometimes you have long hours depending on your role. The pay isn't fair for the amount of work you put in. The benefits are good. The community involvement is good. Wish the company cared about their employees in the field just as well as they care about the ones in the offices and pharmacy.
good,"This was a very stressful workplace, being understaffed while also being very busy. It was very difficult to get work done and there was very little training for the job, I was just thrown in."
good,"started at 6 am, open the door at 7 am, star to run the whole store, register, orders, reset up the new items, new merchandise, fixed any problem with the customers, resolve any difficult  the store have, going another stores, run like is my owe house, together with the Pharmacy, responsibly for deposit, change, place the order every Friday for next week. every store is different. I work around Chicago Loop. I was relocated so many stores thru the years I was in Walgreen's, I had better good experiences and bad, I had Excellent Manager's and bad. I was works so hard. Was my second house for so many years. my shift  was 12 hours a day."
good,It's a super boring job. You stand there for 8hours doing nothing. The management is always breathing down your neck expecting you to check all the customers out and have the store clean at the same time. Most of the time you are working on your own with another person who is normally in the photo lab and with the manager. Which they never come and help you with the customers when you have a line. You will never be able to get things done.
good,No career advancements. Poor management. Lack of benefits/Insufficient benefits. Low work compensation or pay. No useful training. Stressful work conditions.
good,"It is a decent job, as a Pharm tech you learn a lot and you are trained pretty well but it's very stressful and sometimes easy to get caught in the madness. I also hate that you can get written up for almost everything you do there. Kind of annoying."
good,I learned so  mucho working for walgreens but when it comes to the schedule their not fair  and hire employees more than what they really need.When I was hired there it was for cashier and in a short time I was working all departments.
good,"A typical day working for Walgreens consists of assisting customers and cashing out when gets store gets busy. I would be in charge of cosmetics department in the evening and that consisted of helping customers with beauty questions. These questions were relating to what type of products would work for customers such as makeup, shampoo/conditioner, and facial recomendation products."
good,"The job was typical, there we so many different managers got confused on who I was suppose to talk to about anything, but they were all nice. Managers NEVER backed you up when it came to an angry customer"
good,"I worked at a very high production location; 550-600 scripts filled per day.  The customers are very demanding and breaks are very rare.  Experience wise, Walgreens is the best place to learn.  High exposure to virtually every scenario"
good,"Am considered full time(work between 25 and 30 hours a week) as a Cashier. As an older worker who was forced out of the IT area due to off shore outsourcing I collect a partial Social  Security benefits. Am working at Walgreen's just for the Insurance they provide. The insurance  is good, and at my pay rate I receive a subsidy form Walgreen's. Pay is minimum wage. Hours are less then desirable. Currently 4 pm to midnight. Management is non-existent, as long as you don't complain to Corporate about the conditions of the store. Good coworkers. Hardest part of the job is when the stores don't update the sale prices and customers insist the item is on sale. You can't leave the register to verify the sale price as it is usually me and the shift lead on duty."
good,"I learned a lot about retail in general and how to do a lot of different things throughout the store which I am sure will help me in the future. The hardest thing was when I had a lot of things to do in a short amount of time because coworkers were slacking and I don't like to see a job not finished. Despite this, I feel my time was educational and I had a good connection with some of the people I worked with."
good,"Co workers are easy to work with. In between customers stock and face shelves, answering phones, and/or clean. Very flexible with schedules, good for current students."
good,"Working here was very stressful, the work itself was very satisfying however management made the work environment very hostile and it seemed as if they were pitting everyone against everyone else"
good,It took them almost a month to fully get me started. The hours aren't ideal and the pay was minimum wage. The assistant manager was in charge of scheduling and didn't know how to properly schedule everyone.
good,"Overall experience can depend on management of the store, however, if you can get a good crew work is much more enjoyable. Can be stressful work. Especially when open every holiday and the general retail schedules. Advancement can either be too fast or too slow. I've been promised promotions by two separate managers but they have been shut down by District Managers just for some pharmacy technician to be promoted directly from tech to Assistant Manager. It feels like the corporate culture is a bit skewed."
good,"good first time job"
good,Walgreens is a very stressful place to work for especially at a very busy store. Many demands and metrics are monitored and needs to be met. Corporate does not understand firsthand of what goes on at store level and constantly have hours cut when it’s needed most.
good,no don't do it reconsider. more about making pockets happy and healthy rather than making customers and employees happy and healthy. No value on employee satisfaction in regards to scheduling.
good,"The job was very slow paced, and indoors. I didn’t enjoy the co-workers I had or the managers. The pay was very low and I wasn’t offered benefits. I would prefer to never work for Walgreens again"
good,It was fast paced and stressful. They cut the technician help to a bare minimum so the pharmacist was working the drive-through as well as the cash register in between filling prescriptions.
good,"Very challenging and fast paced work. My tasks consisted of answering phones assisting with lines, drive thru and filling prescriptions, while placing medication orders in a timely manner."
good,Most people at Walgreen's will remain at Walgreen's. The Job culture is strong. The history is long. Unfortunately advancement is slow. Past work experience at a direct competitor is irrelevant for job advancement here.
good,It can be stressful at times because the line becomes really long and there aren't any extra technicians to come up and help. Customers are really impatient.There's a lot to memorize. It's good to carry a little pocket book to keep notes in. There is practically no way to move up in the field unless you go to school to become a pharmacist.  I found employees to be very friend and helpful at every location I have worked at.
good,Everybody was great. All managers were really fair with everyone regardless of any differences. If you needed a day off for whatever reason they will give it to you without any problem.
good,"I didn't enjoy working at Walgreens as a front cashier, especially since Walgreens sold cigarettes to customers.It was all very uncomfortable to sell."
good,When first employed at Walgreens it was a great and fun place to work with and a place that cared about its employee and their family. With recent changrs within the company that has changed my outlook of the company.
good,I was working in the pharmacy department and the management was horrible. Basically if you were not there for 17 years expect the always closing shifts or weekend shifts. When any issues would be brought up to management they would automatically side with the senior employee. Made me feel as if I did not have a voice. Also denied my bereavement leave because they were short handed.
good,"Worked as a pharmacist for a few months, very poor experience.  Would not recommend for a new pharmacist graduate.  Forced to work over night, frequently asked to travel 100+ miles, way too many floater pharmacists employed, next to impossible to get a staff position.  Overall, very poor experience."
good,"Some managers are nice but corporates employee are inconsiderate of technician hard work and long hours. Pharmacist do not get breaks, creating an unhealthy work environment for the long run."
good,"Not to dog the whole company over the misfortune I experienced, but the manager I worked for was the worst.  He is no longer with the company and thats very much deserved."
good,It don't matter how much you bust your butt to keep your numbers up or how much stress you suddenly become overwhelmed with while taking amost 500 calls a day YOU ARE JUST ANOTHER TECH. They will train newcomers in better positions before asking someone who's been there longer. Raises were garbage and were given out based on favoritism. If you were kissing butt then you got a deceit raise.
good,No respect for hardworking employees. Culture of fear and retaliation from supervisors. No prospect for advancement but mediocrity thrives because the manager-supervisor are poorly trained.
good,Slow paced environment. Clean and professional. Not a whole lot of fun. Coworkers were okay. Just not one of my favorite places to work. Not a bad place to work just not for me.
good,"Walgreens' district level management is constantly cutting hours at every location, despite increased prescription volume. An already overworked staff is forced to take on even more stress and workload."
good,It was very hectic. Didn't please managers very well. Although you complete the work assigned. IT was more of a playing favorites. It was very disappointing.
good,"They're requiring more and more work while decreasing help hours, salary, and pay raises. Also, employees are being chastised for not getting work completed."
good,"It was fasted past, a lot to learn in such a short time. Management was very ridiculous and rude at times. It was very clique like and sometimes I felt out of place. The store was very busy and we didn't have a lot of help in the pharmacy unless the store manager came to help fill although some customers were very hard to work with some were very sweet and that was my favorite part."
good,I come in to work 4 to 5 days out of the week. We have a numerous amount of prescriptions to fill EVERY SINGLE DAY. There's only 1 pharmacist until the afternoon. Lines and lines of people coming in with their nasty attitudes. We call for help to assist the customers and help hardly ever comes. We rack up numerous customer complaints because their Rx's aren't ready. Phones are simultaneously ringing off the hook and not even half the questions the call center can even handle. Season returns here in South Florida and we still haven't regained our hours back. Sometimes it's extremely sad to say I work for this company. This company needs to do better with its employees and customer service. GIVE THE EMPLOYEES THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMERS!
good,"Working graveyard shift was rough"
good,i thnk they could've gave better hours and had more people working. I would come in and be the only person at the register with long lines and no one would help.
good,The Walgreens I worked at was very very busy. The customers were always in need and management did not assist employees at all. This really changed my perspective of Walgreens
good,"I worked in the pharmacy as a pharmacy technician, and sometimes you were run thin, but it wasn't worth it for only $10.00 an hour.  And when you get certified you only get $11.00.  Not worth it."
good,"The job is not hard, very slow environment. the payment is very low and there are not opportunities to grow, it is hard to move up in the company. if you are a manager your store have to be 50 miles away from your home."
good,"Walgreens is a good company. The work is very task oriented and there is always something needing completion. Very focused on the customer to make sure their needs are met, whether you work at the cash register or back in the pharmacy."
good,Full accountability/responsibility without authority for balance. Very little support from management.  Poor conditions.  Poor attitudes. Physically demanding.  Policies constantly fluctuating.
good,.it was a fast pace workplace was always busy. i always had something to do. good practice of customer service. large amount of money handling. overall was a good job to have
good,Working at Walgreens is a great place for someone who needs flexible hours. There is room for advancement which is great for someone who like a challange.
good,"When I first started with Walgreens it sounded like a great choice to me. The store I started at had a pretty good staff. Everyone had a positive attitude. Then they started cutting hours from every store. This cut down on available people on the sales floor. We were one of the busier stores so it hurt us a lot. Once hours cut our customer service went down. Customers were complaining about the lack of people to help them find things in the store. They keep cutting store hours to help keep corporate pockets lined. Our stores are open every day so we must work on all holidays. That is if you're in the retail stores. If you're corporate, enjoy your holidays off with your family and loved ones while us retail employees have to tell our families ""sorry I have to work."""
good,"At my store it was very in organized... Schedules never stayed the same,  the store manager was very unprofessional and inconsistent. One of the not so pleasant jobs."
good,"Terrible pay, terrible management. I've never worked for a company before that valued their customers so poorly. I wouldn't recommend anyone to apply there. They are a sinking ship and I'd be surprised if they didn't go under in a few years. Good riddance to that cancerous atmosphere."
good,"Walgreens used to be great but unfortunately they were bought off.  They changed their positions titles and didn't develop enough.  They hire anyone or the wrong people.  There was no team, it was more about the manager and getting tasks done."
good,"The Company is good, The management is bad, you will get some stores where the managers are really nice and will help you move up. and most other places are filled with controlling ones that will bring you down and hinder your chances of you moving up, They will lie and manipulate and try to keep you in the same place. There is alot of preference too."
good,"Nothing special or complicated about this job. Handle cash register and learn how to interact with customers. You will, also, be stocking products a lot."
good,A lot could be done to help make this company much better than it is. the company is good to its customer s but i believe the could be more caring about their employees.
good,"They will promise raises and promotions that won't come.  Changes will always be on the way ""next month.""  I don't feel like the upper management is at all connected to what is actually happening on the sales floor here."
good,"pharmacy is fast paced anyways which is fine, its that they dont schedule enough employees to appropriately handle the business. I have gotten certified and havent been able to learn more to advance because nobody wants to teach you. the senior techs here prefer to be the only ones who know how to do the bigger things. lack in communication when it comes to scheduling, if you change your availability, they are unwilling to work with you to schedule anything else; they assume and then give you no hours. the senior techs talk down to you, and make you feel stupid for trying to do your job. the same people who are there to ""help train"" refuse to teach or work with you."
good,"It is a diverse place to work and there are opportunities for advancement. There are incentives for employees, depending on what state you live in, you can get a lot of perks."
good,"Good place to start out ,but management was never clear on items always had to ask to communicate with me .I learn how to place orders using a telzon and learned about cosmetics."
good,"The company of Walgreens overall is amazing, and offer great opportunity to those seeking advancement in corporate. However, each store location has a store manager, and all managers are not fair to employees. If you're at a location where all are treated fairly and equally, that will be a great place to work. Overall, a lot of work is expected from regular associates, and the pay does not equal to the amount of work given. Our company is all about promoting within our stores, but our manager promotes outside of our store and company so my coworkers and myself have not experienced that personally. There is no work/life balance. I go to work every morning, and leave every night. The only time I am home is to go to sleep, wake up and go back into work in a few hours. I am a full time college student and barely can create a balanced time management due to me being at work most of the time. Once I started working I have experienced that my job and customer service is priority over college, family, health, and life due to personal experiences and what I've been told personally from my managers. If I were given an opportunity to work at another store under fair management, I will give it a chance, but I work in a very unstructured district overall."
good,This job was given to me because of my brothers mother. The job was full of girls which was okay but the lack of males to conversate with on breaks was lackluster. To make matters worse the manager was sexist and would only treat us bad for things we didn't even do but ignored the mistakes the girls do EVERY single TIME.
good,The job was okay to work at. It was just a little summer job that I needed. The pay was not that great but I wasn't expecting to get paid that much...
good,"I have learned many valuable skills working with my counterparts. "
good,Took job as Designated Hitter which requires running photo lab as well as learning functions and helping in the Pharmacy. Also stocked shelves and provide customer service.
good,It used to be a good place to work. Used to take care of their employees. It was a fun job years ago. Like all good things. Everything comes to an end.
good,The hardest part of the job was the occasional difficult customer. The most enjoyable part of the job were regular customers that would come in and make my day.
good,Normal Work Environment But other Staff Had poor work ethic And were with the company longer then I was so It was very Unbearable me being an Over acheiver being around of Slackers and Time wasters The Work was Great I enjoyed the Work Just couldn't stand the Co workers They Were way to Negative and It was the Hadrest thing to Handle was When I worked really Hard they would always question me or When I I was working hard they Would make a Scene like I am Making them Tired or something of that nature I couldn't stand it
good,"Not usually too busy, but it had it's crazy days. I learned how to operate a cash register and work bays. Management was friendly and helpful. At first it can be difficult working with angry customers, but you get to meet a lot of new people."
good,"Walgreens is a very demanding job.  There is a lot of physical work, as well as a fast paced sales environment.  There is not much room for moving up in this field."
good,depending on your manager the environment can totally change. They expect a lot from their employees for minimal compensation. They don't agree with going to school while working full time.
good,"Open cash registers, get store ready for customers. I learned how to open and close a store. My manager was very hard to work for, none of the employees liked him much. You always had work to do, which I like to stay busy. Making sure you got the truck done on time."
good,"Typical day at Walgreen's for me currently, is to off load product from trucks. Receive the product in and put onto conveyor system. The hardest part of the job is double checking to make sure the product is received correctly and not damaged. I have learned how to use the AS400 in the Receiving department. I learned the WEBTma system, in the maintenance department, while covering for someone who was out on medical leave, and I have repeatedly gone back to help out when needed. Management could use improvement in the sense that they need people who communicate in a way that does not seem condescending or rude. Also, management could use people who are willing to learn, understand and improve the department they are in, a few managers do not understand or know what to do in their department and they have been in the department for quite a while. The workplace culture, many people are fed up and are getting burnt out from the daily politics that are happening there."
good,Employees are not recognized for good work. Hard workers go unnoticed and lazy people are promoted. I believe it would be better to switch workers at the main register mid shift. Standing at the main register for long periods at a time put a huge strain on the back. So if you could look into switching main cashiers mid sift that would be nice.
good,"Management does not recognize leadership staff."
good,I would check outdates and maintain the liquid bays from the stockroom and in the cooler/freezer. I would scan outs from my bays also print photos and make cavnas and calendars.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with.  I like fast paced and challenging work environment. I managed and coached all my employees to be their best on a daily basis.  I maintained excellent relationships with both customers and employees through honesty,  empathy and trust ."
good,"the manager I had was very rude and inconsiderate to his employees. he treated us like we were below him. some times he would do the schedule so that we worked 9 or 10 days in a row and some days were 10 -12 hours long, he would have us close on one day and open the next, because of him I did not enjoy the job at all."
good,Not enough opportunity for advancement and salary was low compared to other management positions elsewhere. The most enjoyable part of the job is i learned a great deal about leadership because im young compared me colleges and it was my first management job
good,"A typical day would be to pick and pack supplies and medication and get your route together for your deliveries and then making said deliveries. I learned that it was more gratifying taking life saving and life changing medications and supplies to those that were in need than having time off for myself. Management were pretty hands off and friendly. I didn't experience much of the workplace culture, because I spent most of the time on the road. The hardest part of the job was learning that a patient that you had been serving had passed away. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that an ill patient was now well and no longer need of my service."
good,"Walgreens...just plain boring. unless you plan on going into the medical field. It was an easy job but there just wasn't much to do, and god forbid you try and ask to do anything else."
good,"Understaffed, underpaid, undervalued.  When your ability to make (or fake) random phone calls to customers who don't want to receive them is valued higher than your ability to drive the business and take care of your patients, there's an issue with the direction the company is going."
good,"Retail is not for everyone.  The things that made it hard for me to enjoy this job were the hours, the floating, and some of the customers.  The hours made it really hard to have a life. Pair that with floating; some nights I didn't get home until 11:30 at night! And of course there are the rude customers...blah!  I enjoyed the fast pace and helping my patient with medication questions. There really isn't any place for advancement in retail besides a pharmacy manager then a district manager. Not interested!"
good,could be a great place to work but to much drama goes on and the management has their favorites. nobody cares about how others are doing as long as job gets done.
good,Good job if you don't have small children. Was hard at time to get a set schedule to co exist with my child's daycare and schooling schedule. Other then that it was a great place to be.
good,"Store to store environment varies, I actually enjoy my coworkers and managers a lot. The higher ups on the other hand need some better outreach to their lower level employees. I cannot say much about benefits as I do not use them but they are offered so that is a plus. The pay also is not great considering walgreens is usually open on holidays and for me I have to stay at work until 1 am all while going to school."
good,It's a decent job to work but not very flexible If you are in school. They pay was fine but not much advancement. If you can completely make commit to Walgreens and only Walgreens then that's fine for you.
good,"Just another average job that any high school or college student can use to make quick money. I would clock in, and sign into the register at the front and start putting the sales tags on the front shelves. Some of my managers were nice. The hardest part of the job would be standing in the front for hours. My coworkers were very nice."
good,"meeting nice people is the most enjoyable."
good,"Would not recommend this job to anyone.  Walgreens cut the labor budget and added more work.  Highly stressful position, was salaried per RXM status however didn't get paid for full number of hours worked.  Was expected and required to do ""volunteer"" clinics and community service ""on my own time"". I enjoy volunteering but should NOT be required."
good,"Personally, working at Walgreens has been a challenge for me. I started as a sales representative and had to push to become trained in the pharmacy because management did not listen very well. Whenever I have complaints, they often do not know how to handle or solve them and only the same people get noticed or praised the most often. Issues in the workplace rarely get resolved and it is frustrating. Also, a fellow technician makes the schedule and constantly changes it after it has been posted without notifying staff and then acts hostile towards us. The best part is helping people and getting that type of satisfaction. The worst part is the lack of communication."
good,"Standard retail responsibilities. Customer service oriented. Used to have lower management positions that have since been replaced with lower-paid positions, removing upward mobility."
good,Leaders don't communicate. Employees don't care about the company. No one ever says thank you for helping out.benefits are good. Discount is great and walgreens items ok on name brand
good,I have been with walgreens for a year I work graveyards. Which is just a ghost shift managers don't pay attention to us do not give us recognition. Since I've been here i have not got a raise I have not been told what I'm doing correct I have been told what I have done wrong but they do not want to show me how to do it right they will just give the dutie to someone else instead. Supposedly grave yard is supposed to get a higher pay than day shift but all I get is an 18 cent difference.
good,"High energy job, attention to detail is a must for this job. I was an intern for the Pharmacy, as a technician. I enjoyed the team that I was paired with and learned a great deal."
good,The truck days are hard because you have to unload heavy pallets of store merchandise. You also have to be at work very early in the mornings. I was stuck on truck duty for a month straight.
good,Customer service very enjoyable and rewarding. Company strives to high standards of customer satisfaction. Supportive training for each department and management staff readily available.
good,The pharmacy is extremely busy and understaffed. The store manager at 5765 is rude. If you can get past all of that the pharmacy can be like a family working together. There are times when it's really hard and 800 scripts a day is rough. Everyone get through it together.
good,Very busy place to work for and a lot of holidays and weekends that you must work but overall a great experience to get your foot in the door as far pharmacy goes and to gather great customer service experience
good,Good experiences at the management level but long hours and a lot of work on your plate with average resources to support.  Company constantly in cost cutting mode and very little in the form of employee investments.
good,The best and only good part is the customers they make my shift every time I work I love working with some amazing people but other then that nobody wants to see you shine and do better than them they are all greedy and just want to see you stay in the same place for years.
good,The management was very organized. Scheduled always changing unexpectedly. They really didn't care about the workers schedule it always changed around without notice.
good,"Great place to learn and develop your skills for your future career.  Walgreens helps develop change management skills with their rapidly evolving structure, core beliefs and expectations."
good,"Company is really stingy with hours but expects everything to be done on time anyway. Literally gives us 30-year-old scan guns to use, as they break almost every week.  Upper management will use any dirty tactic they can in order to get rid of a lower level manager. Would definitely say they do NOT care about their employees."
good,"I am a cashier that helps customer's with their purchases. Walgreens offers flexible work hours, it can be fun and we have an unique crew.  Only the favorites get promoted. Raises SUCK!!"
good,I really enjoyed my time at Walgreens. The pharmacist on staff was an excellent example of a medical professional and truly cares about her patients and employees.
good,"Basic requirements to work here. Management isn't the best, favoritism is highly seen in this work place. Very little benefits if any. Not so great communication skills between management and workers."
good,Walgreen was a good job with benefits. I departed from Walgreen when I got married. The Management team was great and very helpful to all employees needs.
good,The store manager as well as most of the employees showed little interest in benefitting and bettering the live of their workers. No one cares about anything.
good,"Walgreens has changed dramatically since I began working there 10 years ago.  Overall, the benefits are really great but the company is constantly going through change which can be extremely stressful.  They have been in a constant reorganization since 2009 which is great for some, but there has been a lot of job loss as a result.  I enjoy the constant challenges that come along with the change, but the management thrives on favoritism.  The corporate politics can be defeating.  There is a lot of opportunity for growth for some, but it is easy to get lost in an organization of this size."
good,I started at Walgreen on Darlington and HWY 19.  I saw myself with great potential after having the new ASM took over during March 2016. He made so much changes in the working environment.  We became his team to help our Store Manager to achieve his and Walgreen's goal.  The growth and employees participation grew tremendously.  I miss that feeling of being a part of a team. I miss the drive to going forward and feeling that there is growth on my career at Walgreen.  But that feeling drives me to look for a secured and stable career somewhere else who can see my potential as well as a good employee determined to be part of a team.
good,"My manager consistently complained over every move I made and I would work harder every day to try to make sure to not disappoint her. I'm definitely not perfect, I'm a human like anyone else. I was not treated that way at all, though. Any time any of my coworkers did anything wrong, I was the one she would blame. This happened quite often, as most of my coworkers were too busy socializing and being friends to do work. Which was also a big part of why everything was an issue in the first place. My boss was pretty young and so were my coworkers. I was the second oldest person in the store (and I was only 33-years-old) and all of the younger people would regularly party and hangout off the clock as well. Apparently, this meant I was to be treated badly because no one wanted to be mean to their friends. I did attempt to be friendly with them, but found that the more I did that, the less work got done and the more complaints my manager had. Ultimately, I injured myself working too hard and quit the job."
good,My time there was frustrating because no one trained you.  Lots of videos to watch and then you feel like a robot counting pills and working cash register while you handle phone calls and call people and fill orders.
good,"I was hired at minimum wage, nobody can live off of minimum wage. The lifers make probably 10$ an hour while the company makes billions. They don't care about their employees just the company. They make you up sell the customers and don't care if you offend them. It is all about the company, not the customers and not the employees."
good,"A typical day includes: helping customers, cleaning up the store like taking out the trash, grabbing carts, returning lost items to their homes...etc. Managers and co-workers are professional. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor like lifting heavy loads. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers smile."
good,"There are hardly any managers to help assist you.  You have to do 30 things at once, and most of those assignments belong to the managers. Even when other workers see you struggling, they refuse to help you out. Luckily, the store manager always gets them back in shape. Photo has been thus far the most rewarding job, since it's fun to do and real easy to learn."
good,"I took this job out of necessity and I understand it its not an ideal career choice, but bills needed to get paid. I just want to say that this review does not reflect on all Walgreens locations."
good,"While employed at Walgreens I must say that I had a great experience. Everyone was friendly and management was always ready to help me in any way they could. The coaches were hands on and there was never a question that went unanswered. On a typical day calls were always coming in back to back and the environment was always fast pace. I learned how to deal with customers that may not be the nicest, and still in spite of them provide excellent customer service. I would have to say the hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers, but I found that once I learned to separate my personal feeling from work and remembered that I am a representation of my company I was able to handle the customer with respect and care I became a pro at defusing and calming an irate customer."
good,All I can say is no comment...you have to actually be working there to understand the way everything is run. It has its good days and bad. Do I like it? That's a rhetorical question.
good,Manager at this particular Walgreens was not organized and really did not know how to talk to his employees or his costumers
good,The store I work at has good employees but poor management / store manager. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they needed the job. It pays somewhat well but it's hard to move up unless you're a favorite of the company.
good,"I started work at Walgreens on Jul 20, 2016 "
good,Everyday would be a mission. The place was ALWAYS busy! Work was only slow in the morning and at night. The employees were great and very supportive! If given the chance I would most defiantly work there again! I learned great communication and critical thinking skills from there and the pressure of working directly under management.
good,"Great job when your management cares about your life-needs. Good for energetic, 20-somethings to establish their first management position. Not so good for more mature, hardworking folks not interested in moving up, then you are considered easily replaceable and your life needs irrelevant. Personnel changes constantly."
good,"Company lacks promotions"
good,"Pay nominal"
good,"I like the people I work with for the most part. Walgreens is not a horrible job. But I am looking for a Monday-Friday ""9-5"" job, in which is the hardest part of the job for myself. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with some of the people I work with and being trusted to work independently on tasks I have been given. A typical day at Walgreens consists of talking to customers any time someone comes into my range, merchandising, making sure all my tasks are completed on my task list, and most of the time working over in the photo department just to help out. I have learned how to run the photo department and cosmetics. I have advanced on my communication skills, time management, and organization. Like I said, Walgreens is not a bad job. It is your typical retail job."
good,"As a summer intern, I found Walgreens corporation to have strong business platform. I enjoyed attending the leap classes. However, the store management I experienced was poor. The manager and assistant manager made blatant racist comments and opened opportunity advancements based on personal biases and favoritism. They promised a continuation of the internship program into the school year, then abruptly terminated my position based on a faulty online math examination. They sugar coated reasons to get rid of me, and at the same time never provided positive feedback on my progression. This my personal experience with the store I was located in. Walgreens needs to improve the way they subjectively evaluate employees for career advancements. Their ASMT selection process leads to favoritism and bias. Not to mention the fact that managers are given bonuses if they hire persons of color, and have a given number of leadership of color. This is a great way to increase diversity, but lends to basing employment solely for that fact and is problematic with management who have racist biases."
good,"At this job I was capable of more than required.  There was very little training or positive influence to achieve, only brittle attitudes with goals."
good,The company provided many opportunities to learn the procedures throughout the store. Friendly co-workers and management.
good,"Now working as a Service Clerk after long career as Assistant Manager and recently as Pharmacy Techincian. Typical day is a busy one, usually filled with customer and employee interaction. Learned importance of valuing others opinions and needs when trying to build a team atmosphere.New management and policy has made working at Walgreens a much more difficult prospect. Swing shifts and difficult work scheduls, in addition to reduced pay, have made going to work every day a challenge.Most of the people I have worked with have been enjoyable to work with, and I truly enjoy helping my customers even if the challenge to do so is sometimes  difficult."
good,"* A typical day at work is stressful it's so much being shoved on one person & not one person is willing to help or work with you"
good,"daily job was stressful. there was no accountability for the people who didnt want to do their jobs so it made the had workers work even harder. It made it difficult to come to work each day without leaving in tears, leaving late or leaving angry. the job itself is rewarding, helping patients and all but the location is difficult to work at."
good,Growth in my area has increased with leaps and bounds. Bonus is tied to revenue in which expectation for 2016 was based on something that has not been explained to any of the account managers.  Total compensation packet was provided on a different bonus opportunities.
good,I was able to learn a lot about mail service. The job it self was a nice job. Most of the people there were great to work with.
good,"Over the years, the company have went from employee oriented to profit oriented. Reduction in benefits, little to no room for advancement.  The only chain pharmacy besides CVS that pays above 13/hr starting."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was working with may great people that were always willing to collaborate and partner to make improvements throughout the organization.
good,"This is a retail establishment and it can be difficult at times.  Difficult with co workers, management, and sometimes the customers.  I loved my job, however things have changed, there is no work ethic and no disciplinary actions taken when needed. Employees have been rewarded for the bad behavior, bad attendance, etc,  Very disappointed in what used to be rewarding."
good,"The management was not to helpful,did not get very many hours to work each week. Other employees was not too helpful at things needed."
good,"pay rates were very low for the amount of work that was asked of us. Like the saying goes- ""over worked and under payed""... very true, and walgreens company seems stingy"
good,This is a great company to work for.  They care about their employees and customers alike.  not much room for advancement however.
good,"A typical day at work depends on the manager on duty and also the employees working the same shift with you. I learned many things working at Walgreens. Management is great if working with a great shift lead. Co-workers aren't a problem if you don't get along, but makes you enjoy working if you connect with your co-workers. Hardest part of the job is just dealing with customers on very busy days such as on the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job is just working with your friends."
good,The job was rewarding. Management should be revisited and those who are chosen to operate in these positions should assure sales representatives of fairness in the work place
good,Work day high stress coworkers ok management not great very demanding little advancement oppurtunities not a good place to work
good,"Company is greedy, and has no moral values when it comes to loyalty towards its employees. Walgreens focuses more about buying out other companies instead of taking care of its own people that have been loyal to the company."
good,Working here was great at first. Management was great and the co-workers made me feel like family. I was always busy and that was a excellent thing to me. I was taught how to play the role of the manager there. I learned a lot about cooking in a fast pace environment. Pay was under the table. I didn't have not issue with the owner until he decided to go out of business and not pay everyone the total amount of money everyone was entitled to.
good,Overwhelming pressure from management. Make you feel like you cant have a home life that its all about the company and that's the end of it. The job itself isn't bad I think its just the culture the upper management is trying to push that is discouraging as an employee to be a part of. I really love my field of work so I cant let one apple spoil the bunch. So I am spreading my wings so to speak and seeing what is out there for me.
good,"Walgreens says it encourages Diversity and Inclusion, however, they have a set way for stores to set planograms throughout the store and if you change anything, you are considered to be insubordinate. I understand the use of planograms, however if you are going to pride yourself on Diversity and Inclusion, you have to be willing to allow your people to be innovative and act on their ideas. This has proven to increase productivity and drive profits."
good,This was the first place I was able to mix my clinical and retail pharmacy experience. I enjoyed the variation of customers and fast paced environment.
good,"Pros"
good,A typical day consisted of data entry. Processing prescription refill and faxing over refill request to doctors. Working with insurance companies for prior authorization. dispensing and filling prescriptions.
good,"I worked at different stores at Chicago city, compared to Rockford Area, there was so much high volume of patients' prescription and had not enough help from management and from store managers in Rockford area. They keep cutting in technician hours for us pharmacist be alone closing the pharmacy and on one high patient volume stores with only 1 new technician that can not multi-task."
good,it really depends on who the store manager is. walgreens is very basic work. easy for the most part. if your management cant handle pressure well then coming to work is going to be stressful.
good,"a typical day full of stress."
good,"Being on record as a full-time technician never guaranteed me a full week of 40 hours.  In fact, I was lucky to get 32 hours, and there was little if any overlap between tech shifts."
good,management was changed way to often so it was very hard to settle to work ethics there. employees never got along and had to work almost every holiday.
good,I was employed with walgreens for 6 years i've learned so much there i can load and unload truck ...I have plenty of experience on the register counting my draws down at the end of each night i also have experience as a pharmacy technican and a photo tech i learn i can work under pressure and train others and take direction well so with that being said walgreens gave me a pretty great experience
good,"I enjoyed Walgreens for the most part. Just like any other job, you will have co-workers and managers that will get on your nerves, and some of the customers will be unruly. The downfall is getting your hours cut. The pay is okay, it could be better."
good,the atmosphere was always fast paced due to us being a busy store but I loved that about the location I worked at. My coworkers were very friendly which was a big plus. I will always have opportunities to grow and was taught a lot by my store manager who always worked with us.
good,A typical day includes lots of customer that are sick and some well and having to deal with multiple Dr offices. Also you have to be able to answer phones check customers out at drive thru and front counter and be able to fill prescriptions by a certain time frame. Also you have to keep a track of inventory. There are times you have to call patients to verify that they have medications ready for pick to see if they are still interested in filling there medications at that certain time.etc..
good,hired more employees than hours to give. I work all cashier duties and stock as well as customer service. The management team offers training and support as much and as long as needed.
good,"you won't be willing to work there 10+ hours EVERY SINGLE DAY no matter how good you are paid."
good,"Cashier work, stocking and customer service.  Helping guests find any product they were in need of.  Store clean up at end of shift."
good,"Worked to manage initiatives in several departments, train and develop staff, and meet sales goals. Worked to pursue excellence in the customer experience."
good,learned a lot about dealing with retail. how to be prepared for sales and holiday promotions. learned to order a controlled inventory. deal with coworkers in a managment position
good,"I worked as a cashier, checking out customers as quickly and efficiently as possible. I also stocked shelves, unloaded freight and checked for out-dates."
good,go in get on register talk with customers maybe get on sales floor stock items go on break then go home walgreens is a very good job to have while in school
good,"Happy Harry's was a great company to work for. When Walgreen's took over, the compensation was better and benefits, however, hours were severely cut making it hard to get fulltime hours without going from store to store."
good,The job itself was rewarding. Helping patients through the prescription medication process was satisfying work. Management seemed to have confusing and unnecessary daily/weekly goals that were consistently changing making our jobs somewhat harder. Short term goals were not consistent with long term goals. Coworkers were fantastic individuals who often worked as a team to overcome large workloads.
good,"DO NOT ACCEPT ANY GIFTS from customers, if you do accept them, you have to give it to your manager so that THEY can do what they want with it, I was fired for accepting a Christmas gift from a regular customer(a gift card) and used it for myself. They fired me on Christmas Eve"
good,"The customers are nice, job is not hard. No advancement opportunities. It seems that the young people today don't have pride in the store they work in. Walgreens' states that the employees should ""own it"" but no one seems to care anymore."
good,It was my first job but the one I was at was very slow paced. The customers are very rude. Its hard to maintain my composer with the customers. But the employees are nice.
good,"Pleasant place to work-scheduling options are attractive."
good,"Typical work day included resolving escalated issues from the Asset Managers in the field and corporate management. Corporate duties included creating RFP's, meetings, special projects and communication of programs to the field. New management was installed over the last 3 years. A number of managers had minimum experience in maintenance or leadership skills which required patience in delivery of the message to the Asset Managers and with the customer. Coworkers relationships were both good and bad. The new inexperienced management hires were bad but the experience management relationships and were great. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with constant changes within the company. Once a simple tasks became buried in bureaucracy. The most enjoyable part of the job was problem solving and relationships with the field, the customer and legacy employees."
good,"You would think that a company such as Walgreens would pay more than it does, but they start off with minimum wage. They are always busy and have so many rules for you to follow. Greetings, suggestive sales, ECC., etc. I love my coworkers, all of them but management is horrible, except for two of them. The store manager is by far the worst one"
good,"Greet and assist customers with all their needs, learned how to take orders for customers, management was good, my co workers were the best."
good,50-60 hour week. I really enjoyed the time I was there but unfortunately there were well documented changes that forced the cost cutting measures. This affected both employees and customers. Pretty much par for the industry though. I enjoyed the hands on opportunity and true ownership of the business while it lasted.  As of late it is all cookie cutter. Worked with some outstanding managers and leadership over the years. I am grateful for that experience.
good,"i enjoy this postion because of its interaction with customers on a daily basis on the hour , my co - workers are a joy to be around because their just as friendly as myself"
good,"Its ok part time job, expect you to get pushed over by the older employees that been there since the beginning of time, And the messed up work schedules"
good,"Every week they want you to learn a new phrase such as ""Be Well"" and if you don't learn you can be written up. Aside from that, working there was fun."
good,"Closing Shifts are typically busy. Sometimes simple objectives end up getting delayed or all together ignored because of the on going traffic of customers I need to attend to. This can be frustrating for someone who loves having a mission to complete with the desire to see it to completion. You have to decide weather the time it takes to complete is worth the energy if its only going to get half done."
good,Working at Walgreens is not worth it and I will tell you why. You will go through training that is not applicable to the job and extremely irrelevant. You will not learn basic job duties until you have been there for weeks or months and this will lead you to look like a chicken running around with its head cut off. Management is great there but you can expect to never EVER have a set schedule and your hours will change every week out of no where. You will find yourself getting an extremely large number of tasks about an hour before you close leaving you stressed. Expect to also have shifts from 3pm-12am and then 7am-3pm the next day leaving you sleep deprived. The good thing about this job is that it is NOT minimum wage.
good,"Jobs in general always depend on who you work with, but for the Walgreens store in Gillette, Wyoming I was treated very unfairly, talked behind my back, as was my good co-worker. Laughs were stiffled for reasons I am not aware of. The agreed upon 35 hours per week when I first started was complied with, but soon (90 or so days afterwards, when befits would start kicking in.) Soon downgraded to 30, then to 25 then back up to 29 once brought across to management. For my benefits I had to make a MINIMUM of 30 hours PER WEEK, and they cut me off at 29. After months of bringing this up, I finally quit, and will not ever again want to work at a Walgreens/CVS store AGAIN.  Besides that though, the job was fairly easy - if you were to work in cashiering as I did, you would do some stocking here and there, but it was mainly keeping your front clean and greeting customers, and always giving every customer a smile - even if you were rushing!"
good,"I arrive at work either morning or night, it's either steady busy or slow. "
good,not paid enough for the job you do. very very stressful working conditions that required me to take a medical leave for my third trimester in pregnancy because of the stress it caused.
good,I really liked Walgreens. Every day was very busy.  Loved helping customers .Seeing the smiles on their faces after helping them. The store I worked in needed management help. I liked most of my co workers. There was more work than employees which was a bad thing. The work wasn't hard and I like to keep busy. It seemed to me that District office was never happy with worked that was done I hated there visit every other month. Never any complements.
good,"I dealt with customer throughout the whole day. With that being said, I also did the inventory, orderings, answering phones, and clean. Because it wasn't so busy, it made things run smoothly for the most part."
good,The only thing I did like about working here was after I got moved to the photo lab where I stayed busy my whole shift. I did not like having to pick up everyone else's slack.
good,"•	Recruit, hire, train, and supervise 40+ store personnel; coach, mentor, and develop team members for operational excellence and to deliver the highest level of customer service"
good,"Very fast paced environment with many things to do , entering prescriptions, taking care of insurance issues, restocking, taking care of customers. I love the pharmacy profession as it is more important than ever to provide patients with correct medication for their life. Be it due to illness or to maintain their lifestyle, ensuring proper treatment is achieved."
good,"Helping people is what I like to do.  I learned about medications and what they are used for, inventory reduction and maintenance. Co-workers were great for the most part.  Some complained too much so that made it stressful.  My pharmacy manager was not very fun to work with.  I never knew my schedule.  When I did get it I was pulling back to back shifts, closing one night opening the next day, closing the next day opening the next day.  I have a kid. I'm a single mother.  I can't be working shifts like that."
good,"When opening the store everyone felt rushed, setting a discouraging tone for the day. "
good,"A lot of gossip and drama amongst management and employees (about 90% females). I stayed out of the majority of it by just doing my job. Besides that I had some fun and interesting experiences during my year there. However I do feel like I made $3-4 less than I probably should have for the amount of work, effort, and patience required. This job was just a means to an end while I looked around for something better and it served it's purpose! I recommend you don't stay any longer than you need to unless you're interested in becoming a GM."
good,"A typical day consists of prescription intake, entry, fulfillment and selling.  Great customer service is routine so we try to make every patient experience a great one."
good,"Met some really great co-workers. The hardest part was lack of schedule flexability, I hardly ever had weekends off."
good,Great work environment. Daily tasks kept you busy along. all employees were very nice and easy to work with.
good,Normally work in photo department and go up front and work on the cash register and their are normally 3-4 managers on shift. I have about 10 other co-workers who I get along with great and they make the day go by quicker. The hardest part clois probably closing when you stay about and hour after closing and clean around the entire store.
good,"Management is terrible, they don't care about their employees."
good,Overall a typical customer service job in which you learn to dread.
good,The people are great to work with and work as a team to get things done and meet the store goals. Management on the other hand lacks involvement and encouragement. They lack in discipline and communication.
good,I didn't have a good experience with Walgreen's as a part time college student. I worked very long and late shifts and had little time between classes to get to work. I also worked very late shifts with my manager knowing that I was in school.
good,"Typical Work day includes team management, administrative duties, cash handling, merchandising, customer Interaction, conflict resolution, analyzing sales trends, inventory,vendor/ management."
good,Walgreens is a fast paced company that I thrive in. I am however ready to excel in other areas of work.
good,I used to love my job there until corporate started expecting too much. They wanted good customer service but yet they do not provide sufficient staffing for everything they expected you do get done in a day. Did like my co-workers & most customers.
good,Meet alot of great peaple as well as bad individuals. If your thing is retail this job might be for you.
good,"When I started working for this organization, I had zero experience in the pharmacy field. I came from working in a lab for 5 years. I was pretty much told that I would be fine because I had ""medical"" experience I knew that I had to do some training, however each day I went in for training which was on a computer I was called in to work in the pharmacy. I had to learn quickly because I never started the computer work & I was thrown into the job. I made so many mistakes & I was being penalized for them, & this was after the second week. I thought I was not going to make it.  I would go into the bathroom & cry but after another week I sucked it up and decided not to quit. I fought to learn everything.  Borrowing a pharmacy book from the library & writing everything down.  Eventually I became a very successful tech going to stores that needed help.  One store was closer to where I worked & they have a very short staff, I would work a full day at my store, then go to this store & work 4-5 hours at this store. Eventually I transferred to this store.  This store was almost as bad a where I came from, the lines would be to the front door. I would work maybe 5 hours by myself before another tech would come in & vice versa, Some days it would only be one tech & one pharmacist, & a another tech & pharmacist would come in to replace the ones that worked the first shift. Leaving the tech to fill scripts, cashier both the drive-thru and front & process scripts; with the pharmacist of course.  I began working 6 days a week 10 hours a day. The other tech that worked there would say well look"
good,"This is a good company to start out in. It is a slower paced job compared to other retails careers which gives all employees a chance to learn how to do their jobs. However it is not something to have a career in even being in management. "
good,"I was an extern here so I didn't actually work here. Didn't get as much education as expected here, but it was a good learning experience."
good,"Worked in Photo Printing department, enjoyed working there with the exception of dealing with managers letting employees getting away with whatever they wanted because they were sleeping together."
good,The work was pretty easy and simple. The store was often slow.
good,"Always something to do"
good,"great customers when they are satisfied, management loves to discuss improvement potential"
good,I open the store greet offer assistance and check out the customers purchases. My co workers are supportive and team work oriented. The most enjoyable part is engaging with the customers
good,"Task driven days, managers wear to many hats"
good,at convergys I would take over 200 calls per day. a real fast pace environment with not enough promotions
good,"A typical day can be fast or slow depending on which part of day or season. It is tiring sometime being on feet for 8 hours continuously but when we are busy working we don't realize that. "
good,"Great co-workers but unorganized management, frustrating scheduling and work equipment. A typical day is non-stop customers and failing computers. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rough customers and the most enjoyable is able to help great customers."
good,"Overall a decent company. Did not appreciate where the company was going in terms of ""moving up"" in the company and the pay cut."
good,"Great Company to work for, management was excellent. I am very pleased to say this company gave me many opportunities."
good,"Company doesn't care about you nor family."
good,Working for this company is for younger people only. The pay is low and the stress is high. You have no set scheduling and no social life.
good,"Employees there were nice, but as far as management was not good. Management often changed rules and responsibilities and made it confusing as to what we were allowed to do and what we were not allowed to do. Management also had bad attitude."
good,"All in all, the job itself wasn't that bad. You came into work, did what you needed to do, then leave. "
good,typically job..not much room for advancement. management was messy.
good,"Day to day activities are dependent upon task that need to be fulfilled. Warehouse, ordering, rests/revisions, and customer engagement are all typical parts of any day. Being able to help customers is always the most enjoyable part of my day."
good,I had to make my customers happy with a wonderful attitude and positive thinking.
good,There are a lot of great people that go through Walgreens but the management staff was a little sketchy. Some managers were great people though.
good,I learned most of my customer service skills here.  I enjoyed working with the staff.  The store manager was awesome!  The managers under him were terrible.  They talk to you as if you were a child.  The hardest part about this job was dealing with assistant managers and racism.
good,Not enough hours and management was misleading in hiring process
good,i enjoyed working with the customers. i had some good times with some of my co-workers as well
good,"Penny's for pay, decent benefits, no consistent work weeks, Advancements within the company are selective and management breaks promises that they can not keep."
good,"I am looking for a new job because at Walgreens, I have no chance for advancement. I have asked multiple times to be promoted to a full-time position, and have been told that I will be informed when one comes up. However, when one comes up, the position is filled by a new associate. There is no sense of seniority within the hiring process. The people that have been there for a while aren't given any sense of security."
good,Enjoyed working with Customers and Co-workers. Downside to working here was the pressure of a Productivity Matrix used for evaluation on a monthly basis. This system was/is flawed but was still enforced even after management acknowledging those discrepancies. Attrition was high because of its use.
good,"Retail very busy store. Did a lot of product placement. Stocked shelves, process weekly truck for inventory."
good,Run if they call you. Do not accept any job offer. A raise is .50 a year.
good,"Walgreens in Hammond Indiana is a very busy store with many different customers. A typical day at work means having an average of 100 calls, accepting an typing about 200+ prescriptions daily, calling insurance companies and registering many new customers. On a regular basis patient files needed to be updated. Cash handling and register usage. Excellent customer service provided daily."
good,Lots of time away from family. Work a lot of weekends and holidays  and also include nights. Company going through many changes and many managers are having difficulty going to the motions of change.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens being a supervisor consists of opening and/or closing a store, receiving vendors, warehouse trucks, merchandising stock onto the floor, setting forth tasks to be completed daily by your employees as well as yourself, heavy customer service and cash handling. "
good,The days go by really fast.Learned how to work in a warehouse environment which was fun.Management is ok .Most coworkers are great and very helpful.The hardest part of the job is the fast pace . the best part of the job is pay and overtime.They worst is the H.R department very unorganized.Wouldn't work there ever again..
good,"Retail pharmacist in a chain pharmacy.  Did data entry, product review, counseling and inventory control."
good,"The workday is very stressful, but fast paced and mostly enjoyable."
good,A type day would begin with planning the goals for the day.  I would then analyze the previous days data and notes for completion. I would then assign the daily task and monitor employees for any corrective issues.
good,"Go to work, often short staffed. Leadership team (Management) is short tempered, lazy, inefficient. Heavy workload both on floor and register with minimal time to accomplish work, while being micro managed by Leadership ensuring not a pleasant moment passes without them stopping it. All this and a pay freeze as well."
good,A day at work consist of making sure my department is in good shape. Checking on all equipment. Once that is complete i work on the manager's store notes. I get along with all of my co-workers. Each of us communicate effectively. hardest part is that most of the stores' tasks are all put on one person.
good,"Walgreens is a nice atmosphere if you work with the right staff, if you work with the wrong staff, it is terrible. It's retail, so what else is there to say. Some customers are awesome, some are the exact opposite. The hours are completely crazy until you get a set schedule. But until that happens, it feels like you have no life. About the only way to get a set schedule is to be in school at the same time or have been with the company for over a decade, and maybe not even then. If you have the right managers you can move up in the company, but most of them will keep you in the same position until someone important leaves the company, and even then there is no telling that they won't hire an outsider for the position you have been working toward for years. Unless they are short they will keep you at 29hrs to avoid giving you benefits and making you a full time member of the staff. You won't get insurance until October, and they are very strict on overtime. Good luck getting into the Pharmacy to train. If you started as a floor person, that's most likely where you will stay."
good,"While I did make a lot of good friends and, learned some things here it was not a pleasurable place to work. As an asst. we were transferred around a lot. In my 4 yrs. with them I was transferred approximately 10-12 times. It is hard to get to know your customer base and employees when being transferred that much. It is also hard to sales trends an such."
good,"I've Worked for Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy for a total of 7 years. I've been there for many highs and many lows. Its been a great opportunity for me to grow & learn many things in my career, such customer service, management skills, insurance background, etc. But as a person who wants to grow, i feel the company is locked. The pay is not competitive & management could be improved. The company is great, with out a doubt however this department can be better, because like many other companies that are growing & improving with the time, Specialty has stood still. The environment is great, the people i work with are a somewhat tight unit, the programs are challenging, but its not a department for growth or pay."
good,My manager was nice although some employees were rude to customers.
good,Worked for a store manager who used racial slurs on a regular basis and was later terminated for it after I quit.
good,"customer service,I have a hard time lifting more that 20lbs"
good,"A new task everyday, a lot of customer service, a lot of stocking shelves and covering other shifts"
good,"At work i would help customers on the floor, stock items, pull inventory and pack out. I learned how to use the telxon and some other retail stuff.. The management some werent so bad but then there was those that would hold you back from a promotion or even respecting you. My co-workers were genereally hard workers but they knew how to get the job done. The job wasnt really that hard but customers can really get to you if you let them. The ability to know you did an honest work and are getting paid."
good,"I worked here for a year and learned all about retail. Some co-workers were fun and productive, while others would slack off. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The unreasonably rude customers are what made me dislike working in retail."
good,"I assist people with all sorts of needs and problems. Everything from returns to dealing with complaints about theft or mishandling of medicine by pharmacy staff. "
good,"I loved this company when I began working for them in 2011. At the end of 2012 they began to make drastic restructuring changes that included pay plan cuts. I lost $45k in annual income instantly. I had worked hard to rebuild a dead territory and had reached a significant level of compensation only to have it taken away and be told I was ""overpaid"" and I ""should see it as a big bonus"" that I made that much money. When I brought this up to upper management, I was basically targeted as being a ""rogue"" employee that wouldn't conform to the ways of the company. I left by choice, and WOULD NOT recommend this company to anyone in the medical sales field. "
good,"In the last three years or so, the company has really changed. There is little room for advancement since they took away the ""shift manager"" title, change it to ""shift lead,"" and cut pay by about $6 an hour in there area I live. There has been a lot of restructuring that is not beneficial to the employee. They would also not work with my school schedule."
good,things were not as they seemed with this position.  expectations were unreasonable
good,This was a nice place for my learning experience but management was not very reliable with decisions and trustworthiness
good,"A typical day consist of checking out customers, stocking merchandise and sometimes putting up sales tags. I learned how to be more patient with difficult customers. I got along really well with my managers and showed excellent teamwork with my co-workers"
good,"My manager is amazing and understanding, The pay could be better, and the company overall could care more about their employees. "
good,"Walgreen is a cookie cutter company times 8,000 stores.  If you step outside of the model you will be made out as an outcast because the company dictates everything from Deerfield, Ill. "
good,I worked in the pharmacy. You need to be licensed and certified. They do not appreciate their employees and they do not pay enough. 
good,"The people are fun but the pay is okay, could be better. The treatment towards new employees is different from the ones that have been there longer. They don't have the time to train new workers, plus the breaks are short and very hard to get one. "
good,"never enough help , too many call outs  so that leaves everyone else to do double duty  to get the work done !!  "
good,Fast paced work environment dealing with customers who are on the go.
good,Nothing special. Regular Customer Service job. Stay away from the high school atmosphere.
good,As a cashier they expect you to do all this as you ring up 60 customers per hour:
good,"I enjoyed being hands on in my own department. I was the Beauty Advisor so I enjoyed helping customers pick out beauty products that best suit them, such as, hair dye's, perfumes, colognes, creams for skin, make up color, etc. We were responsible for inventory and stocking shelves as well as multi tasking with our registers."
good,"as the years passed working for walgreens i saw the beginings of decline from the company. we saw the loss of our meager christmas bonuses to reduced hours, less coverage from benefits, poor corporate management. people were being promoted to store manager that had no business being a store manager. one of the major decisions that bothered me was selling beer and wine in new stores. i know many older stores that already had liqour remained, but to sell out for maybe some extra profits and not honor the fact that the walgreen family suffered from alcoholism and that was why newer stores did not sell liqour to me was a slap in the face. district management was in great decline as well, no real sense for the community or the customer base. like many companies the bottom line is what became more important, not the customer and especially not the employee. this review is based on workin in the southern california area, i had worked in Illinois for a few years and really none of these issues above were apparent."
good,It's a good company just not what I want to do with my life right now.
good,very busy to make the day go by fast
good,"The thing I liked the most about this position was that they payed for you to become a registered pharmacy tech, within 3 months of being hired. I didn't really care for the metrics. Monitoring calls, handle time, etc. Human resources let me go because I missed 4 days due to an auto accident which I had documentation for. That sucked, but opened up better opportunites for me."
good,Great supervisors and co-workers. Too bad the company drastically cut hours when its stock fell. Couldn't live off two days a week.
good,This place is a nice place to work and the pay and benefits are good but the office drama is too much to bear.
good,"All though my time was cut short with the company, I really enjoyed working there, I did a have a issue with the miscommunication between some of managers but it wasn't nothing that major. I learned how to process photos and fill prescriptions with the company. My co workers were like family to me, everyone worked as a team. The part I enjoyed the most was the interaction with the customers, I knew how to keep a smile on their faces just like they did for me."
good,"job is acceptable but will get old quick, working nights, weekends and holidays. Missing family functions and other such things like christmas etc is very frustrating."
good,Benefits have been cut
good,"A typical day at work includes the following: Arrive at the store, perform maitenance and open the photo lab, tend to customer service requests and assistance, ensure the shelves are stocked and stockroom is neat, and take in any deliveries that may occur. Most of the management are a very hard-working group, but one assistant manager is very lazy and has even said, ""I was promoted because of who I know."" I've learned that this sort of sentiment is detremental both to the company and the customers, as hard work and teamwork make for a better work environment. The hardest part of the job is helping more than two people at once and running the front end of the store by myself, but the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing peoples faces after they have been helped and are truly thankful for what we have done for them."
good,management was the problem not concern about other employees.
good,Advancement is based on relationships not quality. Lots of merchandising.
good,Walgreens is an experience in itself. you have the normal workflow of dealing with customers and patient's alongside the responsibility of maintaining order in a sometimes hostile enviroment. Our co-workers for the most part are pretty down to earth and are ready to assist when necessary. I learn throughout the vigors of an average day to not let it totally get to me and by focusing on the big picture making money i can perform each task fairly easy. The most enjoyable part of work is dealing with the public they give you a different experience with each person that comes through the door.
good,"This was a good experience as far as showing me that I had to get focused on my personal goals so that I can invest my time in something that would be more beneficial. It wasn't the work or the peoples personalities, but the fact that we were all on egg shells and had to operate out of elements, that make us unique."
good,"the most enjoyable aspect of this job is working with customers. This position requires working days, nights, weekends, and holidays. This position also requires unloading trucks, stocking shelves, operating a cash register, knowledge of pharmacy functions, knowledge of photo lab functions, handling large sums of money, and resolving customer complaints"
good,It was easy to work with the coworkers than management. I learned alot since i DIDN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT cosmetics.
good,"Walgreens was a great workplace, four years ago. I learn to utilize many task such as cashier, customer service, inventory, stock, ordering, shipment and make mylars. The most enjoyable part was working with great people. Management has gotten shorten with the budget cuts so there was no way to improved. The hardest part was being in cosmetic and learning all different types of make-up on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part I meant great people."
good,"The working environment and staff are friendly. I learn new techniques working in my department. Management is willing to work with scheduling and hours. My coworkers are like family, loving and caring. The hardest part of the job would be not being able to satisfy a unhappy customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is making people smile and feeling welcomed."
good,"You walk in and there's already so much to do, prescriptions to fill and enter into the walgreen's system. Sometimes there are patients waiting in line to be attended to. A lot of running around between the filling station, the out/in windows and trying to get little projects done. So far i've learned a lot about pharmaceuticals, and their uses. My co-workers are great and we get along great which is a big deal given the environment in which we work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unreasonable patients, you try to explain situations and processes to them, but they just don't want to hear it. For me the most enjoyable part of my job is the people i work with, my bosses and colleagues. Everyone gets along and has a great relationship with each other."
good, Responsible for developing photographs and creating any calendars/collages per customer’s specifications.
good,hours and pay not great. Good for a student because of flexible schedule. benefits are dwindling down.
good,"A typical day at work was checking out customers at the front, and talking to coworkers."
good,"Nice environment Clean, Precise"
good,"Walgreens Distribution center in Connecticut, is one of the most important warehouses of Walgreens, and they pay their employees very well, but the only problem is the management I can tell that they are the worst management I ever seen. For example: If school calls you and says that you have to come immediately because your kid got hurt, the management won't let you go, but if you do, you have to sign an attendance disciplinary form. and stuff like that."
good,"Every day was pretty repetitive. come into work, look at the what film needed to be developed, get to work. Not much room to multitask other than changing paper type."
good,"The environment is very stressful . No matter how hard you work, the outcome is always non appreciative. The staff is always rude and not co-operative. I did stayed for so long , because I thought some day it might change . The open door policy means openning troubles for yourself or loosing the job."
good,"A typical work day at Walgreens is busy, you are given some of the tools to learn different things, Management is management. Coworkers have their good and bad days. Hardest part about the job for me is feeling I could have done more. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others."
good,It was a good job for when your starting out. I was in the photo dept and it was a fast paste job. Always something to do. Management was ok there. The benefits were not good at all. It was hard to advance there also.
good,Work off a list the GM would write each day. My favorite part of the job was all the great people that worked there and the people that would come in to shop. The hardest part was getting everything done on the list and expected to do the side work.
good,"Typical day at work begins with moving right into the out window and drive through and taking in coming prescriptions. Filling the medications come a little later during the day. The one thing I learned is how to process insurance claims, brand and generic names, and good customer service skills. Management there is ok as well as co-workers"
good,"I have my own department and overstock bays that I am responsible for. I have learned that in order to have something that you really want, you have to work extra hard for it. The hardest part of my job is making sure there are no empty spots on any shelves, order all the inventory without having too much overstock. The most enjoyable part about my job is having my customers, the customers who come in and specifically ask for you. I love talking to them and helping them find the items they are looking for."
good,"It can be quit busy at times, so I have defitnaly learned how to work in a fast pace job. Overall management isnt bad, but sometimes they can be in thier own way. Co- workers are good thier, really uplifting. The hardest part of the job as well can be the fast pace at times, and the most enjoyable part is the customers."
good,"Employees were a joy to work with, but its a demanding job, that leave you with little time for family."
good,It was a fun place to work with even with all the messes you had to deal with. The only bad thing was the pay wasn't good at all I feel that we did too much work for little bit of pay we was getting.
good,"I had a fair experience, however I felt over worked and under valued for majority of my time with the company. At times I felt if I had an issue that needed addressing I would rather not address the issue because managers nor supervisors would value my concerns. The room for growth seemed to be politics based. Basically, an individuals growth was based on a who you know mentality instead of a what you know mentality!"
good,"All sorts of management duties.  Run the overall store operations, do ordering, scheduling and inventory control.  The hours are a it much, but that is the retail world that I am trying to move out of."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting customers and forming relationships with the regulars that come through. The hardest part of the job is likewise the public, as they can be extremely polarized--there are good customers, but also unpleasant customers. The management I worked for constantly saw turnover, but the majority of the people I worked for were enjoyable and easy to get along with as well as respect. I learned a lot about photography and processing, which I am not sure how that will help me in the future but it was an important skill to have nonetheless. A typical day at Walgreens consists of moving back and forth from one department to the other, especially with a short staff."
good,"While everyday can bring different challenges the fast paced work environment remains the same. You need skills of time management, customer care, attention to detail, computer skills, how to interact with patients and healthcare professionals, and efficiency."
good,"Company will pay for you to obtain pharmacy technician license. But, will work you constantly so no time to study/train. Pay not worth customer abuse."
good,"I loved my job and helping all my patients but when it comes down to it, I’m a mother and when I tried to talk to management about trying to help me out with maybe two days a week that I could be home to make for a better work/home life balance, and they weren’t willing to even try, I knew I had to find something else for my kids."
good,"The pay is good, but you'll work for it.  Understaffed and overworked.  Difficult, anymore, to get full time work, as the company is overstaffed.  They seem to prefer hiring new part time employees that they can avoid paying full time benefits to."
good,Communication across the board is horrible. Constant change in schedule with no sustainability or consistency. Even with giving your all just take with little to no appreciation.
good,"Title says it all. Lots of things are just ok. Lots of great people but tons of problems. The system needs alot of work, maybe then I'd rate it higher. Not the worst but certainly not the best."
good,This is a good start out job or after school special. Working in the pharmacy was great experience but the management went down hill when they fired the best store manager I have ever seen. The store has not been the same since he left. The only thing that keeps this place going is the pharmacist they hire.
good,"Employee shortage is huge.  Instead of being able to hire adequate staff,  the staff that is there is just piled higher and higher with more work.  Wasn't always like that -- if adequate staffing, it would be a good job again."
good,A Typical day at Walgreen is a none stop trying to help the customers. I wish they would care more for their crew than just let customers steal what they want.
good,"Overall, a nice retail environment. You have to be able to deal and work with all types of people. It also depends on the type of store manager you have. Some store managers can be unfair and display favoritism, while others are great! Takes time if you want to move up within the company and make a lot of money. A good amount kicks in once you're a store manager, but in my opinion, it is not worth the amount of stress and work it takes to get there. Being a shift lead was okay. I learned a lot but it became boring after about a year or so."
good,"A typical day varies on the moods of management."
good,Working for Walgreens was fairly enjoyable. I just do not feel like I can grow with the company any further. They are cutting hours company wide and it is putting extreme pressure on every store. They want us to work longer shifts for little to no extra compensation for it. I am ready for a new adventure and a new environment to grow into an even better technicain.
good,I used to enjoy being there but seem to only care about themselves. Don't care about your well-being. Management needs a little help with caring about their employees.
good,"There is so much to learn from assisting customers, memorizing products, learning photo department, and learning OSA in the stockroom and on the floor."
good,"I enjoyed my job greatly for the first 2 and a half years. But one bad manager turned the pharmacy into a hostile non-productive, back stabbing environment. After several reports were made nothing changed. The quality of the job really depends on who you work with."
good,The since of work/life balance is off. The company has become only about making money. They do not care about their employees and their families. Bonus have been cut for employees who are the face of the company but they still expect grade A service.
good,I am a Customer  Service Associate (cashier) . The co workers are nice but the management is very cold and seems very disinterested   in any communication  with the employees.  There seems to be a lack of organization among the management.  I gave my notice because my shift were only closing shifts.
good,"Although they paid decent, you ended up being a jack of all trades and not working specifically for what you were hired for. You worked every position from pharmacy, front end, janitor and beyond. Typically was the only worker besides the lead on front end and expected to put up freight, cashier, work photo counter and process orders, inventory, among other duties. If there were two on front end, one was expected to drop what you were doing and run to the pharmacy when they called for help. There was a lot of drama with most of it coming from the store manager (no longer there). It just wasn't an ideal place to work. Best part of the job was the wonderful customers I was able to interact with."
good,"got hired at 16 during high school, been there for about five years. a lot of opportunities but overtime it took away my daily life, took work home with me"
good,"Walgreen is a good starting area for Pharmacist technicians who want to learn about retail pharmacy. If you're just starting out your PHD for Pharmacy, definitely sign up with Walgreen to get the experience you need to graduate."
good,Depends on the store you work at. There’s a lot of mess going on and people talking behind each other’s back. Stay in your own lane and get what you came for..experience and money..then move on to better!
good,Great place to work! Development does not happen here. Management expects you to hit the ground running. Accountability starts and stop at Supervisor-level.
good,The people I worked with for five years become my family and my comfort. All the ladies at Walgreens are great. They were always the best part of the job and the “regulars” customers you formed relationships with.
good,"It turned out to be a low social mobility job. The cut out all the retirement benefits, capped salaries for long term employees. They run a bare minimal shifts with no extra coverage .Sometimes you are on an island all by yourself. Very stressful job."
good,"Walgreens is not a bad place to work at all. However, I do feel that some of us are underpaid, ESPECIALLY for doing other people's job. Some Shift leads should not be shift leads..."
good,"Not enough flexibility "
good,"Good job, the hours are inconsistent and it’s hard to get on as full time ... If you work part time you hardly get any work hours and you receive zero benefits !"
good,"My time at Walgreens has been a rough one, not gonna lie. People are unforgiving and some of the companies policies are ridiculous. I was sick for 2 weeks and was shunned. All the people I thought were my friend I suddenly learned were waiting to turn on me. Just keep your friends close."
good,"New management came in , just stopped utilizing some per Diem nurses ( not because they weren’t needed as staffing still required their use and others were hired) did not fire them or let them go just wouldn’t give them any assignments but did not give any feed back or rationale of why stopped using and even went as far as banning them from the property stating they could do required education. When corporate contacted for feedback they gave no information on how the employee could improve or if there was even anything the employee needed to emotive. ( employee always score very high on evaluations at any place of employment. Very unsettling and unjust place to work. Office people daily cuss and scream at each other very non professional in the office. from their own home."
good,"Nobody is ever on your side from corporate and your manager puts the stress on you when they’re mad. Budgets keep getting cut every year and store managers don’t even get bonuses anymore. The pay is pretty low for everything they put you through if you’re apart of the management team. Walgreens is cheap and only cares about their pharmacies. Not to mention, they expect you to clean up after everyone’s mess even if it means working overtime. you like a dog if you’re the assistant manager and expect you to clean up  They couldn’t care less about front store workers."
good,the jobs stressful and the company doesn’t pay enough for the amount of work you have to do. there’s no security.  if you decide to work there good luck and make sure you ID everyone. i liked my managers and my co workers.
good,"The position it's self wasn't hard, nor the problem. The biggest problem is way to many store ""managers"" don't actually even manage. They show up less than any other shift (30 hours) and leave the store 100% up to the shift leads. Then get mad if anything effects their day i.e. a customer fell and the store manger was upset we had to call an ambulance. I worked with multiple and most where basically 'office' mangers or like one that took an hour long lunch break daily then sat there watching videos on snap chat the rest the day (corp wouldn't do a thing about). The fact that they are allowed to even review employees on performance is a joke. How can you say whether someone is good at their job if your never there to see it. The company says work life balance but its never applied to the actual store. The corporate office needs to be checking on these ""store managers"" as very few are even worth the salary they are paid."
good,"Having started at one location and transferring to another was bad enough. If I could've kept the same store manager, I'd have LOVED it. During employment at my last store, my time and efforts were wasted."
good,"Most immediate supervisors are good to work with, but many people are title-responsive. Meaning, if you need something done, but your title is not high enough, it takes additional follow up to get the request done. Upper management made the decision a few years back to cut as much cost as possible with minimal benefit. This means there are constant 're-organizations"" that lead to layoffs or job changes without your approval. If find your perfect job, that can change in a moments notice one whether you are employed or doing something different from what you were hired for. Not because you did anything wrong, but because upper management deemed it this way. "
good,But then again a lot of companies are the same. They ask a lot from employees and the pay is very low compared to other companies. Very hard to get good employees to stay and work for you.
good,This job has thought me a lot and I will take everything I learned from this job and put it towards my future jobs and opportunities that lies ahead for me
good,"I would go back , but for higher pay. Not sure why they kept the pay raise so low when they make more then enough to pay there employees. Hopefully they can bring up that pay for the employees."
good,"Not enough staff, always a lot of orders waiting  to be pulled/filled no matter what shift you worked. Pharmacists were a great help along with the store manager and staff."
good,"At my location, it was usually a slow pace environment in the front end and more fast paced in the pharmacy.  Overall, it is a pretty easy and laidback job. My manager was willing to work with my schedule but the job is very repetitive."
good,Walgreens is a great company. Have a engagement culture and flexibility for spend time with friends and family. You can do a career in Walgreens if you want.
good,The co workers were excellent. They treat you like family. Management and leadership however were the total opposite and that made the job hard to work.
good,"I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable saying too much about the company. It's public knowledge we are closing stores, getting budget cuts, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to run a store like that."
good,It is a part-time job for me.  It truly has been a family this last year. It seems like the ship is gonna sink.  Some days we have lots of help some days we have barley any help.
good,"Company has steadily cut budgets every year. So that includes benefits bonuses etc. Company talks about ""leading the industry"" but when it comes to employees being ""competitive"" is ok.  Motto every year seems to be do more with less."
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work at first. Your hours are cut regularly so be prepared to work at other stores. The management does their best, but the environment is stressful. A lot of homeless people come in and the cops are called a lot."
good,Throughout my time with Walgreens I was able to cross train in each department to gain knowledge to better serve the company as well as our customers. Sadly the Company lost my respect due to lack of upper management engagement. Upper management began to slowly forget the rule of Lead by Example.
good,Highly political culture - you need be a high performer to do well here.  There was no bonus this year and likely not next year - yet executives are still compensated.
good,"I would have loved to stay at Walgreens, but the hours conflicted with school, and management wasn't enthusiastic about having to change from Full Time to Part Time and changing my schedule."
good,The company just went through a major downsizing. Expect disgruntled employees and even more overworked leadership. The pay will not be what you are worth and the hours will be terrible. I have been with the company over 10 years and I am leaving as soon as I find a better place.
good,"If you're going into higher management than at the store level this company may be a good fit. My experience all stems from store level interactions in all the departments. "
good,Stay away if you can there supervisions is terrible DC manager doesn’t care for anyone but himself there not a forward looking company they are reactive company never proactive
good,they put you through a class to obtain your pharmacy license for free and once you complete the class/training they will pay for your test the 1st time. if you fail you have to pay for the retake(s) but they will reimburse you
good,Manager was great and flexible with hours and help you out when you need help with life and work and very quiet store nothing major happened in the store
good,"The Benefits Are Nice & The Employee Discount Helps A Lot But The Management Is Very Um, Iffy I Should Say.. There’s Always A New Store Manager So It’s Hard To Maintain Structure & Morale. The Scheduling Isn’t Very Good Either."
good,while working for Walgreens I was an overnight shift lead eventually. This was after I had been there for years asking for it and watching them hire and have me train inexperienced individuals for the position while I was only a cashier. Then when I was finally promoted there was a switch in head store manager that the new one had it out for all overnight and caused such anxiety. Since I have heard they have gotten an new manager.
good,"The staff were usually kind to one another, however the workload was difficult to maintain. Management often wanted large tasks done by a team of only three people. Good for a first time job, but not long term."
good,"managers talk bad about employees , and make bad remarks about customers it could be a good place to work if the  leadership team was on the same page and worked together  to get stuff done"
good,"likes"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was that when customers get what they desire or need , the smile and thank you is what makes the job more enjoyable"
good,"In the beginning of this job I adored it, loved the managers, customers weren't bad, and work environment was positive and fun. After working there for 2 years I called it quits because the store manager never did her job, always left problems to the night shift, and every concern and problem was met with an 'I don't know' or 'just leave it, let someone else figure it out'"
good,With budget hours being cut and restructuring to add Rite Aid people the compnay is going downhill. Store managers aren't held accountable for bad behavior and the wrong kind of people are getting high level positions. CEO doesn't care about anything but money.
good,Walgreens started off good until the company made a lot of changes with management making it more stressful on all employees including management. They did include benefits and retirement which was good.
good,I like working there and all the people there are easy to work with and have a great attitude towards each other is a safe place and I think other would enjoy it
good,Got to understand more basic customer service skills and cashier experience. The training was modest but most things you learn on the job while working in any department.
good,A lot of insubordination and a lot of managers who did not even care. Most just sat at their desks texting all day. It's literally the smaller version of walmart!
good,Participated in a paid internship in college.  Received same starting pay after graduation (not a good sign).  No work-life balance.  Forced to do at least 4 overtime hours per week.  Pay was mediocre at best.  Sell you on a fast track to your own store but most EXAs and ASMs work nearly a decade and still no luck.
good,"Hours will be cut with the same amount of work expected. Health insurance is worthless, you get better insurance from other, non-health-related companies, which is sad. Your managers and team can be great, but when the company works against itself things fall apart."
good,"Over worked and under paid. Little to no input in the day to day operation.  Open all year long, including major holidays such as Christmas and Thanksgiving."
good,Action plans are put in motion but are not followed through.  Employees don't have a problem doing the work it;s the time that's needed to complete the work.  The benefits have changed.
good,The whole time I worked at Walgreens we had to work 12 hours daily even though I was only a part time worker . I don’t think it is fair for someone who is part time to have to work the hours that they don’t need to be work and after that o got fired because I didn’t want to work the long hours .
good,"Just like any other retail experience. Customer care, heavy priority, along with 15 other tasks and protocols and things you have to push. Typical Corporation. Confusing policies and miscommunication with new managers that are out sourced and returning."
good,"When I started at Walgreens, I loved it. But I was promoted about a year into it and from there it all went downhill. Constant corporate budget cuts which causes us to fire employees that allowed us to function. They don’t care about their employees anymore, they just care about corporate pay raises."
good,"Don't pay enough, but the job itself is easy.  Management needs to be more involved in cross training all associates and not letting people do just one thing."
good,"The Walgreens had less than agreeable staff, which made work days dreaded and drag on. Unless you have plans to work with pharmaceuticals, which they have a program that provides you with schooling, there is not a lot that this location has to offer.  It is an easy location to be hired, and a decent first job for high school students."
good,"Find fulfillment in the change and help you are giving to the customers. You won't find it elsewhere."
good,"A good place to start as a first job. Management was a nightmare. Unable to communicate clear or respectfully between coworkers. Management could have been better, giving employees hard time when needed to be out of work for a reasonable matter."
good,"Whalgreens, while in the beginning a great place to work has now gone the way of other corporate owned pharmacies and are now putting metrics ahead of the employees. Cutting hours while increasing the workload in an already stressful area as the Pharmacy is only going to hurt patient outcomes in the end."
good,"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, home care aide is among the top 10 occupations with the largest job growth."
good,"I worked with 2 different stores and they were very different atmospheres. I was only a part time employee and did not receive benefits but knew of the little to no benefits given to full time employees. Little room to move u in the company except for the rare opening at another store. I had an overall good experience working here, yet there are definitely cons with working here."
good,This company can be great but also can have the bad times. I think they could have better management ones that actually care about their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers and making them feel welcomed into the store.
good,It's a busy place to work. It can be a fun environment and you meet new people and learn while working. They offer training for the PTCB exam. Hours ok.
good,They offer good pay and benefits but that's how they get you to stay. Its hard finding the same pay elsewhere without going to factory work. It also has a poor work life/home life balance and they're terrible at allowing open scheduling for parents.
good,"I had no problems with the work load provided for us, though each manager we've had made the work experience horrible. The moment you were to do something that they didn't like too well, they were sure to make your working experience uncomfortable until you decide to quit."
good,"Interesting place to work.. Working in retail gives you an opportunity to decide what you do not want to do with the rest of your life. Most customers are self absorbed and treat you like you are next to nothing. Every once in a while, you will meet customers who are polite, considerate and a pleasure to see. "
good,"Really flexible scheduling for students with about average pay for the job. As a company they could definitely afford to invest more in their employees growth, promote internal promotions versus bringing in people from outside which happens frequently, and overall a great college job (not good for retirement because there is a lot of age and health related discrimination that happens). Overall it's not bad for a short-term gig or to at least get your Pharmacy Technician Certification for free then go ahead and take that certification to a hospital or somewhere where they will compensate you with better money and way better benefits. Do not recommend as a long-term career."
good,"a typical day of work is checking how much medication in stock we have and counting/ inputting into the system. I learned a lot about pharmacy, what medications work for what, what to do with the medication or if it needs to be taken with food, or effects that it does to the body. My pharmacy manager was incredible, patient, and has taught me everything I know today. Hardest part of the job is not taking into account what the customers say. Enjoyable part of the job was learning background knowledge of medications, and working with my manager."
good,The company itself has gone downhill since 2010 with the new CEO. The pay is competitive but the work environment is not provided with sufficient staff to get the job done correctly or in a timely manner.
good,"Customer Service, Photo Lab, Clerk, Cash Handling, Stocking and replenishments, producing photo prints for customer orders while also assisting customers both at the photo lab as well as at the front and throughout the store.  Cash handling, pricing, helping people find products."
good,Great opportunity to meet customers from all walks of life.  Wonderful discounts for employee's on discontinued items.  Opportunity to grow within the company.
good,"Worked in the busiest store in the upper midwest and all corporate did was constantly cut hours and staff coverage. Which made for a very stressful workplace, not even worth the pay if it effects your health."
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for "
good,"After working for Walgreens for 19 years, I am ready for a change. They have treated me well historically, however recently with so many changes, I am unsure if this is the retailer for me anymore."
good,"dealing with sick patients is something expected but I had way too Buch confidence In my immune system and how they'd be moving me to higher positions. They make empty promises and everything is gross and probably not up to health codes. Safety hazards are haphazardly ignored in order to achieve daily goals. However, the people I worked with were cool and made it tolerable."
good,Greensburg is a well run store and very clean. The management knows what needs done and gets it done. Staff is friendly and caring. I was just recently relocated to a new store because they rotate the mgmt staff every 6-18 months which is absurd and messes with the routines of the stores. I am now at different location which is dirty and staff is not the friendliest.
good,"Paid a poor wage. Store had multiple managers.  We all got along pretty well. Overall, I hated my job. It was a good college job though. I did make decent money in c olletg.,e"
good,Walgreens has removed many benefits from its employees.  It used to pay nice bonuses to the managers and they keep taking more and more of it away.  This last year they wanted to stay in an elite stock group (keep a title) so they cut managers salary over 50%.  They keep taking away budget hours so we have fewer people on the floor working and yet they wonder why our customer service scores go down.
good,the is no steady shift hours. you could be scheduled to work that night and turn around have to work in the morning. the job is high pace and at time stressful
good,"The company is OK overall , And is definitely for someone who wants to pick up a job or find some career advancement and either retail or pharmacy area"
good,"I think the experience at Walgreens is location-specific. It's an ages old company so there is some security in that bit as far as profits go, though they are very successful little of that is returned to its employees or any meaningful improvements as far as I saw. There is medical insurance, at least."
good,"Some days were fast paced others were very slow."
good,"Be Prepared for a low salary and glued to your chair."
good,"I enjoyed the work and customers at the store.  Our store manager and assistant manager were awful.  They bullied and harassed store leadership and employees.  District managers were made aware and did not do much, even though 7 employees left in one month AND they were aware that the behavior was inappropriate."
good,"Lots of turnover. (Went through 3 Store Managers and a few Pharmacy Managers in about 2 years. Not to mention the regular employee turnover.) "
good,I learned how to deal with different type of people. It was very stressful because of the location and the management really looked down on the coworkers unless you were best friends with them.
good,"Working in a store for the first time was a big change from an office job, was great to be familiar with the local customers. The hours were just not working especially being required to work on the busiest days and holidays in the liquor department became overwhelming."
good,"Walgreens doesnt let the pharmacy do its job....pharmacy should be concerned with patient care and pharmacy. Instead, we have to upsell candy and give people walgreen cards....if it is beneficial to a patient I have no problem. BUT I  do have a problem having to sit on a conference call beacuse we didn't meet a quota to upsell while we have 45 prescriptions sitting in the queue and 10 sick patients waiting on medication.....what is more important."
good,Management was not the easiest to go to with issues. Each manager went about things differently. I was scheduled mostly nights and weekends. But was not told this would be my sechdule upon hiring.
good,"I have been discriminated against twice in just 2018. I have an attorney now. If you work here, watch out for your pharm manager. Many are corrupt. If you’re a tech that knows what you’re doing you will be overworked and exhausted. Especially during flu season."
good,"The expectations are through the roof at Walgreens and although have been paid well in the past, pay for performance and hard to attain targets make it a dead end career anymore. If you are one of the favorites of upper management then you are okay, everyone else is struggling to""meet expectations"" to get raises and or bonuses anymore. Once was a great company with great culture but now driven by shareholder expectations and not by leadership of people"
good,"It was a huge learning experience, the company showed me many of the tools I now plan to use on my other jobs, from problem solving to having the initiative to do more today then yesterday, customer satisfaction always being the top priority my company overall experience was very good."
good,The company in my opinion is falling down. They used to be family owned and more friendly to there employees but now your just a number. And they don’t care how you feel at your job because they’ll just replace you with another number
good,"Working at Walgreens was like trying to keep a skining boat afloat. Longs hours, low staff, too much merchandise. Coworkers were nice but undertrained."
good,I enjoyed the company and what it stands for. Always have some form of charity going on or some form of donations in every quarter of the year. The hiring process as well as the wages may need some work. I was a cross trained cashier doing more than Shift leads with little to no recognition. Also their 'open door policy' is b.s.
good,"Walgreens is a productive place to work, but the store I worked in was very slow and very few employees were hired. If you are the cashier in your shift, you wouldn't see other employees talking to you. Being the cashier is enjoyable and stocking items in shelves was not hard but took long if you'd be alone."
good,"A typical day involves you taking care of customers, stocking merchandise, and checking inventory. "
good,its all about who are your co workers but very completive and lack of learning more. which I mean they don't teach more around the system they just keep you steady at one position
good,"Its a nice place to work as a start up job, while going to school. Flexible hours, good benefits, friendly faces. I started out as cashier then photo tech, and some pharmacy work."
good,Buena empleada me ubiese gustado que me ubiesen dado mas oportunidades para hacer mas cosas y crecer en la empresa
good,Working with public was good. Most of the crew we’re nice and supportive. Some managers were great. I’d recommend for college students or moms when their children go to school.
good,Very unorganized. No training structure. Very nice and casual work environment. Lots of employee perks when they actually hire you on. Working as a contractor for them really sucks.
good,"The time I was working there, I gain a lot of experience in customer service. It helped me to resolve any issues customers brought to the store, and there was no drama at work. Everyone focuses on their role and communication was key. The job was not as stressful as my previous job, therefore I felt the time I was at Walgreens was great."
good,"Easy job as a cashier, as you progress, naturally, the job gets harder. Any and all training is provided. Very friendly and understanding workplace with lots to do at all times. Very busy environment, you have to learn quick."
good,"This company isn't the worst out there but they definitely do not care about their employees. It is a high stress, low reward environment with limited job growth potential."
good,"The pay was decent , it was not a very organized company regarding management with shifts and making sure they kept up with pay. I never had a pay increase in the 2 years with them and hours were very scattered, some weeks I would have 50+ hours and others I'd have 5 and need to find work at other locations."
good,"If the store manager of whatever Walgreens ur applying to likes you, you'll go far, if not forget about it. Managers don't treat you fair, and can hardly move up without knowing someone or getting really good numbers on ur review."
good,I am the customer service ambassador I pride myself on providing great service to everyone whom walks in the door. I have created a family friendly environment that clients and customers have trusted me to come back to me over the years for whatever they need.
good,"I was over worked & treated unfairly. The management at the store I was located needs more training! At that store, you treated as children & not adults! The management's ""Open door"" policy was literally open door. Many good people on management was either forced to leave the store or quit the job all together after years because they couldn't continue being underappreciated. If management don't like you, they'll lie & pick on you."
good,The company was a great company to work for when I first started but when new management came all the little benefits that gave the employees a break for low pay was cut. The store manager at the time was out of touch with people everyday struggle to survive on the low wage.
good,"La empresa sostiene una cultura de compromiso con los clientes/pacientes."
good,"Even though I have a love of service as a Clinical Pharmacist and Pharmacy Manager, Walgreens does a poor job in grooming employees for growth. Being a retail pharmacist for this company does not provide a healthy work life balance."
good,Great starter up job . Best for kids that are in high school and need some extra cash . Walgreens never close on holiday . They have a black out . Where u can call out starting November until January. Nps is every important so is OSA
good,"If my managers were not such horrible people, this job would have been a blast. The GM was great though. Must work weekends and sale products but don't expect commission for that. You either open or close."
good,"Over my 3 1/2 years with the company, I went through the whole gamut of quality of work."
good,Walgreens is either fast paced environment. Everyone tries to be team players and help eachother out. The holidays get hectic and sometimes the empyloees don't get thanked enough by upper management for their hard work.
good,Location matters when determining the overall quality of life with this job. Each store manager and their assistant all have their ways of managing the store.
good,"Walgreens expects a lot from its employees, does not compensate"
good,Walgreens is turning into a snowflake company where the rude and nasty people come to take advantage of the employees will the comoany sits back and allows it to happen
good,Good place to start out. Opportunities to move up but you have to put up with and learn to deal with a lot at one time. Overall good place to work for  short period of time.
good,Although based on 44 hr. work week I was told by Manager that if it took 70+ hours per week on average than that is what must be done to advance.  The work load with the resources that were made available was unrealistic.
good,"Poor managerial skills,  make promises they don't keep, if someone they know or has a relative there you are treated differently you may even loose your position to make room for them.  Pay scale depends on who you know not what you know!!!"
good,"Provided numerous benefits and perks for employees. Flexible schedule. Good Opportunity for Advancement, if you want to move through the ranks of a retail pharmacy drug chain."
good,Stressful work environment with unrealistic expectations. Store Mangers expected to put in extra time with no overtime. Not a lot of positive recognition. Weekends and Holidays off.
good,"The overall budgeting at Walgreens is higher than at other high volume retail chains which increases the opportunity to provide more adequate patient care. Although, it is alarming at the number of board member that are not in the profession of pharmacy and policies that could be potentially dangerous to patients continue to be made because of the lack of insight into the real dangers in a pharmacy dept"
good,"I worked the night shift in a 24 hour Pharmacy on a rotating shift,lots of turn over in the cashier position . Good team work but wage cuts and staffing cuts made it tough to continue level of service"
good,This use to be a fun place to work. But with the continuous changes that have taken place I feel the company has loss touch with their employees. I believe they can make it better if they strive to. They are losing a lot of quality employees by not viewing what actually takes place in the stores and pharmacy versus just wanting to cut costs.
good,After I transferred my experience was completely changed. My manager was kind but when things didnt go her way she made it hard to work. The people i work with seem to not care about most of the tasks we have to do from day to day.
good,"No review please, Not recommend working, To much partiality.with out any reasons keep giving final right up warning.Always working in tension.do not like to work."
good,The management seemed very uptight and didn't allow you to take your time on projects. Everything was rushed including stocking and helping customers. Not alot of help when busy
good,I almost always had to do everything and I tried my best but I haven't been working there long enough to feel that type of pressure. I learned to keep it professional amongst colleagues as well as customers. A smile goes a long way.
good,"If you like to take on challenges, this is the right place. There is a lot that can be learned. Team work here does not fully exist. Management hardly ever gets involved in helping. Patients can be really difficult to help."
good,Personally I wasn’t looking for a serious job at the time being that I was still in high school. Hours were a little harsh and management would constantly forget I was still attending school which became stressful for me.
good,"The employees were helpful, but sometimes the lines are so long and there is only one employee at the registers during the day. Where are the other employees? That is my only concern."
good,"Working with customers in a local corner-store environment isn't easy, but the challenge of meeting wildly different needs every time a new customer walks up to the counter is exciting. Due to the late hours and demographics of customers, dealing with unhappy, grumpy, or just flat out mad customers is a major part of the job, and being able to de-escalate situations as well as work together with customers is a necessity. While Walgreens gives a friendly, local, drugstore feel, it's very similar to most other retail stores. 6-8 hour shifts, with a 30-minute lunch and 1-2 15 minute paid breaks. Overall, a good company, but difficult to make a career with."
good,Management itself fluctuates but my overall experience is ok.  I prefer to find a position with weekends off so that I can maintain a social life. If you need a job and don't care about the inconsistency-it is a great place
good,Working as a pharmacy technician at Walgreens is a stressful environment and the budget cuts are killing the company. We simply cannot work with such short staff.
good,Must be able to multi-task. Give direction to team members. Assist customers most important. Assist in the pharmacy when needed.
good,"Company just keeps cutting employee hours and the customers and employees are suffering because of it. Pay is not comparable, and hours are crazy.. One day you close and then next morning you open."
good,"Walgreens is a wonderful company to work for. The people inside the company are kind and offer support. However, over the last year or two corporate walgreens has taken over how it is run, and it makes it harder to enjoy work."
good,"-fast-paced job always going to be tired"
good,"pretty standard, nothing bad, just the same old problems. Lack of benefits, low wages, high stress, understaffed, overworked. Get to deal with lying addicts, angry drug dealers, conceited pharmacists, ignorant patients, angry doctors secretaries, and apathetic doctors."
good,"So, granted if you have no other options and are desperate, take the job...because it's a job. It was mostly laid back and simple. You just sit in a chair all day. But always look for something better. Not only is the pay terrible for Walgreens to be such a large company ($10) but the turnover rate is just as bad. Mainly because they give you snacks instead of raises like we're children. Money talks. For students, they're so cheap that they do not reimburse you like any other major corporation would. They will only if you are seeking a degree in pharmacy. Not nursing (like I was) or technical. It's ridiculous that a healthcare business would not invest in its employees seeking a health science degree. I worked w/ women who have been there for years and still only made 12-14 hourly. Definitely underpaid. I couldn't afford to invest in a 401k. $800 every two weeks, no overtime for my dept. Some depts have mandatory overtime though. Do not get comfortable. Just use this job as a stepping stone until you either graduate or find a better one. Goodness knows they're using you."
good,"Since it has changed hands numerous times, it has been hard to get back to the day the Walgreens family owned the company and cared for its employees."
good,"My review is mostly based upon being in a particular department - Ecomm Exceptions Handler. The workload is a lot and you're constantly behind and the overtime is basically never ending. The customers are demanding and there's not exactly great boundaries to protect from verbal and written abuse from customers. "
good,I was a cashier and it was my first job. I hated the feeling of having to stand in one spot all the time so it wasn't for me. I moved to photo 6 months in. Walgreen's overall is best as a first job only or as a decent part-time job for anyone who doesn't mind retail.
good,A typical day at Walgreens is working with customers and filling shelves with product.  I think there could be some changes done with in the Walgreens company.  I do think they need more leadership and more sharing of what is going on in the company.
good,"walgreens is a fast paced warehouse, the temperature in the warehouse is constant and relaxing, management however makes it a not so pleasant place to work as most of them have a lack of knowledge of there own department and basically plugs numbers into the computer and whatever the computer says they do instead of going off what they may know"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is to interact with patients and customers.  We are in an area with baby boomers and they are the nicest customers to deal with.  We have repeat customers who are like family.
good,Walgreens likes to cut hours from the budget on a regular basis So 40 hours a week is not promised. And in 2 years of working there I got a 19¢ raise.
good,Good job just needs better management and training because the managers doesnt care about the job and poor training the trainers aee good but also kinda new to the job themselves
good,Corporate culture is not good. Extreme cuts in labor hours. Added programs with no additional hours to complete. The ultimate focus is on the Pharmacy.
good,Initially I was very proud and happy to work under my original managers. After my managers promotion to other stores; it had a 180 turn around. But I learned to develop a new inventory method and skills while my time there.
good,"ales associates at Walgreens assist customers in a variety of departments, including photo development, grocery, pharmacy, and health and beauty sections. Walgreens customer service associates may also operate cash registers, stock shelves, and perform cleaning duties while at work."
good,"Walgreen's is a good place to work.  However; the amount of pay does not compensate for the demands from the manager/company."
good,It was a decent place to work but personal life got in the way for me and I could not get my hours changed for many months I'm sure not for lack of trying but was too inflexible for me
good,Overall a decent company to work for but in the last couple of years it has gone in a much more corporate feel versus hometown feel. Cutting hours and not always the best management can definitely make a long day longer.
good,"After I finished my training, I was given the night shift that ended at 12:30am. As a short young woman growing up in Brooklyn, this was a safety issue. I learned how to juggle multiple tasks at once, and I liked the people I worked with. I enjoyed engaging with the customers, but did not like that my shifts were constantly so late. A typical day looks like coming in during the early evening hours, and getting to work on changing the prices and rearranging the merchandise to their proper places. Occasionally I would be called to open my register because the main registers were flooded with waiting customers. This pattern would continue after lunch until closing time. Final cleanup would happen shortly after the last customers left, which gave us at the most, 20 minutes to reface the store, sweep the store, vacuum the carpets, empty the registers, count the money, AND clock out to be outside the store by 12:30 sharp."
good,Work hard.....work include maintenace....must be able to handle working with the public......sometimes your days are great and other time not so great......
good,"The team I work with is why I come to work everyday.  There are good days and bad days, and the team members are always there to back you up.  High volume, small budgets, trying to keep good customer service."
good,"The hours were the worst part, and some times management can be hard to work with, because it is a big corporation. having a work life balance can kind of be hard sometimes with this job."
good,Work with great people and great customers. Local Mangers are friendly and nice but upper management has little care about the hourly works and cuts hours on stories.
good,Management only cares about themselves. The scheduling is awful. The ASM only wants to make sure she can be off anytime she wants. They don't rotate shifts or hours. Some people have a lot heavier workload then others in the same role. Training is a joke.
good,Company with strong feelings about “equality and improvement to all” leaves a lot to be desired. Focuses heavily on customer care and does this well but employees are overworked with horrible sparatic schedules making the overall atmosphere of the job seem fake.
good,"the positions at walgreens are slowly dwindling due to large scale hour and budget cuts. this means that if you are not doing EXACTLY what they want you to be doing then you are gone. Management is also inconsistent as I had a horrible manager at my store but while I was working at other stores, the managers were awesome. Positioning can be stressful mainly due to the already stated hour cuts. This leads to only one or two people out on the floor at a time. I have gone weeks of having to run the photo department, help with checkout when the front register was busy, and stock nearly half the store on the same day. Ridiculous."
good,"This was a great first job for me, but walking away from it, I see that it was an unhealthy environment. Eight hour shifts felt like 12 hours because time just inched by. As someone who had to work the front, there was no time to breathe. Note, though, I consider myself to be more of a creative person than a practical person, so I am just doomed to be bored with stagnant jobs. Managers constantly piled up work for me, expecting it to get done even though as a cashier here, you are NOT allowed to leave the front. So, it was very challenging to to be productive."
good,"I have worked there for about a year and a half now and would say that it is an ok first job, but if you are able to get a career job soon I would. Insurance is great if you can afford it and work the hours. The manager I worked under doesn't really seem to care for her employees though. Neither does the benefits center or HR department."
good,Was treated unfairly. Employee demands were not met by a certain shift leader. Not everyone took their job seriously and that certainly affected the work environment as a whole.
good,Each store is different and each manager runs things differently. Pay does not match the amount of work given out. There is opportunity for growth but politics do play a big role in that.
good,"The job was very simple at first, until they started hiring new people and start to put more and more ‘management’ work on you and you aren’t getting paid for it."
good,"Walgreen's is a well-known cooperation, except for the head management at our local store rather has a lack of communication skills. Instead of trying to work with said employees as far as give and take, it was either their way or no further room for adjustments."
good,"40+ hours of work to do but only part-time hours to get it done. Always left work daily feeling drained, affected home life. Walgreens has become a healthcare company that cares more about money than people. Management must work 40+ hours weekly to make up for a few part-time employees as their staff. This way Walgreens does not have to pay overtime to salaried employees and provide benefits to part-timers if they qualify, but do not because the staff budget set by corporate will not allow it."
good,The company is successful about customer care. The overall benefits are very unsuccessful especially for hard working employees who have been there a while.
good,If you are someone who likes to keep busy throughout the work day then this is the place. You can always find something to keep you occupied. The customers were great and the work was not difficult to preform.
good,"A typical day at work was, helping out customers with customer service & selling beauty products daily.I've learned to become more of an independent sales person & it helped me with my social and customer service.The work place was a semi-friendly environment, not very pleasant.The hardest part of my job was dealing with managers & employees.The most enjoyable part of my job has been helping customers with their needs and making connections daily."
good,Ok place to work fast paced close corners with co workers retail only not much advance in job placement not much open door policy not always able to get a raise
good,"I worked part-time at Walgreens for a few years. I enjoyed working there for over a year, really liking my co-workers and enjoying the various things I got to do instead of just one thing all the time. That changed when management changed. I still had my friends and duties, but instead of enjoying my job, I ended up with stress and anxiety due to having an ASM that couldn't respect their employees and fellow managers at any store. I really like Walgreens in general and met some great people working there, but based on how they handle managers with an inability to show respect to others, there needs to be some serious changes."
good,"A typical work day is opening the store."
good,Insane pressure to preform. No work-life balance. Very inconsistent scheduling and mandatory holidays. Very difficult to maintain a good home life between work stress and extreme / inconsistent scheduling demands.
good,"Very stressful, not a good place for advancement, and the company does not care for their employees. I would not recommend working for this company at all."
good,I had the opportunity to work with some great co-workers. I also had the chance to obtain and perfect my customer service skills. I also had the chance to meet a lot of interesting people of all backgrounds and walks of life. I just wish the manager I started with could have stayed on he was professional and still empathetic to his employees.
good,I still love this company and think that it had it's opportunity for young Pharmacist. I hope that many people can work for the company and advance with them.
good,"My manager was amazing. She understood the struggles of the position because she had done the job. The work load was too high and they were not hiring any more techs, so the overtime was mandatory and crazy"
good,"Walgreens has a very diverse group of customers.  Able to meet new people every day.  Store open twenty four hours, never closed.  Open on all holidays"
good,They go by the fiscal year for raises. Meaning you wait all year to get a raise and then you get to keep it for about 2 months before minimum wage goes up. Also the biggest raise you can ever get is 25 cents. The management is pretty terrible and everyone is burnt out by their second year. Its best not to talk to anyone and barely do your job as long as possible. Once you make the mistake to work hard or talk to people you better watch your buttocks! They also pretend to have some sort of conservative christian values. Which is a bunch of bs. They do not take care of their employees! And will expect you to do questionable tag scams. Its on sale for 10 cents more today! Yippee. For learning customer service skills it is good. But once you realize how the place is run its hard on your morality and human integrity. They want robots not critical thinkers or hard workers. Ask anyone who works there how they feel; especially around the holidays. Super
good,Benefits are not great and assistant manager and store manager act like they are well above the Shift Leads. On the plus side the work is simple and customers are friendly. The other coworkers are wonderful.
good,It isn't a bad job at all but it's only meant for students looking for some income on the side or someone who just wants a little bit of extra money on the side.
good,"My role as a Beauty consultant was to maximize sales and create brand awareness no matter the budget. Honestly I felt this position had nothing to do with beauty artistry or anything and a lot of girls go into this job thinking so... it’s actually ONLY customer service. No tasking. Another thing is not a lot of ppl think “oh I’m gonna go get a makeover at Walgreens!” so don’t expect too much. This position is strictly to provide customers 100% your services even though the description says makeovers and all. Most of the time it’s super slow and most managers will have you do task anyway, but it’s not your job description."
good,"Great place to work, depending on the store. Sometimes you're needed in 3 places at once and there is only one of you. Granted that comes with retail, but consistently not having enough management on hand becomes extremely stressful. I did love the people I worked with, the pay was nice, and benefits were nice as well."
good,"I was hired as a pharmacy technician but had to start as a cashier for the store so I can learn the register system which I was okay with and understood. After 2 months they moved me to the pharmacy since one of the other techs went out on maternity leave earlier than they expected. I mainly spent my 8 hours ringing up sales on the register. They would not let me do any pharmacy stuff until the last hour of the day when it was just me and the pharmacist there until closing. After 1 year they called me into the office to let me go and complained that I was not doing my pharmacy duties well enough. I looked at the pharmacist and said how can I do them well and learn  if all I do is ring things up on the register. Well I guess I should have asked, but they were always overstaffed and super busy so there was never anyone to help me or willing to switch positions with."
good,My district manager sucked!  He was friends with my manager and he did not like me so he made my life miserable through her.  He was a newly appointed DM and was not qualified for the position.  He had favorites and he made sure everyone knew it!
good,You have to advance really fast in management to keep advancing. Too much back biting and backstabbing amongst employees. The management competed entirely too much with each other instead of cooperating with each other
good,Fast-paced understaffed work environment. Our direct mangers were not pharmacists Which would without fail cause In our pharmacy on a day-to-day basis.
good,"The managers were relaxed but then people wouldn't do their job. Stressful when others had to pick up the slack. Cool people but not great coworkers. The pay made it worth it, thank you minimum wage!"
good,It was a good company to begin with long ago but the past several years it's been steadily going downhill since the Walgreens Boots Alliance merger...
good,Reset and revisions. Stocking shelves. Rotate product. Ordering product. cleaning  and restocking  stock room. Great customer service. also cashiering. Learning new product.
good,"If working in the pharmacy, you need to have a tough skin and be able to brush off the common occurrence of patients/customers getting very angry with you for no fault of your own. I don't really believe the starting pay was worth it, but it is still a better starting rate than most retail jobs."
good,i’m a overnight manager so i’m basically stocking and cleaning everyday. but i’ve learned how to lead a group of people that works under me. management could be better but it’s not bad.
good,First part of my day is seeing which shift lead I work i am gonna be working with cause some are fine and others are really terrible like one of them constantly complains and and talks about how she just wants to get drunk it is really annoying.
good,"As a contractor, i don't like the work culture in Walgreens, There are no reviews of the personal business conduct of contractors. There is no professionalism or process involved in IT Management."
good,"I was first hired full time, but, accepted a part time position because the full time position didn't pay enough for all the tasks I had to do in the short time frame I had to do them."
good,"When I was here, it was a fun place to work and the people I worked with were awesome! Everyone worked well together. Later on there was a lot of turnover and the management wasn't the best at hiring people who were worth anything."
good,"Mainly just scheduling conflicts, don't necessarily feel like I was treated fairly. Wanted a set schedule but couldn't make that happen. Worked a lot of holidays and couldn't get many off."
good,Always busy at the back. Colleagues help each other. I enjoyed interacting with fellow technician and customers but lady pharmacy manager doesn't have managerial concept and skills.
good,Very stressful a lot of favoritism.  A very fast turn over with employees.  Always new rules they change all the time and never consistent.   Never enough hours.  You get in trouble if you go over in hours no overtime acceptable.
good,"I loved working for Walgreen as a second job, they worked with my hours and it wasn't a hard job at all.  If you love greeting and meeting Customers and you are looking for a partime job then this is the job for you."
good,"Being a rover for the company, I worked any and all shifts, all positions. I did not receiver paid time off, I worked my but off for 9 dollars an hour. to me the job was not worth it"
good,You do nothing but type prescriptions your entire shift. Required to type 500 per shift. Can easily be done once you get the hang of it. You are able to listen to music while you work which is actually a HIPAA violation since most employees use their personal phones (which have cameras) and are out on their desks.
good,"stressful work environment. fast paced, lack of management, there's room for grow just extremely hard to achieve. management isn't attentive to employees"
good,"Working for the dark side... super high stress and lack of care for employees and their well being. Top notch benefits and decent pay. Room for advancement at most levels,"
good,"The pay at Walgreens prior to the merge with Alliance Boots was great.  This was to compensate for the long hours, poor management, and lack of support for hourly associates."
good,Pretty decent place to work. Always gave me good hours and worked around my schedule. Promised me a movement into pharmacy area and did not follow through with it.
good,When working here I had a terrible manager. She fired one of her best employees in front of my face as I was starting my first day. Everyone left work at 5pm and it was only me and a float pharmacist in and I had no training and the pharmacist could only help me as much as she could because that was not her home store. I eventually survived my first day. I'm glad that all the patients were understanding that night.
good,Working at Walgreens was great in the beginning. It's a nice starter job. It was my first job so I let a lot of things slide. You're lucky to get a good store manager who actually talks to you about your performance or anything in general. Management refused to actively talk to their employees and miscommunication happened every day. Everyone but the ASM and store manager are under paid. Worked my butt off during the holidays and was blamed for not getting enough done although holidays are crazy in sales. My store also had a lot of favoritism which was very unprofessional. Good starting out job but I definitely wouldn't stay there for more than a year.
good,"There are some perks with this company like the benefits they do offer. I think there is a lot of favoritism here and minimal room for growth with low pay. In NYC, you cannot definitely live off of their pay."
good,While I was grateful for the time I had at Walgreens as a basic job I was left with nothing but grief and a pay check. I worked for the company for 8 years and was always approached by new hires or even shift leads when a problem arose but each time I tried to move up in the company I was denied. I was known for more of my hard work ethic and not my skills at sucking up those who were higher up then me. I was taught that hard work paid off but was sad to learn that didn't apply to this company. When they increased minimum wage I was disappointed that I was given a raise and after 8 years was only making a couple cents more then new hires.
good,I like my job most days.   It is very fast paced.   I do work with a store full of women so there is a lot of petty childishness to deal with.   It seems like I can never do enough.   I love staying busy though and we definitely do that.   I like for work to be very structured and for the most part we are that.
good,I worked with walgreens as a vendor and Walgreens is an incredible organization with tremendous consumer acceptance and support. I love Walgreens and the people.
good,"There's a lot of favoritism at Walgreens. I worked a two different stores. The first was awful. The management at my current store isn't as bad, fit there is still a lot of favoritism. Also I was promised full-time and suddenly they hired a new employee for cosmetics and cut a day out of my week, so I'm down to 29 hours."
good,Not my favorite job but it wasn't bad either. My coworkers were great to spend time with and made shifts fly by.  The work itself was monotonous but necessary for the store to operate.
good,You get close to 30 hours weekly and the customers vary from the nicest to the worst. The co-workers are some of the best and the managers are overall great but the store manager I had seemed to not know what to do in the store
good,The management sucks at the job. They don't appreciate the work time and effort you put in at the job. But have good benefits.........................
good,Not a fun place to work when leadership is constantly working like they are three months behind whats going on in the present. The people you work with are great (sometimes) but lots of backstabbing and secrets going on.
good,management from the store manager all the way up to ceo was very poor. work on all holidays. they do not care about your life at home or with family. Got nice discounts though
good,"Great company in the beginning until change of hands"
good,Good college job but not if you need to make a living. How smoothly things go depend on how good your manager is. Most people that do it for a living don't feel recognized. (Hence why college kids seem more upbeat that 30+ regulars)
good,"My day starts in the office between 6:30 - 7AM Monday - Friday. I have learned that one  person is expected to do the job of several. Management in most cases is supportive. The culture like most corporations no two are the same. They all have a characteristic of their own. The most difficult part of my job is to feel like I have accomplished anything at the end of the day. PMs are viewed as the ""you do everything person"" . Groups do not work as a team to accomplish an end goal. I enjoy the direct team I work with. They are all great people."
good,"The hardest part of the job is there's little room for advancement, having to deal with difficult customers, the low pay, and having long slow nights. The most enjoyable is the friendliness of the coworkers and the usual customers that remember your name and they become your favorite customers. they work with your other sechedules."
good,This is a good company to work for in a situation where you need a job to eat and pay your living expenses.  If you are young and just getting started this is a good starting point.
good,"Busy scheduled days with daily operations of the pharmacy, customer service and being helpful to those that are sick. You must be able to multi-task, management is not the same as it use to be but again the company itself is moving in a new direction."
good,"Schedule could change. Worked AM or PM due to rotating shifts. I gained a wealth of knowledge working with all the automated machinery such as cranes, good to person pick, automated guided vehicles, pick to lights, to name a few. Management was difficult as they hired from the outside and always changed the culture. Some good and some not so healthy. I enjoyed working on analytics, projects, Lean Six Sigma, and process improvements."
good,"Only recently allowing flexible WFH or other, closer offices."
good,"Although I do enjoy my direct management, this company has sincerely declined these last few years. From poor pay to less than average benefits, it is not worth it to work here long term."
good,Instructing over 45+ team members to work on a timely manor to meet goals of getting product to customers. Removing pinpoints while ensuring team members work in a safe manor.
good,"As a photo tech the bulk of the work was loaded on you to stock food, cooler, freezer and manage photo area. I loved helping customers. When I could make a customer happy that made me happy."
good,"Each store is different. When working in retail the final results fall on the major no matter how understaffed you may be. Company is very numbers driven, but not always supplying that appropriate amount of resources to accomplish your goals. A cookie cutter approach of guidelines is often used for a custom made location. Overall retail is always hectic and competitive. Staffing for retail is always a concern due to competitive pay and job requirements.  This is a company in which if you are not in the appropriate circle then it will cost you in the long run.  Definitely a ""Who You Know"" company, instead of how well you do at doing your job."
good,"The store manager at the time was disregarding of company policy, and allowed for hostile work environments.   Their focus was mainly their bonuses each year."
good,Working at walgreens was a good place to work. The only problem that I had was my manager. He wasn't doing his job in making sure his employees were comfortable at work. Did not resolve complaints.
good,Not worth working there. I didn't get advanced in the company. I got treated poorly and took on more responsibility then I ever should have for the amount of money I was getting paid.
good,Totally profit oriented.  There is no respect for employees.  You are expected to do more and more work with a constant cutting of help. Raises or bonuses are nonexistent.
good,"I was in the retail department of cosmetics. My job included placing orders of merchandise, managing displays, customer service and advising customers of products. The hardest aspect of the day was heavy lifting and the work shift. The best part of the day was client satisfaction and advising them on products. I learned about products and many aspects of retail and customers service."
good,"This company works best for those that don't have a demanding home life, such as no children, no second job, etc. It is a face paced job that requires commitment and sacrifice. You're responsible for a lot of things, and it's more of a self indulging job. For the most part you are required to work by yourself for certain task. The managers are good, a few to adjust to but for the most part they all are friendly and reasonable."
good,This company is serious about all the wrong things. They need to be nicer to their employees and compensate them better for the stress we go through. People shouldn't have to beg for years to move up in a company that they clearly work harder for than anyone else.and 25 Cents per year is not a good raise for anyone.
good,"This company is 100% only interested in making money, they do not care for your well being as a person. I've worked here 2 years, going above and beyond to bring revenue to my store."
good,"Don't know what a typical day might be. It can start off good but then turn bad or vice versa. It takes forever to get into corporate and corporate needs to give employees working in stores a better chance at applying, interviewing, and overall giving them better treatment because we understand the company better than an external candidate."
good,"The most hardest part of the job is all the stress it brings and dealing with rude customers. In that type of work place, being able to control yourself & having a positive attitude will always get you through the day."
good,"There are a lot of different difficulties but most of it is with communication and lack of respect for all employees. There many different ways that the communication could be fixed, but along with all else, it is ignored and expanded to be even bigger of an issue."
good,"Walgreens bought the company I worked for for 10 years.  The beginning was great, but then big changes came."
good,Overall this is a pleasant place to work really enjoy helping others and making sure their visit was pleasant and they were satisfied and found what they were looking for.
good,walgreens does not value employees need for work family balance. Often times the schedules you have to bid on do not offer days off together or if they do offer consecutive days off the hours are undesirable
good,"I was lucky enough to work with a very nice group of people, it was like a family. The manager treated everybody with respect and appreciated hard workers."
good,"Being able to do your job in a timely manner is all that the management cares about. If you get hurt and have to be off for a while, kiss your job goodbye. Very physical work and the opportunity for injury is strong."
good,Started just stocking shelves and made my way up to pharmacy tech.  Lots of hands on and dealing with customers.  Decent place to work.  Benefits are average. Scheduling can be spontaneous.
good,being that it is a high volume store along with being 24 hrs it was at a much higher pace than i was use too but i liked the challenged and learned a lot from my other managers
good,"very busy workplace, as with all other pharmacies they are always short on help. too many areas  with not enough coverage. benefits were adequate, never had problem with them, not much room for advancement unless you wanted to move.hardest part was lack of help. enjoyable was the patients in the area"
good,alot of cheifs no master. 10-15 cent raises yearly. everchanging policies. hours are not guaranteed unless you are a shift manager or assistant manager.
good,It was a good job to work for but the management that was there was ran wrong and caused a lot of problems. The schedule was always unfair to some. There was no time for the balance of home life and work life.
good,"For years I loved working at Walgreens, but now I think I just need a place that I can learn more and grow.  walgreens was run better years ago. If I felt job security from day to day, I probably would want to stay."
good,They are very childish in management. Also lie and start drama between co-workers. There are times that you can request days off and they will tell you its okay and still have problems with you taking the day.
good,"It is a good place to work, but not face paced like I am used to. I like to feel like I worked for my money and didn't just sit around and get paid. Too easy."
good,I was a floater and so travelled quite a bit. The staff constantly complained and I didnt see much improvement and so I never took a permanent store as PiC in order not to have to deal with the drama. I understand things are even worse now because they have non pharmacists running the company now.
good,"micromanaging, lack of training to staff, lack of communication, some management have no knowledge in the field of pharmacy, used to be a great company to work for"
good,"Walgreens is a very fast paced work environment and I loved that, however they are always short handed and have a big employee turn over. There pay isn't that competitive and you hardly every get a raise."
good,"okay entry job, customers can be draining to deal with at times.  often there is not much to do, which makes the job boring at times.  great workers, okay managers. stayed with company for a year."
good,"As a manager in the retail stores, I enjoyed the team environment and camaraderie that we shared.  Goals were set, plans were made and implemented and success was celebrated in our store.  "
good,"In my first two years at Walgreens, the environment was great. In my last year there were so management changes it was hard to keep up with different styles of management."
good,"Fast paced enviroment sometimes stressfull"
good,"I worked in many stores. If you are an hourly employee and what to work on your terms get a job at Walgreens. If you want a career in management I would not advise you to take a job with Walgreens. Walgreens is promoting young inexperience managers. Management is paid in the mid- 50,000. Great for a person in there twenty's. I just hope they are smart enough to realize in ten years what they will be making.  If you have any experience as a manager you might find yourself shaking you head many days. You must be able to have an upward management style in order to deal with the inexperience store managers. The inexperience manager feel treaten by experience manager an do whatever it takes to get them out of there store. If they had an common sense they should listen to the experience manager to help improve there skills. Walgreens takes years to fire someone unless you steal."
good,Very convnient place for everyday needs and basic necessities. There is always someoe willing to assist and overall pretty okay place to gain working experience.
good,"Walgreens has undergone many changes with its culture.  Recently, bringing on new faces to the executive board, has brought on quite a few challenges in the field.  To the teams it looks like the company does not care for the team members.  Walgreens should bring back the culture of caring for their people first and foremost."
good,"The work is not always difficult, but there is way more ""build this today, take it apart tomorrow"" than there should be. The stores are open all year long, unless you're a member of the pharmacy team. Even then, when the pharmacy is closed for holidays, they get slammed once the holiday is over and they receive patients who haven't had their medications for at least a day. "
good,the hardest part of the job was bending & stooping down too much to work with products. I don't have anymore to say. Management was very pleasabt and understanding to my disability.
good,"I did not have good amangers. They were young and did not set a very good example for their peers or employees."
good,The new corporate overlords are running the culture into the ground.There are a lot of good people who will be miolked until nothing is left. And the goal posts are always moving.
good,"Had it's ups and downs:"
good,"working at walgreens was stressful just for the fact most workers did not work as a team, customer service is very lacking in most areas especially at the registers where the wait time can range from two minutes to ten depending on how many workers respond.  they hire an extreme amount of high school kids who spend a lot of time visiting each other then getting the work done."
good,"Hired employees were good people, however I felt that the upper management did not treat its employees fairly. Only good for a part-time job for students."
good,"A Walgreens day begins with a Shift Lead opening the store at the beginning of the day. After setting up registers & opening the store to the public, a shift lead then assess the state of the store & begins to assign tasked based on incomplete assignment. After making price changes & scanning inventory anomalies, shift leads will get daily instructions from Assistant Store Mangers or Store managers. Shift leads will take care of deliveries, deposits, register loans, refunds/exchange approvals, & back up staff needs. From assisting in the pharmacy as technicians to running register, shift leads pick up the slack to make sure the store runs efficiently. At the end of the day, shift leads either pass on information to the next shift lead or close down the store. Securing registers, coupons, & money, making deposits, & making the final daily reports to Walgreens."
good,"Walgreens, the store, has been good to me. The management not so much. Inexperienced & selfish. They don't really care about the customer service as much as the sales & the customer plan. Scheduling issues occur often. Lots of unfair scheduling including weekends & holidays."
good,"A typical work day includes greeting customers, cashiering, etc.  I learned a lot about retail and found it to be stressful sometimes.  The management is fair at best but could be better.  The workplace culture is friendly and easy to get along with.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and shoplifters which is rampant at the location where I currently work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting a diverse group of customers."
good,Walgreens is very behind the times. The managers are very thrifty to say the least. Bare minimum is spent on anything.  The computers and registers are outdated and crash frequently. The employees are required to clean the restrooms and mop the floors in the store and stockroom.
good,I took many various positions in the company and enjoyed them all.  Unfortunately they closed the doors after 13 years of employment.  The hardest part of any of my positions was the stress put on by the office managers for productivity and quality.
good,when you are a shift lead you have to deal with a lot for the little pay. especially in a 24 hour store. shift leads are expected to know pharmacy too for a measly pay.
good,"Fast paced, busy work environment gave me the experience to grow and move on. On your feet all day. Sometimes hectic. Provided opportunity for self-development and improved customer service."
good,"A typical day begins with clocking in, going straight to your department and not stopping until your break time. I've learned a tremendous amount about multi-tasking, working efficiently under pressure, and staying patient no matter what the situation. The team members are nice. Management is good at the store level. Constantly being scrutinized by upper management. Hardest part of the job is being asked to meet unrealistic goals. Most enjoyable part of the job is when you know you've made at least one person's day better."
good,"This is a great place for a first job, or a part-time job if you have other jobs as well. Each location differs, but for the most part the employees are underpaid, overworked, and underappreciated. The management at several stores needs some major revamping, yet most respectable and educated managers would not be likely to work here in the first place. "
good,"I loved working at Walgreens as a pharmacy technician; however, when I moved to a different apartment they promised to transfer me to a Walgreens closer to my new apartment. After said promise, they never transferred me or got back to me about a job period, so I had to quite."
good,I been with walgreens for 4 years and I like I can work any Walgreens I want and I like the breaks and my coworkers are helpful when I have questions or need help. But I really dislike getting blamed for patients co-pays and trying to explain everytime it's their insurance not my choice and insurance companies complicate the job more than anything.
good,"I was threatened by people, who was later allowed back in the store to do it again. Ones a customer threatened an employee with physical violence they should be encored out and not allowed back in for the safety of the employer."
good,tolls and experience's I have gained from this job are both positive and negative. Such as making lasting relationships with co workers and customers beyond those four walls. The negatives are the pushiness to promote verses find the needs of the customers also the work load and expectations to get task completed and still be helpful to customers also poor management good in other areas but overall lacks in performance.
good,dont expect to make alot of money here. managers dont really care about your life or anything outside of making money for walgreens. customer focused job so expect the customer to always be right. benifits kick in pretty fast afer starting. short breaks long hours. jus because you work one department doesnt mean you wont ALL of them including saniatation when needed.
good,It's a pretty fun job but it's not enough money to manage my bills and start the business that I want to start. Do not fell like I can advance myself in this job.
good,"Walgreens was not the best company to work for. There was little to no opportunity for advancement, management was inefficient, and the pay was poor. This is a job I would recommend for those trying to gain general work experience, those without very high expectations, i.e. teenagers."
good,"Good people to work with. But crazy busy. Store level employees are perpetually understaffed, underpaid, and overworked. A lot of rude and entitled customers abusing the employees. "
good,"Typical day: Filled and labeled prescriptions, aided customers, answered many insurance questions."
good,"I worked with some truly fine individuals while in the employ of Walgreens, from store mangers to district supervisors to other staff pharmacists I was blessed with good co-workers"
good,"I dont mind working for walgreens. The main reason for my scores have to do with current management. Sometime favoritism at the store makes me feel as if it could be my location. Other employees that have transferred from other locations find the location I personally work at to not feel as homey as other locations that the word ""team"" and ""together"" mean something."
good,"Walgreens was a great job that I stuck with for years. But with constant corporate changes and minimum wage going up, my hard work seemed useless. I didn't feel appreciated anymore. It has been a fantastic learning experience. But I am ready to move on. It's a great entree level job."
good,"This job required a large and quick learning curve to become familiar with an entirely new set of skills. I did not receive the highest quality training so I was forced to learn many things on my own and by trial and error. The workplace was filled with many great people who wanted to provide the highest level of care to the many patients we worked with, but the management was sometimes not supportive of the staff and the problems that would arise."
good,"good hours,got to learn new fork trucks, met some nice people, clean work, had to make productivity numbers did not agree with some of management policy."
good,old employees think that they are above everyone because they have been there longer which makes it very difficult to get long when they do not like change. It makes you feel unwanted.
good,"Over loaded all employees with long hours and the management was extremely rude and self-serving. Not easy to communicate with, none of my fellow employees liked our management. Would have been a nicer work environment under other managers."
good,A typical day was long hours. I learned working for a corporation was just for profit. They didn't care about their employees. Rarely was able to take breaks and eat lunch. They were just looking to make the stockholders happy.Managers were not sympathetic to employees needs as far as giving good feed back.
good,"Working for Walgreen's was an okay job. I used to love coming to work everyday and greeting my fellow coworkers/ customers. What i learned at Walgreen's was having patience with difficult customers. Most of the management was okay, didn't really have any problems with them. The work place was filled with different types of culture, we all got along like family. that's what I loved about Walgreen's. The hardest part about Walgreen's I would say is when it would get super busy, and you'd have a million and one task to do but you'd have to help the customer first. So it would set you back a little bit. The lines would be really long due to lack of extra help. A typical day at work would be stocking, setting up displays, making side panels, building up in stands etc. Overall Walgreen's is a good start off job to help you build up your customer service skills."
good,Not a very stimulating environment. You are just another number here and unfortunately it is very difficult to advance. The managers are always changing. The only good thing are the customer.
good,"A typical day at walgreens is pretty easy going until it gets busy, which is usually during lunch time unless you're at a flagship store. Ive learned a lot of things at walgreens especially customer service skills, they are very big on customer service. Depending on which location you go to management can either be good or bad. In my experience of working there for nearly 3 years management wasn't really that fair there was a lot of favoritism. Some were fair but for the most part in upper management such as store managers and assistant store managers they usually had favoritism and always let those employees get away with things they shouldn't get away with.  The workplace culture isn't too bad if everything goes according to plan but sometimes the culture of the store gets thrown out the window due to the unfairness of management so nobody cares to work the way they should. There really isn't anything hard about working at walgreens. All I can think of that was hard for me in my experience is learning which aisles are where. The most enjoyable part about the job is the employees and getting to know them and also helping some of the employees"
good,"Walgreens isn't a fair place to work. The management use to be great but unfortunately it is declining quickly. The hardest part of the job is feeling like you are never doing the right thing and then management throwing more on your plate. My favorite part of my job is my patients. Providing my patients with the best care is extremely rewarding. I have learned how to manage inventory, whether it is ordering medication or sending it back. I have also learned how to be more understanding to the needs of sick people and family members. My typical day is answering telephones, filling prescriptions, and giving my patients excellent service and sometimes the only requirement is to listen."
good,"On a daily basis I will work one on one with customers, insurance companies, and physicians. The job requires multitasking and taking care of patients in a timely manner."
good,"the motto of "" live and and healthy"" ..... it is a job that is customer based. must be a people person...great benefits as far as discount. its a retail job..."
good,"While there is room to grow, road blocks tend to get in the way if one does not have a completed higher education. Shift leaders were not treated fairly by either management or staff."
good,overly worked due to short handed store staff. can be very frustration for both workers and customers because there is never enough help. It could be an ok place to work if there was enough staff and work was distributed equally between workers.
good,"Hectic place to work for. Changed managers too much. Had to do too much work that was other people jobs. Things never came up on sale right, and made customers angry"
good,"Walgreens pharmacy I worked in has a good working environment. However, the coworkers are not helping each other like a team and you will get into argument which could be avoided. A lot of pressure from team members."
good,"Seems lower level management takes the blame for what upper level management can't balance. Everyday a new task gets added to your growing daily workload, and then upper management stresses ""time management' There is only so much time in a day... and if you devoted your life to walgreens, well then thats just it... you have no life...."
good,Over the past years there have been many changes in the company. In my opinion these changes are not for the best. You are expected to do much more work in less time and with no pay increase. Definitely not the best place to work.
good,The job was an overall great experience. My coworkers were great to work with and easy to get along with and management had its perks but they were understanding and easy to work with. The only bad thing about the job I would say was the pay. Its known to be a great company that makes lots of money but didn't care to pay you much.
good,"Loved the job, but lots of changes being made and Voluntary Redundancies offered, so decided to take it and go freelance."
good,"They have a lot of on line training except you never get to finish your training because there always short staff, they over work you and dont pay you for all the work they require you to do.very fast paced, you learn alot about different medicines, they also have you help the pharmacy when needed.which is a whole other level of learning experience. It wouldn't be a bad place to work if they paid you for what they have you do.to much work and no pay, management need to be more professional.  Alot of favoritism."
good,"Prepare to work and sweat to validate the slightly above average pay they offer. Not all Walgreen's Distribution Centers are created equal. Be forewarned."
good,"When I was at this job I assisted the manager of the liquor store. We built displays, maintained inventory, keep a clean store, and sold products."
good,"job can be stressful on some days, new management, somewhat flexible schedule, other employees constantly calling in or no call no show. there are no hard part about working at walgreens."
good,Very hectic work enviroment.  It can be very fast paced.  You are asked to do alot with very little help.   Work hours are cut down to bare minimum.  Outside of excellent retirement benefit  its hard to enjoy working here.
good,"Too much duties, no enough hours. Sometimes teamwork sucks but pretty good company. Deal with lots of customer and engage in many conversations. The only bad thing was i never got more hours unless someone called in and they asked if i could cover their shift"
good,"I have enjoyed my job there, each day was different each time I entered through the door, I enjoyed it, but as it became a habit, I started to have my doubts. I have learned a bit about stocking and switching ""use by"" dates. The manager really enjoyed how I worked there, and he has told me that I was neat in my job. However the cleanliness needs improvement, there has been dead insects in the back of the stocking shelves, the windows and random dust bunnies in the corridors of the wall, and I often had many questions with my job. The manager claimed that if I were to turn in my application to this job site, they would accept me completely. However me going back and actually getting payed may be roughly considerable."
good,"I studied pharmacy and had the opportunity to intern at Walgreen's. I learned hands on how to fill, do data entry, and work with customers.  This was my first experience in pharmacy."
good,"Your open to learn a lot, it's very busy constantly helping customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with."
good,the workplace is pretty  average it has its fast paced days and other days it seems like it just drags.Management is pretty good they make sure you doing what you suposed to do.
good,customer service/ problem solving / theft encounter/ customers can be very rude at times but again customers are always right because of the way of time life in the customer service world.
good,"Walgreens was a great job with great management at most times. The customers were great and there was room for advancement though, there were huge waiting lists to get there. I would recommend this job to anyone who enjoys retail and is a self motivated, go getter."
good,"The management team needs a lot of work, but co-works and customers make the job worth while. It is easy for your time to fly by when helping customers find the products they are looking for, as well as answering questions."
good,No excitement in work environment. Same tasks were given / expected to be performed day after day. Nothing new to learn. Did not see any growth for a better future.
good,Great people I work with but company can be better need to  A knowledge  there employees more need to back employees up when it comes to rule people in the store
good,started off as a mgt then had a pay cut because they changed titles to shift lead.   hours were not that great because you would close and have to open the following morning
good,My time with Walgreens was a great learning experience and I enjoyed processing photos because it was new talent discovered and mastered to my full potential. I could envision myself working with photos as a career. I discovered that I had a passion for photography that I was unaware of.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers. I have several regular customers that I see on a day to day basis and I always greet them with a smile and I know they truly appreciate my genuineness.
good,"Management only cared about how much work was done. They did not care if you were sick, had a final (for students), or had to get something done before work. They had favorites and if you were not one of the favorites then they did not go above and beyond for you."
good,"Their beliefs are to make everyone as one team, but in actuality their is no one team. Employees are treated with indifference, condensation, with makes for a very unhappy place to work."
good,A typical day at Walgreens consisted of numerous retail clients. I worked at a slow pace due to unorganized management. They were also very slow when it came down to passing out checks on pay day. Overall I did enjoy my work experience there.
good,"This was a very easy job for an MA.  All you had to do was manage the waiting area, take vitals, and enter some patient history."
good,"Walgreens isn't anything special as far as retail or retail pharmacy goes.  Yes, it's an old company that's been around since the turn of the 20th century, but it's fallen to the typical dealings that plagues all large corporations.  They're recently shifting to focus more on the pharmacy, but too little too late.  As with most stores like this, your experience will heavily depend on the employees working there."
good,While this is a good company to work for if you're looking for a possible management position... It is not particularly good for someone who is looking for a pay increase.
good,Great place to work and meet new people everyday. something to do at all time when your at work. Great place to start and get work experience
good,"If a teen is interested in their first job, Walgreens is perfect and more flexible the younger you are. However, as an adult who has bills to pay and an expensive rent.. it is not. Pay isn't very good and favoritism is apparent. Rotating schedules make it very hard to plan for things and hours are always different. Hired as full time but I work part time hours some weeks.. It makes it hard for me to pay everything I need to. Coworkers are good."
good,Always changing from one vision to a different vision. Always changing job responsibilities. work with so great people just expect more and more with less and less help.
good,"The workplace is super quiet. everyone keeps to themselves, not much ""team chemistry"" at all. Low pay for quite a bit of work. Benefits are good though."
good,"I would fill the shelves,recieve merchandise, and run the cash register. Its a nice place to work, but not a place for advancement."
good,"the day to day operation was straight forward. not difficult. Did get a little redundant though. you great the customers when they come in, help them fin what their looking for,ring them up and tell them to have a great day when they leave."
good,I have a very busy day everyday.  I have learned better ways on training new employees.  I have a really good staff.  The hardest part of my job is maintaining all the new procedure changes with the company.  The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with my customers.
good,typical day srart and end very busy. phamcist often with limited staff to fill 300+  the hard part is not having a support system. I have leaned that being able to multitask is a must and having a good partner is a also vital.
good,"Running around the store trying to do everything, because other manager on duty would not help"
good,"They're open late, so the hours are flexible. It's easy work for minimum wage. Not a lot of room for advancement. The management was relatively lenient when it came to break times, deadlines, etc, which was OK if you're the one slacking but not OK if you're the one picking up after everyone else."
good,"For all of the things the manager makes you run around the store to do, $8/hr is definitely not worth it. Tag night was the absolute worse, but I was quite well at it."
good,"The job was pretty good starting off but as you proceed into about 6 months in, your hours will drop. I felt as if some management did not like me due to my race."
good,"Walgreen's has always been very good to me. Walgreen's worked around my school schedule while I was in college and I slowly advanced through the company. I do see others struggle within the company. It seems that there is favoritism at times.  I love the people I work with and I've learned a lot of good customer service skills from walgreens.  I never intended walgreens to be my ultimate ""career"" and I think it is a great place for young people to learn customer service skills."
good,"Fast paced, high demand job. Poor work space quality. Unappreciated staff, understaffed team leading to overworked employees"
good,Used to be a nice place to work at. But yearly downsizing and reduced raises make the job very undesirable. Most people are jumping ship.
good,"At first i enjoyed working at Walgreen's in Springfield, but after about 2 weeks things began to change and I started to see/understand the dynamic around there. The biggest issue i had with working there was that the managers had a tendency to gossip and spread false information  about other staff members. Nothing was confidential, and nobody had each others backs like a team should"
good,"A typical work period at Walgreens is almost always hectic, mainly due to lack of technician hours assigned to stores. You feel as if the company is trying to squeeze every last drop of sweat out of their employees."
good,"I was only a part-time employee, which does not entitle me to any benefits whatsoever. The Managers were generally insightful and courteous as well as informative."
good,"As a beauty advisor, my typical day of work was selling cosmetic products, learning about new cosmetic products, making displays for the department, keeping stock and inventory, answering phone calls, and providing good customer service. I learned a lot about management and beauty while I was here, but at time I felt like I was not valued by the company or my team/managers. Most of my co-workers were very hard workers that I was able to build a strong relationship with. I enjoyed helping women and young girls find products best for them and hosting ""Saturdates"" and ""Beauty Must Haves"" on Saturdays."
good,Every manager has his or her own rules. Employees were not always aware of what was happening around in the company. But other than that work routines was always the same.
good,"They keep squeezing more and more out of employees with less pay and benefits,"
good,"I started at Walgreens as a Photo Tech. I was able to advance to a Pharmacy Tech. My experience at this location, however, was less than enjoyable. A set schedule that didn't allow much time outside of work, extremely poor compensation, and only somewhat decent management."
good,a typical day was I work from 4-10 Five days a week and 8-4 on sat.  management was always hanging out in the office and not on the sales floor until I moved to north Carolina then management was always on the sales floor helping with stocking the merchandise or helping customers.
good,it is a good place as long as you do your job. the customer can be stressful to work with the employees are people that care but some dont care
good,"A typical day at work included dispersing merchandise to the sales floor, checking out customers, and addressing any concerns, questions or issues they may have. In my brief time at Walgreens I learned to be more efficient in counting money in general and when counting down my drawer. Management over all was good. Store manager was very rude and disrespectful to emplyees. Hardest part of the job was sales tags (weekly & monthly). And the part I loved the most about my job was seeing my regular customers come in and knowing exactly what they wanted."
good,staff and some management was unfriendly and rude only upside was i learned great customer service and the hours were not bad
good,"Phone ringing off the hook as soon as the pharmacy opens, with customers in drive-thru and front counter even before Pharmacy opens. Always short on help, which results into poor customer service."
good,Typical day at work put products in shelf and stay behind register all day. When i was working i had very good managers.Noting enjoyably at this work.
good,"Walgreens is nothing like the company that I thought it was. Everyone around me use to tell me that Walgreens was a really good company to work for. Over the past few years that I've worked at Walgreens, I found the environment to be unbearable due to management. The managers do not do anything that they are suppose to do. A typical day at Walgreens includes: greeting customers, entering sales into the register, providing great customer service. The thing that I like most about my job are the employees and the customers, meeting new people. I learned how not to be a bad manager."
good,"Walgreens historically has been a good company to work for and with, but in recent times has taken a path of extreme cost cutting and the leadership is focused more on profit than providing the excellent customer service which they tout."
good,"I only worked at Walgreens for about 6 month. I do not feel as if I was well trained in what they wanted me to do for my task, and i feel like I was expected of a lot more than a part time job usually requires. There was a shift in management, where some full time management were being dropped to part time because walgreens needed to save on money, I left for schooling, but I would not work here again."
good,The management was not all that good and we were short staffed half of the time due to or manager not wanting to hire new people.
good,"Some days can be very fast pace and other day very slow. As part of management I learned how to handle employees, get them motivated to complete take at hand. Learn pharmacy procedures as well at store procedures. Hardest part of the job was handling customer complaints. But the more I got them I realized that they just want to be heard. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the co-works and customers you get to meet! Often its the little things that count, and knowing that you just help a customer solve any problem they had brings great satisfaction."
good,Walgreens is a start up job for anybody... horrible pay and benefits no good neither... McDonalds is a better company to work for then this place not a opinion a fact sorry this is my experience and my personal...
good,"I was a Beauty Adviser at Walgreens for 3 years. On a typical day I opened the register and began helping customers. I maintained the cleanliness of my department, ordered products, created displays and organized the stockroom. I was also cross trained in all the other departments Main register, photo and pharmacy. I would make signs and label sales. My number one objective was sales, I had daily and weekly sales goals that I was expected to achieve. I learned how to bundle sales (ex. if someone is buying mascara try to sell them eyeliner) my skills at customer service became so outstanding that I had a huge amount of return customers and even had a few write reviews and send them to my district manager. I liked my coworkers and continue to stop in and see them. However the management at my store was awful. I had one assistant manager in the 3 years I worked for walgreens who didn't make work difficult. They made working there hard and not worth it. I complained to HR and nothing ever happened. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers, I enjoyed helping people."
good,"The job didn't require a lot of thinking or actual work, it was a very boring job and it didn't pay well at all. The management for the most part was great, they seemed like they actually cared about their workers."
good,"Walgreens used to be a great place to work, but then changes started coming down one the merger with boots happened.  It is now a place that condescends to its employees and makes management execute rather than think."
good,"its a good job to have while looking for better work, the employees are not valued and the pay stinks. but if you need some money in ur pocket here is a good temporary employment."
good,I loved working there. It was hard because I worked until close every night and it kept me from my young son. The people were great to work with and I love all of my regular customers.
good,"My location was a small store with close contact with customers that allowed a more personal relationship. My co-workers were efficient and great to work with. Following corporate budgets was always a challenge, but we made it work. Overall, it was a great place to work."
good,"I worked there for 3 years while I went to school. Yes I appreciate the fact that they gave me a job with a flexible schedule as I went to school part time and it helped me get off unemployment, but I didn't appreciate the lack of compensation, respect from my employer, or job security. I learned valuable skills in customer service and patience, but I was expected to do jobs like order and maintain the photo department inventory despite being told that I couldn't be promoted to Photo Manager because they had gotten rid of the title. However shortly before my departure, I learned that was untrue and I was doing jobs that I wasn't being compensated for. I was always fighting management to keep my hours and maintain my schedule because otherwise it was random, hard to keep up with, and my paycheck wouldn't be steady if I didn't. After I graduated and received my license in medical lab, I went on interviews and my supervisor was nice to help me get time away from work for about a month. Then right before December, I was told I couldn't network anymore. I couldn't go on anymore interviews despite job recruiters calling me left and right. I wish I hadn't left the way I did because I burned the bridge but I had no choice. Afterwards I received word that the photo department had run out of supplies multiple times because no one knew how to order the supplies or keep the inventory. Machines had also broken down because no one was trained to maintain them. I can't say I'm surprised because it was a revolving door of employees working there, most of which didn't want to stay long anyway."
good,Most of the managers favor people. when your short handed they still  expect you to get all your jobs done on time.  They expect you to do everything and more even if you don't know quit how to do it and then yell at you for not doing it the right way.
good,I enjoyed assisting the customers with their purchases.  Coworkers were friendly and mostly helpful. The managers were always there when you needed them.  I love shopping so this was fun to see all the stock and what I would buy when I shop here.
good,Low-level employees are not their top priority. They are more worried about being in control of the pharmacy industry.
good,Walgreens is a company that does not properly compensate its employees and has made several pay cuts across the board in the last several years. The employees tend to be unmotivated and lacking drive and determination. This is in part due to the fact that the upper management continues to make decisions that negatively impact the working environment to the detriment of the individual retail employee.
good,The co-workers in general are easier to work with and the most enjoyable part of the job is the customer services.I learned  management and retail service accountability and patience.
good,"Walgreens is a diverse work place. I enjoyed getting to know all my coworkers, but management made it difficult for me to stay. The flexible work schedule also wasn't the best for me. And the pay was close to minimum wage. But, couldn't have asked for a better first job."
good,"The job itself is pretty monotonous, and they put unrealistic expectations on the cashiers come Medicare enrollment season. The medical benefits are great for prescriptions but not doctor visits. The pay could be better."
good,"There was very little opportunity of advancement. It was a very boring job, and most of the times there was very little to do, especially as the front cashier."
good,"The company was a great place to work. But, they have changed and it's not for the better of the employees. "
good,Management was fair. We had activities every now and then. llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
good,"This has been my first job. It has definitely been something to glean information from. The people that work there are generally nice, but the district management can be intimidating and unyielding with their quotas and expectations. All of this can create a stressful environment."
good,"The average day at work starts with answer customer inquires over the phone or in person at the pharmacy or pharmacy drive-thru window. Communication with insurance companies on a regular basis referring to patients medications and coverage. Filling prescribed medications to the precise dosage as prescribed by the doctors. Maintaining a clean workspace. Assisting fellow technicians and pharmacists with their work. "
good,"My experience with Walgreen's has been nothing shy of disappointing for the exception of the flexibility in scheduling. The work atmosphere in general is that of ""it's someone else's responsibility"" or ""I don't get paid enough to do that"" by in large. The overall appearance of the store is filthy, particularly the bathrooms. The appearance of the employees is sloppy and unkempt. There are no consequences for failures of accomplishment nor poor professional appearances. Essentially, although the management is very friendly and understanding, the store morale is low, the overall management experience is poor, and the appearance and operations are sub-par"
good,"I enjoyed my last store that I worked at Walgreens, but overall this place is the worst company to work for. There are some good benefits to working at that place, but for the most part its very bad. Do not waste your time and apply for a job there. There is a reason why there are so many job openings."
good,"I was there for over three years and it wasn't a bad job at all, but there were long periods throughout the day where there was not much to do in my department. The wages were incredibly low, starting from minimum wage which was $7.50 and getting a .25 cent raise every September. Which is odd since Walgreen's is always hiking up the prices on items almost monthly. The three years I worked there,I got about maybe less than a dozen either Saturdays or Sundays off. Same with other holidays."
good,My typical day at work is a very very busy day. I love the people that i work with. My manager is very helpful and working there i have learned a lot.
good,It was a very easy job. Just wasn't the right fit for me. The mangers where barely around. Typical day of work would be standing behind register for 8 hours.
good,Walgreen's has very low pay for entry level employees. Walgreen's is very flexible with schedules so it is ideal for a college student or a individual with another job/ looking for part time work.
good,"Walgreens has been around for over 100 years, and, through the decades, they have hired bright leaders whom have brought forth great ideas, and, whom have executed the goals to maintain those ideas; hence, they really have placed Walgreens above the rest, as one of the top drug store retailers in the nation. "
good,"When I worked  for Walgreens, my typical day was handling employee and customer related issuses. Inventory, ordering, day to day up keep of the store and my department.  I learned how to Change plan o grams and displaying merchandise. I worked well with employees, the higher managers appreaticated my hard work.The hardest part of the job was the hours, there was never a set schedule and they are open 365 days a year.The most enjoyable part was Customer service and problem solving."
good,"Managed daily operations of a retail pharmacy, performing tasks as a pharmacist; reviewing data entry, filling prescriptions, verifying work done by technicians, etc.  In addition to the general pharmacy tasks, I am an immunizer and was a limited lab. director, doing very limited blood work-up, blood glucose, A1C, cholesterol levels."
good,"They need stop focusing on cost saving, and focus on their employees as a whole. The amount of work does not match the pay, and employees need to be trained better on all levels. Employees are either over tasked for the day or under tasked, so there really is not a typical day."
good,Management is not understanding to employee's that have children. No tolerable for children being ill and a parent having to take time off work to care for them.
good,"Good Company to work for ,helping Customers. My co-workers are the best to work with were like Family. Helping Customer with Photo Orders."
good,"Walgreens Is A Good Work Environment. Dealing With All Type Of Customers Each An Everyday Helps You With Your Customer Service And Communication Skills. Not Hard Or Challenging Work At All, But When You Work Hard Day In An Day Out There's Not Much Advancement Opportunities Within The Company Its Self. I Say Walgreens Careers Are More For Young Teens First Starting Off In The Work World, As Well As Some Seniors Taking It Easy But Is Still Dedicated To Work."
good,"Stable job with weekly routine. Everyone plays a part in keeping the store maintained and running smoothly. From stocking to facing the store, doing outs/order review, periodic counts, creating visually appealing displays to boost sales."
good,"Walgreens will work you to death.  When I left the company I was putting 80-90 hours a week.  They cut the staff forcing all salary to work more hours to make up for it, but it was never enough.  Walgreens has lots of rules. But with one rule there are a 100 exceptions to it, making them hard to follow."
good,"Great employees, but not much room for outside life. Very hard to move up within the company. The hardest part of the job is the multiple tasks they place on you and expect you to complete. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the employees and customers."
good,"Days are typically routine, which is good because this store did not do paid training, hardly any training at all. "
good,"Typical retail job. teaches great customer service skills and patience. minumun wage pay. ok hours, boring, mundane work. No real challenge."
good,"Lovely people to work with, but the company asks too much of it's employees without increased wages. Customers are ridiculous. Great that they let employees transfer locations."
good,"If you love difficult customers and problem solving and being in two places at once and hurting feet, then this is the job for you."
good,"High volume and hectic customer service environment. Lot's of on the job training is required and available but time is not enough time is given for attention of on the job training.Pharmacy Technician work is not a glamorous it is hard work and a high volume and high pace but it has its rewarding moments, if you enjoy helping people."
good,"After 12 years I decided it was time to leave.  This is a company that once had a family-owned feel to it, and is now going in the way of other big-box retailers.  It does offer the benefits and protections provided by law to employees (plus a few extra bonuses such as employee discount and profit sharing), and on a local level there are wonderful people to work with.  Otherwise, expect the big-box treatment in regards to pay, time off, number of hours scheduled/cut, and generally the required same-mindedness such as memorization of company ""verbage"" and ridiculous acronyms.  Also, keep an eye on the news.  This company went through a huge overhaul by merging with, then acquiring a company overseas called Boots Alliance.  Shortly thereafter, the CEO took a buyout and the position was filled with someone outside of Walgreens.  These things are not formally announced or made known to employees unless they're also stock holders in the company."
good,"I love promoting sales."
good,"Walgreens has good benefits, but there is no room growth. They don't look out for the well being of the employees. Usually a typical day is making sure the store is fully stocked and customer service is provided. I've learned how to practice patience and understanding the needs of the customer. Being part of management, I have to be openminded to everyone's needs and being compassionate when necessary. My co-workers have a very high level of respect for me and feel comfortable talking with me about anything. The hardest part of my job is the schedule. There is no set schedule and no weekends off, which makes it hard to spend time with my family. The most enjoyable is helping someone and they really appreciate the service that you've provided."
good,"The management at the first store I worked at was wonderful. "
good,"Walgreens is a fun place to work, unfortunately they do not care about their employees safety enough to provide security."
good,"Consistant Work, Consistant Pay, Great Benefits.. Good For Starting Work Careers And Building Good Work Habits."
good,"This company is very difficult to work with. It is obvious to anyone working there that the store manager does not really care about the people. She never said hello or goodbye, never gave compliments, pats on the back, recognition for any job well done. Never. The pay is very low and hard to live on. The store manager pressured me into purchasing health insurance I did not want. That's the only ""benefit"" they offer. There was no chance of advancement at all. They hired from the outside, always. I never felt secure in my job due to the manager's attitude or lack thereof. She had her ""favorites"" and it was painfully obvious to everyone. There was no spirit whatsoever in this store. I commented on it, until I knew there was no chance of any sort of 'celebration' for anything. There is an empty hole in the section in the break room for ""Happy Birthday"" where a picture of the birthday person is supposed to be. Also an empty hole for ""Employee of the month.""  Raises were based on customers who actually called and used the survey on their receipts, NOT on your work. This is a fact, as I was told that during my evaluation for a raise. Raises were usually less than 25 cents."
good,I love walgreens but since they took over Kerr Drugs things just not the same. They never have enough hours for everyone. People that's been there years don't get permanent but people that's been there months do. They care nothing about their employees. I cant wait to leave. Can live off 20 hours a week. My manager is fantastic. Shift leaders are great too. I love all my customers they are great!
good,"The location I currently work at is a 24 hour pharmacy. It is a fast paced location that does around 375-400 prescriptions a day. I work with all different insurances including Medi-Cal, Medicare, & private billing. I am one of the two SR. CPhT's at our store so we are currently training two technicians. The hardest part of work would be properly maintaining work flow so we I may submit TAR's to Medi-Cal while managing to keep the typing, patient traffic, filling & placing/ordering medications. In general- having to maintain all work flow & time management is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"It's retail. You sacrifice your time for pay. But in this every increasing globalized economy, the time/pay ratios are trending in a downward direction."
good,"Immediate management up to the district level are great.  I understand that may not be everyone's encounter, but I have been blessed to work with some great managers.  The only real downside of the company is that they seem to value the bottom line over everything else.  I understand that is very important, but when you alienate the employee's, make them feel that they are disposable, you lose all of your good employees and are left with not so good employees.  This affects your customer satisfaction, leads to increased employee turnover, and eventually leads to declining sales.  The pay for technicians is around average, the benefits though are horrendous.  The cheapest medical plan they offer is still going to cost a family of four $300 per paycheck.  That's each and every paycheck, not every month.  When you have a Type I diabetic daughter that was diagnosed at 15 months and whose life depends on insulin and you have to pay $75 for each (there are two) every single month on top of the cost of test strips, doctors appointments, etc. Even the medical plan that we would need to reduce our monthly cost for Dr's and prescriptions cost me a little under $467 per paycheck.  Like I said, management (immediate up to district, not so much corporate), is great, co-workers are great, helping customers is great.  The benefits flat out suck though."
good,"My typical day consist of making IV medications."
good,Big company with nearly 275K employees and 8000+ stores.  Lots of room for advancement.
good,Filling and entering customer scripts. Dealing with insurance problems.
good,"Retail pharmacy tech in a fast passed environment can be rather challenging, but becomes rather difficult when working without the appropriate tools or proper training from the company. The store staff, including management are helpful and friendly, never had a complaint about a co-worker. This job is for the patient, skillful, and patient! did I say patient?"
good,"I became certified and registered at Walgreens, and even though their training system is not that great,  you do have the opportunity to "" learn as you go"" on the job."
good,"The work at walgreens was easy, but management was a big problem."
good,"I worked at Walgreens on and off for years, from the age I was 15 - 23. I left briefly a number of times due to school and getting a 2nd job with a higher pay and benefits."
good,"My typical work day are cases are generated from management that could be a simple case, to a very complex case they really range in day to day. The work atmosphere is ok, but at times the stress level is really at its peak. My coworkers are a great group of people to work with, very supportive of one another. The most enjoyable part of my day is working with the customers on issues, and resolving problems."
good,"With the corporate higher ups cutting the hours to the stores, the workload is increased with less time to complete it in. The benefits really don't match the amount that is thrown on the shoulders of the hourly people and their direct supervisors. "
good,"The workplace isn't as pleasant as it use to be. New employees are constantly coming and going. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management on a daily basis, as well as all the new rules. Things have really changed. The best part of the job is the flexible hours."
good,You need a lot of patience and need to be able to handle the amount of stress coming at you at all times. You can't let the craziness of the environment get to you or you will not make it.
good,"Good company except all positions have a salary cap.  Once you hit it, no more raises.  Advancement is very minimal."
good,"My typical day working at Walgreens was very confusing with all different people telling me what to do and never having an understanding on who to listen to. I learned how to teach myself in the work place when I wasn't told how to do something I would teach myself and progress in that way. My manager never really came out of his office and would never talk to us about work or rules and left the employees to direct me. Some of my co-workers were amazing and helped me as much as they could but some would harass me and never leave me alone and telling the manager did nothing, which is one of the reasons I quit. The hardest part of the job was getting harassed and nothing getting done about it. The most enjoyable part of the job was figuring out that I am a really good worker and teaching myself all by myself."
good,"love working with the customers,love my job not enough hours in the day to get done what you need.i started out as a cashier and in 8 years advanced."
good,"I have loved working for this company, but with new restructuring the potential for advancement has decreased significantly."
good,"Walgreens was a good company, how ever being fairly expensive compared to other businesses, and the pharmacy garnering many a complaint, dampened their reputation. I learned how to provide excellent customer service, and how to print photos clean the store etc."
good,"you're responsible for customer service including purchase transactions, balancing the register at the end of the shift, selling and offering the Walgreens rewards card, facing and restocking merchandise."
good,your life is not your own. co workers were for most part great. too many hours and being on call is just crazy. need a 3rd person to take calls/work nights.
good,"walgreens is a ok place to work but as far as management goes, it sucks! coporate doesn't do what they are suppose to do as far as looking into problems that the store manager cant solve"
good,"Opening store / Balancing case/ distributing work amongst the employees "
good,Company has changed to what can we get for the cheapest price. This includes their employee wages which leads to lack of advancement.
good,"The management mainly means well, but most of the management titles have been eliminated, so they're waiting for theirs to be as well. Most of the staff make minimum wage and are told they must say and do things a certain way and that ""this isn't going away""; then a few months later it changes. This does not make for a stable or productive envirement. I did learn a lot of things over the years, but there seems to very little time to do anything but try to keep your head above water anymore.  Enjoyed interacting with most of the employees."
good,"The company is alright. The photo department is the best place to work. If you're white, you'll move up a lot faster than your co-workers."
good,"Fast paced work environment, with no break time. "
good,It really depends on who is your store manager but other than that co workers and fun to work with!
good,Walgreens is a good place to work. I love interacting with customers daily. I also made a few friends there as well. Everyone was willing to help out.
good,"Upon clocking in checking with the shift-lead seeing of any nightly/daily task that need to be done arbitrated and collectively. Making sure cooler and aisles closet to the cooler (8,9) are faced plus stocked before the shift is over. Consistently attending with customers while in the process of performing other task required. Print, sell, edit and package photos. Give information on items, location of it in-store, rewards with Walgreens card, sales, promotions or signing people up for a Walgreens too the customers/guests. Thus far I've learned that in order to smoothly get things done you have to have 2 people in each department, too properly rotate and attend to the high unexpected volume of guests/customers. Everyone needs to be self-motivated in order to collaborate collectively on helping each other to complete with a more productive shift. Management is ok I'd personally like to see more creative strategies to get all the employees collectively to brainstorm more often together. In a small environment in this location everyone tackling one subject at the same time will be of better productivity. Most of my co-workers seem to give me the impression that they just come for a check. Generally the hardest part of the job is balancing needed productivity against in-store customer productivity. Another part is the software editing program for the pictures. I truly would see more productive time being I was able to save a picture and go back too access the file. The most enjoyable part of the job is the empathy related with customers and employees."
good,Worked for them for seven years and I was let go for being 20 min late. Nothing but drama. The place is ran like a high school. HR and corporate make all decisions which is always bad because they sit behind a desk all day and know nothing about what happens on the work floor. When I got hired in they gave over 3 dollars for every dollar you put in to your retirement now it dollar for dollar. They have slowly taken away everything that made them great. The medical was terrible I pay over 300 a month for me and my wife. The moral is terrible and most workers are looking for a new place to work.
good,"I am new to retail,  "
good,"Management is very nice and the coworkers are friendly. However, they routinely schedule you 1-10 PM and then 7 AM - 3 PM the next day. Not sure why they do schedules like that but it's not enough turn around time. Also, found out Walmart (!!) pays their new employees more than Walgreens..."
good,"I have heard that your experience working for this company will differ depending on your location. My personal experience hasn't been amazing but it has not been bad. Even in the same store your experience will be different. The difference between the day crew work list and the night crew work list is a little bit insane. The store is maintained, stocked, merchandised and everything else that needs to be done during the night. It does give you the opportunity to work on time management and problem solving skills."
good,"•	Input prescriptions onto the computer database"
good,The people you meet will become your life long friends. I loved working at Walgreens because there was never a dull moment.
good,"worked hard everyday and was able to learn new things ,meet new people throughout the company and meet new associates."
good,Walgreens has grown although the economy has slowed down. Walgreens is trying to restructure at a fast pace leaving behind some employees that have dedicated a lot of their time to this company.
good,"I worked for Walgreens for 14 years, when I first started to work there I was in High School which was a great start for anyone needing flexible hours. When I started there the work environment was very family oriented and an overall great place to work. As the years went on noticed a great change in the overall running of the stores, which I guess was to be expected with the changes in the market. The hardest part for me was when changes where sent down upper management wasn't even clear on how to implement the changes we always had to figure it out and hope we got it right.  Like I said before Walgreens is good place to work if you are going to school and  need the flexible hours."
good,"There seems to be structural changes every year. Turn over can be high in some departments. Management seems to be stressed out which waterfalls down onto their employees. Have seen benefit cuts over the past few years. Seems to have that ""corporate"" feel more and more each day."
good,Every year that I have worked here there are structural changes. Benefits are cut every year and it seems as though they care less and less about their employees. Love the people I work with and have worked with some great managers but have also worked for some not so great people. Hardest part of the job is finding the resources in order to do perform better and get ahead. Not much direction given from management.
good,"A work the graveyard shift as an assistant manager at Walgreens.  A typical day for me involves a lot of heavy lifting, cleaning up all of the messes from day shift employees, organizing departments of the store, and resetting merchandise.  I enjoy how I have the opportunity to accomplish a lot of work during third shift but not the hours are not working for me anymore.  My co-worker are great.  We all get along work together very well.  I would say the hardest part of my job is the amount of work I am expected to do.  I am a very hard worker, and get these things done, but do not feel appreciated for my effort.  The most enjoyable part would be my co-workers, and customer service; building relationships with my regular customers."
good,Interesting place to work if you're up for a challenge. Always really busy. Can have difficult customers at times.
good,"Handle with the cash register operations and customer service to merchandising, store"
good,Can be demanding depending upon which store you're working at.
good,"Duties included: Manage opening/ closing; supervise staff of 15; order product from group sheets, ad bulletins, and weekly store product ordering; cash control; end of day cash reports; brinks bank deposit; customer service; checking in warehouse; inventory control; ordering product from outside vendors; checking in vendors and prepare Power Point presentations for staff meetings."
good,"Fast paced working environment, Learning is encouraged and rewarded."
good,Depends on the store where you work. All management are not the same. The hardest part of the job is work life balance. I enjoy the job because Iike what I do.
good,"Great Benefits, but NOT Cheap!"
good,"When I was promoted to the pharmacy I was very excited to learn a new skill. I began working in the pharmacy over the summer and the pharmacy manager was out on leave. I assumed I would receive extensive training because of the fact that I had never worked in a pharmacy setting. I asked a lot of questions and the other techs helped me out when they could. The pharmacy was so busy every day it was hard for anyone to find time to really train me on the job. The only training I received was through the computer training courses, which were helpful, but basically just covered basic training on how to use the computer program used in the pharmacy. I studied all the sig codes on my own and taught myself the generic and brand names for the drugs and their uses. Overall, my experience in the pharmacy was less satisfying than I had hoped it would have been. I really expected more out of it. I feel that Walgreens didn't fully give me all the necessary tools to be successful in the new position."
good,I started out as a cashier and became a beauty advisor in a few months. Worked with great people. only complaint is that it was too far and only worked one day a week.
good,"A typical day at work includes customer service and stocking. I advanced from a photo technician to shift lead over the span of three years. Shift lead was not exactly what I expected, it has been a struggle. The hardest part of my day is motivating employees that are only present for the paycheck, not because they would want to make a difference in the store or sales. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with customers. My goal is to make someone laugh everyday."
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for if you don't mind not having a life. As a manager we work 3 weekends a month and have to work both nights and days.  It can be very hectic and frustrating at times. I love my job and what I do, however, I am missing a lot of my sons life because of my crazy work schedule.  The company is also making changes in their management structure making it more difficult to advance."
good,"pays good, always something new to learn everyday, some coworkers were made friends for life."
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for. They really care about the customers needs. As well as the workers
good,"This was a fun store to work in. The staff was very enthusiastic, and the management team worked hard to keep it that way."
good,"a typical day at work is clock in and clock out. I see 3 is a must for everybody. I had learned about 1st impressions and that you do not only sell the product but you must also know the product you are selling. My co-workers are the best, everyday they hustle to get to work and be the best they can be at any given day! The hardest part of my job is when a co-worker is absent I/we have to fill in for those missing shoes. Multitasking is a must, weather you like it or not. What I enjoy the most about this job is the 5min's huddles we have at the beginning of each shift, I also enjoy working  together as a team and that is priceless."
good,"have costumers yell at you, and illegible writing from doctors offices"
good,I called various people to reconcile outstanding balances on workers compensation bills. My manager was fair. My job was not hard.
good,It's a good company to start off at they are good with working around any schedule.
good,i would get there early clock in and then see what was on the list that needed to be done for the day. i would work through the tasks and would ask a question when needed. Management was ok they made sure that we keep on task. The hardest part of the job was resets (when the move whole areas around). The most enjoyable part of the job was the clients i had many that would come in just to see me.
good,"Supported software packages ad the work had become boring, nothing new to learn, just the same work day in and day out."
good,there is great potential with walgreens but the opportunity and availability of mangers and staff coverage tends to fluctuate.
good,I have learned a lot while working at Walgreens. My favorite part is my co-workers and my customers. The company has changed a lot and going in different directions. I am not sure about a lot of the things they are doing and trying. The management is the most frustrating part of the job.
good,"Typical work day includes helping customers find otc or answering their questions on their Rx medications, filling prescriptions, making compounds, keeping the pharmacy clean. "
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is the same old thing, just work around the store and assist where needed. What i've learned from working at Walgreens for the last few years is that there's no opportunity for advancement and it's time for me to move on.  The management is ok, they just don't give you the credit you deserve or cross train you to work in other areas of the store to advance in the company .  Co-workers are somewhat unprofessional and don't like to do work and you end up doing your work and theirs too.  The hardest part of my job is going and working hard for what seems to be nothing, even though I put my all in what I do it's not appreciated by Walgreens.  The most enjoyable part is when I interact with my customers and punch the clock at ther end of the day to go home."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consists of putting away merchandise, and customer service.  Some days require running a register or photo machines.  Every day requires cash handling, doing returns/exchanges, and answering customer questions.  I have learned a lot over the years in this position.  The biggest most valuable thing is time management.  With out this very important skill it would be almost impossible to get all tasks done in a day.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customer complaints, only because if you do what you are trained to do and the angry customer goes above and beyond you they will always get what is wanted.  There is no form of unity, if you complain someone will break the rules to keep you happy."
good,"A typical day at work is normally busy, but at night it slows down a lot. I've learned a lot with dealing with customers on what makes them happy. Customer Service isn't a easy job but its a wonderful experience. Co-workers are wonderful to work with. The hardest part of is sometimes picking heavy items up but other than that its a simple job."
good,"There is nothing unusual about a management job at Walgreens.  You have the highs and lows of managing hourly employees and meeting customer service demands along with the retail schedule. If you are great at getting the most out of your employees and you really love helping customers, Walgreens may be the place for you.  If you are looking to move up the ladder quickly and value spending the holidays with family, you should probably look elsewhere."
good,"A typical day at work for me is to provide friendly, courteous and efficient customer service along with operating cash register, merchandising, store inventory, and maintaining store displays and signs. As a photo specialist I also help run the photo lab which includes processing pictures, monitoring orders, helping customers with any of their photo needs."
good,"A typical day at work is working the cash register, tending to customers, and maintaining the store's display. I learned how to do the basic duties of a retail employee. I feel the management was fair. My co-workers like to gossip and complain while on the clock and focus more on making friends than doing a good job. The hardest part of this job is dealing with theft. The most enjoyable part of this job is knowing that I helped someone in a big way."
good,"A typical day at work is when I have the chance to walk in to work and be able to execute a successful day in sales. I enjoy making sure the customers are satisfied with their entire shopping experience from the time they walk in until the time they walk out. I learned customer service is very important and as long as you are a reliable employee, it will work out good for you. However, the hardest part of the job is you feel you haven't fulfilled every aspect of the job and when several tasks are to be done and you don't have enough record time to finish. The store is constantly busy so it can be quick to not finish things on time. But, the most enjoyable part about the job is the fact that you can move around between departments to have as much experience as you desire."
good,Working with different people. I learned that people are very serious about their pictures. Management was fun. Co-workers was great.
good,"A typical day at work is stressful. I have learn the proper way of cash handling, opening and closing of the store, and team leadership. My co workers are excellent. The hardest part of my job is having to learn everything on my own, when the store manger does not want to  assist or train me. The part I enjoyed the most at work, is working with other employees and helping customers."
good,"There are rapid changes going on in the company.  Many people are losing their jobs.  Management is shifting.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with people.  Customers and employees do not like change, so they resist it."
good,"I come in (10pm) and count the safe first to make sure the safe is balanced and bands are correct. I do the rest of my End of Day procedures and after doing so I go over tasks we are to do with my staff. We all have cleaning duties so we do those first, straighten the entire store, then start on the task list. Often I would have to assist the pharmacist in the pharmacy when It gets busy or on an as needed basis and check in vendors. We stop everything and clean up at 6am, then straighten again. My employees are back at there post at 7am and we all get off at 8am. (I'm usually working constantly until then)"
good,"A typical day at work would start with filling more than 350 scripts a day. Solving all kinds of insurance issues, including workers' comp"
good,"Typical day as a SBA at Walgreens. Reviewing department for improvements, merchandising department, customer service and aiding customers, ordering for the department, departmental resets and revisions, organizational of assets and ordering, checking in vendors, following company code of conduct and following HIPPA."
good,Fun work environment and easy job. Management is good just kind of
good,"Working on salary was great but all the lawsuits in CA. made my position a non-exempt employee. Good work culture and environment, just upper management need to recognize the talent they have before they lose their employees."
good,It was an ok job. I learned how to run a photo lab. I also learned about prescription drugs.
good,"Ok place to work. Most management at my store didn't really care about most of the employees, heavy favoritism. No real chance for promotion when you start at the bottom. Co-workers were the best part. Made time go by faster. Good starter job."
good,"My personal experience at the South Euclid Walgreen's Pharmacy was absolutely fantastic. The store and staff were polite, competent, and professional. I loved my six-week externship. When it comes to Walgreen's Corporate, however, I cannot say the same. To keep a long story short, I was offered a Pharmacy Technician position at a different Walgreen's. After a 3-week interview, drug test, and background test process, AND after having successfully completed all of these things for the original externship, I was rejected due to an already disclosed misdemeanor. Extremely disappointing. Unfortunately the wonderful and positive experience I had with the South Euclid Walgreen's is overshadowed by this letdown from 'corporate'."
good,great company to work for if you looking for entry level experience but job stability is changing and there looking for lower wage candidates
good,-A typical work day is all about customer service.
good,"Specialty Pharmacy, mail order setting. You don't have to deal with the public. Processing, Running Insurance claims and filling and shipping the prescriptions out."
good,"i am a current employee. i have 9 years with the company as a pharmacy technician. the pay has been caped at about $2 above what other companies are starting at. there is no possibility to advance unless you want to leave the pharmacy and become an assistant manager. the benefits have gotten worse, the vacation has be restructured and there is no Christmas bonus. the company acts as if they can replace a veteran pharmacy technician with a new graduate..and they make sure you know it. i know of several pharmacy technicians with more than 5 years at walgreens that are looking for jobs now. we are tired of knowing that we arent valued. with the pay structure as it is we will actually lose money each year as the cost of living goes up and we do not get raises. walgreens no longer cares about its skilled labor."
good,I met alot of nice people such as customers and coworkers. I developed communication skills by interactions with customers. I handle money daily and learned about inventory and how to order items for the store. I am also able to multitask with answering phone calls and serving customers.
good,It is a retail job you can see and hear about a lot of different people
good,"Walgreens is not a bad place to start out. They don't demand anything unreasonable from you, but they do try a lot of suggestive selling and asking people to donate to charities. They vary greatly in the amount of hours they are allowed to schedule, having me feel not very stable in the amount of hours i will receive every week."
good,"I coached many eager AE's in the field. That was an amazing experience. Met with their patients, provided educational orrportunities."
good,Average intake of between 400 and 700 prescriptions per day. A very fast paces enviroment.I liked this because I felt very productive everyday. My co-workers were very helpful and friendly. I learned so much about medications and the benefits for patients. The hardest part of the day is that sometimes you didn't even get a lunch break because it was so busy. Can be very tiring.
good,Answered high volume of calls.
good,"Fast paced , Long days / nights...good co workers. Drug /convenience store atmosphere"
good,I worked as a beauty advisor. The deparment is very boring and never have any assignments to do and I love to be busy and always stay working. I always asked to be trained in another department but they always wanted me to be in that department even when they where short handed in the other departments.
good,okay place to work for a kid or retiree but if you cant take rude cranky customers do not apply
good,"Walgreen is a company that has a lot of potential to be in the top 5 as for being a company to work for, during my time here i just saw the company moving in another direction that wasn't what i was used to when i first started with them in 2004. It's a company with high expectations and competitive working environment and will profit every year."
good,I enjoyed being a positive role model for the kids and helping the one's who didn't have a father figure in their lives.
good,"management and co workers have good relationships, fast paced"
good,"A day starts at 9:15 pm, I then have to count the safe and pull all registers, (eight of them) and balance them out for the next day, this usually takes about 3 hours, then I have to count the safe again. I then engage the service clerk(s) for the evening about all task's. I then begin my resets/revisions which involve moving products, shelves and inventory using a planogram, a picture and text about what to do. I will do this until about 5:00 am, and then I count the registers to ensure they have to correct amount of money in them, clean the restrooms and straighten the products on all the store shelves. When my relief worker get's in at 7:00 am, I engage them about the events of the previous night and any information that they may need to know for the following workday."
good,Assisting the customer in any way.
good,"I worked overnight, was kept busy with customers and watching the front end. Bad part I was not allowed to get away from cash register to do any straighting of shelves to keep the store looking good. For the customers."
good,Walgreens is an exellent company to work for. They offer wonderful benefits for their team members. During the transition phase their are alot of new chages to come and their all for the good.
good,"Day usually consist of preparing medication, stocking medication, talking to the customers, helping the customers with their insurance or what ever help they may need. My days usually went smooth."
good,"Have a great store manager, but when he's away nothing gets done. A typical day for me would be resetting the shelves now. The co-workers are great, very enjoyable, if they are doing their job. Hardest part is worrying about safety the entire time. The best part is when we have a lot to do and I get to keep my hands busy."
good,Great place to start off at. Not so good if you want to move ahead.
good,"The company compensates well but the schedule sucks and makes it very hard to balance a work/home balance. With one full weekend off a month and a manager that makes sure you close before your day off and open the next day, it makes it hard to plan anything and you feel like you are always there. Can be a stressful job but you do get to work with some great employees."
good,Walgreen's expects you to be more than perfect and in order to get a promotion you have have to be there so long by the time you get it your half dead.
good,Taking and processing customer prescriptions. I started my pharmacy technician career here and am greatful for all the lessons my coworkers and managers taught me. The stores I worked at were full of great people. The hardest part was dealing with irate customers and the company cutting back hours and hindering my growth. The best part was the customers who I grew to know and love.
good,"Like to learn about pharmacy industry, always have activities for employees"
good,"The advancement became non-existent at the economic down-turn which is what I was seeking. I stuck it out, but noticed an awkward trend: they tend to hire from the bottom of the barrel when there are better employees to choose from. That left me picking up after the slack (by goodness there was a LOT)."
good,"My experience with Walgreens was a frustrating experience. In the two years there as an assistant manager, I was transferred three times, each time to a more incompetent store manager. Most of the store managers I saw were not good at the job, preferring to stay in the office instead of leading my example."
good,A typical day at work was logging on to the computer and opening all the applications that would be used throughout the day. After you were signed on a third party rejection would enter your queue and the quota was to resolve these rejections in 48 seconds. Once a third party rejection was resolved another rejection would populate on your screen. I learned alot about pharmacy benefits plans and I learned alot about medications. Most enjoyable part of the day was making quota and still providing great customer service. Then hardest part was the constant work schedule changes. I felt management could have done alot better job at training and coaching.
good,"Co-workers were absolutely amazing. Most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the clients and the angry clients. I have a way with words that seems to sooth them. I was trained in all areas of the company from sales, customer service, insurance, claimes, and many more. Management had a lot of turn over. They didn't belive in the way that the company was ran. A typical day of work was meeting quotas for inbound and outbound calls, claims, dealing with insurance companies, and so on. There was little to no room for error."
good,"typical day: 5 min meeetings, daily list of tasks for the store, back and forth thru the store doing customer returns, exchanges, price checks, bathroom entry, change request, tender counts, vendors, friendly jokes with the staff, it's usually one manager on duty"
good,when i first got to walgreens I loved it. The employees were great and it was my home away from home. they dont know how to balance home life. i cant work the swing shifts like i used to. i have to do day shift. I go to work in pain everyday because the floors are awful. they took away tricare so its hard to get people in the door. the asst. managers got demoted so it makes me feel like i cant advance in this company like we use to. we have a great managment staff within the store
good,"Very busy all shifts, filling perscriptions,ordering out of stock medicine and specialty medinces, we are directly linked with all insurances and there is always Dur rejects,refill to soons,some insurance companies will not pay for 3 month supplies even though Walgreen's offers them.Ihave learned medicaide and medicare insurance, the co-workers are all super freindly and very helpful. The hardest part of the job is also having to be a cashier. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everything works like clockwork"
good,Did not like it Fill doctors scripts and customer service. Cashiering and inventory.
good,"A typical day in the office consist of working with upper management setting daily, monthly, and weekly goals. Working with HR and the Quality Team on constant improvements of daily operations to maximize business and opportunities. Handling monthly employee audits, suggesting improvements or address excel points in a positive manner. I also deal with any issues that are related to patient care and customer service. The most enjoyable part of my day is assisting with training and development of new employees. We work in a fast paced environment and I enjoy whenever new hires catch on and have fun with what we doing on the daily basis. My job is fun and we are very productive."
good,Same thing throughout the day. Not a lot to learn and know. Advancement with the company is not anything that as an employee will have get any benefit from. The management does not seem to care much and does not show enough appreciation for a valuable worker. I just want more for myself and not getting anything from this job. Want to have more and to advance in my career I want.
good,any pharmaceutical retail store you work at you will have a horrible experience with customers. Even the Pharmacists whom have a doctorate degree get disrespected.
good,"I have learned to supervise multiple employees while managing store operations. It's a difficult task to do both, but i welcome the challenge. The hardest part of my job is adapting to the schedule changes and being needed in more than one part of the store at the same time. The best part of my job is being active on my feet."
good,"involved in communities, limited room for advancement, not much for work life advancement weekends are important part of the schedule, some health benefits for fulltime workers, holidays are also very important since most walgreens are open everyday of the year you will be sacrificing them. for hardworkers who want to advance in their career this may be a dead end for you, unless you are a cashier or photo tech who has a bachelors and would like to invest atleast 4 years in the company then you may have a chance at management."
good,Not Applicable/ Would rather not say. it is very hard to progress in the company. There are a lot of hoops to jump through.
good,Walgreen's is open to more advancement but it is not that easy to get it. The people I work with are fun to work with.
good,"had to give up holidays, birthdays, family events & vacations. most weeks work 60+ hours. most all work placed on management with little to no help. having said that the training program is awesome!"
good,"Walreens is a good company, with good customer service. I can't really say much about their benefits plans because I didn't have any benefits. I was a part-time employee."
good,good to costumiers and team building. Managers are easy to talk to. Company has multiple destinations so if moving you could transfer to one closer to home.
good,"If you’re a pharmacy tech in retail it’s probably as good as it gets in terms of pay and flexibility. Positive experience with most pharmacists and colleagues. "
good,"This job had good pay and the schedule was good, they worked really well with college students. But the location I worked at was unprofessional and at times I didn't feel safe at work. Some of the managers were really rude."
good,the Pay and hours was Good but the management and shift leads are the reason I decided to quit everything else besides that I enjoyed working in Walgreens
good,I rather not comment about my work experience at Walgreens.  I've experienced a management environment that was unfair.  I'd rather keep my work experience to myself.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of entering prescriptions, calling insurances companies, assisting patients with general questions about their medications and manually filling prescriptions."
good,"The pay is above average and the benefits are outstanding. The problem is, there is too much emphasis on shareholder value so the company cuts costs wherever they can which translates to having to do more work with less resources. It has become very stressful working for a company that cares so much about profits, but has a shoplifting policy that allows for thousands of lost profits per week per store."
good,"Job can be demanding at times. If you get the right manager, there is room for advancement. Company has made a lot of changes in recent years, so keeping up can be difficult as all employees are adjusting, including higher ups. Customer satisfaction is always priority. There are plenty of locations and you can always find someone willing to work with you on hours."
good,"I work in one of the busier stores. Luckily management and the staff are super friendly and take in new associates like they're family. Since it is a well known company they do expect your best work and that you're not just there for a paycheck, and most the time they'll act like its a life or death situation which can get old quick. If you slack at any time you will get a coaching card. The best part of the job is the coworkers and benefits (if you're full time) along with the holiday pay after a year! I'd recommend anyone to apply, especially if you have no experience. The registers are super easy to learn and at first management is super easy going, also everyone is always willing to help if you have any questions."
good,"A typical day at work was usually a stressful one.  They began cutting hours and requesting more of us technicians, thus taking a lot of our focus off of customer service and forcing us to focus more on meeting quotas.  When I first started working at Walgreens, customer service was the most important.  Now it's all about how much money they can make and how much of their budget can be cut.  The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with our patients.  The different stores I've worked at had an amazing pharmacy team.  We all worked together to make our workplace fun and enjoyable, despite us being treated like slaves.  I highly believe that the pay rate didn't coincide with the amount of work and stress we had to deal with on a daily basis."
good,this company does not pay well enough for all that they require employees to do.  the company is supposed to give Excellant customer service.. but with the company cutting hours all the time.. the customers arent receiving that excellant customer service.  They also dont give their employees fair pay in conjunction with their experience and cost of living these days.  They higher ups and owners just want the money in their pockets and screw the help that make the money for them.  Corporation dont appreciate who helps them make money anymore.  It's all about the money for them.  Screw the customer and screw the employees.. if we quit.. they know that they can be replaced at a cheaper pay rate.
good,Walgreen's is a great work environment for people looking to get back into the work force or someone just starting. They offer a decent starting pay and the tasks are simple depending on your job description.
good,"Walgreens is a great place for experience. if you're new to pharmacy, this is a great retail experience. you are exposed to many diifult tasks as well as some difficult customers. This job prepares you for the stressors of Hospital (inpateint) pharmacy. I don't belieive i would have been able to work in any hospital before i had worked at walgreens."
good,"This job is very boring and tedious. You always have to seem busy even if there is literally nothing to do and you simply can't stop for a break. Customers can be extremely rude and there are way too many codes and rules to remember about each product. As an associate, you have to be able to take on many responsibilities some you did not even apply for."
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting various customers, restocking, cleaning the store stock room, or maintaining the register. Each store has it's own culture and it is easy to assimilate to each."
good,"My experience with this company was that they had little to no actual consideration for their retail employees. I was encouraged, occasionally even required, to go above and beyond what would be reasonably expected of me in the course of my daily work for the benefit of the company's bottom line. This company, like many others these days, deliberately gives its stores less man-hours of available pay than is actually needed to properly run and manage their locations, forcing their workers to have to spend days usually allowed off to cover for others suffering from life events. The pay was minimal unless you'd either been there a long time or were a senior member of management.  Not even being on the job for six years allowed me to reach a pay grade that would have allowed me to live on my own, forcing me to return to my parents' house after starting here. And there was no consideration given for anyone dealing with mental health issues. The general corporate policy, though technically unofficial, was that a lack of customer complaints and a surplus of customer compliments was more important than the health and well-being of its own employees."
good,"Overall, it can be a good company to work for. With the right management, you can accomplish a lot working as a team. With policy and procedure changes frequently, made it more challenging."
good,"I loved pharmacy, but too fast paced for me to keep up or apply my pharmacy skills. Customers and staff were very nice, but I felt like it was ""fast food drive through with prescription drugs""."
good,"Do not let this company over work you and not pay you, because they will. I was very excited at first, but management changed for the worse. I was offered so many job opportunities and promises of elevating, however, it never happened. I did pave my own way and even that felt like a dead end. The company just doesn't really back up what they claim they represent when it comes to the treatment of its employees."
good,As in most retail pharmacy Walgreens tend to cut hours and expect more.  Quantity is promoted over quality and suggestions fall of deaf ears.  Its all about profit for the company.   Many locations are behind all the time and works who can not keep up are still on the job because there is not enough time allocated to training.
good,"This was a very physical job. By the end of your workday, you felt as though you ran 10 miles. The management was not very helpful,  and we were constantly getting our hours cut."
good,Besides someone not being able to multitask and being accused of something forcing me out of the company it wasn't all bad while I was there for ten months. Didn't even make full time or a year
good,"I really enjoyed working for Walgreens. I thought the job was simple, I didn't dread having to go there every day like most jobs people have. "
good,Custimer and co workers unappreciative on a daily basis. Was asked to work all the time knowing I had 2 little kids at home. I found it a hard environment to try to raise a family in
good,Not enough hours-needed full-time frequently had my hours cut.  Easy job with nice customers.  Would have liked on the job training to move to management
good,If Walgreens paid their employees more for the amount of stuff we deal with it wouldn’t be as bad. The customers and problems are ever abundant but the compensation is not.
good,"Walgreens is a good place for someone with little experience or no degree. With enough hard work and dedication you can advance to a Shift Lead and much later down the line an Assistant Manager or even Store Manager. "
good,The treatment of employees has been on the decline. Constantly raising goals without providing a higher budget to accomplish. Not a very rewarding career field.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens includes helping with customer questions, using the cash drawer after checking items out, putting away truck to fill inventory and printing photo orders."
good,You need to be really good with customers to work here. It is a really fast paced job with high turnover. The managers have high quotas for surveys and flu shots.
good,"Started with the company as a shift lead and was promoted 3 times up to store manager."
good,was a very good work place just not very flexible when it came to scheduling and it just didnt balance ell with my home and work life never had much time with my kids.
good,Some people are hands down rude in this world. Great job for a kid to get use to the world because you’ll see all types of people at the counter.  Just wouldn’t take me off check-out and they saw i wasn’t good at communicating. Just wanted to stock and work in the back but it never happened.
good,"Good job for a high schooler. Not sure how the older adults were surviving on the small pay checks. Left because I felt unsafe, store was constantly getting robbed. However I was cross trained as a customer service associate and someone who was able to work in the pharmacy, so it looks great on my resume (:"
good,"My days were between 8 and 10 hours, starting at 5 or 6am. Learning wasn't really ""important"" persay unless you were wanting to work there 10+ years. Although i did learn how to better communicate with people which was big since im not a big people person. It was difficult to work there because there wasn't really anything enjoyable."
good,"The area I worked at was disgusting, the customers got pretty mouthy and tried to get physical. Managers would take the customers side even when they were in the wrong, just to get a good survey score. Lack of communication and no help in the pharmacy. Certain coworkers whine about being there and complain about working nights when they supposedly have “open availability”. So much stress at that place, it was cool at first but started becoming too much."
good,"The management there is not the greatest, there are 2 main general managers and the rest are ""shift leaders"". They don't communicate very well and they like to exaggerate about things to make everyone seem like they're doing something that they shouldn't, for example, they have asked me to work on a day i was already scheduled off even though during that week i had only been given 2 off and when i said i couldn't they told me that if i didn't then they couldn't promise me a lot of hours the following week even though the following week they still had scheduled me for 36 hours so they lied and exaggerated just to guilt me into working on my day off. they also expect you to complete way too many tasks in one shift even though usually there is never more than 3-4 people working at once and if there is, they're all doing different things and aren't helping you."
good,Walgreens was a great place for me to start my career in pharmacy. Because there were many technicians when I first started it was easy to learn and better my skill set. Over the years they cut hours and shifts back more and more until there was hardly no one there but the patient volume increased. Once I perfected my routine and maximized my time the best and it was still not enough to match patient demand. I knew that the stress level was not worth the lackluster benefits.
good,The job experience will be as good as your manager and superiors. Hardest part of the job is the upper management really dont know whats going on. So there is a new policy almost every two weeks.
good,Never know when your hours will be cut. Always under staffed. Corporate keeps piling knew work on top of what we are already doing. It's a number game.
good,"good place to work as a starter job, but while the employees are great, the work place is freezing cold which makes extended shifts nearly unbearable without a jacket even in summer."
good,We was rite aid and I transfer to Walgreens so it’s okay but I love my boss they was great to me they understand me with my kids and all I been with them g for  3 year and it been great
good,I was at Walgreens for about four months. I was there after Rite Aid closed. The best part about Walgreens was seeing my favorite customers from Rite Aid.
good,Coworkers were nice managers not soo much but if you showed that you were a hard worker u got the hours that you wanted if you are given a task you are expected to complete it
good,"Good team to work with, Do not like the direction and the current culture of the company.  Stores are understaffed, upper management has unrealistic expectations."
good,Pharmacy staff are treated better and advance more in their career. Only decide to work here if you plan to go into the behind the pharmacy counter. You have to stay here for years to get any type of advancement in your career. Good part time job to have as a student. They were accomodating to my class schedule.
good,Great company to work with not only a job but a career can come from this as well. It's a stressful job when you begin but in all it was a learning opportunity.
good,After 4 years at Walgreens I was only making 10 an hour. They run stores with very little staff and your often left with no help on a shift. Management only cared about what saved them money and did not care for their employees on a personal level. Not all stores are ran like this though. All depends on the manager.
good,"I loved my store manager and quite a few of my coworkers. I left when my store manager had retired because I had grown close to him and after a while, he was the only reason I was staying. The district manager was terrible and always complained about our store manager, who was able to keep the store running. Now that he has left its gone downhill and only one person that I worked with is still there."
good,"Everything there was messy. The store manager was great but moving down, it was terrible. Switched them out too much. Loved the customers, even the messy ones lol .. just the work environment and the people could've been better at communicating and keeping things professional for a comfortable work place. Overall though I was able to learn a lot and develop some great work ethic and skills. I personally had a lot of chances and opportunities to add to myself but that was mostly taking initiative to improve my everyday work day because I loved what I did. Appreciative for growth, I am grateful to be Pursuing an opportunity that is healthier and beneficial for my growth."
good,"The workplace culture broadcast to employees is overshadowed by the focus on cost reduction, removing humans from interacting with customers, and an unspoken expectation to always be connected, always on, and always available, 27/7/365. Resources are overwhelmed and exhausted with large projects driven by high level leadership; and mid-level management is unbending when smaller projects are stalled due to bandwidth constraints."
good,"Not enough tech hours to get the job done . No overlap with pharmacist for them to get the patients out on a timely matter . Adding more task to the techs and pharmacist each week , some of it is not necessary ,"
good,It started out as a good experience to work there but poor management made it a dreadful workplace. Once new store manager came the store became like a dark hole. The employees stop smiling and enjoying the work day.
good,I enjoy working at Walgreens but they only have so much room for growth. It is a dependable place and you do get a decent discount. They even sometimes extend your discount to friends and family
good,Working hours unpredictable. The hardest part was not having steady hours do to the fluctuation of the time of the year and working the days when the truck came.
good,"Walgreen's was a great company when i started, not so much nowadays. Maybe its the economy in general but hours , pay , and positions are being cut fairly regularly. i stayed for so long because they really worked with my schedule and i made alot of true friends there"
good,"Managers didn't want to lose me; my health was my issue. Why others who worked there much longer could be out sick; I gave them Dr""s notes. Did they expect me to stay and work with nosebleeds!¡!!!???"
good,"Focus more on the numbers than the staffs.  It's face pace, no break, and very stressful.  The benefit was good before but now everything is cut including your ret ins."
good,"Walgreens is not as good as it used to be. Expect to be a cashier that has to run the front, photo, and cos. Corporate has really cut hours, so you'll be honestly doing the job of 2+ people. My advice, don't stay in front end too long. Try to work in the pharmacy. I loved my coworkers and managers, but corporate really asks a lot for the lack of employees to get it done. I loved helping the customers, especially in photo."
good,"I have been a pharm tech for over 5 years. I'm over-qualified, but yet no promotion. Cheap pay and rotten customers. We get paid little but deal with a lot of bs from customers blaming us for their insurance companies not covering their drugs and their drs not writing them the drugs they want instead of the patient advocating for themselves. They harasses instead. Take initiative and stop being a lazy bum-go call your dr and insurance company! Not hard at all since we are all always on our phones. I have been training new pharmacists fresh out of school they can't even identify the different drug classifications, but yet they're making more money than me and i'm doing their job. Figure that out. There is zero room to move around internally in the company for pharmacy. Such a disgrace!"
good,At Walgreen I don’t know if it was because I’m new but the employees some of them is not very friendly they thinks they knows more than you do they don’t want to answer question you may have it is stressful working among coworkers like that
good,Enjoyed my time. Great experience   Unfair termination with manager.  Built great relationships. Had great training through district office. Great experience with pharmacy staff
good,okay Walgreens was an okay place to work because it was busy at most times and slow at other times the customers are very rude and don’t care the environment was okay but honestly it just depends on which Walgreens you work at unfortunately for me I didn’t work at the best one
good,Work there was ok needs a lot of help and more workers needs to pay more and hours are to long for a store this small . And needs more Structure with management.
good,Walgreens is good and bad. Most of the people are great. The customers are mostly great. The police's are not great. The benefits are good and bad. But I have ran into the bad. Having a work place Injury and collecting any due pay like work comp or temporary disability can take a very long time over 30 days just to get a normal pay check. The dress code is bla. The vests are not cool at all.
good,"I was a manager for Walgreens 15 years.  It started out great but as the company got larger it became impossible.  Every year the budget gets smaller and task became larger.  Being salary I would have to work long hours.  This caused me to miss a lot of activities with my kids.  In the last 3 years I started having nerve issues, depression and anxiety attacks.  Since leaving these issues have resolved."
good,I wouldn't recommend this type of job if you want to love on your own. No benefits and no opportunities to advance. I did not like working there and don't recommend it
good,"The location in Oxford, Ms is a very easy, laid back job. My issue was that i applied to work as a pharmacy cashier and when I got hired, my position was changed to customer service associate without my permission. After a month of working there, I still did not work in the pharmacy."
good,I learned valuable pharmacy skills and was able to participate in a buyout of a pharmacy chain and teach those employees the Walgreens way of doing things
good,"Walgreens is a really great company to work for, it just depends on who you get as your management, I had a store manager who seems to only do what was best for her store and made her store look good to the district.  I had a great shift leads who poured into me and helped me learn and become one my own. I left due to flexibility and not being about to have my weekends off as well as not being able to attend church as I had asked in the past."
good,"Everyone knows that change is a part of life and business, yet the changes at Walgreens are overwhelming and consistent. There used to be help to get tasks done and care for customers but not anymore. There is no care about store appearance, product availability or adequate staffing anymore. All of the changes push out the tenure employees and make taking care of the customers nearly impossible"
good,"Working for Walgreens has been helpful in my Esthetican career. It has given me the opportunity to bren somewhat creative a d I have learned a lot. I am excellent at what I do as a Beauy Consultant"
good,"I learned to work with other people, customer service and greatings . Stocking boxes or items . Answering phone calls from customers . I enjoyed dressing up in Halloween for the kids ."
good,The store i worked at terminated me for asking for paternity leave when my wife was due to have our daughter. I cant speak for other stores but my overall experience was very bad.
good,"You need alot of patience to work with the public, especially in pharmacy. It really depends on the management and co workers to make or break your day. But upper management at corporate make new rules every day but have never worked a day in their life behind that counter. They really dont listen to us low folk."
good,"I Been with the company years. They use to care about the employees. They use to care about how long we’ve been there. I’ve been with the company 7+ years. "
good,"The job is tough, but your boss and your subordinates matter. On a solid team. You will do well. Or a poor team, the job is murder. They are leading the charge to switch to a non engagement policy over theft, because bad press is generally worse than a loss incident."
good,"On most days, work load is super demanding. Pay is great, all things considered, but the environment is very stressful. Management is very poor and almost nothing gets done."
good,After 5yrs of going above and beyond my duties. Thinking I had the respect of my management team. I  suddenly find out . I  was only used till  wasn't  needed.
good,"I work as a cashier and customer service rep. It can be extremely busy or at times slow paced. I'm not taught any other functions of the store, I only do the register and think thats because of my older age. Every young hire learns all aspects of the position and store. Management is poor and does not communicate - no encouragement and praise, just criticism and complaints. We manage to work as a team but no camaraderie. The hardest part of my job is only the lack of hours which can be as low as 13 hours per week. Management and sales leads take all the hours and the reps get the scraps. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers. They're all great no matter their mood. I love to make their visit a great one."
good,"When I first started the company was amazing, Benefits were good, team engagement, and I wanted to go to work."
good,Hours at this job were not the best.  I knew that go in but the swing shifts were awful.  I would not recommend this job to anyone with a family.  It was good for a season in life.
good,"The job was busy but gave me discipline. It taught me how to coach and help people be positive and enthused. The job has rules that haven't changed for a long time, but the company is always trying new things and getting behind different initiatives."
good,"Job was decent the pay was good . But our leaders were acting more like 2 year olds our store manager had the audacity to tell women to wear makeup cause they didn't look good enough,  and tell them their significant other must have been drunk to get with them. Work barely got done because leadership pushed it off on the employees who already have a huge list . Overall after 3 years I walked out cause I couldn't take 1 more minute of it everyone constantly complains but when you try to fix things they get mad"
good,I would work 6-8 hours a day. I worked every department in the store and learned a lot there. the management was the worst the store manager wasn't in the interview room and didn't like me first time meeting me. so much to do with close to no time to finish the work load the best part of this job was moving and learning other departments
good,If you can stand the monotonous and repetitive work. Then you will have no problem here. But if you're someone who can't just stand still this isn't the right fit.
good,"Corporate ties your hands behind your back, expectations are ridiculous for what you can accomplish."
good,Management is constantly changing and so do the hours. It is hard to plan ahead when you don’t have guaranteed hours. Most team members just go to pharmacy or manager just to be able to live decent.
good,Horrible management and corporate. It's not about what you know but who you know. Pay is decent but management knows as much as regular employees. Always keep copies of any papers you sign.
good,"Walgreen's is not a good place to work.  They gave me a 10 cent raise yearly.  I started out making 4.00/hr. and in the 9 years I was with them and after TWO promotions, I left making 9.60/hr.  Only $5.60 worth of raises in 9 years.   Management was difficult."
good,Assistant manager was no good had her groupies. the store started to have way to many turn arounds the more the lazier. Store cooler never stocked most of the time you couldnt get help in the front had friday meetings that only a few got to attend. Customers could never find someone on the floor as front cashier I had to leave customers at the front to take care of the floor. They were all in the office gossiping when the manager was out then ran out as soon as the seen him walk in. Nobody could really count money back and that's disrespectful to alot of the customers. The manager was really nice compared to the first but never said anything to these lazy people. I truly loved my customers. I learned that you couldn't say anything to people in way that their feeling would get hurt. Being the eldest their assit. manager did her best to make it harder to stay with her threats.
good,"The job itself was easy and required minimal energy with the exception of holidays, management quality was generally low I think because of how ignorant the work politics was. I had periods of working both full and part time, so I had some flexibility. Benefits were great when I had them, I think if I could go back I work given that I could be paid more then I was as a teenager. so all in all I would recommend this to others especially starting out, gave me good money handling experience."
good,"High volume, constant patient interaction. Giving immunizations, encouraging patients to fill 90 day supply. Training technicians. MTM therapy management."
good,Walgreens isn't the company it used to be. Upper management never care for their employees. Pay is minimal for all the work we are assigned. Corporate keeps cutting hours so we work with skeleton crews.. yet they expect top performance.
good,Walgreens was a good retail pharmacy job if all you ever want as a pharmacist is to fill prescriptions as fast as possible. Coworkers were wonderful but management has a hard time supporting the staff when it comes to workload balancing and workload management.
good,"I enjoyed working for the Pharmacy Department at Walgreens and I also enjoyed helping patients with their prescriptions and billing insurances. Reading, typing up, filling Rx prescriptions, counting pills and compounding."
good,"Management was a litle out of tune especially night crew, but for the most part my experience working for Walgreen's was a positive step on my job skills."
good,"Honestly only took this job because the convenience of location, it's very close to my house. The management is horrible, bad attitude and take no consideration for basic retail staff."
good,"They like to promote from with in. Typically you spend your day helping customers around the store while trying to get multiple other projects completed. "
good,"I learned how to effectively work together with a team of coworkers, time management and to always make the customers happy.  a typical work day is very busy but never the same.  I enjoyed being a pharmacy technician because I enjoy helping people and making a difference in the lives of others. I believe my true calling is to be at service to others, make people smile and bring joy into their lives everyday possible.  I enjoy meeting new people and to bring a positive attitude to work everyday that I can make others feel happy and excited about their life."
good,"It's a nice place to work, however; you can't really count on your co-workers showing up to do their shifts.  There is too much turn-over with co-workers, so every day you show up for work, you never know what you will be doing to cover the day's workload.  I do like the customers we have and I have meet a few great co-workers that make my day great.  I like to stay upbeat and positive, don't like complaining co-workers, they tend to bring me down."
good,i worked there for over 3 years and the raises were pathetic only .10 or .25 at a time and then come to find out my last year there they decieded within the company to bring in new hires and pay them what i was making after the years there it was like a slap in the face and although i missed one day over the allotment due to a recent back surgery i was let go they were not willing to work with me to try to get back to doing what i used to do which took time after my surgery
good,I enjoy the Pharmacy technician position however the management of the store is less than desirable. There is constant bickering and negativity in an already stressful environment. It makes training and working unpleasant most days.
good,"I worked at a Walgreens where the pharmacists were nice but the techs were mean. I felt bad for leaving but I was stressed out with drive thru and being too busy to provide the best customer service. We were just too busy to follow up with doctors offices, insurance claims, customers,  hospitals etc. The customers were always frustrated."
good,No room for advancement but slow paced relaxed environment. Not hectic but truck day was a real pain. Moving up is difficult and the corporate ladder is comepletely messed up.
good,"Decent beginner job.  Not much chance to move up if not a favorite.  Employees are treated fair, pay is low.  Be prepared to work late off the clock at times because there is no allowed overtime so you must clock out to avoid OT, but you must finish your project or shift."
good,There was no team work. Management was terrible and couldn’t follow an availability. There was no encouragement for improvement in the company and was on able to move up the ladder within the company.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to start with customer service. If your a fast learner, great you'll exceed in the business fast. When you are first hired be sure to ask ALLOT of questions when being trained by another walgreens CSR."
good,"Very micro managed , very few hours for labor, if you have an issue that you refer to hr do not expect much support, very long waiting period to get your own store ,"
good,"I am currently unhappy in my job at Walgreens, so I'm not too fond of writing them a review. I have found that the company is more interested in their bottom line than how that bottom line effects their employees. I work with some of the hardest working people I know, but with budget cuts keeping staff low, it is impossible to stay ahead of the demands. The people I've worked with have been great, but the company itself needs to address some things before they lose all the talent in the stores."
good,WORST JOB ! Other locations are not as bad but my location is one of the busiest in Ohio. The customers are rude and impatient and were constantly busy.  Customers steal a lot and theres nothing we can do about it or you’ll get fired. The people I work with are great but management is trash they do not communicate anything and they’ll say there’s flexible and fair scheduling but it’s not. The people with seniority or favorites get the desired hours.
good,Expected too much of the nightcrew during holiday season. Left each morning feeling like I would have a breakdown. Sometimes left vague or contradicting instructions on what we were supposed to accomplish during the night. No security during high theft times.
good,"Management that I had decided that my expertise in customer service and work ethic meant that he could promote people with little or no experience ahead of me because he didn't want to allow me to leave the floor."
good,"Walgreens has been a fair job for me the past year but over time I have found that my treatment progressively gets worse over time, it seems as if they are testing to see how far they can push me before I'll quit.. slowly progressing to more and more bad scheduling (10-12 days with no days off in a row... I am currently scheduled to work 4 weeks full time with no 2 days off in a row, split days the entire way.. I was told when I got hired that there was a policy against this but when I questioned it my manager told me ""oh the law just says you can't work more than 7 days in a week.""... I was like.. Yea.. you can't work more than 7 days in a week, because there is only 7 days in a week.) worse and worse treatment over time.. I have begun looking for a new job when I previously had thought this could be my career. So when you start out expect to be treated good, if they think you'll be long term they start treating you badly because they think they have you trapped at that point."
good,"The Walgreens Manager position used to be a great job. The job used to make us feel like we were really running our own business and they allowed us to order and set up our stores our way. Upper management at that time really wanted you to succeed and the encouraged and supported you. But now it is much different. The Store Manager job is extremely stressful and we have all learned to hate our jobs.  The company reduced our payroll hours and expects more production and better customer service scores with less people.  Salaries have been cut as well and so they expect people to do more work, with less help, for less money.  There are a few really good DMs, but there are some that are really untrustworthy. In the last several years we continue to fear further cutbacks, layoffs, and the turnover is so bad that we just can't keep good people."
good,"Walgreens should focus not only on extraordinary customer care, but on extraordinary employee care. Many employees are overworked, promised compensation and bonuses that don’t happen, and under appreciated."
good,Do to the changes in Insurance reimbursements and the change in the retail Pharmacy market place the pay for high performers has been  stagnate. With continuing restructuring or upper and middle management upward movement within California has become harder to come by.
good,"When I worked in the pharmacy, we were a good team and all worked well with each other. My pharmacy manager was a good guy but was willing to help teach you whatever you needed to know. However each location varies in how the pharmacy is ran."
good,Seemed liked no one wanted to be there. Typical day at work was to help out the customer to the best of our ability. I learned how to multitask in a somewhat rush environment.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work in, but with hard times achieving company goals a hard to meet especially since management expects you to work with less manpower"
good,"Provides a decent starting point for work in a retail setting. However, recent changes in upper management have made things harder for employees who don't have much a plan to move forward in the company."
good,A very stressful and fast paced environment where you are pushed to give your best. No time to relax as customers as well as managers are very demanding
good,"Heavy lifting, lots of customers and fast paced environment. Lots of responsibility and tasks that needed to be completed by end of day."
good,a typical day at work was at a very fast but maintaining accuracy. i enjoyed the pace. corporate structure protects employees but also makes it a less personal caring environment regarding supervisors and management
good,"I enjoyed working with customers and other employees, but disapproved of management and quit. (This form required more characters than exist in my report.)"
good,"The culture was very traditional - the workplace was distinctly where you work only (vs. rec areas nowadays), and the managers decide what the employees should do. (This was not necessarily negative.) "
good,"Management at Walgreens was totally unfair unless they liked you, or If you were in the 'click', the company was great to work for at 1 time but over the years everything about it totally changed"
good,"You've got to be serious and have a good work ethic to work for Walgreens. If you are ambitious, you can rise through the ranks. People and co-workers were always friendly. Overall, a good job!"
good,Better options for a transfer from store to store. They need to learn how to treat transfer employees. Especially other employees not so much management. Less racist would be nice.
good,"Most locations in the area are very fast-paced, busy locations with overworked staff.  There is not enough help when needed, and too many quotas to fill."
good,It was fun place to work at & you get an employee discount but poor management did you wrong. Rude pharmacist treated you like trash. Good part time job tho
good,"Overall you have bad management store front and pharmacy.  If they no longer want you there , they will find ways to get rid of you with no way of proving it. Management have it made and if they mess up they get moved around."
good,"If you're an efficient worker, you always have opportunity to become more within Walgreens. Management is pretty unorganized. They pay for your pharmacy certificaion."
good,"Always have to be busy doing something if there was no customers. If there’s customers all of them had to be asked if they needed help. I didnt like how you had to ask all the customers when there was a fundraiser. It didnt matter if it was a customer that came in every day, You still had to give the whole speech."
good,"Very busy store, filling high volume prescriptions.  Filling and verified prescriptions nonstop on Monday and Friday.  It has 2 drive through windows,  it is liked fast food sometimes.  Many customers don't understand how hard we have to work inside pharmacy.  They expect us to giving medication out quick.  It is very stressful when the techs called off, we short of staff and the pharmacy is always busy.  Also, when the robot is died, we are behind the filling, we have to manual fill for all of prescriptions, it consumes a lot of our times."
good,"Stayed busy there was always something for you to do got to work independently with manager telling you step by step what to do. Learned different positions throughout the store I.e stocking, photo department"
good,They never completely trained me at my job as a Pharm Tech.  Over FIFTY hours of on-line training not completed; hence a a highly stressful position. UGH
good,"Working from home was a great opportunity however it was difficult if you needed assistance with anything. The pay was also very poor. However, I did learn a lot about pharmacy billing"
good,"atmosphere is an co-workers are friendly, store is clean and fun to work in great location also got awards for good customer services and attention to detail."
good,"I don't have any link to Walgreen's since I worked for T Box that was a Vendor to Walgreen's "
good,Its great when you first start as long as you do what they want. when it comes to you being hurt or sick they frown upon it and will guilt trip you to come in anyways. Dont get sick working here and you are fine.
good,"Every Day is a normal day,you are kind with people, some of them are kind with you, others not so much, sometimes u deal with bad days, but the staff and the management is very nice and polite, if only they pay more and give more hours will be great, is a good company but I find it really inconsistent"
good,I did get promoted with them but i just wish i didn't have to transfer stores to do it. Also management wasn't all that great. The store i was promoted to was just a really bad store based solely on location.
good,"I feel that i was mistreated with this company and very under paid. I worked there for 5 years started out making $7.50 an hour left making only $9.25. I was promised to talk about advancing to pharmacy or shift lead poisoning but it never happened. Im very disappointed in this company because i had high expectations when i started and i see that was never going to happen. Although i learned a lot, i still feel that i wasted time with this company because all my bills got behind and my health declined due to not having insurance for a few years because i couldn't afford it."
good,Walgreens is a good place to be for a 'first job' employee. You get into a routine and cultivate some useful skills while working in a team oriented environment.
good,Working at Walgreens really helped me learn how to communicate and help patients with there need. Being able to find a discount card for a patient prescription was a very fullfilling.
good,Times can be great to work and times can be a nightmare unfortunately. Hours are iffy at times due to corporate issues. Work load can vary on some occasions.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company its a good company to work for."
good,Not really happy right now working there. I want a career change. Management and corporate don't help you at all. Not a great place to work at. I wouldn't recommend working there.
good,It’s a job that mainly depends on who you work with and the neighborhood you work in. If those to aspects suck the whole experience is gonna be terrible.
good,I had a very serious injury at work but Walgreens accepted responsibility until they realized how serious it was then I needed to get a lawyer involved. Do not get hurt at work and you will be fine.
good,"I personally liked the smaller store size because it was more efficient when people need assistance or have questions because of quick turn around time. "
good,"They pay decent money for a job that anyone can learn. The benefits are good, and the friendships there are long lasting. They also have family days with free food a few times a year. Normally they have a restaurant sale food daily for break. That is where the good times end. Rates are too high. They expect you to kill yourself to make your rate. You work 10hrs with a 25 and 30 minute break, and 12hrs with a 25, 30, and 15 minute break. But if you let them use you they will ask you to work 11.5 hours so you don't get your last 15 minute break. The breaks are incredibly short considering you have to walk 3-5 minutes to get to the break room. Then add using the restroom and microwaving your food, and you end up with 10-15 minutes to eat and relax, then walk your 3-5 minutes back. The ""fresh food"" options are laughable. Half the time the card reader doesn't work. Best to bring your own meals or you might be so hungry you get sick. They don't care one bit for your home life. They can move your schedule forwards or backwards 2 hours if they want, then call a mandatory 12 hour call. EXAMPLE: One shift is 7am-5pm. The day before they can force you to come in the next day at 9am and work until 9 that night. It is a very hard place to work if you have children, attend college, or have another job. Also, I believe that to get into management or a supervisor position you simply write ""liar"" on your resume and get the job. They will lie right to your face and smile while doing it. The job itself is not that difficult. The hard part is the repetitive motions that break your body down so"
good,"its a good place to work at, but only if everyone gets along. my store manager was a racist and made it difficult for me to get things done. overall i enjoyed it but didn't like my store manager for her racist against brown people."
good,"I like working here. Normally full time hours. Pay is low, however. I like most of the people I work with and overall management is pretty good. Usually pretty busy."
good,"The neighborhood of this Walgreens made this job more interesting because of the customers. Having a friend who worked there also made it better. The management was okay. Overall, kind of a toxic environment to work in though. Walgreens' technology and some policies did not help in customer satisfaction because of slowness and a lot of things that didn't make sense in efficiency."
good,"My experience at Walgreens was a learning experience, I was placed in different positions and taught various techniques that the job required, my managers were always willing to help coach and train me if I had any questions or needed any help"
good,It was a good place to work while in school because they will work with your schedule. I really do not have any current information for this job because it was a very long time ago I was employed there.
good,"When I started out with this Company 9 years ago, there was a more familial feel. Over the years even though I am well aware of the need to stay relevant, Walgreens has concentrated more on relevancy and less on appreciating their management team. This has lead to disengagement and huge turnovers. To be fair the positive part is the team members you meet. There are some wonderful people who have been in my Walgreens circle that have become lifetime friends."
good,"upper management not connected to employee, work day depends on the managerment. I do see lots of improvement happening with the company and moving forward should be a great place to work"
good,Working at with this company was not a bad place to work. I enjoyed the customers and helping them with anything they needed. I enjoyed  helping customers.
good,"Walgreens has went through many changes in the past 6 years and consistently take away from employees to help purchase more market share. The employees are overworked and not compensated for their contribution. It is difficult to keep the employees engaged when their corporation keeps taking from them. "
good,If you get a good manager it makes things better. Walgreens has headed down a path that not many people have agreed with. They try to say we’re all about listening to our team members voice but we really don’t. There’s a lot of micro management and not being able to take blame for themselves.
good,I was given the opportunity to move into a w@h position within my year of being with the company. The company is new and has continued to strive to work towards all of there core values. With every company they have their pros and cons.
good,I say Walgreens is a wonderful place to start off with a 1st job you get to have experience and get to have opportunities but later you'll be stress out because of management
good,"It ok for high school students to work their. The job is easy and not very hard, Clock in help customers then take a lunch then go back to the floor and wait to clock out"
good,"Over my course at walgreens the management pay structure had several changes, all reducing the pay for starting managers. So friends that I was working with doing the same job as me were making substantially more than I was doing the same job."
good,Managers were friendly. Employees were like family could pay more hardest part was unloading trucks and to King shelves matching bar codes. The only problem is the amount of work that is expected for minimum wage.
good,"Walgreens is a decent place to work, if you like retail. I feel like they could train their employees and management a little better. Overall, it's a good place to work."
good,"I did not enjoy working there. At first, it was okay, but then there were more and more customers that would come up with the smallest things to get mad about. The coworkers were self-centered, although the store manager was okay. There was little communication on what is going on or what to do. There was always downtime, which was spent walking around the store doing next to nothing."
good,"I worked at the busiest store in Delaware, meaning that the store was non-stop busy. I enjoyed the fast paced environment at the start, but store managers were lacking. I was the only Lead that was responsible and a lot of the task were given to me to accomplish. You get the hours you want and more because others do not help with the load. Sad that I had to leave because others wanted to be lazy."
good,"Most of the district leaders at Walgreens are front store managers that have been promoted to district leaders. I found it difficult to convey what I thought was important information and as such, did not receive proper response."
good,"I enjoyed my time at walgreens , very fast pace environment , a little to unorganized when I was there but overall we got the job done o time and that's all that matters"
good,"Our 'office' is the server room. It is always loud and obnoxious, difficult to communicate over the phone and attend meetings. Many times we'd turn the AC off just so we could hear off-shore support on the phone."
good,"This is a company where it really depends on where you work if it is enjoyable or not.  Some of my co-workers have become my best friends, but I would still never go back."
good,"Your a retail supervisor at a department store/pharmacy.  Your deal with money, customer complaints, employees, and help in the pharmacy. You either open or close down the store on a regular basis."
good,Too much drama and hypocrisy among team and management. Alot of favoritism shown on a regular basis.  Management does not support each other.  Team not supported by management.
good,"I can not speak for Walgreens as a whole, just the location I was employed. I feel like the management was a little too lenient with some of the employees and strict on others. It appeared there was some favoritism amongst the shift leads as well. I did not agree with the rules apply to some and not others mentality. Plus, I was assured I would get some hands on training while attempting to get my pharmacy hours towards my certification, but that did not happen. While I liked my store manager personally, professionally I felt she fell a little short of her responsibility to offer the benefits I was promised to prepare me for advancement."
good,"working for walgreens was ok when the people are great to each other. i always had good relationship with employees and treated them fairly, so they did the same"
good,"Retired, would much rather not answer. I am not applying for a job at Walgreens so this should not apply to me. I don't have anything to say about the company one way or another."
good,"same as other big name pharmacies, sets unrealistic goals with not enough staff. Only thing good about the company is the people that I work with. I wish the company treated their employees better."
good,"Great place to work if you're attending school, management works around your schedule and fellow employees are easy to get along with and teamwork is essential."
good,A good place to work but the pay grade for moving up in the company sucks many additional tasks and responsibility for too little of an hourly pay getting a 25 cent pay increase from employee to shift lead is not worth it.
good,"Company worked with me through school but I noticed a shift in company culture as time went on, and not for the better. Hours being cut and more is expected."
good,"Pharmacy is usually understaffed but the pharmacist is generally good and your shifts go by fast.  Ya have to work closely with the other technicians which can be good or bad, but there are consistent hours."
good,Great job for those looking for second jobs or part time gigs! Flexible hours but the stress of Walgreens' management structure can weigh too much! IF you love helping others you'll love this job
good,"it was a okay job with interesting people, something happened everyday, you had to have a lot of patience and be able to work in a teamwork environment"
good,"The typical day at Walgreens was pretty long and boring. For example, it never really got busy there at all. There was always free time to take a break or use the bathroom if needed."
good,I would rather not get into my true feelings. What I do know is that I have been an Assistant Store Manager for 10 years looking to advance. I have done everything that has been asked and looked over for advancement each and every time.
good,Walgreens doesn't pay based on experience and their managers are very uncommunicative. I had some very mean coworkers who made working there even worse. When I expressed interest in moving up in my career they first said that I would and then later said I wouldn't. It has been a horrible place to work.
good,"The Walgreens I worked at was just a job and nothing more, if you are looking for a second home or a safe space this isnt it. However if you are looking for a place where you can get in, get paid, and get out this is the place for you. Outside of the occasional promotional event they do not ask much of you in terms of expressiveness."
good,"You learn a lot and quickly. I love the pace of this store compared to the others. They do aid those who strive to be great employees, and acknowledge those who've done great work. District and store management though has changed multiple times in the last few years, none of which for the better it seems. Corporate still does not see the staff as anything but a number. They cut hours drastically every summer and do not guarantee hours even if you are full-time. They tell you to work at other stores or use paid-time off."
good,"the job was fast paced, alot of the customers that came in were looking for hair care and make up.  my shifts went by pretty fast.  had regular customers that came in the store."
good,Typical work day is hectic. What I learned at the time is Walgreens is a poorly managed company. It became so much profit driven at a cost to patient safety. Hardest part of my job then is there were no official lunch breaks. You ate quick and fast in the pharmacy so you can get back to work. I would still be in a food coma and concentrating to get my patients' medicines out. I probably say enjoyed working with the people and enjoyed seeing my regular customers.
good,Great customer service was imperative. Different stores and locations see various levels of work loads. Turnover of management was high (but may just have been during my short tenure). Staff was good to each other.
good,"Most of the time shorthanded on staff people call in frequently. Hours are available, but starting pay varies. They did pay for me getting my tech license though so that was a plus."
good,"I would consider Walgreens a fare work invironment , with nice benefits that provides a clean non-hostile work place, easy location to access , friendly management and they make u feel right at home."
good,Working for Walgreens gave me the human interaction with the way people are and how they act that was helpful. It also made me realize that retail is not what I like.
good,Company  has big visions for the future. New management locally is a poor leader. Like all companies now they are very tied to their shareholders and not as much for their employees.
good,Lack of advancement. Great people. Nice customers. Current management exceptional. Hours recently cut. Opinions matter and are welcomed when problem solving and concerns arise
good,"Walgreen's is a great company to work for, depending on the staff. When i first started working for Walgreen's I enjoyed it. Most importantly, I was able to advanced in my customer services skills."
good,"Busy work environment. Company has a great business plan in the rapidly changing field, but seems a bit slow in implementations ."
good,Management will try to help where they can and encourage you to do what needs to be done. When trying to improve yourself some would do things for you instead of letting you do the work and walk you through it which made for advancing very difficult.
good,If you have a good manager that cares about the place you will work in a great environment. Depending on the location it can be fast paced. The customers can be very nice as long as you don't work in the pharmacy.
good,"Walgreens used to be a Great Company to work for, they used to care about employees and customers. Now new management has changed everything. I would stay if things went back to how they used to be."
good,They need more techs in the pharmacy. They want to cut hours for the techs. Though the customers are the ones that pay the price for there not being enough techs to do all the jobs.
good,Most enjoyable part of the position was the HR team. No micromanaging - which is a plus. There was no room for flexibility with being sick and hours worked.
good,"Always understaffed. Poor scheduling, and lack of information on most procedures. Great job security if you can deal with all of that going on. Hardest part of the job is doing the work of 2 employees due to being understaffed constantly."
good,Walgreen was a good place to work but had too many non pharmacist district managers. This leads to unrealistic goals and standards to be meet by pharmacy team.
good,I would am honored to have had the experience of working at Walgreens. I am blessed that God directed me to leave.  The stress of more demanding hours was more than I could give.
good,a typical day at work i learn photo department and pharmacy also scan outs and we also learn promotions for the costumers.learn how to be organized with your own station
good,"Not a secure company, lower pay, very rigid protocols, big micromanaging management, work alone, good schedules, professionals treated like children, locations not everywhere"
good,"Nothing good, nothing bad. Hard to think of this as a career. There is ZERO room for advancement unless you want to go into management. The hardest part about the day is the constant and unless drivethru patients."
good,"The job is a fast paced costomer focused and satisying place to work. State license requirments to work and continue to work in the pharmacy require continuing education and knowledge growth. A typical work day will require working with the public, insurance companys, doctors, pharmacist and many other professonals. Handling perscription filling, confirming and writing instructions to use the medications, orderfilling, inventory and working with money and computers."
good,"used to be a good place to work not so much anymore.  no compassion for those with sick or terminal family members."
good,Very disingenuous environment where lip service is rewarded and honest discussion is penalized with blackballing. Priorities are always shifting to make a higher-up's 'pet program' shine even at the cost of many other priorities.
good,Can be an alright place to work for as long as you focus on the job in front of you and do not get involved with anything that's above your pay grade.
good,"The store i worked out of had a great store manager and Pharmacy Manager until she left and we got a new Pharmacy Manager/ Head Pharmacist who came in on her face day and changed everything about how the pharmacy was run without taking the time to know the patients or the staff. The changes she made, made lines longer and patients more irritable and made the pharmacy inefficient. She was not willing to listen to the opinions of her technicians, pharmacist or the store manager."
good,"Enter and process all prescriptions into the computer."
good,I enjoy my job however I don't agree with scheduling and pay. I don't make nearly enough especially being certified and licensed. My family isn't a concern and to me my family comes first
good,"Overall I think it’s a good job to get you through college, or if you’re in between jobs, but management is poor. Focus is completely on budget. Every year they’ll cut hours and expect you to do the same amount of work and then some, and complain when you aren’t meeting expectations. They have little to no sympathy when it comes to days off, even if it’s a family emergency or if you’re very sick. After your 6 sick days, they don’t care what the situation is, you’re expected to show up."
good,Walgreens has become so much about the numbers that the focus on patients are going downhill and the patients are noticing it. They have expectations of the pharmacy but they do not provide a budget for the pharmacy to schedule the amount of people needed to do the job.
good,"Great compensation. The bonus structure and base pay scale for salaried leaders is different than from in the past, so it's not quite as attractive as it used to be, but still pretty decent compared to other retail operations. The company seems to have gotten stuck in the middle of a culture change and is re-launching a roll-out in field operations it originally implemented a few years ago. Much change in the company as a whole. I think the Boots leadership which was brought over with the acquisition/merger is fairly frustrated by now."
good,Difficult to know what your job description was. Roles would change from week to week. The hours were always the same but not the job description. I would work under a different management if I had to do it all over again.
good,"Typically you would do a lot of the same tasks over and over throughout your workday. For some that might be boring. Often times the store is slow, so if you make friends with fellow employees the shifts will go by quicker. The hardest parts were having to stand all the time and expected to work until midnight every Saturday. The scheduling was kind of poor in my experience, I'm sure not every store struggles like this. The shift leads could either be your best friends or very condescending and rude towards you."
good,"I was on the phone for this job 7 hour out of 8 hours and was not allowed to take additional breaks, unless prescribed by your primary doctor. You got an 30 min lunch and two 15 min breaks and that was it. Not allowed to even use the restroom! I did like at this job if you did well the first 6 months, you was offered to work from home. This was an commission and hourly pay Job, and my commission checks were nice, due to how hard I worked to get Diabetic customers to sign up with Walgreens. Would of stayed here, but the company went out of business due to the new Insurance/Medicare laws and restrictions."
good,"Awful management, you have shift leaders who constantly disagree with one another and conflict which causes problems for the employees below them, horrible organization and communication skills in discussing policy changes, as well as changes to rules and methods. No training for new employees, need to find a helpful coworker in a similar position to yours to take you under their wing and explain things."
good,"as upper management changed so didn't the bottom dollar. with the constantly changing economy, businesses need to adapt. unfortunately, it affects employees. reduction in the workforces puts a heavier load on the people left."
good,"From what I remember, this job requires a lot of physical activity and hours. I've not worked for Walgreen's in several years I remember working a lot of hours especially during the holidays. The time off allowed for medical leave or sick days was very minimal which ultimately made me leave the company."
good,"While this company is a multi-billion dollar company, the pay is not competitive. The benefits we're semi- reasonable, until 2018. An  hourly employee must work about half a month or more just to afford the health insurance. Management is acceptable however,  they have a problem controlling drama amoungst employee's and they also have a problem inspiring there employee's to actually do their job."
good,"It was a very fast paced job with high customer flow and lots to do a lot of the time, but my coworkers were a lot of fun and made the job itself fun."
good,Fair pay for staying with the company/ fair paid time off.  Lacking in benefits that other advanced organizations are providing like paid MATERNITY/PATERNITY leave.
good,"At the beginning of the day you check in."
good,They don’t pay you enough for all the job duties you have to do and it’s never enough people working on one shift to take care of stock and the manager is pretty much everything
good,"Walgreens is a very stressful environment."
good,"Walgreens, like most other corporate retailers, offers a corporate work culture.  Days are generally busy with periodic lulls in customer volume. They put an emphasis on customer service and making sure they have repeat business. Turnover can be high, especially among younger employees While the company offers decent benefits and a profit sharing plan that's hard to beat, wages are often low. While the company used to have a focus on the growth of leadership from within the company, offering mentorship programs and education opportunities for personnel trying to go into pharmacy or get tech certification, that's slowed down in recent years. Despite this, Walgreens generally maintains a culture where management is willing to help employees learn and grow as professionals."
good,"When I'm at work I try my best to be a team player if someone is in need of help with their duties if I am available to help I will help.  Also my job is a mix of different background and culture, which is very good for me because I get to learn different things about them."
good,Before the management change it was a good place to work. They only issue i had was not being pairs enough and having to commute far. But after management changed it went down hill they was micromanaging so bad. Like half of my Team including me left with in the same month. But the Job it self was fine I liked it even after they updated the systems.
good,"I've worked  for the Walgreens15+ years and have develop a lot over the time period. it's a good company to work for, however there's no work like balance. Walgreens, also needs to applaud and show more recognition to employees."
good,"Most employees are early to mid 20's makes it easy to relate to and get along with coworkers. Store leadership and corporate employees tend to me mid twenties/ early thirties or older. If you get a good store it can be a very rewarding company, if you get a bad store you're going to have a hard time getting good feedback or advancing"
good,It seemed as if there was not down time ever.  Always had to be doing something appearing as if there was more work to do than what is actually required for the job.
good,The Brand image trumps everything else.  Expectations to deliver on metrics with sufficient resources.  Accountability and ownership driven.  Created a culture where teamwork thrives.
good,"I  enjoyed working and training other employees, we were a team , there were many challenges that I had to face but through it all , I learned  many new things from my manager, he was a team player challenged me a lot."
good,"good place to work if you're not picky and you need the money.  no benefits nor training"
good,"Its a job, you deal with customers face to face and some of them are not pleasant but most are. If your manager is great, then you'll enjoy working there. Expect to do work though, you cant just sit around (unless its a really really really slow store)."
good,If you seek to make a career here you need to be prepared to deal with horrible staffing and finger pointing management styles. Employee discount isn't too bad though.
good,"Was there for 6 months.  Loved the job and the coworkers.  Always worked well together."
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work if you are in school to make something of yourself. There aren't many perks working for the company. The pay is low and requirements are too high. Management needs to get themselves in order as well. If Walgreens would focus on compensating the staff, listening to them, and weeding out problem employees, then it helps to become a delightful place to be."
good,The position was that of Claims Reviews and Utilization Review. I was to process Utilization Reviews and then review the rejected ones.  The rejected ones were to be corrected and reprocessed for payment.
good,"This job allowed me to grown and gain experience. I started with an amazing store manager, but once management changed the store went downhill. There were constant complaints from customers over ""new policies"" that only applied to our store, a lot of things were done that weren't in sync with HR. This cause a high turnover at our store. I decided to leave to look for a better work environment."
good,"Walgreens is great for starting your work career, however not much in career advancement or change. Corporate does not always communicate effectively with their peers and their subordinates."
good,Its nice place to work. The hours were awful. They were constantly changing. There was no way to have a life or plan things because of the ever changing hours.
good,Walgreens is a great place to work at. I enjoyed my time at Walgreens. The issue that I have with this establishment is their flexibility. I was a full time student that was promised multiple times that I would have my school days off. Those promises were never kept and I failed my classes because of the insane amount they made a part time employee work.
good,"Enjoy seeing my customers,  love learning new departments .  Management is not professional and not fair to all employees. No recognition and no appreciation"
good,"If you interested in becoming anything in the medical field, Walgreens is a great place to start. The pharmacy teaches you how to work well with others, interact with doctors offices, read and identify sig codes, drug classifications and interactions, and all around good customer service skills. The best benefit is the knowledge you acquire that can then be applied in later health settings. Wages and benefits aren't the best."
good,The workload is too much for the number of hours and employees available.The communication between leadership is lacking.  The compensation and benefits are fair.
good,"Overall, Walgreens is a workplace that is slow-paced and quite calm most times. I learned how to do the basics (ie: cashier, price tags, customer service) for a customer representative position; not much product knowledge or customer service approach training from management. Management staff at the time I was working, were laid-back, and lacked communication with their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job, is interacting with customers and finding out what their needs are."
good,I have been with Walgreen's for 10 years as a company like many others they have been threw many changes and are still going threw more.  The company does not allow a good balance for ASM's when it comes to work and life responsibilities.  They have shifted to the point where they hire management from outside the company for position that used to have earned.  Instead of working with their employee's and developing them they would rather discipline them and move them out and bring another one in this is why the companies turn over rate is now threw the roof.  With their new style of management training and communication it creates large gaps in communication among field management.
good,"I work in one of the busier pharmacies in the area, but constant corporate cutbacks lead to a reduction in pharmacy technician hours. Now requiring 2 technicians to work the equivalent of 4. Needless to say the constant work on your feet in a retail setting can take a tole. Co-workers are amazing but it feels like upper management and corporate only care about numbers with total disregard to how the numbers are achieved. It used to be a great place to work 4 years ago but I have noticed a significant change in the workplace."
good,"Pharmacy technician for almost 4 years. Good part time job, especially for students and with an interest in medical field. Stressful but learn a ton that will help you in your career."
good,"Walgreen's does not compensate there help fairly for the amount of responsibility .  Filling prescriptions in a timely manner, cashiering, customer service and inventory control are all what is expected of the employee for minimum wage.  All without any formal training."
good,"It was my first job. Good job for anyone looking for a first time job, or someone who is looking to take on a second part time job. They don't really hire many full time employees."
good,This is like any other retail store job you might expect. The same usual stress from customers and management (when I was there) were tolerable and understanding of Life issues.
good,"This was honestly a pretty standard retail experience.  Most non-management employees were restricted to schedules that put them just under the benefits threshold, mandatory holidays, and long hours on your feet."
good,"Shift managers are not given any tools to discipline insubordinate employees."
good,"I only worked here as an intern for my senior year. This was about 3 years ago now. But it was super fast paced, lots of stuff to learn, and the manager was definitely a little snooty. At least one of them was."
good,"We are out of a product, ""I'm sorry"""
good,fun customers fast paced  good service. lots of things to do. work day consisted of cashing people scan products clean . Management sometimes did not help
good,"Walgreens was a great place to work; however, they quickly lay individuals off when the market is not doing well or if an insurance company does not sign with them again."
good,"For the amount of work and great service we provide the pay is not enough they honestly pay horribly. You literally stock shelves, do customer service"
good,"Walgreens was a great company to work for. It offered a culture of inclusiveness. However, the cut back of hours has effected the productivity and expectations of Assistant Managers.The chance of promotion becomes more slim being that there are only a specific amount of stores to manage which would leave a person to stay in one position for a  long time"
good,"its ok as a whole corporation but they work you extra hard and every holiday for very little pay and depending on your manager the work environment is stressful, they worry more about looking good in front the district manager than being a great store."
good,moderate work conditions frozen pay for a year no breaks or lunches permitted stock down unfavorable management not allowing time off for family emergency or self emergency
good,The benefits were excellent but having to work mandatory holidays and not being allowed to request off on holidays sucked. you really have to put your job first.
good,"I had a great experience working at Walgreens until my most recent manager had started working at my store. Employee discount is decent and is combinable with clearance items. Paid time off increases as your time with the company increases. All employees start off at $9."
good,"Those in management roles did not take their jobs seriously and, in some instances, openly engaged in preferential treatment and thinly veiled nepotism."
good,Typical part time job for students. Did not really expect much from the job due to the fact that it was only temporary. Walgreens is really flexible with everyone schedule.
good,"Location was not that safe. Some of the customers were nice, a lot of them were snotty. Mangers didn’t always do their job, I felt like I was doing their job at times."
good,"Up close customer service with all customers."
good,"Didn't experience enough to make me wanna continue my position with the company...not enough hours ,lack of promotion, there were to much goofing off/silly things going on but the customers were lovely."
good,"As a store manager, I found that alll levels of management in the Houston area seem to have way to much on their plate. It's impossible to complete everything and they communicate poorly on what our true priorities are."
good,"The people are mean, the managers played favoritism. the customers were already stressful enough then I had to deal with the poor employers that made my life and other co-workers life stressful."
good,"Unrealistic expectations for the technician pay, too many duties to get done and people up front make more too start than technicians, at least at my store. Can't make a living off of this."
good,"They dont do advancement, their turnover on Shift Leads is staggering. They teach you the floor people are thieves in their security classes. Its all about class warfare at the corner of Stabby and Crabby."
good,"Walgreens is a fast paced retail pharmacy that is always understaffed.  With a team oriented approach, better communication, and support from the front store manager, the pharmacy would be more efficient with less wait times."
good,"Walgreens is a pretty fun job working part time . Depending on which location your working you’ll have busy and slow days ."
good,It was not the company but the people they employ in management that were not professional at all it was just a paycheck  and control issue from upper management
good,Banking and planning duties started the workday. Assigning team member duties and following up were also part of the day. I learned various forms of coaching and training. The quality of management varied from store to store.
good,"I started off as a cashier and stocker, but was moved more to the photo department. I liked it, but employees in photo have to do more complex work, while getting paid the same as the cashiers. This was discouraging to me, but overall, it was a decent experience."
good,Scheduling was unfair and management played favoritism. Employees talked bad about each other and caused discord constantly. Too many people tried to get others fired and tried to run the store without proper management. Constantly complaining about something.;
good,Good honest fair company to work for managers good in C.A. where I  worked. Pay could be better but not bad for starting. Attendance needs to be good.
good,typical day is about 9 hours. minimal staffing but work load can be accomplished to focused people. very minimal advancement opportunities after you achieve assistant role if any at all. Hardest part of job is dealing with irate customers otherwise its a steady and relaxed pace of work.
good,Is working with different people and not having a set schedule. also always having your hours switch on you due to inaccurate scheduling. Working with a lot of high school students that are lazy at their jobs
good,"Long hours, salaried position paid monthly. In charge of leading the change that is always happening in this corporation. Responsible for training and leading the leadership team."
good,"Responsibilities Assist customers in my department. Advise customers on their favorite beauty products. Push promotional sales. Face all products in my department."
good,"Dm had chip on his shoulder did care about you as a member of Management. "
good,It's a good place  good pay the hours were long.co workers were cool and stuck up for each other.only bad thing security guards  were rude.benefits  were okay.
good,"Working at Walgreens started good, but after seeing the changes that have happened it has declined severely. Many stores have employees that constantly keep up drama, while others sometimes have a hard time keeping employees."
good,Walgreens expects their workers to work any all types of days for their company but does not provide their workers with any type of extra compensation or competitive pay for the work that is expected.
good,"Start the shift by checking products for expired dates, provide customer service by answering any questions that customers may have regarding products. Check out customers with friendly behavior."
good,It was an experience where I can used pharmacy knowledge to help grow the business both on front end and pharmacy.  It was great that Walgreens taught me to learn how to engage with employees and properly train team members to perform high standard.
good,"I believe that higher level management should engage its employees at a more direct level. Come into the stores more often and actually work, to see how it actually works versus how they believe it should."
good,"Was there a short time - dusty environment with bugs running all behind the cash register and where the cigarettes are stored.  Like the discounts you receive when hired.  Did not like the hours.  If you are scheduled to get off work at one time, you don't leave there until half hour or hour later even after drawers are counted down and store is cleaned after closing."
good,Walgreen's has too many rules and not flexible when confronted with issues. Diagnosed with stage 3 cancer and needed chemo treatments. Didn't work with me too well regarding appts.
good,The job was awesome just poor management. Few amount of call off days after probation period . Lack of proper training depending on field your working
good,"Overall Walgreens is a good, stable company and provides good benefits. Support from management depends on who the manager is and varies from store to store. Resources provided for daily job demands are constantly diminishing."
good,Standard RPh job! very stressful and thankless. Not enough help. People throw each other under the bus. Difficult to get days off that you need. Very uncaring to their RPh's.
good,The hardest part of working at Walgreens is job staff turnover is inconsistent. Pay increase is rare. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer interaction.
good,"very busy and no lack of work for team. "
good,"It was a good job for what it was, there wasn't much to really complain about most of the time. "
good,"stocking shelves , ringing up customers, organizing stock room, helping customers find products and sales. competing to sell the most of item of the day"
good,Walgreens is really based on location and management. Those two things will determine test your ability to remain calm in certain situations and how well you are at communication.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for temporarily. Career advancements are rare and the pay is mediocre. It is fast paced and there is no set work schedule which can be stressful at times.
good,"We have all new management, they are not  equipped for the job. I check all the vendors in, I assist customers, I manage different departments and I train newer employees on a consistent basis"
good,"when I worked at walgreens, I enjoyed working with the pharmacy. they were friendly and fun and professional. i would not however recommend working for this company any longer. recently, a walgreens employee in another state did not fill a prescription for a woman's birth control because of their beliefs and that employee won the case."
good,They DO NOT take care of loyal employees - had to relocate to south Florida due to family health issues and they were not accommodating.  Overall the company in Michigan does the best they can to help you with your schedule or with anything you may need however i have found that this doesn't happen across the nation
good,"A typical workday at Walgreen's starts out slow on most weekdays, and then picks up after the afternoon. Overnight shifts die down after about 1:30 am and can become pretty boring. This was my first major retail job so I learned a lot. Money handling skills, photo lab specifics and if you choose, pharmacy technician skills also.The management can be unorganized at times but for the most part works in tandem with the store as a whole. The workplace can be calming depending on certain employees and customer interactions but can be stressful at times. The hardest part of the job can sometimes be working with others at times. The job is fairly simple once you know the ropes. It can be just overwhelming depending on the holiday season or time of day."
good,The job itself is good and I like the workplace where I am now but it is very difficult to work with a group of people that's not team player's . Also there's no room for growth there . And with never being closed is also a difficult  . There has been a lot of scary incidents there where I felt afraid with no security . Co-workers fighting with customer's and management being argumentative with customer's also. The most enjoyable time for me is my customer's .
good,Fast paced and customer focused. If you are a people person then this is the place for you.  Customer interactions vary but if you treat the customers with respect they generally treat you the same.
good,"I applied there to become a Pharmacy Tech at first, but that didn't work out for me. Working as a clerk will definitely keep you busy, especially during the holidays. Depending on the location, you might have to deal with some out of the ordinary customers now and then."
good,Walgreens use to be more selective in the hiring process for management. Walgreens would recruit young college graduates and train their leaders. Now they don't offer competitive salaries.
good,Walgreens isn't a bad place to work.  Being short staffed constantly and having a person call in can ruin a day.  Depending on where you work though days can be slow and easy and you can get a lot of work done.  When it's busy though you are still expected to get everything done even when you are swamped.
good,"If you want to look into becoming a Manager for them, you have to verify with your Store Manager as well as other Managers that you work with. Or else, every time a new manager comes in to run things, you're starting all over again to get Supervisors to recognize your work ethic to get a promotion."
good,"Walgreens is not where you would want to make a career. The location I was at was nice but the management was lacking. Smoke and mirrors. No one ever told you things straight. "
good,The company was fine to work for before recent major cuts in store hours significantly reduced workforce and simultaneously increased workload. Employees are unhappy and stressed out while customers now find it hard to find the quick service they expected. Overall the workplace experience is not as happy and friendly as it once was.
good,"Its a great place to work, work well with school schedule. Closing all the time is no fun and some managers are verrrry lazy. Don't understand how a manager knows less than a regular employee."
good,I like to shop at Walgreens.  I would never want to work there again.  Very low pay scale.  Saw floor managers get pay reduced and titles taken away for no other reason that the company made changes.
good,"- No work life balance"
good,walgreens is a nice place to work if you are trying to find a starter job or if you need to get a second job. the work is easy an the staff and customers are great
good,Not for a family man. Not enough budget hours.All corporate decisions.  No autonomy. My staff did work hard. Our xustomers appreciated their devotion to them.
good,I learned a lot about retail here but we were supposed to receive small commissions on things that we sold and I ended up leaving bc I racked up $400 in commission that he never paid me.
good,It is a minimum wage company. Great for a starter job and great for students. Most managers are able to work with other schedules such as a second job or school.
good,"With Walgreens, it's hard to balance life and work especially if you work full-time.  Management does not care a lot about your personal needs or circumstances."
good,"Worked evenings in the cosmetic department. Completed inventory weekly. Customer service, try to keep sales at a certain percentage. Set up displays and attend monthly cosmetic meetings"
good,"ASM was very belittling, in some cases would lie in order to prevent herself from getting in trouble and would push the blame on those under her."
good,"If you have no experience and you're looking to gain some, this is the place to work. I began working here in college and had no experience with customer service or any job for that matter. I gained so much knowledge about how a store is run and learned how to handle difficult situations. The particular Walgreens I worked at was not ideal if you wanted to advance with the company. They promised for 5 months that they would take me off the front register but they never did because they liked my work ethic. They did not want to lose one of their best cashiers. That's great for them but not for me. I wanted to advance in that career and was unable to so I left."
good,"I spent three years with Walgreens as a shift lead, but, as per usual, I filled in for every job position possible, including cashier, floor help, pharmacy tech, liquor store clerk and assistant manager (unofficially, of course). It's possibly to fall in love with the atmosphere and the community, and to really feel like Walgreens is your second home, but that's also the drawback; if you can't come in for every call-out (which is incredibly frequent), every time someone has quit or been fired (frequent) and every time the manager fails to create a schedule until the very last minute and you literally have 20 people who have no idea when their next shift is until 12 hours prior, its just not the job for you. Many things are great, but if you're not dedicated to putting your work schedule (which varies greatly - can we say 3pm to 11pm one day and 8am to 4pm the next, with an overnight thrown in for good measure) ahead of your personal life then you'll have a hard time keeping up and a harder time getting ahead."
good,"Its either hot or cold, very short breaks (15mins) too much or not enough work depending on time of year. Boxes weigh more than 40lbs as quoted in their job description. Don't mess up or miss a day, might as well stay home fore good."
good,opportunity to advance is there but you are seen as unreliable once a call-in to the employer is in place-managers are very nice and courteous as long as you are considered dependable and reliable in their eyes.
good,"Good place to work for a first job or so. Not a place to stay for years because you get no promotion or a raise. The customers are nice, and the management is ok."
good,"Walgreens when I first started was a great strong company that tried to get solid help with a solid pay rate and decent benefits. As upper management rolled over the benefits were whittled down, more was asked without any compensation and now it's not the company I started working for anymore. I love my coworkers and my manager but they are all stuck making thing work with what little they're given by a corporate team that no longer cares about its employees."
good,I enjoyed my time at Walgreens and miss it a lot. Just wish we were compensated with more salary and better benefits. Hours depends on season and how much prescriptions the pharmacy fills on average.
good,"You don't have to expect anything new or swift changing at Walgreens. Work days are predictable and behaviors of people are consistent. There is little to no job promotion from within for anything higher than a shift leader. They like to hire on BA/BS degree candidates for those positions. It can be like a village complex because there are so little employees required to run the store but then it is easy to create friendships with the team this way. The benefits are really good and support student and family lifestyles. Attendance policy is a little extreme, especially for those with children but it depends on the store team on how enforced it is. A good place to build up experience but not a place to make a career out of unless you have the education to get hired for it."
good,A typical day at work is very busy all the time. I learned how to do so many spreadsheet. Too many chief not enough Indians. Work culture is ok.  Management needs to treat people fairly. The hardest part of the job is the change they made all the time. The enjoyable part of the job  is the working with the clients.
good,"I imagine working this chain was a typical experience for most major corporate retailers. There seemed to always be more work to do than hours in the day. It constantly felt like we were understaffed given the technician budget that was given to us, and this was true at all 9 locations that I worked. A typical day involved me coming in early, working 8-12 hour shifts, no lunch and no break. While lunch was ""offered"" there was no feasible way to take a break of any sort. Especially when working a 12 hours shift and no other pharmacist overlap. There was alway pressure from upper management to meet certain ""goals"" or as I like to call them quotas. If your store was unable to meet the ""goal"" then pressure was applied and a microscope brought down on everyone. The hardest part of the job was never feeling like I was doing a good enough job and feeling undervalued and under-appreciated. The most enjoyable part was the salary."
good,There are a lot of things that are great about the job like the discount and flexibility with schedule however moving up inthe company takes a while and the processes are prolonged for unnecessary amounts of time.
good,"The is a HUGE corporation, yet they can only pay the employees who deal with their customers day in and out minimum wage. I would think a company that expects so much from the employees interacting with customers on a daily basis to pay them more for all the hard work they do daily."
good,"I would say the compensation is variable from location to location. If you are not a manager, pharmacist or above, this job is not a career and will not sustain you. Its okay for students or retired folk that want a side job but that is it. "
good,"As an overnight worker my day started with me sealing off one of the entry doors to make security easier manage as I was alone for the most part. From there I had a checklist to perform which included, cleaning all registers in store, sweeping  and mopping the store, sweeping the parking lot, emptying all trash cans inside and outside the store, facing all merchandise in the store, vacuuming all carpets, replenishing stock, unloading the daily truck, and security detail all the while answering phones and cashiering. The management and staff were pretty agreeable for the most part, however the hardest part of the job was that the location of the store was in a..... less than favorable and sometimes outright dangerous part of town. the customers noticeably wore staff members down on a regular basis."
good,"Typical would be walking clocking and meeting with shift-leads of the overnight shift. Restocking and shelves and putting the store back together was the main duty of the overnight crew. Restocking would include coolers, McLane truck that arrived Tuesday Mornings and Thrusday Mornings had to be a put away. Most difficult part of the job was the more difficult under the influence customers and the amount of load work being placed with the hours cutting."
good,"I was being promoted very quickly but wound up under a manager in a busy store that had me held with not immediate advance in site.  It was steady work, but the pay without the future advancement was not working."
good,Walgreens had a great vision for the type of company they want to be. But they are trying to achieve it at the expense of cutting budgets and not taking any work load away. Work life balance is becoming less and less manageable.
good,"Not a peaceful atmosphere, the budget is constantly decreasing but more tasks and responsibilities are added on. Extremely high turnover rate. A typical day is wondering what is going to happen there is a lack of stability at the job. Also management does not care or listen to there employees needs."
good,"While this job may suit well to someone who requires flexible and ever-changing hours, it is difficult for those of use who have other obligations or are seeking to return to school. The uncertainty of the volume and frequency of hours makes it difficult to work more than one job or to add schooling."
good,"Short staffed, low wages, nice people. Very controlled merchandising, no room for error. Difficult to hire new clerks due to to starting pay.Management has to pick up the slack, and it can become difficult"
good,"Management was a mixed bag. Either slacking or trying too hard. "
good,I would have enjoyed better management. I also would have liked to have more hands-on training. Overall I enjoyed the job and my workmates were very good.
good,It is a summer job. There is no point in working there in the long term unless you move up the chain of command in the company. You can work there as a regular employee for the short-term.
good,I enjoyed working with the people. Some times the over night shift was difficult but you met some interesting people.Just remember this is a major retail operation and is international.
good,I have learned a lot over the years but have found it to be very stressful with trying to accommodate to Walgreen's expectations with limited time and hours accessible to the employee. They cut hours in half and expect twice the work load to be done.
good,I learned a lot from working for this company.  Always kiss your higher ups butts or it will most likely hurt you in the end like it did me.  I enjoyed my job until i became manager.
good,Walgreens was a very good company to work for but after almost 12 yrs. I'm ready for a change. Also  I am looking for a job where I don't have to work on major holidays such as Thanksgiving & Christmas. I feel those holidays should be spent with family
good,"Does not provide a comfortable work environment, Management seems to make the work place a hostile environment to work in.  Management does not give praise only ridicule."
good,Walgreens is a retail pharmacy. As a team lead I was able to learn all the various departments and ensure customers shopping needs were met. My favorite part was being able to develop relationships with customers!
good,"You do too much for the little pay they offer"
good,"It's an okay place to work while you look for something better. It constantly keeps you busy so the days fly by, but what they pay you for that amount of work it's not really worth it."
good,"It's a great place to work don't get me wrong, but I am not at a place in my life where minimum wage is going to cut it anymore and they just do not have the hours I need."
good,"not challenging, decent pay, bad direction, self-starter, not much to do after 5 hours, nice coworkers, high turn over, deals a lot with inventory, merchandising"
good,"Working at Walgreens is fun place to work on a typical work day we get everything and more done on a timely manner, you learn something new each and everyday its always fun to interact with the customers make them feel welcomed, the management on good days are great on busy days can be a little crabby. The hardest part about the job is trying to get what you need to get done in your department on a busy day but I mean to be honest its what makes the job fun because its like a mini challenge, and I love a good challenge but other then that Walgreens is an amazing place to work!"
good,Walgreens was a great company to work for. The working  g.their was pleasant and rewarding. Communication could better at times but was good. Training was always on going an lunches.d we often had pot luck  employees lunches. The company was good at treating their employees good.
good,The pay is not great when basing on the period of time you have been employed by them. Management truly depends on the store. It's fun depending on who you work with.
good,Poor advancement and terrible senior management.  Not flexible and forward thinking.  Old school mentality runs very strong.  Office conditions are okay
good,"Used to be a great company to work for and felt family orientated,  Field management kept changing, thus changing expectations and goals.  Payroll budgets kept decreasing despite increase in sales causing management to carry out tasks including all physical work.  Used to be able to merchandise freely to satisfy customer needs but company set merchandising standards despite not making sense for the demographic."
good,"I learn what I can do."
good,"Walgreens used to be an awesome family oriented company.  They were all about taking care of the customer and their employees. Now it has become all about the mighty dollar.  Corporate will visit your store say how great it is and later ask your district manager how many people do they have to get rid off.  Their main concern is to get rid of the older, higher paid employees and bring in new people for a fraction of the cost."
good,"Loved my co-workers, Management okay.Had many rude customers at that store. Very tense place to work.  Aging the best part of the job was most of the people I worked with."
good,For the amount of work that you are required to do it isn't worth the pay.  Receiving days are the worst because you get a mountain of inventory coming in and you spend the majority of the shift working on that.
good,"No day was ever the same, always something that can be done in store. You should never be bored with your work load. Management could be improved but the co-workers were nice and easy to get along with. Customer service is also top priority in this position. Plenty of hands on training involved."
good,"Great people, work load is reasonable. The only concern is the company does not pay very well unless you've gained a lot of years with the company. But overall nice"
good,It was very hard to advance in the workplace and there was a lot of bias in our store. A lot of hard work and hardly any advancement. Corporate keeps cutting our hours making it harder to see how they value us as employees.
good,"It's an easy place to work, and it's fun at times. Buy when other people are getting promotions before you, even though you've been there longer is very frustrating. I'm stuck in the same position with no hope of getting something different unless someone gets hired, which I probably still be on register. Some coworkers are nice but everyone is leaving so I might follow suit. Lots of drama too. I also doubled in hours every week because too many people left."
good,"stressful environment, week management, benefits are not great, jobs are not secure, no work life balance. High pay compares to other retail companies."
good,"Long days at work while constantly serving customers who often cause disputes because of the way Walgreens discounts are set up. All the prices in the store are upped by a large amount but they allow ""Sales"" with their rewards cards that usually only bring the item in question back to a reasonable price. Because of this, customers constantly have to dispute over prices and it creates a large hassle for the entire work environment."
good,"When i went away to college, I was told my job at a store would be safe; however, when I called the newly-relocated manager, she informed me that while I was still an employee of Walgreen's, she gave away my position. The company is very stringent on employee benefits and is open, always. Good for customers, not very good for employees."
good,"The work life of Walgreens is really nice. Honestly the perfect job if you're still in high school or in college seeking a part-time job."
good,"friendly staff, long hours of standing on feet. pretty easy work. I liked helping the customers & drive through. this was just an externship requirement for school. was not a paid position."
good,"Its been an interesting experience. It started off well and I learned a lot, but the company has definitely changed A LOT. I grew a lot here, and I'm thankful for that. My store's location wasn't exactly a great one, so there were a lot of crazy people. I definitely have a lot of crazy stories to go along with them too. I can just say it's a good place to start off at entry level, but definitely don't stay long unless you really plan on growing within the company."
good,The entire time I spent working for Walgreens they allowed company morale and standards to fall as the focused on beating their competitors. It seemed like Walgreens was always chasing CVS.CVS seemed like the visionary company with fresh ideas and Walgreens was reacting to whatever CVS was doing. Walgreens really went all in with LEAN culture. Programs were set in place for employees to report mistakes on each other. Loss prevention took over the duties of the Safety Process Manager and the Occupational Therapist after the company decided to discontinue those positions. Company morale dropped dramatically in the 6 years I worked there.
good,"The last manager could have been way better. She was barely there and when she was, it was horrible. she did the most. As a manager she just didn't care."
good,feels like working with family. but its a really tough place to work in. the people are nice though. but i felt like i didn't learn much here for my internship and i felt like i was doing way to much and not getting payed for it ...you know..
good,"Out of the 9+ years I have worked here I would say that it was not easy to get to the level I am at now. The hardest part of the job is trying to please the customer. Even when you think you have done your best, you find out that it was not good enough. Sometimes it can seem like the company is so focused on the customer that they forget to take care of the employee."
good,"A slow paced, friendly work environment.  Great first job or a good additional/second job.  Management is relaxed and coworkers are friendly.  Not a good place for advancement."
good,"Walgreen is not what it used to be. Management does not value their employees as they should. The company has great benefits to offer, but not much advancement for blacks, even though work incredibly hard for the company. There is room for much improvement."
good,"Like April 09, 2017 I was on the register from 7 Am to 3:14 Pm by myself without taking 15 minutes break  or 30 minutes lunches.That wasn't right. One of the lead shift was open accidentally  on the register not for long .I tried everything to please my customers no matter what, you do work as a manager  and get pay as a regular employee and they call it team work but not for the pay."
good,"Worked 8 years, but as soon as management change I was out.  Basically a dead end job, unless you want to get into management. Good benefits, ok pay, crazy busy, LOTS of people. Learned a lot and some of the people were really nice."
good,"Walgreens has a clear vision for its future but needs to make decisions on locations that don't fit those visions.  Recent changes to company plan/structure and not viable in some locations.  Based on store metrics, certain store either need specific attention or to be closed."
good,Routine is boring. Little chance to advance your career. People are nice. Salary is not good. It looks good from the outside but people actually work there will leave within few years.
good,"Been with the company for almost 9 years. Started out as management and ended up as cashier, with still having to do manager duties. Basically more work, less pay. was great at first but the company change so much it affected me it in a non-positive way. you are only good as you were yesterday. Good luck to all."
good,I think this company should reevaluate their management on a regularge basis. Management does not value their emotes as they should. I think this one major reason the company experience so.much employee turnovers
good,"I love working at Walgreen's is a great company the corporate are really care for the employee, we help and care for each other as a team, the manager always making sure that we did our job properly and make good customer services."
good,The one I worked at played favorites when it came to who did what and who got what schedule. It wasn't fair. We in the beauty department were set goals the management thought was doable but it wasn't always based on the customers who came in on our shifts. We were still told to do better even if we didn't have any customers all day in our area.
good,"In the beginning it was a great place to work, then management changed, people stop caring, and the store went done hill. The pay sucks you get a raise every year but its not much. If anyone decides to work at walgreens i would suggest going into pharmacy."
good,This place of work is good. If you like to be worked like a dog and treated poorly. No opportunities to advance most of the time management will complain about lack of work even though you work your butt off for them. No general acknowledgment for good work you do.
good,"A typical day of work as a Shift Lead at Walgreens involves juggling so many responsibilities at once, that it is nearly impossible to complete everything requested of you by the end of your shift."
good,Typical day consists of consistent monitoring of several screens to ensure work is being completed in a timely fashion. Leading direct and indirect reports towards being successful in their roles. Perception is reality in this distribution center. Team member engagement is crucial part of their culture. Good work is hardly recognized in management position. its the best and worst part of the job. Management is on a much tighter leash than a regular team member.
good,The culture has really changed.  Pay and benefits are not what they used to be. Long hours have to work almost all holidays.
good,I got a lot of hands on training from the manager and senior tech I shadowed. I meet all different kinds of different culture.I enjoyed learning the different things in the pharmacy.
good,"For a pharmacist, a walgreens career amounts to a modern day factory. The pay, benefits, etc are very appealing but the quality of life associated with the job is getting worse each year."
good,Worked there for 6 years part time. Liked the employees did not like upper management. No advancement when I really wanted one
good,Over the couple years I have been away from walgreens much has changed.  There is little to none advancement opportunists. Pay has been lowered and job titles have be replaced.
good,"Good place to work for a short time. Shift leads are great, managers not so much. Very high turnover rate. They'll probably be one employee leaving every two weeks, and someone new hired within that time."
good,"I really do not wish to review Walgreens. It has been a good place to work, but over the last couple of years the changes the company are making leave those at the lower level feeling as though the company doesn't know what it wants."
good,"Walgreens was a good job that allowed me to get closer to people and learn there likes and dislikes and how to be more understanding. Being a cashier/night stocker was very interesting at moments remotely dealing with different emotions and cultures, it's was a unforgettable experience. We had a few rough situations where people got caught stealing but usually there was no drama just hard work and fun."
good,"Walgreens is great for getting a foot in the door to retail, customer service and sales. They're pretty straight forward with what they want and expect from you"
good,"Corporation is lacking in the area of showing true concern for employees safety and well being prior to the occurrence of unforeseen circumstances like store robberies that involve deadly weapons. Additionally, monitoring on how employee store ratings are acquired via coaxing by upper management needs to be implemented as well as how management ratings of employees are determined."
good,A great company with very good benefits. The job is pretty much made for people in the management or pharmacy field. For all regular employees its only good if your in high school and want to make money.
good,After working for the company for over 6 years and being let go due to no positions available in the Kalamazoo area after being told there was a place for me left me pretty upset with the company
good,"No real room for advancement. Salary caps. Crazy hours. Ability to work extra hours at different stores. Understaffed when working later hours, often closing with 1 tech and 1 rph. You rarely get breaks."
good,"Had various shifts ranging from 7 AM to 3 PM, 12;45 to 7;15, 3PM to 12:30 AM, 6 PM to 12:30 PM, worked every Saturday3 PM to 1 AM since new Management started 7 months ago. Had no time to spend with family as I worked every Holiday! Had endless regular customers & always tried to find Walgreen coupons to make their purchase cheaper, & I worked front register some days & Cosmetics other days which I restocked shelves, emptied 9 trash cans, opened restroom for customers & cleaned bathrooms!"
good,"Walgreens is an ok company to work for, the employee discount is nice. The pay is low, even with 5 years previous experience including being a department manager."
good,"I loved interacting with customers and helping them with whatever they needed. We were usually pretty busy and it helped me learn about customer service. However, the hours were too unsteady and with a wife and child I need a more stable income."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of merchandising, organizing the cosmetics department, customer assistance, working the registers and helping in the photo department. "
good,"what I usually do is Cash handling, Educate customers about products and new offerings, Provide superior customer satisfaction for high volume operations. management is very bad store manager is racist don't know how to talk to people very bad management skills."
good,"I had crazy schedule, one day morning shift and next day middle shift, and the next day is closing. It is mess up my social life and my health balance"
good,"The best thing about working at Walgreens was the opportunities you had. If you worked hard and took responsibilty, you could go far in the company. I got promoted every year just by doing what was expected and taking ownership. That is also the downfall. Most of the employees working at Walgreens are just there to get a paycheck. They don't care. Consequently a lot of responsibility falls on management and the few employees that do care. Work/life balance was terrible. As an assistant manager I was working sometimes up to 60 hours a week, closing and then opening. I had no personal life. Pay was ok, benefits were better. Generally if the company cared as much about their employees as they did their customers it would be a great place to work. But they don't. They will put a customer before an employee anyday which is why turnover is so high."
good,the entry lever job at walgreens was a jood exprirence job for a young person. the management was not very friendly and the hours were somtimes to little between
good,Each and every day one does the same thing over and over again. There is very little opportunity to grow. I feel like I am too stagnant and management is very complacent with having people working part-time.
good,"Working for walgreens is okay, it is a job. Unless you are a pharmacist do not make it a career.It is just a job, something to pay the bills with, nothing more nothing less."
good,"I worked here for about a year and it was what you'd expect. Dealing with customers, stocking shelves, using a register, etc. The work was nothing too hard. My only problem was there were never set hours and sometimes hours were cut, which meant less pay. Plus, there was absolutely no room for advancement."
good,It was great when I first joined the company as it changed hands it became just a job instead of a career and a home. Met great staff and upper management.
good,"A typical work day includes doing everything that your shift lead doesn't want to do, in order for them to look good to the store manager. "
good,"some of employees  are very funny and kind.I learned a lot of skills. The location is very busy so I hope they have enough people to work for. otherwise, it is too tired."
good,The job is decent. It's dependent on location more than anything. The Stone Mountain location (24 hours) is very busy. Customers have entitlement issues and management lacks regard for employees or customers. Just about everyone is just rude. Walking through the door has the ability to kill high spirits.
good,Was a great company to work at. Great group of co-workers. I like that my work kept me busy for the 8hrs I was there. Very flexible company.
good,Enjoyed my co workers and meeting new customers received free flu shots and a store discounts liked having regular customers who knew me and the store manager was not nice but the asse manager was excellent
good,walgreens is a decent job  a typical day i unload the truck and help customers hardest part is sometimes dealing with customers attitude
good,do not care to answer this is not what im on indeed to do this is a waste of my time if i was not looking for a new start im very sure walgreens would be an ex employer i do not care to talk about this low paying job.
good,"i really did enjoy my job. The people i got to encounter, I loved meeting new people daily and being able to help them. My pharmacy crew was awesome, but like any job you have your bumps to overcome. The hardest part of my job was not having all the answers to give at all times."
good,"Lots to do with no to no time to do it or help"
good,"Amazing job with great people just no room for moving up."
good,"I did not enjoy working at Walgreens. I cried after one of the managers humiliated me on the phone for a little misunderstanding about me getting help getting a carton of cigarettes from the office up to the front where I was. Completely, unnecessary. Pay was awful, and I felt like they did not care about me being in school and the ever changing semester hours."
good,"The company is good if you're starting out and looking to gain experience and eventually move on to better things. It does not pay well and has little advancement in pay, even for very experienced people. Stable hours, but overworked employees and underpaid."
good,"While employed with this company I felt as if, if I didn't move on to something else that I would have to stay in that field of work forever. Mangers tend to stay within the company for a long time so there's not much room for advancement once you've been there for a while. Sales were a big part but you don't get much profit from it."
good,The management is poor and only cares about employees when higher people of management is around. Also it is hard to advance within the company.
good,"Retail aspect of a health store conglomeration where an employee benefits greatly being knowledgeable about all areas of customer service and its affiliated departments such as health, photo, beauty, shipping and receiving"
good,"Manage daily store operations, supervise team members, and provide customer service"
good,"Work is pretty nonchalant, but it can be fast paced at times. My co-workers are really friendly. I learned that i have to be fast on the floor and on register. Work in general is not that hard it's just i need full time hours."
good,"The reason I say this is because each store is different. I worked at 6 different stores total, and all of them but my most recent one I had worked at was awesome! They had amazing leadership that were on the same page and knew what was going on. When I moved to my new store, none of the leadership staff knew what was going on, and that trickled down to the front end employees."
good,Was a great company to work for before new management began put corporate shareholder profits over employee's. No moral is at an all time low. People dont feel secure about their job security.
good,"Low pay, not enough hours, can't get hours at other locations, no advancements once you start. Some managers are good to work with, and the others just let other employees sit around on there phone."
good,"Help health care providers and patients by greeting them in person and by phone; answering questions and requests; referring inquiries to the pharmacist. Maintain pharmacy inventory by checking pharmaceutical stock to determine inventory level; anticipating needed medications and supplies; placing and expediting orders; verifying receipt; removing outdated drugs, and dispense the correct medication to the correct patient. Maintain records by recording and filing physicians' orders and prescriptions."
good,"I loved my job. Bu the management was all about the corporate slogans. It felt like all we did was sell, push, say, take surveys. Instead of help the customer."
good,"ive worked there for 2 yrs and I have to say one of the worst jobs ive had. poor communication with employees, favoritism, retaliation."
good,"Fast paced work environment, Customer Service first very giving with quality and make sure customer felt welcomed. I loved working with this company and so room for improvement."
good,"I learned a lot during my internship on how to dispatch pills, attend clients, customer service, and preparing medications especially antibiotics and other stuff. I currently dont work there because my contract finished."
good,This was my first real job. I was a pharmacy tech and stayed with the company for 6 years been through many changes in that time. They gave me the room and training to improve.But management are very numbers driven and they're making the customer experience more and more robotic
good,A typical day at work involves me communicating tasks from store manager to team members. You must focus on great customer service and tend to the needs of the store. Management can vary from store to store. Co-workers are pretty good overall. Hardest part of the job is trying to complete all of the tasks given by the store manager in a timely manner while tending to customers and team members. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers with their questions and concerns.
good,"There's not to much to say about working at Walgreens, I enjoy many of the people I work with and their is a real sense of friendship among the sales teem. I work well with my co-workers and very much enjoy the customers I get to assist. I can honestly say I did not expect to learn the lessons I have learned while working here. While working at this location, I have been disrespected on many occasions by management, and treated as if I am unintelligent. This has not made me bitter or angry, I am just ready to move on to a place where what I have to offer will be acknowledged and I am able to put my gift for working with people to better use."
good,"Management is not very organize with schedules expect to run a whole department on your own, pay rate is not competitive for work load.Very short breaks."
good,"I learned a lot at Walgreens such as learning to use a telxon, continuing to grow my experience there for bettering me in customer service. There's no hardest part of the job you take what ever it is and figure it out to the best of your ability and make things happen."
good,"Lots of interaction with customers is expected"
good,"Its an OK place to start, or as an interim until you can find something else. Most of the employees are pretty good. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the general public."
good,A typical day at work includes a lot of date entry and speaking with insurance representatives. I learned a lot about how to process insurance claims and get the most money for the job while providing great service to our customers. I've been there a year and I really enjoyed about 3 out of the 5 managers that I was switched to so I'd have to say management was good. I absolutely LOVE my coworkers. They are part of what makes better days on the job. The most difficult portion of the job is completing certain task in the time limits in which they expect them to get done. Some being unrealistic. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the insurance company to pay for medication that our patients need to survive.
good,"Co-workers were great. Management not all on the same page, or the same goals. Minimal one on one training offered, computer training was the only real opportunity. The computers that were offered for training were in poor working order. Hardest part of the job was the minimal training at registers. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was doing things that I saw were a need. Management telling me ""as long as I have been her I have never seen anyone ever do that."""
good,"I was an order picker from Aug to November. The pay is ok but the work is very tedious and redundant. Managment has very little respect of employees and will talk to you any kind of way. Constant mandatory overtime especially around October Nov, Dec, Some major holidays you arent off or just off the day before. Very little room for growth because you have to work at least 5 years to get promoted like all the other managers. Wouldnt recommend to the educated."
good,"i've been working with this company for 10 years now and alot has changed over the years....but not for the better... a million things is expected of you to do and achieve for THE NUMBERS that corporate wants to see but they don't know what a typical day in the front lines of being a pharmacy tech consists of. The lines are usually always long... CAPS are a pain in the butt (the main reasons to tie up the lines). Irate customers who demands you to just hand them the medication as it is just in a box. Learned alot through out the years but their is no more room for advancement as a tech. Co-workers are cool to work with... hardest part of job is picking up co-workers slack because they are lazy and don't want to put their 100% in their work.Overall, flexible with schedule"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and the training I received. I guess 12/hr (certified) is good starting out, but good luck getting a raise or even acknowledging you for working hard. They only care about how fast you work. "
good,Never have a set schedule and the managers can be difficult to deal with. There is room for advancement though as the company continues to grow.
good,"Good pay for my age. I worked while going to school for a few months, once I was ready to start college I had to quit because I couldn't work the hours they gave me."
good,It's a stablished company. There's plenty of work over there. My co-workers were very friendly with me. Customer service is their goal number one.
good,The job was physically demanding and the store was understaffed. Most employees are part time and some not very reliable.  Management was lacking and compensation very low.
good,Work / Life Balance can be impossible. Turn over rate is high. Long hours with continued iniatives that pile on top of daily task.
good,"depending on  the store manager if theres room to grow, they are always change how do to do things, the most I enjoyed part of my job was they do a lot of charity work"
good,"At work, I was able to start working as a Service Clerk which basically just meant ringing people up. It was very boring and not fulfilling. I tried my best to enjoy it and I would try and make every person smile. I learned a lot more about how the customer is always right and how I needed to have a good attitude always. Even as a photo specialist, I was always dealing with new customers. Management was pretty good, but they liked to work you more than you wanted to be worked. It took me a very long time to learn what my job was at Walgreens because they didn't really train me well. They expected me to just know what they were talking about which was the hardest part of the job. My co-workers didn't work hard, but I would work anyways. It just didn't feel good to me to not do my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to a customer who felt like telling you about themselves that day."
good,"The pay sucked, as did the hours. I loved the Store Manager, but not so much the shift leads. Apparently its Walgreen's Policy to have three registers in the front, but only use one. I was the fastest cashier they had but my line was still always backed up, because I was the only cashier ringing people out. It took FOREVER for cash pickups to  get done, or change to be brought. Sometimes the managers would just be standing, talking to customers. The customers were awful, but that's just how retail is."
good,"typical work day would be to come in put the tills in the registers."
good,"If you need an entry level job to get some experience walgreens is okay for that. If you plan on making a career out of it, it has been my experience that its more about who you know than what you know."
good,"A typical day consists of interacting with customers, making sure we maintain a high level of productivity throughout the day, completing daily tasks, and performing extraordinary customer care. I have obtained great social skills and expanded by customer service skills as well. I work with a great crew of managers within my store. I have very reliable co-workers. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help a customer in need of a item which we are out of stock or do not carry. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer and seeing the joy on their faces when they are able to receive everything they needed and more."
good,"Working at Walgreens has taught me a lot about customer service; most importantly, how to roll over and accept being demeaned by people with less than average intellect. Daily tasks are fairly simple, it's a great first job. The hardest thing to walk away from is the benefits, that's how they suck you in. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the coworkers, I've made a lot of good friends through Walgreens."
good,A typical day consists of tedious odd tasks whilst assisting ungrateful and disrespectful and even sometimes dangerous customers.
good,"A typical day is attending to a wide variety of customers and needs along with balancing routine daily procedures and maintaining inventory levels in the store. The schedule is never a set one and usually you only have a week or two notice on schedule. The manager of the store was awful- used fear as motivation, had no appreciation for hard work, and abused corporate policy. There were rats for two years in the warehouse, the exterminators practically gave up, and corporate did nothing about it, so under threat of termination myself and a few fellow strong-hearted employees literally chased down and killed rats during many of the night shifts. Walgreens does not care about you as the individual."
good,"*Diverse workplace"
good,"The hardest part of the job is the pay and management. I think long term employees should be rewarded with higher pay.  Also, management can be difficult."
good,Great place to work if you like working with people. More flexible for teenagers/college students and people with good health.
good,"Consistently unsafe place to work. Pallets of 50+ totes being lifted by fork lift drivers up to 50 ft in the air with just a thin tape to hold them. Seen them fall several times with nothing done to improve the safety."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Walgreen's. The days were long and busy, but I did not mind. It helped the day go by faster for me. The pharmacy manager was great and he really care about his team personally. The store was busy all the time. Breaks were rare and long hours standing on your feet. That's every pharmacy, right? Walgreen's has a lot of customer pleasing rules and promotions to encourage the clientele to be apart of. No lie it could become overwhelming. Dealing with sick and agitated patients who could often take out there frustrations on you because they don't understand what's going on, while pushing out 700+ prescriptions daily and stubborn coworkers who have been with the company for decades and stuck in their way. That was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was pleasing the customer and seeing thm happy after you serve the community."
good,though walgreens is a good company the one I worked for had very bad management. the managers very very rude and lied about many things.
good,I enjoyed my tasks but the team i worked with wasn't really what i enjoy as far as a work environment. i did not receive days i requested off simply because it was based on seniority and i did more than i should have for my position without compensation.
good,A typical day for me is I work from the time I clock in until the time I clock out. I multi-task because I have worked for the company for almost ten years and have gained much experience through the years. I have never worked in the pharmacy. I am not a manager or SFL. I prefer less stress and prefer to stay an employee and not advance to management. I  enjoy providing customer service to customers and helping new employees learn how to perform the required duties of our job. The difficulties I have at work is that many new employees are not willing to make the effort to learn how to effectively perform different tasks at work.  Many of the employees do not attempt to do their own assignments. This behavior results with others  being left with multiple tasks to complete during a given shift. Management is not quick about handling incidents or effective in resolving difficulties between staff and customers either. Although the customers are extremely rude and inconsiderate at times it should be effective guidelines exhibited to improve the situations that are occurring. Overall the store and corporation is a great company to advance with. However different locations need to work on improving in various areas of job roles.
good,"I liked being a beauty adviser, i liked seeing and helping people pick out the different cosmetic products that they prefer"
good,A typical day at work would include ringing up customers at the cash register. I learned just how important customer service skills are at any job. The majority of the managers I've had have been great; they're always willing to help out. My co-workers are just as good and are efficient at delivering great customer service. The hardest part of the job was meeting a certain number of sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers.
good,I only was there for 2 months so not alot of information collected. but altho the ork ther was nice it just got old doint the same thing every day all day. would be better if was allowed to rotate within
good,Good company to work for with many opportunities to learn and advance within the company.  Learning programs can be done in store or at home with withthe company website for employees.
good,"In my time with the company, it switched from being privately owned to publicly traded.  "
good,Working for walgreen's for the past 15 years. It used to be very great company to work for. But for the past 2 to 3 years everything is changing. It looks good on paper but most of the employees are not happy from inside. Management is all business oriented which is fine but in all those chaos employee suffers. Not enough help either in the front end and pharmacy and expect lots from employee. Co-workers are great to work with.
good,been working there for seven years just got moved to assistant manger position 2 years ago. The raises are complete jokes.
good,"I loved my job working with customers. I loved my co-workers. The managers there were not very helpful to the employees. I would have over a 1,000 dollars in my draw because certain managers there would not come get my pick up. Also they would not help when the lines got full and we were low on staff."
good,"I was a cashier; stocked shelves, assisted customers.  I learned not to complain.  The Management I had was not well suited for this position.  My co-workers were good people."
good,"Walgreens is a fast paced place to work.  You are constantly having to think on your feet.  I didn't work in a great store and had problems with the management staff.  They just didn't care.  However, I have worked with other managers who are amazing! Work/Life Balance was almost non existent.  The most taxing thing is having to deal with the amount of thieves."
good,The work culture I saw within the Walgreens workplace is one of the very distance management system that only reacts to complaints. If you complain about your hours or treatment from your supervisor don't expect a solution. Management will try to solve the problem without letting you know. Phone calls to human resources were only with a voice mail service and emails were not returned so it felt like I was ignored.
good,"This Walgreens that I worked for in general was not in the best neighborhood, did not have the nicest customers, or the best employees, but my job as a beauty advisor was fantastic."
good,"I was not impressed with the management at the location that I worked at, the store manager did not like females that had a family and particullary ones that were Military spouses and didn't want to work with the schedule of the military families"
good,"I enjoyed the people i worked alongside on a daily basis and the customers, in my opinion, were genuinely caring people."
good,I worked nights so I cleaned up after almost all the staff so ireally didn't speak to anyone due to the lack of respect they showed everyone
good,"Overall good experience but major IT restructuring and cost cutting initiatives in progress."
good,"A typical work day was busy. I learned a lot of valuable retail skills. There is a lot of diversity among co-workers, and it shows you how to relate to people on a whole. The hardest part of the job is being able to multi-task and handle the issues of the public. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to multi-task, and have fun doing the things-that you enjoy to keep you busy-throughout the day."
good,"Great opportunities to learn and grow in the beauty field such as, being the first to use and learn about new products. A typical day at work is its all about sales and customer service but, also educating customer about products. At work stocking going over inventory cleaning and building displays is also, apart of a days work.Management can be a bit unreasonable about hours or if enrolled in school.My co-workers makes my job enjoyable no one comes in with a sad face we might be tired but we work as a team everyone gets along.The hardest part of the job is making sales,customer come in knowing what they want so you have to convince them to buy a certain product, or having other projects to do in a little amount of time."
good,"Working in a high volume Walgreen's Pharmacy is extremely challenging.  The store is always busy, and is especially busy during Fridays, and during the first of the month.  A typical day at work consists of typing hard copy prescriptions, as well as prescriptions which have been e-scribed or called in from a doctors' office.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you are able to help someone maintain good health by selling consumers their medication.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with extremely irate customers."
good,"Management was well Unprofessional. "
good,Its literally only a job to put a few dollars in your pockets. not the sort of job you can live off of. only enough for a bill or two a month. work is easy.
good,pharmacy staff is completely overwhelmed with workload. The company doesn't seem to see this as a problem. The company needs to be able to retain good people.
good,"Giving the best customer service I can. Processing there order quickly. Meeting new and returning customers, hoping they enjoyed their visit at the store. Management, most were very nice and fair. Most co-workers willing to help without asking. Hardest part was to keep busy. Most enjoyable part was keeping busy and the customers."
good,Work all holidays and weekends. Company constantly eliminating management positions. Fellow employees  are great to work with. Shift work not for everyone
good,"Fast pace, busy and exciting company to work for.  Always something to do.  Always something to learn.  Always room to move up within the company."
good,"Working here was exceptional. Although some days were slow and co-workers were great characters. Management was understanding ,but a bit snoopy and disorganized. Typical day included ringing up several costumer and maintaining the store. What I loved the most was interacting with the costumer's who would speak Spanish with me."
good,"Great when your co workers flow as a team ,but when the flow was thrown off it gets very, very stressful in a hurry. A very steep learning curve but with a great pharmacist with patience you will survive lol"
good,"I enjoy the interaction I have with all my customers and my fellow associates.  Working together to accomplish our daily tacks can be challenging, but that what life is about.  The challenge to stay current and excited in your position.  Always being positive about each day and to make everyone as positive as possible each day."
good,"Need to treat their employee more fair on the other hand being a stocker was fun, really nice customers and employee's, hardest part is lifting heavy items,stay focus."
good,"The pay is quite fair for the job requirements and within a year you can gain up to 30-35 hours a week and be trained for multiple customer sales positions in Cosmetics, Photo, and Cashier."
good,"Learned a lot about providing excellent customer service and valuing great business. Maintaining relationships with regular, loyal customers."
good,Hours are not the best it was hard work doing resets but I enjoyed doing them and I enjoyed selling products to customers.
good,"I hate it. Management, long hours, low pay, customers everything. Management expects you to do a lot for basically nothing. You have no voice and you are always blamed even if it is not your fault."
good,Walgreens is a nice place to work if you like working with the general public. The employees are fun and interesting. Pay is not so good but most of the time management is willing to work with you on scheduling which for most of us is a huge plus!.
good,"A typical day will include many customers and requires help"
good,"Walgreens the company is a great place to work. I unfortunately had the pleasure of working at one of the worse stores in the region. Managers weren't trained well so they couldn't properly train the new hires. Walgreens even has benefits for its employees but my store wouldnt  give the proper hours for you to obtain those benefits. I would definitely work for Walgreens again, just not that store."
good,"Clock in "
good,Walgreens Healthcare Plus is no longer in business.  Many changes have occured in the industry and they were no longer competitive in the field.
good,"Every month they cut more and more hours off everyone's schedule. You can't survive off 10 hours a week. They are great working around college student's schedules tho, but the amount of hours available for part time employees is ridiculous."
good,"Enjoy interacting with the public, good staff, no day is ever the same."
good,"A typical day at work revolves around making the clientele happy and keeping the store in order. My social skills have progressed a great deal while working at Walgreens since communicating with the customers is a must. However, it is very difficult to make a decent paycheck here at Walgreens since management doesn't seem to want to give hours. They constantly hire new employees so there's barely enough hours to share among us. It's a blessing to even get two shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers. They are what keep me sane while being enclosed in the walls of Walgreens. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. But having worked at Walgreens for a while now, I've mastered handling difficult adults in a professional manner."
good,"Great co-workers, upper management was always changing.  Lots of politics. Overall, a good place to start a career but I would move on after a few years."
good,"The job keeps me busy and productive through out the shift. Between management and doing my daily task, I tend to stay on my p's and q's at work."
good,"The management at my store was amazing and made this place survivable for four years. When the company started changing everything, cutting hours, giving people severance packages left and right and telling them to get out I had to say goodbye to some really great coworkers. I decided I wouldn't contribute to a company with so little care for their employees so I left. Some people love this place, but if you think that you are worth more than slightly above minimum wage and want to spend time with your family, find another company. You will be open every holiday, you will work weird hours, you will get called in to cover shifts for the less dedicated and you will not receive anything in return."
good,"start by typing prescriptions, and greeting customers. I learn everyday is a new and exciting challenge. the hardest part of my job is working all the different shifts. the most enjoyable part of my job is when I see that customer with that big smile on their face when they say ""thank you Frances"""
good,"Working for Walgreens has been a roller coaster, I have been overlooked position cut, its hard to stay positive when you individuals get promoted because of a buddy system. I have heard this for years its not what you know its who you know I have seen this and experience"
good,Learned a lot about pharmacy benefit management. Walgreens Health Initiatives is no longer a company; it was sold 2011.
good,"Customer Service driven! A typical day at work consists of several chats and/or calls regarding the website, customer accounts, and general prescription inquiries."
good,Walgreen Infusion at Legacy is a good place to work. It is in the process of changing ownership. The RN manager is supportive. Pay scale is less than hospital jobs.
good,I love working in the photo lab and being able to help people and share some of their photographic memories with them. Co-workers are easy to get along with and management is nice. The worst part is the pay and wont allow full time.
good,"Very high stress. Very challenging. Lots of change. If you love to be challenged, this is the job for you. Get to meet a lot of great people."
good,Location was less than desirable but the employees were a class act. pay was extremely low with little chance to get a raise or incentive to work hard. entry level job into the working world
good,A typical day at work was filling prescriptions to inventory and everything in between that can be done in a pharmacy setting. Ihad a few managers along the way and almost all of them were some of the smartest helpful people I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I learned so much about day to day pharmacy duties from insurance billing to data input.
good,"Its always very busy, which makes the day fly past. I learned all medical insurances very quickly with the help of my co-workers, I like greeting happy patients and making the sick patients feel a little better by smiling. This is a very demanding job and can sometimes be stressful with the traffic volume. I make sure to get the patients in and out of the pharmacy with a good experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is a funny customer, Its also good to see the patients leave happy and satisfied with their experience at Walgreens Pharmacy. The patients often return and you get to know them as well as their family."
good,"included retail prescription processing— transcribing, filling, packaging and labeling; assisting in inventory control of pharmaceutical medications; compounding creams and lotions; filling suspensions; filing hard copies of each controlled and non-controlled prescription sale; maintaining ink jet printers stocked with labels and paper; ensuring inventory of bottles, caps, cylinders for filling prescriptions; returned general merchandise back to stock; maintained and operated cash registers; janitorial services in the pharmacy; assisted patients to various locations within the store for general merchandise"
good,"Walgreen is a good place to work with good coworkers and supervisors. working at Walgreen i developed more about customers services and i have learned more how to deal with difficult customers.  ,"
good,"It is a great first job for someone just starting out in the workforce, but I wouldn't recommend working for Walgreens as a long term option if you are trying to start a family or make more money."
good,I came into work and had a list of things to do. I had to sign off on everything I completed and run the cash register. The managers were overall rude. The job wasn't hard but required a lot of multitasking and putting up with getting yelled at by the management. It was not an enjoyable work environment.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens would be taking care of all the photo orders coming through an being sent out. Stocking shelf's always having enough product for customers, if we don't have certain product they are looking for I will try my best to find it at a local Walgreens or order online."
good,"Walgreens has publicly committed itself to becoming the industry standard rather than the industry leader. In the last few years it has gutted many of its employee benefits and reduced pay rates significantly. I can't say that it is great place to build a career on, but it is a decent place to start one as there is plenty of opportunity with significant turnover at every level - associates, management, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacists."
good,"The job overall is not that great. You start off as a cashier and then they move you up to different positions without paying you for what you are working. They tried making me a pharmacy tech and still wanted to pay me only minimum wage."
good,"Due to poor pay and limited hours, few employees can participate in benefits. Most employees are on food stamps due to this culture."
good,"A typical day includes reviewing sales reports, competition, training and developing new staff, planning and executing tasks, aiding pharmacy (who continues to struggle due to budget cuts) in engaging customers.  Management is going through a major transformation and no one with the exception of upper management know where the road is going.  The hardest part of the job is not dealing with customers, but bosses who lack people skills and should not be working retail.  The best part of the job is the long term relationships you build with customers and training and developing your staff.  Nothing is more satisfying than see one of your team members go on and accomplish great things based of just a portion of what you taught them."
good,"I loved everyone i worked with, the managers were awesome. I just didn't like what the store stood for, it seemed to me that all the employes and the managers were close. We considered each other family but the actual general managers are horrible, they change so many rules without knowing the problems of each store and make all the employes and managers jobs harder. They don't take input about how to make the store better and could care less about the people who work there. Also they don't promote fairly and expect you to do more than your job description without paying accordingly."
good,"The company does not give opportunities many places to advance. Employees are  over-worked and under paid. Company does not give full lunch breaks, no matter how long of a day you work."
good,Love the Job and my co workers. The best part is customer interaction. Hardest part is the amount of work for the little pay.
good,"A typical day during the overnight shift at this Walgreens consisted of finishing any tasks left incomplete by the previous shift, receiving shipment from truck and vendors, organizing shipment on floor and in stockroom, prioritizing customer service if any during the overnight shift, maintaining one's own aisles by facing and doing an item count on floor and in the stock room."
good,This was a nice place to work. I was terminated due to the fact that they forced me to take a flu shot and then a day later was sick. I went to their clinic and they gave me antibiotics and a note that stated I would need to be off for three days. I called my supervisor who stated to bring the note in when I came back. So when I came back I turned in my note and then 30 minutes I was called into the office. They terminated my employment due to calling out the past three days. I called HR and had an investigation open where I had to go in a write an official statement and get interviewed and was told they would get back in a few days with a determination of the investigation and never heard back. I called every other day for two months leaving voice messages and would have emailed but they refused to give me the email.
good,"Co-workers and management was polite and friendly, easy to work for. I learned a lot working for this company and was given an amazing oppurtunity to work there."
good,it was a typical retail job. i liked it until new management came into the work place. the manager that hired me really helped his staff and knew customers are key.
good,"This job was boring, I either fought for hours or was over worked. I did not agree with a lot of company rules or decisions. A typical day was boring. Management was awful. I liked my co workers and that's about it."
good,mundane mindless task and unrelenting expectations to better a store that is already established and maxed out.
good,"worked every day to restock shelves and help customers find products, was also responsible for cleaning up stores during night shift."
good,"- Provided great customer service."
good,"It was a very fast pace job, which I enjoy , however; there was zero teamwork. Everyone may have been very nice but at times there was zero to no teamwork, one person would be doing the job of 4 . I am thankful for the opportunity I was give, however it was not the job for me."
good,"From the moment you clock in, you are expected to be on task and available for assistance. There was never a day where I wasn't needed to contribute to the progress of the company. I was provided extra training in beauty sales and productions. My managers were always available and open to new ideas to help renovate our system of service. My customers always made me feel needed and well appreciated for my hard work and dedication. The hardest part of the job was not getting to please everyone, but I helped to innovate new ways to assist every customer, even if they were displeased with the unavailability of products."
good,Neither bad or good. Typical retail environment with no real outstanding characteristics of the workforce or management. Some would consider it stagnant while others would consider it routine. Hardest part of the job (as a manager) high turn over rate of 16-18 year olds. There is nothing significant enough to consider most enjoyable. It was routine work.
good,"My day consist of taking phone calls, placing orders for patients, and starting new services for patients. I have learned to multi task in a office environment. I feel management needs to be more involved and observe employees that do not make the work environment pleasant. Most of my co-workers are team players and than there are some that feel they only have one job and are not willing to be a team player.The hardest part of my job is dealing with employees that are rude and unpleasant. The most enjoyable part of my job is taking care of the patient and co-workers that are pleasant to work with."
good,"Print out unbilled report and work independently to process claims in my own alpha split. Bill paper and EMC claims. Work ZirMed rejection reports, daily, if time permits, must be worked every Friday. Work in house hold reports, this report is used when items are missing from the branch and claims must be placed on hold until all documentation is received which is needed to process claims to the AR"
good,"Walgreens is like any other retail store. They have good benefits. However, getting promoted takes some time. One thing I dislike is that when they close a store they don't give the employees, except management, any information."
good,This is the only job I have since i graduated from college. I want to try something new and want to explore other possibilities out there for me. Life is short. I want to make the best out of it.
good,Consistent work flow from the beginning of the day to the end. There's always work to be done. It was always good to be appreciated when we were able to help patients get in and out of Walgreens quickly.
good,"Like any average retail company walgreens has their good and bad days. My co-workers are not so supportive when it comes to working as a team. Overall I'll learn leadership, responsibility, and providing excellent costumer service. patience is definitely essential while working for this establishment and it developed as a person."
good,"Best portions of the job are interacting with customers and assisting them with finding solutions to various problems.  There was no typical day, every day was something different which is also a high point.  Advancement was limited, with store growth halted, and management positions eliminated to save expenses."
good,"great place to start out in the workforce.  working face to face with customers you have to have a pleasant demeanor.  typical day was helping customers locate what products they needed, as well as taking care of any pricing concerns at check out."
good,"Management, other than myself, was not very goal orientated."
good,"basic day of triage and managing patients, assisting  providers and front office work."
good,"Most days started with loading up equipment and routing out stops for the day. Keeping in communications with patients so they know delivery times. Making sure patients have enough supplies for the week/month."
good,"If you enjoy working on family-oriented holidays and for a company that requires you to dump you soul into it, and doesn't appreciate the hard work you put in, then this is the company for you."
good,typical day of paperwork and phone calls. I learned all the ins and outs of a distribution center. I enjoyed working with the managers and my co-workers
good,"Although the coworkers and customers are all a great bunch to work with, corporate doesn't care about their employees and it's incredibly difficult to enjoy working with the company while being dragged down by the ""man""."
good,I would loan and unload truck. I also had to learn how to do stock and present vey good customer service.
good,"Love working for this company, I just think they need to pick management more wisely. Too many playing favoritism as far as rules (who has to follow and who is allowed to break them). I think all employees should be handled fairly."
good,Walgreens as a corporation seems to have a decent vision for where they would like to be as a company however as with many retail chains there is a very hard break at the district manager level. Every position below district manager has issues with maintaining qualified people this results in a lowest common denominator rising environment. Store managers with no Human Resources experience and weak management skills creates a lot of unnecessary politics.
good,"The company is making a lot of changes in upper management that are not always in the best interest of the employees at store level. Communications is often lacking, and the schedule definitely leaves absolutely zero time for family."
good,Normal day would be whether being on cashier or refilling the shelves or organizing the storeroom's stock also very satisfying to help the guest with there needs.
good,"As an employee at Walgreen's I had the opportunity to learn many new things. At first I started as a cashier which was fairly easily because of previous cashier experience. Not to mention engaging customers and getting them in and out of the store in a timely fashion never was a problem. After a couple months as a cashier I then began learning how to run a photo lab. Not the easiest job but definitely tolerable. This job included responsibilities such as devolving film,helping customers use the kiosk,fixing errors with four different machines, putting together calendars, photo books and many more duties. The photo lab sometimes seemed to be a huge headache because it seemed as if something was always not working and other strategic functions had to be carried out. I don't regret the new knowledge but the headache could have been saved. After a couple months of learning photo I then was identified as a photo specialist. Another one my duties at Walgreen's included being a beauty adviser in which I worked in cosmetics. This was my least favorite position. Our district manager was such a stricter on red zone sales(cosmetics) that we literally had to throw ourselves at people to encourage them to buy cosmetic items. It kind of took away from the store's purpose as a convenient store."
good,"assisting customers, stocking, price changes and training new employees and learning new things. The hardest part of my job was dealing with irrate customers and the most fun part of my job was putting a smile on customers face knowing that i've helped them!"
good,"Walgreens has benefits and the pay is not great but competitive. The work schedule and work load is very demanding with mandatory overtime daily. The stress and damage to hands and feet are a problem with repetitive movements and concrete floors. Hand/wrist issues are common example carpal tunnel syndrome."
good,"Overall I like it mostly because of the actual people and the fact that I get some freedom of creativity in my dept. Otherwise, I do not enjoy certain tedious requirements and how I'm managed often times..."
good,Working the main register and helping customers check out with their items was mainly what I do at Walgreens. I help stock inventory whenever I get a chance to. The work environment was fast-paced and productive but the management skills were not the best. There was disorganization around the store and it didn't feel like it was the most efficient environment. The hardest part of the job was making sure the items were stored in the right place because it wasn't so easy to find out which aisle or area it needed to be placed in. Employees within the workspace are conflicted with each other causing drama with one another in front of customers.
good,Walgreens is a very social and fast paced environment! Business is fast and there are always customers to meet and help; this is what I like most.
good,The tasks would vary from day to day based on what needed to be done for the day. I learned about inventory and supply and demand.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my customers with the insurance problems that came across. Helping them save money on their medication because of my knowledge of copay assistance programs. Learning about how insurance companies determine if they will pay for a medication that is prescribed by a doctor. Hard part was the ever changing policies and adaptations you had to make. You always have to sell everything from singles shot, flavorings, and own prescription plan."
good,You're left alone at the register. Your back-up cashier is probably in photos or cosmetics and don't really like to be called up to help you at the front when you need their help. Management expects you to do the impossible by giving you multiple duties that require your presence in different places at once.
good,"You should know when you apply, it's low end retail. The local managers are fine, but corporately, just a number"
good,"I worked at Walgreen's for a short period of time because the people their i had to work with didn't know how to talk to new co-workers and didn't understand how to explain the job."
good,A typical work day has many customers and few staff on hand. Checking in items and ringing up angry customers. Calling insurance companies and being hung up on
good,"The People are excellent I love the people I work with, but the problem with Walgreens is that we are trying to provide a good experience for our customers and they keep reducing hours and manpower and it is becoming a struggle to be able to do that."
good,During my time with this company I have experienced many changes but not nearly as many as I have in the last 12 months. The company has become indecisive. New rules and new focus's every few months.
good,Very hard to move positions. There are hiring freezes every 6 months.
good,"I've been with Walgreens for 8yrs and I must say it has had its good and bad. The company has made some changes that I don't agree with but I have enjoyed my years here. A normal day is busy with customers and trying to get task done. Most days its challenging because it seems like you don't get much done. Over all I like what I do, I enjoy meeting new people and helping people stay well."
good,"A typical day at work was very unorganized and did not fit the job title. I worked as a beauty consultant but was all over the store doing many jobs every day. The best part of the job was the kind coworkers, whereas the worst part was the unorganized management, bad hours and low pay. While working at Walgreens I was promised a promotion many times but never saw it come my way."
good,"Continuously meet new people. The company is beneficial if you are in school, managers have a understanding for people whom are trying to improve on their lives."
good,"Either you love it or you hate it"
good,The management was awful and they don't care about their employees like they claim. I never felt like my job was secure while working there. Luckily my husband got a job and we moved. My co-workers were the best part of my work. I enjoyed talking out my problems with them and realized they felt the same way.
good,I started at 16 years old and they gave me alot of opportunities to advance in the company.
good,Working at Walgreens is not your typical day at retail. It is more like a pharmacy that does photos and sales goods to customers. We pretty much handle customer with care and we as a photo tech print out the photos that customers picked to print.
good,Good company for a first job or working through college. No real room for advancement as they hire in their supervisors for outside. Management is based from corporate standards without information of a stores location or daily clientele. Management would rarely give compliments even when exceeding expectations.
good,"Counted safe to specified amount. Organized cash-related paperwork to be put into the system. Fixed discrepancies. Walk the store, creating daily task list. Received daily deliveries in the warehouse, put product away in organized manner. Offered assistance to all customers."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was working and communicating with the store employees, finding out from them the hottest items, what the customers like the most and what they like most about their job.  The hardest part of the job was too much paperwork to accomplish which led to less time in the stores."
good,A work day consisted of helping customers with finding items in a timely matter along with completing transactions.
good,"Starting out in the pharmacy it took along  time to learn everything you need to know about the pharmacy. Everyday it seemed like you were learning something new. There was good management and bad management if the good management was working your day was gonna be pretty good, if a bad manager was working you could just about expect having a stressful day. The hardest part of the job was working with a Pharmacist that would not be a team player. the best part of the job was getting to know you customers my name and knowing you help them out ."
good,In this particular store favorites are played and cliques run the place. The manager is a bit shady and rarely lives up to his promises to his employees. Concerns of fraud that a customer is comitting were blown off. Trying to keep the sales floor in a somewhat organised manner were blown off.
good,"Each day would consist of entering scripts, filling scripts, answering phone calls, working the drive up window, working the cash registered, putting away inventory."
good,"It was pretty alright I guess if you like doing the same tasks over and over again. Also saying ""be well"" to every customer as they leave is a little awkward. I started working when Walgreens decided to revamp its image in Houston with the whole Balance Rewards card thing. Working there was so boring and depressing though but I guess that's because it wasn't for me. I'm more fast pace and tend to work better under pressure. Nothing really wrong with the place either. It seemed great for the right people. Oh and also I only got payed 7.50."
good,"Overall it is a good company to work for; even though, management and corporate seem to have this impression that they do not know what they are doing or what they want to do. I feel like there is no job security or room for improvement unless you are in management.The co-workers are awesome, and the customers are loyal and incorrigible to make you want to do better. Even though a company may seem like they are on the right track with advancements, they may not be as on track as you think they are. Be prepared to protect your assets and your finances (save up money in an account if possible). Overall, it is a good company to work for and will be around for a while, just be cautious about which store you work at. Definitely do your research."
good,I have worked at two different store locations now and filled in at a few others and i can every store runs different depending on your location the responsibility you have will vary even in the same position. i have been with Walgreens for almost four years now and the experience changes with every new manager with the current company set up there is not much room for promotion. being head photo my day consist of running the photo lab getting customers their prints in a timely manner and making sure the lab is running at full potential also am required to full coolers and freezers and the dry grocery section as well as cover the front cashiers lunch's and brakes
good,"Not enough time to complete tasks before issued more."
good,"A lot of tasks"
good,Leadership is young. Entry level positions are required to carry for youth in leaders
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but it seemed understaffed and the company would not hire anybody else, considering they were not paying enough for the job to be worth the time and work you do there"
good,"Work environment was stressful considering it was one of the busier locations but yet fun , great technicians to work with as a team,who provided an excellent customer service as well as great having numerous happy and pleasant customers."
good,"This job will keep you busy between cashier, tagging, stocking, and customer service duties. Daytime was busiest. Night shift provided unique customers. Not a bad job."
good,Working for Walgreens had its ups and downs. The difficult part for me with working for Walgreens is the benefits and salary. The only way to get a raise is to advance and lucky I'm a quick learner that I was able to do so. You only get to sign up for health insurance once a year so if you miss the deadline then you have no health insurance for the rest of the year. Another bad experience I had working there is customers calling you out your name. You really have to have tough skin to work in that environment. The good experience I had was meeting new people. Not all customers were mean or disrespectful.
good,too many changes that do not take team members lives into consideration
good,"typical day at work including stocking supplies, and working the cash register. I learned how to merchandise. The management at Walgreens is great. My co-workers at walgreens were also great. The hardest part of the job would be trying to find somewhere to put all of the misplace items at the end of the day."
good,"CONS:"
good,A typical day begins with checking and balancing paper work. Setting all tills out to begin operation. Reading the store managers notes to delegate duties. The business of retail pharmacy is nonstop team work around the clock. The reward is repeat customer base from great service. From helping a customer find the right shade make up to filling prescriptions in a timely manner is enjoyable to me.
good,Fast paced and fun. I really enjoyed holidays at walgreens.
good,"While working at Walgreens, one sees no team work being performed. Everyone is off performing their own tasks and thus allowing for no team work or bonding to promote boding and creativity within the work place."
good,I worked nothing but nights and weekends it was very stressful. I even working during a hurricane. The hardest part is standing up for 8 hours and stocking until 11 sometimes 1 in the morning. Customers your time just as much as the managers do at times. It can be a very stressful environment.
good,I liked working face to face with the customers and developing good customer relations with them. I had some scheduling conflicts with the job that couldn't be worked out.
good,"Customer service comes first"
good,Skewed culture across stores and upper management. Work/Life balance is difficult to maintain with upper management taking employees for granted.
good,It a job not a career. Being involved in the daily aspect of running a retail store. I was in charge of making sure the inventory was accurate. Customer satisfaction and problem solving was a very important part of my job.
good,I have enjoyed training many people and watching them succeed in reaching their personal and work related goals.  The best part of the job is dealing with customers and their needs.  Being able to put a smile on a few faces when they are sick or having a bad day is what it is all about.  We work hard at our store keeping it stocked and ready for business.
good,This was a great place to work until the last few years.  It used to care about employees but not anymore.
good,While I enjoyed the actual work I did at Walgreens I had difficulties with the schedule and the general management.  Organizing items into their places is a natural tendency for me as I like to make sure things go in their place.  What I did not like was the fact that I was hired as a part time employee and I was given full time hours without the pay or benefits. I also need a set schedule to maintain proper sleep to function.
good,"learned how to deal with different type of people."
good,I worked for Walgreens for almost 3 years in 2 different positions.  It gave me a great foundation to build my career.
good,Work was very stressful and I felt very undercompensated for what the job required.
good,"Company constantly shifting people from building to building in different town. Tha harder you work the more they jacked up the rates making even more difficult to obtain. Then you would get down to 3or 4 hrs total time put in and they look for volunteers to go home after they push push push, Well its full time job not part time job. That was picking aspect of it.They are just in a constant lean mode we had over a 1000 people employeed they leaned it down to 570. Now closing warehouse eliminating another 350 people leaving roughly 130 people which that   warehouse is predicted to close in year or 2. Id never work for a walgreen company including Amerisourcebergen, they have a stake in that company. They will wreck that one if they run it like they ran walgreens."
good,"Pharmacy Technician, job consisted of filling, processing, billing, customer service in a high volume store. Also specialized in HIV medications. Inventory management as well as bookeeping"
good,A typical day was filled with helping customers with their every need Customer service was a huge part of this job.
good,there is job structure and there is strategic management. there is stratification and job duties are disbursed duly.
good,Extremely stressful environment that is not worth the anxiety and physical pains. Corporate does not understand what it takes to work in a retail/healthcare environment.
good,"I have nothing good to say about WALGREENS. They treat their staff bad and there is a HIGH turnover rate as well. "
good,Loved working with the people in the store. Customers were a huge part of your day.
good,"Overall Walgreens is a good company that tries to care for its employees.  That being said, management on the store levels is very poor.  There is almost no one watching upper management, and unless you are a part of upper management, employees at the corporate level don't care what you have to say.  It's sad to see a good company brought down by employees they simply don't monitor that are given all the power.  It is common to see a manager or assistant store manager do little to no work, and then place all the blame on other employees."
good,"I work in a fast paced environment.I handle 600to800 boxes per day.i have learned to work around many people.my peers treat me with respect.the hardest part of my job is ,I do the same thing every day.the company has cookouts for safety achievements"
good,"Days were very long and stressful. The work place was a good atmosphere, and the customers were very loyal to the store. Management was dedicated to providing excellent customer care. Never try to make friends with co-workers and try to keep to yourself in the work place."
good,"A typical day would consist of stocking and cleaning photo processing equipment, taking and processing customer orders and running a cash register."
good,Walgreen is a good place to work if you permanent if your a temporary team member than you'll get the feeling that your expendable.
good,"Management can be better. The place is busy, manager needs to know how to schedule better."
good,"Supervise and train team members while maintaining a professional appearance and attitude at all times."
good,Everyday was the same process. Although its a billion dollar company the pay for the employees is not great for what they do and the customer service that they provide. The management were great. My store manager is good and very productive. Hardest part of the job is not getting recognized for the work that some of the employees completed.
good,My days are very busy and every day is different.   I love being a leader and role model for my staff.
good,The office was not run very smoothly. The office was in debt ansd took away from the experience.
good,"My night starts out very busy on register.Slows down start cleaning,  trash . floors ,bathrooms. etc.After that  possible a reset to do plus  run register.then if time stocking. then make time to face the front of store all before 7.30 am. Plus still running register. 3rd shift is hard all the time a lot  of running ,walking. Crazy people at night. Most of our late night customers I love great people."
good,I get a lot of love from the employees there. But the work load and the stress doesn't match the pay at all.
good,"I was an Asst. Manager with this company. My duties were typical of a retail assistant manager that included employees supervision, cashiering, product ordering, an daily overall duties."
good,back when  was there i felt as though the managers played buddy buddy to much with certain people. the upside was there was always over time and vacation!
good,"Typical day as an assistant manager would be counting the safe reviewing the corporate tasks on the computer and getting with your ASM or store manager and see if they have any special tasks that need completed. Next assign/delegate the tasks and give yourself something to work on (usually building a display, stocking, scanning in vendors, ordering new product, organizing the warehouse etc.) I learned to adapt quickly to changing situations, moods, and issues. Management was pretty hit or miss. At a busier store you would usually have a great manager but at some of the slower stores not so much. Co-workers and employees are great, being the manager it is what you make of it. Hardest part of the job was after the economic downturn watching all the perks and benefits slowly being taken away, pay being frozen and cut, and new rules and requirements that required much more work for the same amount of pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my hands, mind, and fellow employees all at the same time."
good,"I started here as a college intern.  There are opportunities to advance if you are willing to relocate, and can tolerate retail."
good,A typical day for me at Walgreens is to meet the weekly goals set in Cosmetics department and make sure that everything looks good before I clock out for the night.
good,Don't really have much to say other than you know what you are getting into if you are working for walgreens.
good,"•	Handling Money"
good,Management was very petty lunch was too short. Need better training programs for employees
good,"walgreens wants everyone to do the job of three people but only pay you like you are only doing half the work of one. they cut hours, added job duties and make you jump hoops to get promoted for a sad raise."
good,"Work assigned is straightforward from stocking to cash register and helping customers. There will be days when a sales clerk must multi-task. Duties, schedule and department are not set. Managers will call if they need. Sales clerk will be asked by manager to do other duties that are not regularly assigned."
good,"Even though I enjoy working with the public, it was very hard to sell expensive products due the store was located in an urban area that was country folks."
good,Work loads steadily increasing with payroll steadily decreasing
good,"My typical day varies day by day.  I spend my day wearing many hats such as providing customer service, assist in RX, receiving vendors, coaching and mentoring my staff, building displays, etc.  I have learned to better multi-task and become a leader.  The hardest part about my current job is the variety of hours.  The most enjoyable part about my job is developing and mentoring my staff."
good,"working with patients and their prescriptions. data input, stocking and inventory. Filing and typing. patient interaction. cash handling."
good,"I worked overnight, so I was robbed here.  After I was robbed, it seemed like the company did not care."
good,"Great people to work with."
good,"When I worked there, there was a constant fear of layoffs and a very high rate of turn over.  Management was constantly changing as were coworkers.  Very stressful and intense."
good,"Very busy store, learned that when people are sick, it very hard to reason with them. Manager was a great person, very fair to all. Co-workers we all got along well"
good,"Nothing spectacular about this job. The managers seem bipolar, and the customers are typically pretty rude. "
good,"I am a cashier most of the time, so I deal with a lot of customer service issues.  I also rotate stock and stock shelves, and I have a little bit of experience in the pharmacy."
good,"helping customers on a daily basis with thier prescriptions, learned new things everyday. had to be patient and sympatheic"
good,Every day its a one to one pharmacist and technician working all day. every task that need to be complete is on me (the technician) along with attending to customers and filling prescriptions in between. sometimes I am not able to complete tasks because I feel like I am the only one on our team while the pharmacist stays idol at the computer all day.
good,"Most are pretty much the same, in which you read, fill, and sell prescriptions. You do learn a lot about what it really takes to know the business. There isn't a lot of interaction between management and the pharmacy side of things, but most of the co-workers are very nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part is probably the having the see the ugly side of people but you also get to see a lot of good people that just need help."
good,"The pay is horrible and the discount is a slap in the face. Managment doesn't do much but hide out in the office, they sometimes put up new resets (products). This is a type of job for a high school student. The hardest part of the job is the horrible pay and lazy managers, but if you're a person who doesn't have alot of financial responsibility and doesn't care about career advancement, then you could give it a try."
good,I typically spent my day filling orders and assisting customers with any questions or concerns they had. I learned how to handle different types of situations that may arise at any given time. Management had favoritism among certain employees. Many of the other employees were pleasant to work with. The most difficult part of the job was fixing technical issues while completing orders. I enjoyed the interaction that I had with the customers and had gained many loyal customers of my own.
good,"I was an overnight pharmacist here and I loved my job. I loved working by myself and taking care of patients, one customer at a time. It was a 10 hour shift, but I loved every minute of it."
good,"My experience at Walgreens was okay. I enjoyed some of my times with co-workers the most. I learned how to provide proper customer service, use a cash register, and deal with customers in stressful situations. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my managers. At times I believed they asked me for more because I'm a pretty nice guy. Unfortunately, this lead to last minute schedule changes and a lot of long nights with less performing co-workers getting better shifts. I learned how to manage short-term tasks at a very fast pace along with dealing with customers with critical expectations. I enjoyed learning at this job and wanted to learn more but I didn't get all I was promised due to the managements disorganization."
good,There is hardly ever any down time with this position. Something is always needing to be done. Working with the customers plays a big part in this position. Learning the ins and outs of this type of business has been interesting.
good,"It's retail. Retail is not a fun time for most people because you have to work with the public. Anytime you have to work with the public, it can be very difficult, especially the general public. As a certified pharmacy tech, you would expect to get some respect from at least your peers at Walgreens. NO. Most of the pharmacists treat the technicians right because they know that without them, their job would be a lot harder than it is, but once in a while you get that pharmacist or pharmacy manager (even district manager) who thinks that technicians are less human. Also, you get a lot of emotional basket cases coming through the door who decide that you personally are out to get them for no apparent reason. If a customer has had a bad day, or they are old, or a drug abuser, they will find you. They will throw all their emotions at you. You will have to jump through flaming hoops to get their insurance to run. They will hand you expired drug coupons, knowing full well that they are expired and call corporate on you for not allowing the coupon to go through. This is Hades, this is Walgreens. And with the current cutbacks at the district and store level, giving really horrible managers even more power, this is one of the worst companies to work for now. It was good clear up until around 2008 but it has gone down hill fast after they decided to start trying to cut corners even though they shove customer service down your throat with a feeding tube and NO lube. They take away employee benefits, the ability to advance, cut hours and STILL expect you to give the very best customer service."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job were interaction with customers from differents cultures and behaviours. I learned a lot about they differents tendancies and attractions in differents contexts(nutritions,cleaning,marks...)"
good,The culture varies greatly from department to department. Wouldn't go back.
good,I clock in on time and take care of my duties as a SBA. I learn how to attract a customer's interest to suggestive selling products as well as merchandising. Part of my job as an SBA is to let the beauty advisors know what to do during their shift for the following day. My co-workers a customer friendly and polite. The hardest part of the job is making unsatisfied customers happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I can merchandise my department in my own creative way.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for unless you are in an entry level position. The managers are usually rude and blame their issues on you.
good,"co-workers are great, great customers, enjoyed helping the public"
good,Walgreens was a fun place to work. The only reason I left there was because I was offered the job a Evans
good,Management and co-workers were average. I learned a lot about retail by being employed here.
good,"Working at Walgreens I learned a lot. I started out just a cashier,and a year later I'm a senior beauty advisor. I learned how to merchandise and how to set up my displays in the right locations so they sell. Once I learned the basics, like how to sell my make up and get customers to return, I was given the position of senior beauty advisor. There I was in complete control of my department. I had a team beneath me that I had to keep motivated to sell and keep everything organized. I had to reorganize all the the merchandise. I turned that department from nothing into something to be proud of. Hardest part of the job was proving even though I'm young I can handle the huge work load. I loved changing something boring and slow into a booming place. Normal day consisted of paperwork, selling and making sure my red zone was good (the number of cosmetic items I ring up compared to the rest of the store), reorganize my displays, fill my shelves, help customers, and reorganize my makeup wall."
good,"I didn't work here long enough to get a real good opinion of working here. While I was there though, I enjoyed how everybody was willing to stop what they were doing to help me with a problem I was having."
good,Productive and constant
good,"I enjoyed working at my current job, I have learned many skills that has better me as a manager and an individual. A typical day in retail isn't typical, one must learn to think quick on their feet, come up with a way to make customers satisfied and learn to work with different personalities."
good,"entering keying rx's, interactions with customers from all walks of life"
good,"basically working at Walgreens was not as bad as i thought it would be. my fellow co workers were very helpful when you needed it. the boss seemed to have more organization skills than i thought they would have. You walked in, they gave you duties for the day which kept you busy for the most part during the day. Nobody was really obnoxious or anything like that, they seemed to be helpful and kind. i would recommend to someone if they were thinking about working for this company."
good,Pretty busy all the time. I learned to run the Photo Lab. Didn't care much for Management. Most of my co-workers were pleasant to work with. The hardest part of my job was dealing with management. Not to much enjoyable. It was just a job.
good,Daily customer interaction. Problem solving techniques are used frequently throughout the day. Management are very reserved. Co-workers are usually peers and homely.
good,"Although customer service is why we do this, it seems that if you can't met the expectations of corporate numbers then you trend to be frowned upon. If only they would allow 2 full time techs to work together. Then training would be better, as I received hardly any good training."
good,"A typical day at work could range anywhere from working with cash reports and ordering from vendors to calming down irate customers and fixing a broken computer. I learned from this company as far as how to deal with co-workers and customers, how to manage with an even balance between professionalism and, for lack of a better word, friendliness. The bits of creative freedom I was allowed over the years after proving to supervisors that I could merchandise and sell things with an aesthetic presentation were easily the best parts of the job. The hardest part of the job had to be the sudden halt in the ability to move and grow with the company."
good,"The employees have all been at the store for so long, they are uninviting to all of the new employees...very rude. Also, if you go even 1 minute over your break they make sure to point it out. The store manager is very rude."
good,This was my first job so I had alot of likes and dislikes. I was still in school but yet I had to stay every night til midnight to 1am cleaning and getting the store done when another school aged girl was able to leave early without finishing what she needed to do. I think they played favoritism alot there as I was basically the only white female there and always got the worst hours or no hours at all.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and the rewards of helping customers find the items that suit their needs. A typical day at work is meeting/greeting customers and assisting them in locating specific items, then checking them out at the cash registers. In between helping customers there is basic inventory, stock replenishment, display set ups, cleaning and maintenance of store appearance. The managers are mostly a very nice group to work with although the general mgr tends to be rather temperamental, does not always follow through with promises made and doesn't communicate well. The hardest part of the job is the changes always coming to the company that reduces our pay, messes with our vacation time, and being asked to comply with policies that could cause us to lose a large amount of our regular customer base."
good,"Learned a lot first ""career"" Long hours on salary. A unwritten rule of you can't leave until 15 minutes after the boss leaves even if you have been there hours before he or she."
good,Not a bad company overall. Distributions centers vary in policy and are inconsistant. best practices are not shared. The pay is competative or better.
good,"A typical day is just work through the day, but you learn a lot if you are hard working. Management is OK they give different training to all staff ""People learning plus"". My co-workers liked me because I was hard working and also assist them when they need my help. The hardest thing for me is climbing a ladder to put stuff up the shelves.I always delegate that to other staff member and stay behind them till they finished it."
good,Co-workers are very helpful.
good,"Ran reports on a daily and weekly basis, as well as placed orders and inventoried daily. Other duties included: typing and filling prescriptions, in addition to calling insurance companies and doctors offices for authorization and, or verification of pertinent information that was needed. Placed and received orders. I Handle training of all new employees in the Tempe location. I enjoyed helping people in need."
good,Working at walgreens was an OK job. The customers are rude and don't understand that everything is not our fault. The managers are also very rude and don't every seem happy about helping the customers. The Co-workers are lazy and spend their time in the back room goofing off. Even though i had a set schedule they would continuously call to see if i could work when they knew i was unavailable.
good,Wasn't too bad of a job if it hadn't been for the store manager. I only took the job so I could work day shift but after I was hired I never got a day shift unless someone called in. When I confronted the store manager he said that the schedule was set before I was hired and he wasn't going to change it. So basically he lied to me during my interview when I explained I needed to work days and he said the evening shift would be temporary. I will never fall for that again! The job itself I enjoyed. I liked doing resets especially if that one manager wasn't there hovering and complaining about every little detail. I got along great with the rest of the staff and managers and would work there again under a different store manager of course.
good,typical retail job. Learned how to multitask and problem solve.
good,Persons who want to become cashiers:
good,"I work with discharge planners, social workers and physicians to assist in the discharge of patients. I enjoy meeting other members of the healthcare team to provide optimal care for the patients."
good,"During my years working for Walgreens Pharmacy I learned alot about customer service, efficiency and maintaining proper inventory. Advancement with this company was for myself easy given good productivity and adherement to company rules and regulations with in Virginia Pharmacy Law. I enjoyed my time with Walgreens and will forever be thankful for the experience and knowledge I aquired."
good,Working with a diverse and often times foreign clientele has helped me hone my customer service skills.
good,"The job was ok, but not too happy with the store manager. He was kind of harsh to me on my job."
good,"I have been at Walgreen's for almost four years. I have learned and gained a lot of experience in managing employees. I am in charge of making weekly schedules, viewing prior week sales and ordering proper inventory for upcoming warehouse deliveries. I also head the customer service aspect of our Walgreen store. I ensure my employees are offering the best customer service as possible. I am also in constant contact with my Pharmacy to make sure everything is running smoothly and I will help out when needed."
good,Really impacted my life.
good,"easy going, team work, overtime is available, friendly staff. good benefits"
good,Worked there for six months was promised the world and then some. Did I ever see any of it? Of course not. I had better customer service skills so the kept me up front and low pay. The job was below my capabilities.
good,"a day at work would be getting the photo machines up and running. also take customers. i learned to respect other people and their needs. management would listen to me for projects to improve the lab. but never agreed to any of it. the hardest part of the job was to keep the machines running,as they needed cleaning inside and out.the most enjoyable part of the job was to make the customers happy with their pictures,and that made repeat customers. they liked my personality,and willing to help them."
good,"My daily routine goes from cashering, working cometics, working warehouse on delivery dates, and floating. I have learnrd that team work and patience a asset you need to already attain when working here as I have already hade plenty of experience surpasing most of the employees, who move on to get promoted, you have to constantly remind some, on how procedure works, and count money, and especialy how to work stock. The majority on the co-workers are mature and decent hard workers, the Walgreens I work at on the Las vegas Strip, is nothing like the Walgreens I transfered from in Chicago. Here the younger employees cause way to much stress, and tension to work. And I would have to say this is the hardest part of the job, there are those who take working, balancing life a serious matter, but to those who bring drama, and unprofessionalism to the work place, it's tough. So far the only enjoyable part of my job, is the customers I meet."
good,"A typical day is processing customers items, processing customers photo orders, maintaining store appearance, stocking if needed. Since I've been with the company I've learned more about processing customers transactions what not to do and what to be aware of when cash handling. The most enjoyable part of the job is speaking to and getting to know my customers."
good,Walgreens is a good place to start a career as a manager or supervisor. They pay was good but as time progressed more and more is expected. Once you become salary your hours go from 40 up to 65 hrs per week. Per hour you don't make much more than you did as an assistant. Demands and expectations are high and if you achieve them little praise is offered. You work ALL holidays and to schedule a vacation is very difficult. Even as a Store Manager you DM may deny many of your requests because the business needs outweigh your personal life. It gives you lots of experiences and you learn to multi-task and delegate but in the end the company has cut back its efforts of employee friendly to a Walmart approach. Sadly in the last 10 years it is not what it once was.
good,Constant flow of patients dropping off new Rx or picking up finished orders. Phone calls are a constant.
good,"A typical day at work includes walking the store and writing down daily task and goals that need to be achieved and then delegating those task to the employees I am in charge of leading. I also perform many other duties such as check in vendors, order inventory, do refunds and exchanges, and solve customer service issues. The hardest part of my job is the fact that I have to work many night and weekends. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that I get to interact with many different types of people and really work in a very comfortable work enviroment"
good,"A typical day at Walgreens entails helping customers first. Our number 1 priority is to make sure our customers are getting quick and quality service. The most enjoyable part pf my job will be the customers. I can always count on at least one customer telling me a joke or story daily. I enjoy working with a team of round welled people with different views. My managers range from the goofy guy to the strict one, this doesn't bother me any I tend to get along with whoever I maycome encountered with."
good,Received incoming calls from patients and doctors.
good,Management is very old school here and stuck in their ways. Change is very hard to come by.
good,"A very demanding job without the bonus of benefits or perks for hard working individuals. No room for experience growth, promotions usually given to college students and employees with degrees, but not available to veteran employees with years of experience. No compassion for family issues or emergencies."
good,"Everyday is different there is always something to do so I'm always busy . I've learned alot at walgreens like ordering merchandise, doing. revisions and resets, cecking in vendors and doing warehouse.The best part of my job is my co -workers you become family. The hardest part is too much work somedays and not enough time"
good,"I enjoyed my first 10 years at Walgreens. I learned a lot about pharmacy operations , pharmacy management, and all aspects of retail pharmacy."
good,"Walgreens is a company that was growing at an extremely fast rate in the mid 2000's and has since slowed down. This has resulted in several downsizing and restructuring measures, and job expectations for employees and management keep shifting. Compensation and promotion opportunities for management are not what they once were."
good,"Walgreens is a good company overall. The company is very stable and positioned for growth. That said, there is little room for advancement and the politics of the workplace are intense. I have seen people's careers ruined because one supervisor did not like them. If you need a job I would reccomend the company. If you are looking for a career, stay away. By the way I am an assistant manager."
good,"Though I have worked for this company for nearly nine years, I don't repsect the overall morale and mission of Walgreens because I do not feel they fully support or appreciate their employees."
good,"Walgreen's was a first foot step into work force job. Fast paced, nagging customers, and low wages."
good,"I Had been with Walgreens for quite some time. I've seen many ups and downs. However the company as a whole seems to be heading down the proverbial toilet. I knew of a upper management team member that was being over worked leaving no time for family. he left the company, apparently it was a new trend. Some Store managers I knew told me that the job was feeling less and less worth the money but they still needed to keep a roof over their families' heads so they stay. I guess the important things I should say though are this:"
good,"The company all together is easy going to work it. But management and customers are often times difficult. When customers are difficult to employees, management does not always back you up. They don’t always look at the whole situation, just as with the customer says, and you receive the backlash. Often times in specific areas, management is unaware of the traffic that comes to store"
good,There is little advancement. They would rather promote from outside rather than within. They expect more with less help. Payroll has been cut by 30 percent within one year.
good,You get great experience there to help move onto other things. Training in different aspects of the field so that you’re able to help in beauty or photo for example
good,"It is like any other retail or customer service centered position. Work is on your feet, and you must be able to stand for long periods of time. Mostly low pay."
good,"This is a good job for a young person beginning the workforce. The work is physical,and nonstop. The standing takes getting used to and the pay minimal. The job can be rewarding if you are looking to grow with the company. Management is goal oriented , fair and has an open door policy.The customers make the job worthwhile. You will learn retail and have good benefits."
good,"Very busy, always something to do.  Most of the training is computer based and very practical for on floor requirements. You are kinda thrown out there to fend for yourself. No breaks except short lunch. Store hours are long."
good,"The group of guys you work with will be some of the best minus the ego that comes with the senior group on first shift, some but not all. If you can deal with that the place is great, just do what you need to do to please the management and its a good place to work."
good,Great place loved working there wish I still did just my store sucked they switch management to much and some people just truly suck at managing. And leave it to Walgreens to have them as store managers
good,"Worked as a manager for almost 4 years and when I asked about raises and possible growth in the company, the numbers were not pleasing. I was pretty much going to be stuck making under 20K per year as the company had changed Managerial positions titles to pay them less money."
good,shareholders have highest priority.  Means they will cut your pay and benefits to increase shareholder payouts.  Have been reducing benefits for years.
good,Walgreens values employees and took care of everyone equally. Every day going into work I felt I was welcomed with open arms and got the help I needed to succeed.
good,Working for this company is great because of the connections you can make. Most of the people at the stores are enjoyable and pleasant coworkers.The only negative connotation is when you start in the upper management levels of this company. They value your work less and use you more like a pawn piece to fit whatever vision they have. Will easily inconvenience you if it works best for the district managers and corporate level employees.
good,"I would have enjoyed working for WG more if I felt I was fairly reviewed and they were better at staffing. They needed a technician assigned to answer the phones so the pharmacist’s time wasn’t taken up with it, taking away time away from patients"
good,Sometimes it’s just too much stress for the pay you’re getting. Good job temporarily but I don’t think it’s a long term workplace. Management is problematic in this location.
good,Although I no longer work there I think it is an awesome place to work at great benefits. But Annual reviews are very hard to get a raise. I meet a lot of new people. I've learned a lot new skills that I can use on my new journey at IHS
good,Walgreens when i first was hired was a great place to work for. Ever since they became merged with Boots Alliance they have really changed in the way they treat their staff. Especially anyone who for one reason or the other can't quite keep up with the increasing demands the company puts on you. No matter how hard you try you cannot please them. Don't make Walgreens into a career! Theywill us
good,"Sometimes the things are not done to the best of the employer, but we have extreme care for customers. They try and do things fair for their employees, but it doesn’t always work out"
good,"A typical day involves your typical pharmacy workflow process. How you handle customer service can really impact your experience. The more you put effort into customer care, the better response you will receive, which can yield an increased job satisfaction. Unfortunately, despite how well your performance is, the company fails to take value in employees."
good,"At some stores, you can basically get by while doing the bare minimum or nothing at all. The store really depends on how effective, and trained the store manager is. Walgreens has bs policies and excuses for how they treat their employees and how the store runs. Most likely will be doing everyone else’s job on top of yours while getting paid the bare minimum. Great job if starting out as a csa."
good,"Walgreens is the first job i had. It was great for an entry level job. I could never see anybody surviving off of how little they pay. The higher up you move, the worse it gets. Budgets are so small that shift leaders have to be the floor person, the photo tech, and the backup cashier. All while being management and going to pharmacy when needed."
good,"I really enjoy the customers and over the years many of the ""regulars"" great me by name when they walk in the door. "
good,Don’t get stuck here.  Use this job as a place to gain experience and then grow with someplace that values hard work with commensurate compensation and recognition.
good,Way too many things to do for the pay I got. Cashiers were expected to stock and be upfront at the same time. Was challenging because the store was often understaffed.
good,"I worked there to supplement my income while attending college full time.  It was a fast paced environment during the holidays, and slow to steady paced during the off season."
good,Easy to move up but it takes a long time to get the money you think you should get. Company making a lot of cuts so beware. As a manager your schedule can be very flexible just depending on your store manager. Some long days some doubles.
good,"I recommend Walgreens to people who need to start somewhere. It’s a stable place to be, but not ideal for the long run. I was lucky enough to have decent management at my store, but I know for a fact that it’s not the same at every store. Choose your Walgreens location wisely. Also, the pay is average to typical pharmacy technicians and the annual raises are pretty much nonexistent"
good,"Working for Walgreen's like all retail jobs right now is a never ending challenge on doing more with less. No vacations November - January for managers. Open 365 days a year regular business hours for the front end. Never boring, meet a lot of great people."
good,"Good place to work at it fun and like a giant family, and the opportunity to move up is there and everyone is treated with respect and the new programs that have been implamented help the employees out alot more now."
good,"They literally push people to their limits. They will tell you the last minute that overtime is mandatory. They do this almost every day and I feel like the managers and no concern or understanding that most people also have a home life. You are also have to work holidays WITHOUT holiday pay and most of the time they throw over time at you on those days also. This is not the reason I quit, I quit due to relocating. I worked at an walgreens warehouse."
good,"busy work environment"
good,"I have worked for Walgreens for eleven years, and the company is not what it used to be. The culture has changed so much, the corporate office what’s you to believe that the team members is the most important but really they just want you to give more and get less."
good,A decent job for anyone that needs a check. The work is not hard its mostly jait stockong the shelves and helping customers find product. Management can be very hit or miss.
good,You work long hours some days . I have worked a 8 to 10 hour days. Schedules change  frequently. Company is not as good has it used to be. It is a stressful working environment .
good,"All of the recent employees have been leaving because of the manager. She constantly does her job wrong and is able to keep it somehow. Supposed to move stores, but somehow manages to stay and never move."
good,"I worked for Walgreens for just over 2 years and have been a designated hitter since April of 2019. Had great love for my coworkers, but depending on the management at your store, you could either be in a nightmare or in heaven. After getting a new store manager, it seems like the store I’m located is a sinking ship. No one is being scheduled to their availability and some are getting shifts cut completely. I recommend Walgreens as a great starter job for customer service experience, but again management can make things difficult. It’s hard to balance work and social life as working here has made me beyond stressed ."
good,"It was a good company to work for at the time, that was a while ago, I do not know if things have changed. I do use the Pharmacy and shop there still."
good,It is decent.  You learn skills that are valuable for working with the public.  You can work nights and weekends.  Their insurance is good.  Its local
good,"Hours were not negotiable once you get your schedule. Nights are mostly slow, only one ""lead"" person and one or two cashier/stock people on. Some lead people hide in the office during shift leaving you alone."
good,"Saturated market, hard to get store placement therefore expected to be on call everyday.  Not enough resources to provide the high level of service that should be expected of a healthcare professional"
good,"The store manager at my store was pretty lazy, did not help much. There was so much theft. Benefits are only available if you work 30 hours or more a week. Many customers were a pain to deal with. If you have patience, definitely go for it! If not...it’s not highly recommended."
good,They expect a lot of u when u have to deal with customers a lot and want task done that aren’t in your area. manager payed no attention to how there assistant managers would talk or treat some coworkers. Some leads/assistant managers where not that bad. They don’t give many hours.
good,Big chain retail pharmacy is pretty busy and with usually not enough help.  Many small tasks and calls to make everyday.  Filling prescriptions and answering the phone are the majority of the day
good,"Fast paced environment dealing with customers stand 8 hours, once in a while handles difficult customers. Offers advancement depending on performance and attitude."
good,"I have seen far too turnover within lower management over my 16 months with Walgreens. 2 assistant managers requested transfers and 4 Shift Leads have all sought different locations or career paths, all due to the lack of character and work ethic of my store manager as well as the blatant favoritism, lack of consequences for putting in minimal effort while outstanding work ethic, and an unbalanced division of labor. I have have numerous opportunities to work overtime in other stores and was astounded at how much more comfortable all the employees were in their positions and how much more smoothly daily operating procedures were carried out. Work Ethic, Problem Solving skills and Critical Thinking skills were all overshadowed by tenure."
good,"Working for Walgreens isn't bad but I wouldn't say it is easy, if you follow every rule to the letter you would be fine but mistakes are not tolerated or ignored. I was management and it doesn't lead you much to have an everyday life, they pride themselves on the concept of being family but it's more of a blindfold to the truth they want you accomplishing almost unattainable goals. Keep customers happy, make sales, make sure everything is done and don't leave anything undone. They work to fire faster than hire."
good,Typical work day running the front register and going back and forth to photo. Hardly no help when you got busy. If someone did not come in you were expected to stay over
good,"My time at Walgreens started out quite easy. But as time went on, I felt more and more unhappy. My hours were quite random and I didn't have much time for anything else. When I got my promotion to a Pharmacy Technician, I got no real proper training. I also had to beg for my promotion since the store manager didn't believe I could ""handle it."""
good,"I was with Walgreens for over a decade, I worked in almost every field, worked in a few different stores/environments and became a shift lead for a couple of years as well. This company is very diverse, what you get will depend on your area, your managers, and your expectations. Walgreens did offer a pretty good 401k plan and insurance discounts when I was there, their pay was better than flipping burgers but not enough for seasoned workers to stay if they gain manager experience or additional skills/degrees."
good,Its ok. Just watch all your stats and time off. Very hard to get approved PTO. Same thing day in and day out. Lots of system problems to deal with not much info provided when something goes wrong or doesn't work.
good,"The benefits are sub-par, management is dependent upon which store you are at - could be bad, could be good, just depends. The hardest part specifically working in the pharmacy are people who do not work in the pharmacy (big business people aka Corporate) assign these various unnecessary tasks and expecting them to get done everyday along with the usual necessary tasks of a pharmacy i.e customer service, filling prescriptions, prior auths, consultations, taking in new prescriptions, drug inventory, answering phones, etc. In the grand scheme of things it is very unrealistic, and believe me everyone agrees from the pharmacists to the techs. Everyone except the suits of course. "
good,It was an ok job the people there were cool but the job demanded a lot from me while I was pregnant with my first child. Other than that I would work there again.
good,"Routine duties. Hard to get information for different job tasks. You have to be able to adjust to a constantly changing schedule. Store Manager was a difficult person, but usually the Assistant Managers, Team Leaders, and Floor employees were pretty nice people to work with. Great customer service is a priority."
good,"very busy, sometimes stressful dealing with insurance companies.  you have to be a multi-tasker to work here. overall a decent place to work, co-workers were helpful, be ready to work on weekends"
good,"9 years of creative enjoyable work.  Many opportunities to learn.  Unfortunately changes were made that eliminated some positions. "
good,"If it's your first time working period then it's an ok job. If you have experience, I would say you're probably better off somewhere else. Pay is garbage, benefits are good, coworkers were great, management sketchy, hours suck unless you work morning shift and the raises are really garbage. They expect too much with little help and little pay. Advise: a happy employee, a customer"
good,"I worked night shifts at Walgreens and it was pretty laid back. We had our list of duties to get done each night and we basically just went to it until a customer was ready to check out then we would go take care of them and get back to it. "
good,"clock in, greet customers, offer help, check them out. when its not busy you just stock, tidy up, or put up displays. co workers were nice and we always got breaks."
good,"I've only worked at Walgreens a short time, but I wasn't exactly trained completely, and wasn't kept in the loop when it came to my schedule. Management changed frequently and caused the scheduling to be weird. Eventually I wasn't being given ANY hours, and the only explanation I got was that budget cuts were being made and they had to cut hours from the ""front-end"", which is the only end I've been trained in and given. The people were very friendly to work with though, and for a first job, it was fun and fairly simple. I just wish I was given more training and attention."
good,"Walgreens firstly was a great place to work, routine days, moderate work load, cross trainings and teaching, employee appreciation /recognition, etc. Now there is no push from management for advancements through trainings and each day alters with constant ""what if's"" and variables in play such as (employee call out, lack of products and instructions, time scheduling, etc) and all for an hourly wage that does not fit the criteria that must be must on a day to day basis."
good,"Walgreens was centered around team environment and offering exceptional customer service. Overall it was a fairly satisfying place to work, with a nice team culture."
good,"Working for walgreens was ok, shift leads were rude, had to pick up pace for old co-workers and really never had time off the pay wasn't very good either."
good,"no raises for pharmacists, they try really hard not to give regular employees raises either, the managers are told not to rate above a 2 or 3 out of 5 on yearly reviews"
good,"Competitive work place, there are options for career paths. They do in house training for most positions. Fast paced and always busy, time goes by quickly."
good,"I love to work in Walgreens, except for the payment. It's a good place to start, learn and then keep going. They have breaks, offered a great discount to the employees and the culture job is ok, unfortunately the benefits are not great, neither the salary."
good,"I was a manager for Walgreens for 30 years. I was always treated fairly, but it was not a fun place to work. Corporately so man payroll hours were cut, it made it impossible to do your job well."
good,Working at walgreens would make the day drag. The management would go ghost for the day and leave. Customers were rude and would make messes. Nine dollars and hour was mot enough considering they dont give you enough hours to live from.
good,"Many odd characters would be hanging around store, calling the cops to the location to pick up shoplifters was a regular occurrence. Seniority plays a huge role."
good,A lot of work and no time to spend with family. Scheduled evening to close and next day morning to evening with 30 min lunches between. 7 days a week.
good,"Although it seem like it may be a great place to start a career, it really isn't. The managers play favorites and will promote other employees who haven't been with the company very long over employees who were there for years and trained the employees who got promoted."
good,"A typical day at work requires filling medications, working the drive through, and updating patient records in the computer. The hardest part of the job was finding something to do when it wasn't busy."
good,"I worked at a ghetto walgreens, continuous theft from customers and no response from management. I've been threatened numerous times and harassed by customers that come in. I believe if you can get at a walgreens in a good area you'll be ok and may actually enjoy the job. I don't think walgreens was meant to be as stressful as my job was. The days are long and work can be boring if you are a cashier and that's all you do which is what I did. Scheduling was terrible as you don't have a set schedule or even days you work unless you're in school you will work any shift the store manager has any day of the week. Not even managers have set schedules. It is pretty easy to become certified as a pharmacy technician and to move up within the company. The work I did when I got the chance was nice but lazy coworkers always trying to find an excuse to not be behind the register really kept me from doing what I knew I was capable of. I don't mind working but being surrounded by lazy people is a vibe killer. Couponers aren't a big problem unless they don't know what they're doing. All in all its ok but like I said if you apply just make sure you know the area of the location you are applying to because I believe it will make a difference on how you view working their. Also walgreens is open 365 days a year"
good,I was going for this job with the intention of working as a pharmacist one day. After this job I decided to change my mind. The job is only suited for certain people who are quick learners. For me I was a slow learner when they needed someone who could pick things easily. I was completely fresh as a pharmacy technician.
good,"I love my job but there is a lack of communication, when opportunities for advancement/position become available they don't ask their current employees first before just hiring new people, also they cut hours without warning or letting you adjust to be able to pay your bills."
good,The work environment was very stressful but I did learn things on the job. It was a different experience but the location I worked at was very unorganized and the management was planning on relocation which disrupted the flow of the job. Many of the workers had attitudes or disrespected the pharmacist on shift which was disrespectful. The job was chaotic to say the least.
good,They don’t really listen to you when you make a point that you can’t always close. They won’t work with you to change your hours so you can realistically work and sleep.
good,Since I only worked part-time my interactions with a majority of the employees was minimal. The most of the employees I came in contact with are friendly and work as a team
good,Overall Walgreen's is a very easy place to work. I have been there 4 years and am still making minimum wage. They say because minimum wage increases every year that that is the raise. They seem to hire outside the company for any manager positions.
good,"a techs typical work day for the locations I worked at it wasn't uncommon for the following:"
good,I was able to get hours in between my college class hours and was able to take off for my college games. I had both good and bad managers while working there but that is always how it goes with part-time college jobs in my opinion.
good,"The hardest part of this job is finding a staff who will work."
good,"I worked for Walgreens for 10 years and from the time I began to the time I left they had changed their vision numerous times. When I first began it was employee driven, and they paid the most out of all businesses around at the time, but by the time I left, they chose the route of putting the company first, with disregard to the employee. The work done as a pharmacy tech or as an assistant manager has not changed, but they chose to change names of the same positions and payed employees less or cap them and give them the same work with less help. It was disappointing but I learned a lot about myself, and I still hold a grudge for their decline in employee satisfaction year after year. I would not recommend this job if you think this is your forever career. Use Walgreens as a filler in your resume and learn from what its like to work hard and learn about customer service."
good,"It all depends on the management. I was very fortunate for management working with me with a college school schedule. The benefits such as insurance is terrible. There is paid maternity leave. Depending on how tier of the store and the location, like mine was a high tier in a bad neighborhood. There was a high turnover rate and I was able to move up very quickly. I was lucky working with a good team."
good,"I started my first official job here and that’s all it’s good for. This job could be for someone who wants a career but you have to know the right people. I transferred once and it was terrible because the management there favored certain employees and treated the others like nothing. Getting PTO can be challenging. Getting benefits isn’t hard as long as you’re not part time. There’s plenty of career options in Walgreens but trying to get promoted or even a raise can be difficult. So like my title states, don’t plan on a career or even a job here unless you’re good at networking."
good,"The staff and environment are great. But the customers in this field can be challenging to deal with. Also, the pharmacy is still subject to retail environment which means the hours are usually not plentiful."
good,".standing all day."
good,"Inadequate staff leads to a stressful environment with a mountain of work that is not feasible to finish within the hours of operation especially on a busy day. Good environment to work, the pharmacist and technicians are willing to help each one another. Communication is key to not fall behind during a normal work-shift. Dedicated pharmacy technicians can make or break the pharmacy. Finding replacement when a technician calls out sick is near impossible, and the pharmacy is required to operate at the same efficiency with limited manpower."
good,No promotions for growth they don’t even allow you to transfer if u have to leave the location I just believe if they would communicate more with their employees and make them feel more appreciated they wouldn’t lose so many good workers they definitely have their favorites and rules only apply to a selected few
good,"It is a good college job. I enjoyed the people and the pay was decent, I didn’t think that the hours were compatible with having kids and we had two kids in two years and we moved so I had to quit."
good,"A typical day for an order selector is filling store orders, helping coworkers with orders, keep clean working areas. Can be extra busy during holidays, but then slows down to normal hours."
good,"The job was very repetitive with daily tasks and was never switched up. At the location I was at, employees were never treated with kindness or received recognition."
good,Lower employees do all the work dont get paid enough. And the manager constantly complain even though they dont do anything. Employees work constantly and continue to be talked down to. But your coworkers always have your back and help out whenever needed!
good,"Everyone is very friendly although they can work relatively slow at times, if you are newer they will schedule you for every holiday and other employees time off."
good,I loved the work load. It taught you how to work alone in a faced paced retail work culture. Along with learning different department so make you more useful in other section of the store.
good,"Walgreens was a good first job, but it was too slow paced for me. I am a people person who likes to interact with others and likes to go at fast paces so this job just wasn't for me."
good,Company varies based on district. Tends to be driven by district culture instead of overall company goals. Small staff so make sure you float for a while before settling on a store. Store dynamics are critical to your psychological well being.
good,"Some managers were great, others were not. Even though i had requested certain days to work, after a couple months I gave up trying to let them know that I only wanted to work certain days. The job itself wasn't bad and had nothing out of the ordinary for a cashier job, though I couldn't wait for the days to just be a stocker. The nights and evenings were super slow and boring."
good,You go in every day knowing exactly what to do. The problem is that the people who have seniority tend to make you feel like less of a person. The job is pretty easy as long as you pay attention and do what you are supposed to. The environment can be fun sometime too!
good,"Lifting heavy"
good,"Some days i thoroughly enjoyed my job, other days can be stressful and very draining, whether it be lack on cooperation from upper management or the constant working nights and weekends."
good,This has potential to be a good place to work but management and pharmacists have difficulties with scheduling fairly. We are over worked and compensation is not fair. Also there is a lot of drama.
good,"Overall good benefits, decent pay if you are part of leadership. Sometimes management are pressed to get things done, so more workload comes on you. They cut budgets all the time."
good,The associates are always very friendly. The communication in stores could be a lot better. Daily tasks aren't assigned to specific people and tend to fall through the cracks. The verbiage they use is different than any other company I've ever worked for.  They assign PPL's (computer training) but never account for time in the schedule to actually complete them.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when I am able to meet the need of a patient in compounding a drug that aids their recovery and they express their gratitude.
good,"Walgreens doesn't mind to ask for the sun, moon and stars, however they do not give you the resources to achieve results.  Computer systems work half the time.  Budget cuts one after another.  They have a strong customer focus however they do not show they care for their employees anymore.  Bonuses are basically non-existent in the last two years.  Some employees not even getting yearly raises.  High stress environment.  If you like stress its the job for you."
good,Walgreens is a secure company but managers are expected to put in extra hours above and beyond normally scheduled work hours to complete tasks leading to poor work/life balance. Most pharmacists also do not get a meal break and work 12 hour shifts.
good,I wish Walgreens would have never bought out Rite Aid! Walgreens do not treat their employees fair. They under compensate their employees with slim/ no advancement even after 15 years!
good,Too much hectic work environment with insufficient help. But if you have enough tech working then it is good. Benefits or vacation add up with  years of work
good,I like my job and all the things I get to do for customers and my team. I dread going into work at times due to the work-life balance. I have a lot to manage outside of work and it gets hard at times not being able to have that balance.
good,Do your job like a robot and you will love this job! Absolute terrible training and unqualified management. Pay was good. But no since of any type of family atmosphere.
good,"Nice, easy minimal work. Good starting rate per hour. Management were friendly & pretty understanding of a student schedule. Awesome way to work on communication skills with customers and co workers"
good,I loved my team and managers the only things that weren't great would be the customers and how they treated us in the area (city)  we worked. The most enjoyable part was that I was able to ask questions to my managers and get detailed answers or even examples if I needed them.
good,"Working in the photo department, expect multitasking and working at a fast pace.  Customer service, cashiering, processing photo orders, passports, not to mention stocking coolers and freezer.  When closing, all of this is required, plus working on warehouse totes, stocking merchandise and then facing your department and working on returns by the end of the night.  A lot of work is expected for little pay.  You do however get your annual evaluation and usually get a raise, not much though.  In the 6+ years I worked at Walgreens, my pay went from starting minimum wage at $7.25 to less than $10 when I left.  Customers and employees make the workday fun, however management isn’t great.  A lot of favoritism when it comes to scheduling and getting days off.  Sometimes I would close from 5pm-12am and be scheduled to open the next morning at 8am."
good,I am very thankful for the opportunity I have had with this company. I have a gained a lot of experience. I have grown a lot within the company and I and ready to experience new things.
good,"Working with Walgreens has been a pleasant experience. The best part of the job was the employees I worked with. While the work was tedious and repetitive, the team members felt like family and were supportive and helpful."
good,You never know if you are working 8 hrs or 10 hrs. Plus side is you never have to work more than 10 unless you volunteer. If you go in a do a good job they will use you to their advantage and put you on busy lines all the time and you never catch a break. You only get 36 hours of sick time a year. And you work towards your paid time off .
good,"work is ok if things would be followed through as told they would be. "
good,Walgreens allows you to have flexible hours and the work isn't too difficult but they could have better store hours for employees. I would recommend this for people in school.
good,The focus on growth through aquisition resulted in a shift in priorities towards reducing labor costs and increasing productivity during high profits.
good,"Good place to work. If you like dealing with customers, this is the place to be. Flexible scheduling and great customer base. Good opportunities to move up in management."
good,"It's OK. A wide variety of people with different skill levels. "
good,Walgreen's give you a lot room to growth with the companies but sometime that is the hard part about Walgreens is that one you get promote the pay is not that much better.
good,shift leads are under paid and over work if u work for the company try to get a store with hours so u can have your staff to back u up with the work load other than that the people I worked with waa great and if your store doesn't have hours you are allowed to work other stores on your days off the company offers paid time off good discount just upper management can be very lazy and put all the work load on shift manager. over all it's a good company the work with u if your a parent or pregnant
good,"I loved working for Walgreens at one point in my life, then all the changes come.  I adapted for 19yrs with the company.  I will say working for this company the last few yrs,  was when I decided that this company wasn’t for me anymore"
good,"Walgreens has many stores within 5 miles of each other, I made myself available to work at whatever store was short handed, I worked as cashier, pharmacy tech, helped set up new stores and did inventory."
good,The best part about my job is being able to have an impact on patient's lives. I love being able to get to know my patients and help them with anything that they may need. Building that rapport with my patients is important to me in order to help establish a good relationship with them.
good,People very nice to work with. everyone gets along and gets the job done. can get very busy but everyone helps each other out. very nice job if your a young adult
good,"Easy job, general public is frustrating to deal with at walgreens. Pay is minimal. Advancement is hard, SM usually hire outside hires. Day time hours are tough to get as well."
good,The job met my needs at the moment. My hours of availability were always changing at the time so it met my needs. The pay was better than most places.
good,"You have to work more hours to get more paid time off."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with and helping patients in the pharmacy. I loved being able to resolve insurance issues and make prices more affordable when possible.
good,"Walgreens was a nice place to work temporarily. They tend to overwork you and not be the most flexible with your hours. I felt like I had four jobs in one, but only got paid for one. Many times I came home at 11:30 when the store closed at 10:30 because of the lack of organization for closing hours. The management can really make or break your experience at this job, they can cause the atmosphere to be very tension filled and stressful than needed, and unfortunately I experienced that along with the stress of having to deal with an unnecessary workload other than the position I applied for. Don't get me wrong, the shift leaders were a joy to work with, but the managers were insanely rude, passive aggressive, and arrogant, It's like they went out their way to make you feel uncomfortable. The only good thing that really came out of this job other than the pay is that I really learned how to work under pressure and deal with issues the best I could without help. The management didn't like to help that much."
good,"Typical day was helping customers in an extremely busy store. I love customer service, but when we don't have hours it starts to get ridiculous. Burns people out. That said, I still love it."
good,"Walgreens is a great job to get you started in looking for careers, you learn a lot of customer service and problem solving. the down side is that the management is not very good and the managers don't seem to really care for the employees and just care about getting work done."
good,Handful of employees are very lazy and dont wanna do anything but get onto those that do work hard. will work you very hard for little pay your getting.
good,"Company has changed its core values with team members since the company became Walgreens Boots Alliance. The culture that Walgreens has been converting to is only masking the true nature of the company. The company seeks to reach efficiency through a method of problem solving from the bottom up. Alternatively the company is seeking team members to resolve issues in the most cost effective manner. This entails higher output at lower cost, great for the company but taxing on the team members."
good,Helping customers putting in scripts for medication orders helping customers ringing up customers answering phones putting away drug order getting prior authorization for prescriptions
good,Walgreens would be an amazing first job for anybody in high school/college. While I couldn't see it being made into a career. The shifts are reasonable for the pay and the only real complaint I have is the drama in some stores.
good,They had great benefits you only needed a 12 week average of 30 hours to get them. They have a lot of favoritism here. I've seen a store associate move up to store manager in a few years. I tried getting back into pharmacy for almost a year and they kept making excuses. The manager i worked for seemed to favorite his day crew over his night crew.
good,Productive environment working with customer no paid off days or sick pay no paid vacations no insurances no 401 k slow pace some times breaks are like 30 minutes
good,"The job is an easy enough job, not a lot of stress involved here. However, I've said it once and I will say it again: This company does not care about it's employees in the slightest. Expect to work every holiday for very little pay."
good,Work was okay some other workers were trying to be intimidating and judge mental but it did not bother me I kept working with smile. I enjoyed helping the customers and stocking the shelves (stocking seemed overwhelming for others) but It was a learning experience for me. Organization is I display of beauty also it was fun even though at times the manager project himself as mean and rude it was still a cool work environment for me.
good,I do feel that when it comes down to there is alot of throwing managers under the bus to protect themselves. I did like the people I worked with. I was a big part in making it more of a family.
good,"The location I was at was poorly managed. the store manager was worried about all the wrong things. She rarely gave raises to those exceeding expectations and recognition was uncommon for those who have done a great job. Certain managers/shift leads continued to bs while lower paid employees were left with all the hard work. There was constant theft and there was literally nothing we could do about it bc of company policy, yet they will not hire security."
good,"Need to pay more to management and stop cutting staff and hours.Detail oriented position. The work day includes following lists and store appearance which is the fun part of the job as long as you are self motivated and take pride  in your work. Customer service can be difficult, but with the right manager that has your back and stands by your decisions you can enjoy this job."
good,"Fast paced, not enough help"
good,Work and life balance was horrible due to late afternoon and evening hours for every shift.  No permanent store was also a factor is the ability to train to further advance
good,"they are laid back, the hours are flexible, as long as you do your job and do it well it is an amazing place to work. Most employees are nice and you have chances to advance"
good,"Decent job, easy work. A lot of your work experience will depend on who your store manager is. Good health benefits pay rates could be a little more competitive."
good,"Learned a lot about Medicines and HIPPA policy as a Pharmacy Technician. Also got experience of retail by helping the sales floor of company. The most enjoyable day at work is every Saturday, it is Walgreen's inventory day. Whole team working together on inventory management and merchandising."
good,"It's a retail job, so there's not exactly much to say. Hours weren't very good, since schedules always were gouged during the summertime, so paying rent was difficult. Staff and coworkers were, for the most part, good, but the feel of corporate work is."
good,Never a dull moment. Walgreens always has something to do. It could be anything from helping a customer in photo to checking in a vendor in the stock room.
good,"Varying work loads, some days very stressful, other days very slow.  Not always properly staffed for the work flow.  As a general rule, all team members will pitch in and help in other departments.  A good place for an entry level job, but not a good choice for someone looking for a career.  Requires long periods of standing and several hours spend lifting crates and putting up stock which can be very heavy."
good,Everyday your behind and cannot even go to the restroom.  Management would just say we can replace you.  Seems the management task were more important than the customers daily.
good,"Answered phones and assisted with customer questions, processed orders in a timely manner, verified insurance coverage, greeted customers at front counter and completed transactions"
good,"I learned a lot about the retail business, I enjoyed shopping there so I knew I would love working there. Very fun and productive enviornment to work in. Store managers were nice and friendly."
good,Working as a photo specialist was fun because you got to process and look through photos people brought in. The only stressful thing about that was some people didn't understand that if you have over 1000 pictures you took on a vacation that the machine literally doesn't print that fast even though the signs all over the photo department say 1 hour photo.
good,I enjoy my job at Walgreens. I’ve learned a lot & have met a ton of interesting people. I advanced quickly & worked very hard. I encourage my co-workers to always do there best.
good,"Typical days were stressful as you mainly deal with sick customers, but overall a good work environment. Nice management but little opportunity for pay increase."
good,Not enough pay for so much work! but overall would recommend to work there for only a year to get enough experience at customer service. Depends on what store you are working and who is the store manager as well.
good,Loved the people I work for but the store managers are not that great. With the exception of a few. There is something always to do but the training in how to do your tasks is not there.
good,This company is a good start for a pharmacist seeking to develop skills in a community/ retail setting.  The pharmacist learns multitasking skills as long as service improvement in work environment.
good,The staff is awesome. They respect that you have a life outside of work. The only issues I have with the company are that there is sometimes a lack of hours for the pharmacy.
good,Walgreen is a customer friendly store there isn't a lot to say about them it gives you a fast-paced work experience and sometimes is unfriendly but the main cons are at work break and poor management.
good,its a lot you have to do on top of your daily task. you only get promoted because favoritism.barly have time to spend with your family. open and closing shifts during the week.
good,"It has been over a decade since I worked for Walgreens, and I am sure things have changed since I left. It was a good starter job for me, as it gave me skills I may not have gotten elsewhere."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens  it was never to hot or to cold every one was always so nice and willing to help when anyone had questions and when they didn’t know they would help you find someone who could help you
good,"The staffing is minimal both for pharmacist coverage and ancillary support.  Staffing for most work functions are geared to how much management thinks is the maximum output an employee can can give for the longest period of time.  Both lunch breaks and short breaks are often non-existent or shortened."
good,This was a very fun work place to start. As management changes often it gets confusing to follow instructions. As well as policies constantly change with every new management team member.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for but Be careful on telling your problems because they say open door policy but don’t practice it. Manager to bossy.
good,"I don't agree with alot. Too much to say, but I am tired. The comoany keeps taking things away, bonus and raises. Pharmacist work long hours, no scheduled breaks, no over lap, not enough help."
good,Negative upper level. No positive reinforcement from district manager and above.  Too many plans to micromanage managers. Too many meetings and not enough hours to run stores.
good,I didnt like this job because i felt so alone at the cash register all by myself. I also didn't like the fact that the schedule was done three weeks in advance.the store manage also rubbed me the wrong way.
good,Have a great team to work with. They are hardworking and strive to do more. Great patient interaction and dedication to patient care. Benefits are good.
good,Walgreens was boring and there was a lot of busy work. The pay was impossible to live on and the raises were ridiculous. I did however love working with the customers which was the one thing that made my job fun.
good,"There seems to be a culture of snobbery among pharmacy employees. I have worked for Walgreen's in both Oklahoma and Arizona, and this has been my experience in both places. Filling prescriptions can be a bit monotonous, but learning about different drugs, and what they do is interesting."
good,"assign techs their working areas, process scripts, count and pour, check outdates in assigned areas, process returns, bill insurance co. properly, order durgs, obtain prior auth., work with patient health files and their specialty durg orders, answering a multi-line phone system, send back overstock and expired drugs, assist patients with their needs, daily inventory and bi-annual inventory, put in work orders for broken equipment, coding bills, return to shelf prescriptions not picked up, filing, 5 minute meetings daily, 1 hour meetings weekly,prepare tech schedule for work week, run the register, call doctors for refills, call patients for prescription pick up reminders, assist with giving shots, train new hires and I hold the position of senior tech at our location"
good,"Great first job. Worked there when i was 17 as a cashier/ seevice clerk. Loved the people i worked with, but rarely if ever actually met the store manager. He was almost never around"
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I learned a lot and met a lot of influential people that helped me grow in knowledge as a pharmacy technician.
good,"I don't feel like out lining the many ways WAG is changing their company. Since 2015 the company seems to be going in a downward spiral, when it comes to their employees. They cut so many corners and expect more and more work to get accomplished"
good,I have learned a lot about individual people from working here. The company is an okay company but needs more work when it comes to employee recognition.
good,"Pay is low.   Getting a raise for hard work or going above and beyond your normal range of employment does not happen.  Annual raise is a maximum of 5% but does not happen.   All ASM's have say in the raise percentage.  If he/she does not like you,  you won't get a good review no matter how hard you work."
good,I worked for the company for 6 years and when my husband past away their was no empathy nor support from the company.  I was very disappointed with the lack of support.
good,"Where my direct management offered support and were great to work with. Corporate, not so much. They are prone to change things to how the staff is expected to work without much notice to the management."
good,Great company as you move forward with your career in retail as a junior leader. Understanding RX operations is critical in order to move into management and executive management.
good,It  Was A Very Big  Place With A Nice Staff And It’s Was A lot Of Good Life Experiences .I learned A lot About State Rules And Regulations. Always Come A Little Early So You can get Scripts Done From The Night Before.
good,Overall the company as a whole  should have better compensation to its employees as well as a better work/life balance. Promotions are rarely based on work ethic and more so who favors who. Way to much stress for the money
good,"I was hired outside the company, which they frown upon. I was pushed harder than I should have been. I excepted the challenge with a smile, because I loved my job."
good,You are handling issue after issue without enough support by technical staff.  The demands are so high on staff that there is a large turnover.  The best part is when you can talk with and help the patients.  The workplace culture is all about production.
good,It is a good experience builder for teen or student. It a fun job I enjoyed. But as time goes i needed to make more so i have to find another job to do
good,"The pharmacy is a decent place to work, however being over worked and under staffed makes working there stressful. I am very grateful for the vast pharmaceutical knowledge I've gained over the years. The opportunity for advancement exists but the process was extremely difficult over the years due to my professional relationship with the store manager and pharmacy manager across several different locations. The sheer number of locations across America are extremely convenient and make employee relocation easy."
good,"staff was fun great customers, the management could have been better but it was a job, I didnt get as many hours as i would have liked but it paid the bills."
good,The turn over rate and management was ridiculous. I was there 5 years and had 3 managers. There was no need to get to know my co-workers because there seemed to be a new staff every Monday after having the weekend off.
good,"Decent company but underpaid for the amount of work that is involved in management. However, job stability is good and the chances of being promoted are very well."
good,"there was a lot of favoritism between management and co workers "
good,"Expect a lot of work in the busier stores but if you don't apply yourself, show interest in learning, or at least TRY TO HAVE A GOOD DAY, then you're not going to make it. It's a great entry level job with some room for moving up but it requires a lot of input from you. I started at the bottom and worked my way to ASM. The only people who complain are people who are lazy, don't like to work, are ungrateful, or looking for handouts. It's an easy job with a great environment. I've had a great experience though sometimes stressful. "
good,"It was okay, compensation wasn't to great, gave you some good experience in the pharmaceutical department, and the photography department. Management is okay at best. good entry job."
good,Every store is different. A store manager who appreciates his/her staff will take a store a long way. Pay is not great for the work that is involved. The Shift Lead position is a management position that doesn't give management pay.
good,Wasn't the right time to work at Walgreens. Management seemed off. Daily job position was not consistent. Co-workers were friendly but overall wouldn't recommend working there
good,"To retain the employee's, pay them more.  Being a pharmacy technician is a unique knowledge.  Being able to take care of patients, type, deal with insurance issues, etc. is difficult and many can not do it.  Pay technicians more for the work they do."
good,Typical days are busy. Schedules are variable. Poor management some stores and good management at others. Job culture is okay. Some friendly employees.
good,I was very grateful for the experience and opportunity. It was an overall welcoming environment and the management team were very generous and helpful.
good,Walgreens is a large company. Sometimes large is not always the best. Difficult to maintain a relationship environment for your patients and customers
good,Great place to work if you are lucky to have good co-workers and or a good manager. I have been lucky to have both at the two stores I have worked at .
good,I would give it a 6 overall but I loved my coworkers and customer's . I also love going to different stores and doing the reset team when we remodeled I wish we could of have a reset job title with good pay like 10.50 per hour to do and I would have stayed and did that cause I loved doing that as well while working at Walgreen's
good,"Terrible management and zero conflict resolution abilities. Many employees would have troubles with store managers, and the district manager would do nothing to help, which resulted in many employees leaving or getting fired. With the management that is in charge, this place only cares about their numbers and not their employees."
good,"Most of the people I worked with were great. Work isn't too difficult. Pharmacy is a bit challenging at first but getting after getting used to, it'll get better."
good,I didnt like the fact that they cut the pharmacy program while i was working there hence why i'm not there anymore. lot of work for such a small store. most managers like to sit in the office all day
good,"It was a nice place to work, friendly yet sill very professional atmosphere. Loved the customer contact and helping them with various needs. Enjoyed working with co-workers and helping them to grow and be more productive members."
good,A typical day at work was not hard. The tasks are very simple such as restocking items and being a cashier. The management at my specific location was terrible. They were rude and made the store environment bad.
good,"I worked full time overnight shifts. This meant that I had a set schedule every week which was 8 nights on 5 days off from 10pm to 7am. Since we are paid every 2 weeks Overnight workers did their 2 weeks (4 days per week) in one setting."
good,If you are new and need experience then this is the place for you. Where i work it was fun but stressful because it was busy everyday and we hardly have enough employees. It can be stressful depending on the location.
good,"Typical day starts off checking your area,and seeing what the store manager has written in his/her assignment book,restocking merchandise in your area,helping front counter ring register for more than three customers, Print and process Internet and In-store Photo Orders,Pull bays and carts,end with clean up and counting money bundles"
good,"The job at Walgreens wasn't a bad job,  I enjoyed coming into work daily and did not drag my feet. The issue was pay and hours, and the lack of striving from the Store manager."
good,"It was interesting. I had a few really good co workers that I was friends with. I really enjoyed my night shifts, I wasn't too keen on the day time shifts."
good,Maintained a professional and compassionate demeanor at all times during extremely busy hours profile calls to ensure accurate insurance information is obtained for adequate transactions. Assist pharmacist in filling and filing prescription orders providing customers with knowledge pertaining to medicines that are being filled.
good,Management may act very nice and friendly however they pick and choose favorites and seem to provide benefits or advantages to people they like the most or see outside of work.
good,"My work was varied: from stocking shelves, to ordering supplies, to ringing up sales on the cash register, to greeting customers, to cleaning my area."
good,"I’ve worked for Walgreens for more than 15 years. (Part time) As of recent there has been major budget cuts, really hard to support a family when one week you’re working 30 hours and the next week you’re working 16."
good,"A typical day at walgreens consist of being cashier, stocking shelfs and making sure the area is clean.  Sweeping from time to time , greeting every customer that walks inside."
good,"We do alot of the work on night shift, and  deserve higher pay for all the work we have to do. 9.60 and being fulltime is not enough to live off of,paid every two weeks"
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting customers, and stocking merchandise. As well as, interacting with customers to meet sale goals. I gained confidence to meet new people with this job."
good,"I have the hardest time trying to become full time. Most of the locations only want to promote within the store so even if you are from another store, you most likely won't be placed in that position. There's a high turnover rate in the front end area and like any other job, there's not enough reliable help. My location is pretty decent on turn overs. I've been there for almost 2 years and I've seen 3 people leave."
good,"Being a Pharmacy Technician for a Drug store is much like being in the fast food industry, except you're serving drugs to your customers, most of the time the customer's insurance doesn't pay for the drugs, and usually you'll stay so busy, you won't have time to study for your classes.  Added to that was the fact that you were only allowed 30 minutes for a break, and it was not an ideal environment for balancing work life with personal life.  The only real benefit was that once your shift ended, you got to go home, unless the store manager needed you to help the night crew restock the shelves before they left for the night, easily turning an 8 hour shift to a 10 hour shift.  To conclude, try to find a pharmacy only place to work as a Technician if pharmacy is your passion."
good,It's a temporary job work place. Only to get some experience if your fresh in the working business. This wouldn't be the job if you have other priorities due to fixed scheduling.
good,Don't really have nothing to say about them I don't like that they are greedy and they don't pay welland they don't care if you get to spend time with family
good,"very hard wok, short staffed, work distribution was bad. they frequently used tactics to save money by cutting the hours. no chair to sit.standing long periods of time"
good,"- High-volume, stressful, fast-paced setting "
good,"The environment itself was the stereotypical retail store. You would have the bad customers and the good ones. The work itself was not too strenuous except on days when the truck would come to stock the store. However, the job itself was highly inconsistent with work flow. With the exception of truck, there could be days when the store is busy while other days you have nothing to do except stare at products and straighten aisles. I would have to try some days to appear busy."
good,Be prepared to work long hours and limited staff. Goals are unreasonable with no a lot of resources. Not a good company for the advancement of women especially of color.
good,"I worked at Walgreens through several transitions. The overall communication of this company is great. I experienced a time of great transition, as well as experimentation at a corporate level. My opinion may end up being the anomaly in this case."
good,You start out at $9 an hour its hard to live off that especially when you're not able to get the hours. You don't get paid sick days and you can only miss 6 shifts out of the whole year. It's an easy job but it doesn't really teach you any life skills other than communication and retail and that won't help you advance in the world into a career someday. So it's a good temporary job but not something necessary for the long term.
good,Walgreens is great to work for if you just need a job. The pay is on pay with other retail positions. The company loves entry level and people with a lack of a drive. Don't come in with hopes to learn transferable skills or advance though.
good,Store atmosphere makes all the difference in contentment. A good team makes a big difference in how easy it is to enjoy this job. Bad management makes the job seem not worth it.
good,"It is a good job for a student, but I feel like the management does not really care about you. They hardly want to work with your schedule even if you have school."
good,"An easy job with room to grow - if you can handle the fluctuation in hours. Can be stressful on busy days, hours are always getting cut, making busy days worse."
good,"I have been with this company for a long time.  There have been a lot of ups and downs both in my immediate work place and corporate wise.  When I first started with this company I was really excited to work there, felt like I mattered. Back then Walgreens was about the people that worked for them which in turn made the patient and customer experience wonderful.  However, that aspect of the company is long gone and sadly it has become like most corporations, about the bottom line and not about their people.  Store and pharmacy staffs are at bare minimum, if that. Personally, I do feel I am in a great store, after many years, I have a great management team and staff.  I have learned a lot from my current pharmacy manager who leads by example,  which is a principle I value a great deal.  I have always felt that I still make a difference in my patients health, that has never wavered despite changes in the valued metrics the company uses to rate performance. No matter where I go or if I stay with Walgreens in another state I will always put the patient first, no matter what metrics are affected.  At the end of the day, that is what my job is, to care for our patients. That is why I go to work, I enjoy my patients and the staff I work with.  All in all I do love what I do."
good,it was okay as a first job but wouldn't recommend it to anyone as their first technician job. It was overcrowded and the management was poor. Could be better with some team building.
good,job security is the best thing about walgreens. They dont just fire you for no reason. The company is moving away from caring about their team members to now just all about the numbers
good,Great customers and other techs. It is refreshing to build relationships with regular customers. Lots of changes happening at Walgreens. Not sure how the will turn out.
good,"I was often the only person working the registers, so the line would fill up on weekends and it'd be somewhat hectic for me. Worked there for 6 months with no raise. When you aren't checking someone out at the register, you're restocking the shelves, unloading the truck, or slapping coupon tags on shelves."
good,"Very busy high paced. A lot to learn with little training. Works around most schedule restrictions. Lots of opportunity to learn other areas of the store including,pharmacy"
good,"as a manager i had to learn everything. all manager duties , pharmacy things, unlocked shipments, rendering things or the store dealing with customer needs at all times. the hardest thing was dealing with managers that treated me unfairly and making me feel very uncomfortable ."
good,"I feel like walgreens is a pretty decent place to start learning about how to manage a job. Some days are busy and others can be peaceful. Depending on the shift lead/ manager, you can actually learn a lot of things pertaining to the job. Honestly the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers. If you can handle them, the rest of the work is very manageable."
good,"It's a very stressful job. It all depends on your managers and co workers. if you have good ones then its fine but if you dont then everything is terrible."
good,"overall the job is pretty nice for someone who is looking for that first job. It is a fun little place to work at. The customers are usually nice and so are the stff. You will learn how to stock, clean, and assist people with their daily problems."
good,"Walgreens was a great company to work for, they provided good benefits. They tried to maintain a good culture, it was fast paced and pharmacist had to take on a larger workload to compensate for technician hours that were constantly being cut."
good,"Over my two years I have picked up tremendous work experience at Walgreens. I was given the opportunity to have my first job.I learned every position at the store, including the pharmacy. At times it was very stable, slow and comfortable. And many times it was fast-paced, stressful, and inconsistent as I have had many store managers during my time. Other than low pay, those are the only negatives. The company is extremely flexible with work hours, they give great benefits and the employee discount came in handy a lot. I had a great time there."
good,"Very fast paced environment.  Have to be able to multitask with the phones ringing, drive thru, counter and typing prescriptions just to name a few. Overtime was available most weeks."
good,"Long hours, Mandatory Overtime, Poor Supervision, Lack of management, Everyone works as a team to get through the day, Some nice patients, Mostly Aggressive patients however"
good,Very focused on numbers and not so much on the staff and patients. Our store would constantly struggle to receive hours from management because we didn't do enough of X this month.
good,"You regularly straightened the store, processed customer transactions, unloaded truck, stocked shelves, process photo orders, all while exhibited excellent customer service.  I learned what it takes for a store to run properly.  The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers and customers.  I love helping people."
good,The management is flexible with your schedule and it’s easy to get days off but I would not recommend this being a forever job. At some point it gets boring and becomes unfair in scheduling.
good,"They aren't very flexible when it comes to scheduling.  if you need days off, they never want to give you days off they suck and the managers are mean and talk a lot of gossip about each other. making life very stressful, and the customers don't make it any easier."
good,The hours were never promised and my hours would drop way lower than what I was comfortable with and when I ask about it nothing was ever done. So if not recommend.
good,"A typical day for an ASM is to be responsible for every part of the operation of the store. You give direction for everyone in the store to follow, you plan to get ahead of trends, you merchandise and work alongside everyone else. You are responsible for the ""engagement"" of all team members and work environment. You are responsible for discipline and hiring. You are responsible for scheduling and payroll. You are responsible for everything to the point that a store manager need not exist other than to give you occasional guidance while you get paid less than them."
good,"Large company with little opportunity for advancement.  They have decreased their management positions in an attempt to decrease costs.  Recently, they became less transparent regarding advancement.  There is no longer a clear path for advancement.;"
good,Compensation is well depending on which Distribution center you end up at. The work can be exhausting but is for the most part compensating. Insurance is mediocre....benefits are dwindling down.
good,"All locations aren't the same. So what may work for my store may not work for another. The company allows you to work at different stores for whatever reason need be. So if your store is cutting hours, you're able to pick up hours elsewhere. There's a lot of requirements to upkeep while dealing with a patient at every station which sometimes can be overwhelming although required"
good,"If you like and understand retial then you will like Walgreens.  You work different shifts, holidays, nights and weekends and when they need you.  If you understand working hard and fast it is a good job."
good,"Learned a lot of different skills which included customer service, computer entry and cashiering skills.  Learned a lot about how a retail pharmacy operates."
good,Walgreens focuses on customer service at all times. Many displays that have to be done throughout the week. Weekly truck. Pharmacy experience and team leading.
good,"Work days are usually long and tedious. As a member of management, you did everything from stocking the shelves to all the merchandising in the store to back up cashiering. Best part of the day is being able to make your customer happy."
good,This job is for younger people with few bills. I am a very hard worker and was told that I would be promoted several times by management and never did. People in higher positions have been working for Walgreens for years and is only getting paid a dollar or more than me. I needed better pay.
good,I really don't have a lot of comments to make. The only hardest part of the job is long working hours and a very short break of only 30 mins if you are working a 10 or 12 hours shift.
good,"The shift leaders are hit and miss with their level of relaxation with employees. The wage for employees is set at minimum wage, but prices are higher than other stores like Walmart..."
good,"When applying for this position I provided my availability.  Upon interviewing I was told the hours I submitted would be honored.  I have three small children and I am a single mother.  I missed almost two full school years due to scheduling.  They call it ""fair scheduling"".  This means everyone has to work all the shifts to be ""fair"".  That defeats the purtpose of providing availability."
good,The true path to store management is clogged with previous hires. The company changed job titles  on their assistant managers and lowered pay as well.
good,"Walgreens main focus is on ""customer satisfaction"" so it is a very rough place to work if you cannot work at a quick and judgmental pace. Most are willing to help but hard to keep up with the various changes that are constantly coming up."
good,"Working for Walgreens had many benefits as well as down falls. With the right team, you can learn alot and go far. In the high volume stores it can take a toll on a person if they are not strong minded. Unfortunately the employees are not properly or fairly compensated for the amount of work, effort and time that is put into each and every job position."
good,I enjoyed my contract positions in the Walgreens Corporate Offices. I was a new college grad and enjoyed the level of responsibility. I didn't like the lack of training I received as my contract was ended with the first error I made unknowingly as I was not fully trained on the projects I was required to work on.
good,At my current store I feel that I am not treated fairly because I am younger so they think I am not as capable of accomplishing tasks. I have lost my love for the company due to the fact of the way my current store treats me and the hours they give me when I feel as if I am a hard worker and deserve more.
good,"As a technician, in my opinion, it's hard to stay here.  You do so much and handle so much stress, and you don't get paid well for what you do.  I went to a hospital setting and there was such a big difference in pay and environment."
good,"Typical day consists of loading and unloading trailers, scanning products in and out of the mods, restocking supplies, counting RX, and loading controlled RX in to trailers."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my customers in Cosmetics.  I miss them. Wlagreens didn't pay as well as they should've.  They should be closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas,  so employees can spend time with their families.  Good benefits and made friends while working there."
good,"Working at Walgreens was a good learning experience. The pay is not excellent, but the atmosphere is great. It was a relaxed place to work and I would recommend as a first or part-time job."
good,"upper management is cutting too many corners, cutting too much away from us in regards to budgets, tools to do our jobs and take care of our customers."
good,The managers and team members are driven to preform at a high standards but the operating systems are outdated.  The lack of  communication between managers and team members is a very stressful work place.
good,I had fun getting along with some of my coworkers and also some of the regular customers.  It sometimes helped me to feel like my time and effort was worth staying around and continue doing my job the best that I possibly could not only for me but for them as well.  The choices for management and choices made by management could have been a whole lot better but that isn't enough to paint the entire company in a bad light.
good,place was a good place to work and good hours and good pay.got along with other drivers and with manager.was physical but it was worth the pay and good equiptment.
good,"I had an enjoyable time working at Walgreen's. Very good managers and co-workers. Customers were rarely angry or disgruntled, and the hours were good. Walgreen's has a great policy for helping cashiers handling angry customers, the managers always supports the employee."
good,"Found Walgreens to be a decent company to work for overall. They worked with me on my schedule and were completely accommodating with regards to my other full-time work. "
good,I learned a lot about customer service and how to work with difficult people. I enjoy the fast paced to stay busy and alert. over-all amazing just besides main management.
good,"Walgreens is a great company if you would like to telocate and keep the job. senority is ko longer there, no one matters. Exploiting employees. Very little hours and poor pay."
good,"Worked Temporary for 3 months, and learned about dispatching and time submission for pay. "
good,"I've worked at two walgreens locations, one was full of life and happiness, bosses were awesome! The other was full of negative people and crooked management; so it really depends on the employees, and location of the store. "
good,Great place to learn and grow if management conditions are on the same page for growth and opportunity. Fun people to work with & a ton of different skill sets to learn.
good,"Your typical retail job - on your feet for eight and a half hours, customers are the pits, etc. In general employees are pretty welcoming to new hires, if for no other reason than because we're all understaffed and dying for help. You do everything here, cleaning, organizing, counting, repair work. We do the bathrooms. We do the floors. "
good,"I Found myself rather stressed out a lot, but that's just me. I wouldn't say its the worst place to work, but the distance from where I lived and the scheduling they had me on was just getting to be too much."
good,"Not the best for long term, meaning more than five years, there is opportunity to move up but not much, and the headaches that come with it make it vital to take a step back and really ask ones self if it is worth all of the pressure and lack of accomplishment."
good,"Huge company with no clear plan for the future, total disconect between corporate and the stores."
good,"Walgreens is like any other job you have good days and bad days. some managers are awesome and others leave a lot to be desired. The company offers great benefits and pay. Even opportunities to advance if you are on the sales floor. Most of the employees look out for each other like family especially in the pharmacy department. Hardest part of this job as with any job is are the mean and rude customers and having to hold your tongue. Best part is helping people feel better. They are usually very greatful. All in all, Walgreens more compensates you to put up with the bad parts of the job with a smile on your face. If I had to do it all over again yes I would work here again just a different location."
good,awesome place to work depending on the manager. very challenging and multitasking oriented. I loved my job for 9 of the 10 years I worked there. I wish I was still with the company but not at the store I left.
good,"As a shift lead it's very stressful and I feel overworked and under paid. There are people that are so unhappy they break down and cry. Walgreens wants the store manager to sit in the office or the pharmacy while everyone else runs around like a chicken with its head cut off. if I were to apply at Aldi which is a German owned grocery store chain I would get paid more there. Walgreens does offer benefits such as health, dental, vision, life insurance, and Profit sharing(401k). There is a fund to help employees who fall short on bills. Last but not least if you do apply and happen to have a nervous breakdown Walgreens will pay for 3 sessions for you to go to a psychotherapist. This company has really changed and has taken away so much merchandise I don't feel as though my job is secure."
good,"I've been with the company for awhile and of course there are always good and bad days but I overall enjoy my job. The stress is mostly due to the customers and how they react when things don't go their way. I enjoy it thanks to my coworkers who are like my second family. Management could use some work though, instead of freaking out over every little thing and stressing their employees out they could have our backs more when it comes to situations."
good,Working up front or as a cashier you tend to get taken advantage of when it comes to scheduling. They expect you to always be there when they need you. Very little wiggle room in scheduling. Not enough workers in pharmacy area.
good,The recent store manager at 09518 from June-current are horrible managers. They do not care about their employees. they do not appreciate your work ethic at all.
good,"Filling prescriptions for Pharmacist to check.  Cashier duties. Patient counseling. "
good,A typical day at Walgreens can be very slow paced depending on the day of the weak and the tasks are mostly very simple. I have learned how to provide great customer service from working here and the management team ensures that all workers provide the best service possible. I would say the hardest part of the job is making sure that everything gets packed out on time during the morning shift. The most enjoyable part would be organizing and cleaning the store.
good,"good place, but the pharmacists, like all employees, need a break to eat and relax. the pharmacist to technician ratio can be too high to protect the patients. there needs to be more overlap for the pharmacists - in the pharmacy - not in meetings."
good,"As long as youre at least a full time employee and your location has room for advancement, youre experience working for Walgreens will be enjoyable and beneficial."
good,"The company has changed drastically since they merged globally and then bought rite-aid. I loved this company but it isn't the same. Work was stressful, long, never-ending, and also typically fun. Management was, on average, good."
good,Walgreens is a large company totally invested in brick and mortar retail.  They talk about moving quickly but real decisions take a long time and go up and down the hierarchy more than once to gain final approval.  They do not embrace real change and are playing catch up.  They are making money due to their broad footprint stores.  Time will tell how they make it in a world where digital shopping is becoming king.
good,Walgreens had a pretty good training program.  It was disappointing that the actual way things were done differed greatly from my training.  I got to work all positions from pharmacy to the sales floor.  The biggest thing I disliked about the job was that there was never enough time to complete the required work.
good,I enjoyed helping all my customers and building trust with them as well as creating family environment place with all my co-worker's and great Teamwork.I will missed them all very much.
good,"It's a job. I like working for the company, but uncomfortable about pushing flu shots and surveys. It has flexible hours, but the store is short handed most of the time. With many open spots, tasks either don't get done or one person is expected to do the work of two or three people."
good,"I did the same thing that was done at Wilkinson Pharmacy. I had strong relationships with patients, physicians, and insurance companies. My knowledge of prescription medications helped me do my job effectively. The hardest part was managing my time between working from 3pm -11pm as well as going to school full-time."
good,pretty ok once you get use to the environment and how things work you'll be fine just at times things get a little stressful. my overall experience was ok but i did learn a few things and keep up the pace with whatever situation i was in.
good,"If you enjoy working odd hours, weekends, and holidays for average pay, this is the place for you. Lots of duties and responsibilities with not much of a reward. Less productive employees seemed to get just as far if not farther up the ladder than the harder working dedicated employees. Surprising that nepotism still takes hold for such a large company. Recall working Christmas eve till midnight and having to come in at 6AM on Christmas day."
good,"On a typical day you know what you have to do and just have to plan the completion of expected responsibilities along with providing good customer service. "
good,"Typical day at work was great. But I have learned that you will get better participation / cooperation out of a TM who wants to participate in extra activities than out of a TM who don't feel like being bothered with the extra activities. I understand the concept of ""Changing Culture"" and getting TM's involved, and their voices heard, and allowing them to execute changes.  Trying to change a culture of many years more than half time into the game is a frustrating task on both ends!! Thinking that extra activity Participation - ""Is voluntary"", but at the same time,  reality is ""You Have to participate"" is stressful for those that enjoy just coming to work and doing a great job without getting involved in other activities.  Having the Right people in the Right Places also plays a huge part in culture change and getting those phenomenal results - along with proper training!! I enjoyed training new hires, helping out others and assisting in various areas as needed."
good,Walgreens overall is good inside the store but they have raised expectations for employees and dropped the wages and benefits. Hours have dropped and policies are changing
good,"My position as a assistant manager or ASM expectation are to coach your team everyday, work next to them stocking. Show leadership and model best work ethic for employee to follow. Answer phone calls and emails. Help in the pharmacy with all type of pharmacy duties. Also help in photo lab with all photo task and costumer orders. Take care of cash transactions and cash report. Maintain inventory counts and order merchandise, take care of customers and any returns, exchanges and any complains, making their shopping experience unique. Receive warehouse and vendor orders, enter vendors invoices and file all vendors invoices. Create displays and merchandise store new items on strategic locations. Work on reset and revisions to company standards. Maintain store clean, organize and in top condition for best shopping experience."
good,"This company does not ""care"" for its employees as much as in the past! Employee benefits keep decreasing, and this year they chose not to give their pharmacists any raise at all, blaming lower insurance reimbursement."
good,If you want to work at a company to get experience Walgreens is the place but if you want to work to provide for yourself and family Walgreens is not the place.
good,People were nice and friendly hours were ok. The store where I was located was lacking employees and everyone had to pick up the extra hours. Had change of both supervisors within a month period.
good,They took away our bonuses and make us work on holidays. They are very selective about who they want to promote. They value their pharmacy staff more than the front end team members. They also disvalue anyone who doesn't have a degree.
good,certain employees are not treated with value. those with the most skills tend to get used and abused. Only benefit is slightly more pay than other retail pharmacies and on the job training acceptable by board of pharmacy.
good,"Working at Walgreens was a fun experience for me. I worked the overnight shift from 11pm to 7am. It was very relaxed but during the holiday season it would get a little chaotic, but nothing that someone couldn't handle."
good,"While being a pharmacy technician at Walgreens provides you with useful work experience and great customer support, technicians are stretched thin with little support from managers especially during busy hours. The company only looks at the numbers from each day and don't pay attention to the staffing and the real reason behind the numbers. You are required as a technician to accomplish many tasks and know how to basically run the pharmacy itself (because the pharmacists rely on the technicians more than anything). Just expect to constantly be putting in your all with no acknowledgement and no backup support from management and lesser pay that does not qualify for all the tasks accomplished by the technicians. Otherwise the benefits with the company are great."
good,"I like My Job,Because I'm a people person.I try always to treat people the way i would want to be treated.I'm very friendly,and care about other people. The job is easy,the down fall is it takes a long time to make decent money.I wait on customers all day,which is great,the hardest part is standing mostly in one spot all day.management is slow at training,therefor your yearly review cant be good so you get small raise.this is all i have to say..."
good,fast paced and very busy. a lot to do in a little time. a lot of walking and  a lot of inventory. sometimes handling alcohol ans tobacco. handing safe counting and cash procedures.
good,It's all up to the individual at the end of the day. Frontier is all about accountability and it's a podium anxious to be passed downward. So you have to motivate yourself and you have come in with a different mindset everyday.
good,"The job sucks but the people are awesome. That was the main reason on how I lasted so long. Very flexible job, but management is a whole mess. The company is going through some changes."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting and helping customers , assisting employees , stocking , setting up displays , cleaning ,opening and closing store,  pharamacy"
good,if you want t be treated like a dog and want to be over worked and under paid than this is the job for you. they dislike the workers and i barely made enough to pay my phone bill
good,"Walgreens in general is a great place to work at. The only issues I encountered were with a few Store Managers that micro manged there employees and didn't allow them to prosper. We had a new program called frontier that was intended to hear employees and address issues as they arose. The store managers that i worked with lacked the capability to hear employees out fairly. There was alot of favoritism. Also, they would hardly praise employees for small wins or accomplishments. The only time this was done was when there would be a DM or DPR in the area to avoid employees from acting up when those people came into the store."
good,"enter prescriptions into the computer, dispense prescription, fill prescriptions,compunding, order medication "
good,"Low pay grade and insufficient hours made it difficult to support myself and my family with a job as a pharm tech at walgreens. Otherwise, I would be fine working there."
good,Walgreens is a pretty laid back job. The tasks that are given to employees are very simple & reasonable at times. Customers are very nice most of the time. Many of them have been loyal customers of Walgreens for years & as long as you treat them with respect you can definitely expect the same in return.
good,Work long hours and often feel underappreciated. Decisions are made from corporate and made on the backs of the people in the store. Culture swings from employee friendly and back to task and operations focused. Hard to work there in this position and have a family at times.
good,"The task is not hard and it's very good for customer care. But the problem is you never have enough time to finish them properly. Company wants to cut cost and save more money, and they expect you to multi-task in a sense of doing at least 2 to 3 tasks at the same time, this is an insane concept when your task is managing/filling patient's medication because you can get somebody killed/injured if not paying enough attention of what you are doing"
good,not enough hours to get more techs. work was parted between three techs all day and work-flow was pretty bad despite bring up concern to pharmacy manager.
good,"Good Company,they are changing all the aspects about family, hiring anyone who can talk their way into management. Killing the employees work qualities of what doesn't get done!"
good,"All pharmacies can be stressful, but Walgreens was less stressful than most. I enjoyed working here but found a better job with better hours and better pay"
good,"Long story short, if you're not an assistant manager or higher, no one listens to you.  However, once you reach that level, you're owned by the company so you don't get an opinion anyway; you need to do what Corporate wants."
good,More worried about numbers the employees they cut to least amount of employees on the floor and wonder why customers say lack of help . The pharmacy is the most stressful part
good,"Very Stressful environment. There is absolutely no work and life balance especially as an assistant manager. If someone calls off, you are the one that is being called in to work even if it is a double shift. As for hiring regular sales associates, it is absolutely impossible to hire help as it is a very low minimum wage job."
good,Nice place to start off as a pharmacist.  Very fast paced.  Always on the go.  Management is awesome.  Lack of job security feels like lately with the low reimbursement.
good,"Typical day at Walgreens would be filling prescriptions answering phone calls, greeting customers, selling prescriptions, talking with healthcare personnel"
good,Walgreens does allow opportunities to transfer between departments.  It does seem very compartmental depending upon the department or division you worked for.
good,"Walgreens would really have great potential if they staffed accordingly. The location I worked in always seemed to be understaffed. I worked the cashier, cleaned the bathrooms, organized the merchandise, and restocked the cooler on an everday basis. The good thing is that most stores are 24 hours and the schedule is very flexible."
good,"I received my initial pharmacy training at Walgreens by a great Pharmacist , how I wish I could work with her forever, but she to has let there. Walgreens has know room to advance after senior tech, they do not believe in giving 40 hours, the benefits are to high. And they never close on holidays, snow, nothing. When I left they had just decided to cap pay."
good,No work/life balance. I work so many hours that the pay does not matter. I am looking for a new job. I will be glad to do something else and enjoy my life
good,"The days differ, so one day, the store can be very relaxed and productive, and others can be a hectic mess, with disorganization among the tasks. Adaptability is much needed here"
good,"My tenure at Walgreens was under the family ownership philosophies. Approx.2012, the new ownership based out of the UK changed the culture dramatically. Its undesireable comparatively speaking. Employees are merely employed, not cared for the way the original founder/CEO  started out over 100 years ago."
good,"I enjoyed the variety of customers visiting Walgreen's. I really would prefer not to give a review. I had not had previous retail experience and felt that, although co-workers were willing to help answer my questions the management fell short in supporting me."
good,"Management varies it can be great, a nightmare or a mix and how your day goes will depend on which manager is working that day. Pay is a joke they will pay a few cents more than minimum wage to avoid having to raise your pay to be equal should other employees come in behind you under a higher minimum wage law. The health benefits and discounts are pretty nice however. This is not a place you turn into a career unless you work in corporate or the pharmacy. Its a means to an end but not a place you can readily move up by hard work and perseverance just working the sales floor."
good,"Walgreen's was a great place to work while I was attending college. The hours were very flexible in relation to my class schedule and the pay was above minimum wage at the time, so not bad. If you're full time, the benefits are great and don't cost too much. However, it's not someplace to make a career. I've now graduated college and I'm not earning enough to support myself and also pay off my school loans. Advancement to my current role is fairly easy, but beyond that requires more effort and luck than the hourly wage merits. All told, it's not a bad place to work, if you're in high school or college."
good,"Not all Walgreens are the same, but my Walgreen's is just not for me anymore. Being a manager is pretty stressful. I have to deal with for to many thieves and crooked people. The hours are to much on any person with a family."
good,"I work as a night pharmacist with a 7 night on & nights off rotation. work days varies based on patient/customer flow. But mainly the night is spent servicing in-coming patients as well as prepare the pharmacy for smooth transition for the morning crew."
good,Stressful place to work many changes affecting decision of staying in the company. It still a nice place to work because of the benefits but reduction in work hours is making difficult staying in work place.
good,"some of the managers are great leaders and really bring their team together and are examples. other are, well, not. pay was good for what was expected."
good,"Very high stress to work in the pharmacy. We were always extremely busy and rarely had the help we needed. You can guarantee every single day a customer will have a fit and be yelling at you. Volatile work environment. Builds character, and now i have the character to dismiss this job altogether. Glad I left."
good,They spent 5.5 billion of Rite Aid stores and started firing pharmacy managers who have been with the company for decades. They do not care about us. It is just amazing that they would do that to such loyal employees.
good,"The job was okay, but the thing that made it hard was the amount you were getting paid there biweekly. The next best thing was that they would only offer shifts to the ones they like to work with and not the new people."
good,"I liked it because they were very flexible with my school schedule, however they started to cut my hours. I couldn't pay bills, eat and put gas in the car. I had to choose, so I chose to leave. Its like any other retail job out there. Manager has there favourites."
good,"I really enjoyed my job and the hours that I worked, 8 days on and 6 days off? Perfect for a single mother, but when push came to shove and I had to pick up a 2nd job store management was not very lenient and told me to chose, so I did."
good,"I worked for this company for less than a year and during this time I was trained to be a cashier. I maintained work and store areas in a clean and upright manner to ensure compliance with store's safety regulations. I also,stocked products in a safe and timely manner. I"
good,"For someone with little to no retail management experience, this is a great entry level job. It's demanding and challenging but you will learn so many various aspects of retail management that it's worth it. If you have a good amount of management experience already, this job would either be a lateral move or a step down when you look at the work-to-life balance and the compensation package. In recent years, the company has substantially changed its labor model by consolidating roles while reducing compensation. Opportunities for advancement are still good, but the advancement has become less valuable."
good,"Still has a small town flair to the way it operates. Customer focus is good and permeates throughout the organization. Although there are many pros, compensation and benefits are well below par."
good,There are some good managers there but there is one manager that needs to be made to leave the store and rotate like all managers do. They do hire within the company and train which is a good thing and help people advance who could not otherwise learn.
good,A fairly simple job that required money handling and customer service. Very tedious and low paying. seems like a job suited for management more than employees. Also terrible store regulations
good,It's an okay job. It's good if you're looking for a job as a teen but it's ok. The job is easy. I would recommend it for your kids if they are just looking for a job to get started
good,"Not the best experience, had to fin for myself and did not have enough training or opportunities to grow. Manger was extremely temperamental and did not appreciate her employees"
good,"ring up customers items, inventory when its needs to be done and keeping the store faced. helping customers and coworkers when needed. greet every customer who walks in. do all the tasks assigned  on the notes"
good,I worked for Walgreens for 5 yrs and enjoyed my job until a new Pharmacist was hired about a yr before I lost my job. I got along fine with the store manager but the Pharmacist manager had something against me and made sure I lost my job one day before I would of been fully vested with the company
good,"Walgreens provides its employees with ample opportunities to grow professionally, and challenge themselves to boldly address new challenges in the world of healthcare on a day-to-day basis."
good,"I worked at the Walgreen's in Midland, Michigan on the corner of Saginaw Street and Eastman Ave. Management changed 3 months into my career there and changed for the worse I got harassed multiple times by a shift leader and when I told my GM about it nothing was done which is my reasoning why I quit."
good,"It really depends on which store you work at.  I worked there for 6 years and worked at several different stores.  After leaving for a few years and coming back, I was started at $5 less an hour than I made before and the management was horrible. Wasn't worth the lousy pay to put up with it."
good,This was a summer youth program where I was able to work at Walgreens. The staff was friendly and you were able to learn about the details that go into retail in stores such as Walgreens. Management was good and I've heard they are under new management. The culture was pretty decent and the community also got to know you. Hardest part of the job was being able to deal with a filled store. Enjoyable part was the customers.
good,like I said great place to work but only if you have a manager that works well with others and does not tear into her managers and other workers. I have worked for managers that where amazing and treated me with respect and like a adult and did not have to be little there workers to get things done at a store
good,I've been Working at Walgreens for 3 years now somethings I've noticed that it is quite easy to move up and management is excellent throughout my experience. Although the job does not pay well.
good,"lack management skills, sometimes take a little too long to help customers. As an employyee of Walgreens for over two years I often get the feeling that I am wasting time. I have asked countless times to work in a specific area of the store to widen my knowledge as I am studying in the field in which I have been asking to to be exposed. However, I realized that my plea has been ignored on several occasions but the employers hire other people to come in and do the jobs that their employees in the store are capable of doing. I have also realized that favoritism plays a part in employment there."
good,"The Walgreens that I work at is a 24 hour store.  There is a very high turnover rate of employees in the pharmacy.  Having new employees so often makes for a more stressful situation.  Very often, there are not enough techs to cover the high volume of customers we have. Also, because they are a 24 hour store, many times you get off at 11:00 pm and have to be back the next morning.  Not having a set shift makes it very hard to plan for things outside of work.  Also, the pharmacy employees have no scheduled breaks except for a 30 minute lunch.  The front end employees have a 15 minute morning and afternoon break but not the pharmacy."
good,Middle management does most work while getting little credit and minimum pay. There are constant changes at the company making it hard to keep up day to day
good,"It did really matter on what manger we had that day. Most were good, but some, including the Store Manger were awful to work with. Most of the workers I loved working with. Had several customers that would only come in when I was working."
good,"when i started training the employees were very harsh, but soon I got used to the work and everything became easy and I even made friends. the job is easy it's just who you work with."
good,"My time at Walgreens/OptionCare was very productive and knowledgeable. Throughout my time with the company I learned quite a bit regarding insurance, and Medicare specifically. I learned how payments are processed and how Medicare bills patients. I learned how to process patients payments, and process them to collections, as well as learned Medicare codes and processes in order to bill patients. We worked together as a team, always able to help each other and learn from one another."
good,"When I started this job I thought it would be a lot easier than it really is. Some days are really slow while other days calls are back to back.The set schedule is really nice, however things around the call center change daily. A lot of miscommunication. It's a nice job for a while, but it gets old really quickly."
good,It was a good place to work but management and coworkers can make it and break it for you. Managers weren't very understanding and would force you to come in to work even if you're sick if you can't find someone to cover for you. Coworkers weren't the best either. It was an easy job though and it's a good job for people in high school.
good,"This job was great, i enjoyed working with all types of customers, and my team that i was in charge of, we worked very strong together, but as all i have learned companies do make changes at times and a lot of my team was let go, so after school i went to pursue my cosmetology career"
good,I've liked my job for as long as I have been her. 5 years and the only complaint I have is the decisions the company makes as a whole. There're many opportunities to grow and move ahead in the company.
good,"When I worked they send me to different locations, because I was helping to introduce them in PR."
good,"You must have patience, compassion, and be knowledgeable. Technicians deal with unruly customers several times a shift. A technician must be able to learn and retain information quickly in order to assist the pharmacist accurately to lighten their workload."
good,"Pharmacy Tech's do not make enough money for the responsibility of what we do and the abuse they take from customers. "
good,This was a great place to work for before the merger. Unsure of the new direction as things were cascaded down on a need to know bases. But I would recommend Walgreens to anyone.
good,"Open 7-7, varied types of patients from school and sport physicals, to pnuemonia, flu, eczema, asthma management and vaccine reviews. Management is good, albeit stand off ish, no real support staff, great coworkers"
good,"Company has great employees."
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of sorting medications alphabetically into proper containers and verifying information with customers to ensure they receive the right medication.  the bulk of the day was spent distributing and selling prescriptions for customer pick-up.  "
good,Everyday was unnecessarily stressful and honestly I felt picked on I was the youngest assistant manager but the people I worked with were very awesome
good,"I thought it was a great opportunity to get your foot in the door. However, the pay sucks. I started off at $10.00 and could've worked somewhere else with a better pay."
good,The location of this Walgreens isn't there anymore I wouldn't refer anyone to work here the lead manager was great very understanding and easy to work with .
good,"The management was poor and they were inconsiderate of the lives of their employees outside the workplace. It was all about favoritism, so whoever the manager liked got the best shifts."
good,"Working for Walgreens I assumed recving Benifits when needed was easy. I was pregnant and didn't recived a pain maternity leave due to the fact that my ""aver"
good,"Usually I check e-mails, check department for inventory, take in any customer calls. I also scan any merchandise that is out and consult  customers. I have learned exceptional customer service, having good  customer relationship, and best products that are worth the money. I feel that management can be helpful at times. They should be a little more informative when it comes to promotions and positions. I feel that the hardest part of the job is making enough sells on Saturdays because of the weekend rush of customers. I feel the most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers with finding the right products that they need and want."
good,"Assessed work for errors or compliance issues and made correction and modifications when necessary. Put together mounted and remote cooler packs quickly and efficiently. Improved knowledge and productivity through continuous education and learning from foreman and senior assemblers. Completed and entered quality records, scrap reports and machine logs in a timely manner. Reviewed and verified all work was in compliance with sales orders and customer requirements. Determine materials, tools, and equipment needed for product orders."
good,They were extremely understaffed when I worked there this resulted in me having to work multiple departments at a time. Which I guess was a good learning experience. It could just be very stressful. Management was descent. You do have the opportunity to move up.
good,i got to make woodpanels and canvases it was interesting and got to work with awesome people the store manager at my store played favorites which made it frustrating
good,This place is very demanding and not flexible with those who have small children. The majority of client's personalities aren't as nice and understanding.
good,Can become a rewarding job. if you are a customer service based person and thick skinned. must know how to problem solve on the fly also be able to multi-task.
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for and I have heard that you can move up in the company quickly. However, that was not my experience. I enjoyed the customers it just wasn't the place for me."
good,"I've worked for Walgreens for a while now and they can be flexible with hours in the retail store and it can be fine to get experience while still in school and earn a little bit of money. Not great for advancements, you aren't going to make very much money, it's stressful, and the company is always on your back. Not a long term job."
good,"This job was simple, but that's not to say it was easy. This is still a retail position and dealing with angry customers was not an enjoyable part of my day. A typical day, pictures needed to be printed and put in envelopes as customers sent them via the Walgreens app or online. Other than handing the customers their pictures, stocking shelves was easy, though the pace at which was expected was a little less than possible."
good,"the employees are ALL nice, the managers are horrible. i would recommend working here as a FIRST job, i made a mistake of working here, im sure not every walgreens is bad, just the one i worked at."
good,"Nice place to work. Hard work but it prepares you to work in a larger company.  Very demanding..Benefits are good... 401k very good,  Company will help you if you need help.  They offer assistance for family needs."
good,"My main complaint working 3rd shift is that i'm always tired, but that's a side effect of almost any 3rd shift job so it's just up to the individual."
good,Walgreens was great to work for 8 years ago. For the last 5 years it has been very stressful and management has gone downhill. The pay is awful and lunches are frowned upon since you are so busy and under staffed.  They expect you to do the work of 3 to 4 pharmacy technicians.  Which makes the customer service awful and very unhappy customers and employees.  I would absolutely not recommend this place to work.  It saddens me to leave this honest review.  I will miss quite a few people I work with.
good,poor management that only cares about the customers and not the wellbeing of their employees. pharmacy is a stressful environment that is understaffed and receives no extra help
good,"Company is Ok."
good,This job was the best way for me to learn how to deal with people. The mangers was always give us( the workers ) attitude because one customer complained that the management at this establishment weren't professional so they took away our 10 min break made us stay bussy.
good,Great place to start as a first job or to move from food industry.  Learned a lot as far as retail. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employee discount and even better when you know how to coupon. You can actually get great deals.
good,"I worked with the company for 5 years, the job itself was very rewarding. I enjoyed my interaction with my patients every day and it was very fulfilling. When higher management changed from a supervising pharmacist to a supervisor with no pharmacy degree; the whole work culture changed. I am one of 5 pharmacist who quit the company because of this change."
good,Good pay but long hours with little to no staff.   Upper management has unrealistic expectations and provides you with little to no support.  Hard to hire right now especially when we only pay a little over minimum wage.
good,"Provided valuable customer service experience and communication skills. "
good,"I was with this group during my externship. During my time there, I was supposed to use the skills I had learned during school. The typical day was fast-paced, which I expected, but I did not expect the cattiness of the other employees and the high turnover in management. The culture catered to seniority and did not train very well. The stress was high enough for me to consider transferring, but I decided to stay because I wanted to graduate. I enjoyed the inventory the most. I did not appreciate the lack of professionalism that plagued the environment. I was given a chance to stay, but for my mental health I decided to leave."
good,"ok job, good place to get management experience. The hours and having to work holidays can be burdensome but overall its a decent place to work. Good management"
good,"Not a millennial friendly environment.  No room for growth. "
good,This place underpays and does not offer enough hours for techs. I completed over 100 hours of internship here and loved helping people. I was unhappy with how underapreciated the techs felt and how underpayed they were. This experience has helped me by motivating me to learn more and strive for something better career wise.
good,"Good company, no room for advancement, management is supportive depending on your district. As an intern, the hours were very flexible and the staff was supportive."
good,I learned how to deal with people in a nice and orderly fashion as well as get many tasks done in a quick manner. Time management was the biggest skill i gained while the hardest part of the job was dealing with insurance errors that caused angry customers. THE most enjoyable part was the people I would have to say.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"Management was okay, location was nice, customers varied. Hated being tied down to register, loved the photo department. No opportunity to get higher than part time position."
good,"receiving scrips for doctors, interring in scrips as they are brought in from patients, filing, answering phone calls, filing meds into bottles, cashiering, and working with insures."
good,Great learning opportunities for career growth and development. Took up much of my time in my 20s and put me in my current path.  Not educated as to how current walgreen co. job opportunities match to when I was there over 10 years ago.
good,"My time with Walgreens is best summed in the above statement."
good,"Worst company I've ever worked for. They make you work more than your schedule eight hours, sometimes don't even allow you to have a break. They don't ever have enough staff to handle the volume of the store."
good,The working atmosphere at Walgreens is good. It's a place where you get to put to use all the good manners you learn from your parents because you will be dealing with different kinds of customers and you still want to keep your cool no matter what.
good,Management wasok.  Job was .boring.   Truck days were hard in my back.  Very busy store.  I enjoyed working on the sales floor helping customers  more than cashiering.
good,Management was not great. The job paid well for what was required of you. The benefits we good as well.  There were no advancement options with the store I was at.
good,"I was able to start without any experience while I worked to get certified. They offered classes to help prepare for the exam that were very helpful, The pay started pretty low but they did offer raises periodically."
good,Working at Walgreens was for sure a high school job. They do not give you the pay that you could ever just live off of. I feel bad for the family that had to
good,walgreens is a great place to work with a slightly better then minumum wage pay per hour most customers are agreeable however be careful as the communication between managers can be rough
good,"I would come in to the job. Do morning prep. Stock transaction and sales ads, sweeping customer service areas, making sure counters are stock, displays set up. Then I would put on my apron and wait for customer come in.  Talk to customers, check out customer, handle cash newspapers. Stock items. Face items. Help with customer complains. Answer phones."
good,"The management makes you feel bad for getting sick even though the customers are they reason you get sick. However, the work is easy and the employees are usually nice and the management work with you and your schedule"
good,"long hours at time, schedule changes all the time, have to work holidays, never know what you are working because you have to wait on management, turn over is high"
good,Company has changed when aligned with Boots from the UK. Cuts in payroll hours have hurt customer service. Employees are the strength of the company. Many restructuring attempts have failed.
good,Management does not make it comfortable to come to them with issues. Favoritism is heavily shown by certain managers. Hours are always cut causing employees to hunt for shifts at other places.
good,"After working in 2 other Walgreens that were fantastic to work at,working in the Gardnerville store was totally opposite...working with the employees was fantastic, the upper management team was never appreciative of the work that was done by assistant managers or employees.  The constant yelling at employees or downgrading them.  Managers were a lot of times in the pharmacy helping to fill orders as they would never hire enough people, leaving the floor unsupervised. The corporate office not supportive with complaints.  "
good,"A typical day consisted of unsatisfied customers, and constantly nagging managers. Whether it's your fault or not, it's your fault. Nothing runs smoothly."
good,"A typical day at work would be cleaning, helping customers find what they are looking for, and put overstock away. I learned how to do scan outs and inventory. The hardest part of the job is sometimes putting up with a shift leads disrespectful behavior. The thing I enjoyed the most at this job is working with other co-workers in a team."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,Job removes pharmacist from its primary function which is patient care to dangerous levels of dispensing and very little emphasis on patient safety goals. Its really long and dangerous hours of work with no break whatsoever which compounds the level of stress which makes it impossible to balance work and life. The good part of the job i guess is the great insurance and 401 k plan ..
good,Everyday after work I knew I was helping majority of our customers live better. This company plays a big role of the type of management style I pursue.
good,As a manager the hours were horrible. Everything Walgreens stands for is a lie. They do offer decent job advancement given you want to spend the rest of your life there.
good,"Good place to start a first job or a  part time job. Hardest part of the job is catering to the CSAs and doing multiple things at once, picking up the slack, always short handed. Most enjoyable part of the job are the people you work with. Management is ok, but I feel like they do not take my opinions seriously or my ideas."
good,This job is like any other corporation. They will pay you minimum wage and expect maximum effort. The management had high turn over at my particular location.
good,"Very fast-paced, management changed every 2-3 months. Very strict and confusing attendance policy. I worked 1st shift (4am-2pm) but they changed our shift from 3am-1pm permanently without proper notice to get comfortable."
good,I've been employed with this company for a few years and never thought I would work for walgreens but by working for this company I've learned to grow to be a better person for my team and my customers and learn to be sympathic to customers needs and learned to communicate and help others ....
good,"Walgreen's wages were good, benefits also good.  Management was okay.  Not much chance for advancement.  Rules and regulations that did not make sense."
good,Coworkers are friendly and willing to help but are very understaffed. Pharmacy I currently work at is a 24 hour pharmacy that fills 1000+ prescriptions daily. Usually 2 types of shifts: 7 hour shifts and 8 1/2-9 hour shifts. 7 hour shifts don't get a lunch and hardly get off on time.
good,"I worked here during High school and it was a decent place to work. Management kept me busy with tasks and I received decent breaks. Although, I felt I wasn't being taken seriously based on my age."
good,I received discounted health insurance with Walgreen's and that was probably the best thing about working at the location I worked at.
good,they provide a lot of training slow advancements depending on your store. they are tight when it comes to raises and tend to be kind of hard to advance.
good,People are great and it's a good place to work while going to school. Hours are good and the people are great. Processes can be challenging though
good,"low stress, low pay, its ok."
good,"pressure from upper management  unrealistic goals, scheduling not good for people who have families, schedule not made in advance good pay and vacation time,"
good,"Walgreens is great to work for. the company truly stands behind its product, many have worked for this company for years, advancement in the company is likely if you do your work"
good,"Pharmacy Technician: Order management including making sure that all of the medications are ordered in a timely manner; and that the pharmacy has all of it's needed supplies. I also make sure that all of the prescriptions are filled in a timely manner. Also, I've dealt with insurance problems that deals with simple prior authorization overrides, and solving simple and also complex Third Party Rejections (TPR), while keeping the Pharmacy clean.I deal with a lot of phone calls pharmacy related and also non-pharmacy related things.Finally i have experience in paper work such as help fill out paperwork properly and also entering it into the computer and filing it."
good,The clients are wonderful people to work with. They enjoy the services that are provided here. The clients look forward to attending daily.
good,"Some days are better then others. I enjoy my coworkers, but sometimes feel like the pay could be higher for the work that you have to do, The hardest part might be working with unruly customers and management could use better commutation. I have learned a lot about myself and other working with this company. The part i love the most is being able to meet new people."
good,Walgreen's is a stable company which will expect you to work hard and focus on customer service.  If you like a balance between physical labor and customer service this may be a good job for you.
good,A typical day at work involved warehouse and vendor deliveries.  Correcting inventory levels.  Pulling and filling overstock to self-service shelves.   Resets and revisions.    Assisting in the pharmacy and photo depts.  Regarding of what tasks you are performing customer service is the #1 priority.  The workplace culture had great intentions but many times the store manager created their own culture.  The hardest part of the job was getting team members up to speed. The most enjoyable part of the job was working side by side with team members and giving shoppers a great experience.
good,My first job was relatively easy to learn. Gave me skills to deal with customers. The best part of the job was helping people who needed the help. It had put me in the foot of the job world and I'll forever be grateful.
good,"Working at Walgreens is a weekly pattern, every day of the week is set for specific task. Mondays and Tuesdays we unload carts of product. Wednesday we recieve totes,Thursday and Friday we unload them Saturday we recieve a truck and Sunday we make sure the store is neat."
good,The people you meet at this company is widely diverse. And though the hours are long and depending on area the pay is somewhat low for the workload you are often given. The benefits are decent but advancement is slow.  Management can turn hectic in that your manager may get sent to different stores or swapped. And the job does not really leave room for a social life if you already have a routine time card older than a month.
good,A typical day at work when you sign in and hope that the day passed by smoothly with no customer complaints. With shortage of staff and hours you are running like chicken without head!!!
good,I loved working there i did my job. But they took alot of incentives away from employees. There was alot in the being but they merge and took alot away.
good,"The best part of working here was my coworkers, most of whom I got along very well with. Most who work there have a great attitude. The job is steady, but monotonous, with little benefit for those who do great work as opposed to those who do passable work. "
good,"a typical day would consist of ringing up customers and cleaning the store, you will given tasks to work on, how ever pharmacy comes first so prepare yourself for that."
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to be able to work there and try to advance in the company. I feel as if they shouldn't be so hard on employees but other than that it wasn't a bad place to work.
good,"Typical retail pharmacy. Once you reach Senior pharm tech, there's no more growth or promotion in the position. Started at $9.50 an hour, ended at $12.75 after 2 years. Good co-workers are the only thing that will keep you sane."
good,"Management is horrible. Favorites are played. A lot of fraternizing between manager and pharmacy tech. Manager would buy a 12 pack of beer EVERY DAY before leaving. Not a very good role model for the younger girls working there if you ask me. WAY too many tasks assigned to one person at one time and then YOU are at fault if you can't get them all done in one shift. Pay is good, benefits are great and there is room for growing. However, overall, I would not recommend this company to anyone. You better not ever get sick or miss a day because you will never hear the end of it! Not even a doctors note will you excuse with this company!"
good,"Walgreens is a fun place to start your first job, but as time goes on you barely ever get pay raises. They dont pay for techs to continue their education and they don't staff enough of change pharmacies to fit the workload."
good,"Great job for people who don't want any advancement in the company.  Pay is poor, schedule is completely inconsistent.  Two days off in a row is a miracle.  Raises and beyond pitiful.  The only good thing is that our employees are all really great people who  care about our customers and each other.  Too bad the company doesn't compensate for that."
good,I learned a lot on the job but it was not always a very positive work environment to encourage proper training. After working with this company for a longer period they give less positive feedback and do not seem concerned with the happiness of their employees.
good,"My most fulfilling aspects of working for Walgreens over the years, are the relationships I've developed with countless team members and vast array of customers."
good,"It is a great place to work in terms of systems and environment. "
good,"Good discount, liked merchandising and training and customer were better than quality than Walmart, some great managers so poor ones. Enjoyed overall working there, 13 years total"
good,Walgreens is not the company it used to be. They are looking  to change behaviors of management yet there is not much accountability for management who have been resistant to the change for many years.
good,"If you are not interested in working weekends and holidays, this is not the place for you. Can be stressful at times with workload and corporate initiatives. Have always treated me good personally but I've seen others go through tougher times"
good,I was just volunteering there for work Experience. Just to get the work experience for more jobs. all I did was stocking and bagging just don't make it your career
good,Had a hard time while working here. Some management were not good. A lot of discrimination was going around when I worked.
good,"A lot of working alone since the store is small. I was able to learn and do tasks on my own right after being shown. Co-works were normally young so it was hard to get them to do tasks. The phone customer service was the the hardest part. People called and yelled at you if they were unable to get through to the pharmacy right away. The management was great, they always were so nice and if you did great job at work one day they sometimes brought in pizza or got you candy."
good,"This is great job for a new employee in the work field, the job teaches you the basic fundamentals of a retail business and you can learn a lot and even move up in the company if you set your mind to it."
good,"I am completing a 10 year run with this company. I can no longer work for a company that feels it is okay to punish in order to grow. To blame store level management for their short comings. A company that piles more work, programs and plans on their management than even 10 managers to each store could handle and then strong arm you when you don't comply. Never again. 10 years....gone!"
good,"I can only speak for the location I was at.  You have very good managers and then you have some not so good.  Fortunately, I was under good management"
good,"I have worked at Walgreens since 2012 the first few years were good, I couldn't have asked for a better job (except pay wise). Then came the inevitable, they moved my store manager to another store and promoted an egotistical control freak that has no idea what she's doing. We went from a store of productive happy employees to an overstaffed, miserable store. You can see the difference in the way the store looks and the life has been sucked out of the store."
good,"Opening and closing duties, daily draw count and deposits, customer service, ordering of products, and make sure staff kept store stocked."
good,An okay place to work. They expect a lot with little pay. There are opportunities to advance but sadly it seems they will recruit anyone for leadership.
good,Enjoyed the employees. Some of management unprofessional. Underpaid. 24 hours. Not enough hours. Good customer service.
good,"I started working at Walgreens when I was 16 and it was my first job. I worked there for over 3 years. My favorite part of the job was definitely the people I worked with, we all got along very well and had fun while working."
good,"Have to be confident and don't be afraid to ask questions. "
good,"Seasonal hours, snowbird season for winter months and have to struggle for hours during the summer. co workers can be pleasant. Pharmacy management usually has a chip on shoulder."
good,"A typical day at work consists of:"
good,"Walgreens is a decent place to train for pharmacy tech or low level retail management. The compensation is below average and they do not treat employees very well, especially management in the stores."
good,"I spent 12 years at Walgreens. It wasn't bad in the beginning but became progressively worse as time passed. Tech hours were the first to be affected, then the pharmacists. Management had no problem treating us as dispensable items. Absolutely no respect for the pharmacists. Added more clinical duties without more tech help. You often left work feeling drained with nothing more to give to your family when home. Lesson to management, happy employees generate good business via providing good customer service because the employees feel valued. Treat all employees with respect and you will see."
good,"Biggest problem with walgreens is their management. They don't care about the employees, and when you put in legitimate complaints, the DMs tend to just brush it aside. "
good,"since the look boutique is new to Seattle ,WA it came with a lot of challenges but everything always worked out the beauty brands that are sold only in the boutique each had educator's and sales reps that were always a pleasure to have in store because they always had something new to teach ."
good,Good to start for first job ad going to school. Customers are great and will make lots of new friends.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for  but has slowly come to industry standards for their compensation of employees. They will likely continue to be around but the focus is shifting to the stock price over the employee.
good,"This job was typically peaceful, but the pay wasn't enough to support myself and family with. It's a great job for beginners. I have more experience in hard labor"
good,"I only work nights and a typical evening is speaking with patients regarding their scripts, typing scripts, filling, and stocking the pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is meeting the time on filling the prescriptions and dealing with angry customers/patients. I enjoy this place because they are flexible with students hours, they are a productive environment, and all the pharmacists are very helpful in teaching technicians to perform their jobs better. Love the diversity!"
good,A career at Walgreens offers you the potential for growth and a clear path to advancement. Our innovative spirit means every day is different opportunity to excel in a welcoming and inclusive environment. Take your first step towards a fulfilling career.
good,"balance cash reports"
good,"Too much time invested. No reward. Little to no wiggle room, micro managing. Good team structure, no real room for growth with the new model."
good,"One of my ""real"" jobs, they make sure you know everything before you work with customers. A lot of staff throughout the store which is great when dealing with a lot of customers."
good,"work life balance : the work life balance was pretty good, rotating holidays. Company has great vacation plans, but no overtime opportunities."
good,"I enjoy working. But when you set up endcaps, and two days later they want it moved to a different location, and three days later moved again, it's a waste of labor. Store managers are generally not enjoyable to work with.  The fellow employees are very nice. Expectations are high, and can present a lot of stress."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at walgreens, but had to quit due to personal reasons including school and home life. I had many responsibilities but minimal training. The staff was friendly, but the management failed to keep us informed and trained for our normal tasks."
good,"My typical day a work is running the cosmetics department. It involves helping customers, unloading truck, answering the phone, and stocking shelves."
good,"Typical day begins with checking out customers at the register while I work on my daily task like putting up stock, or pulling stock out dates. Later on in my shift I would have to complete my daily chore between doing the floors, cleaning bathrooms, or taking out the trash. After that I would face my section of the store to get it ready for the next day. The management was really good, and taught me a lot about the Walgreens company. My co-workers were fairly nice, but seemed overloaded with work a lot. The hardest part of my job was learning how to do resets. The most enjoyable part of my job was making my customers happy."
good,"This isn't your father's Walgreens.  The company is continuing to transform itself to reinvent the retail model of a health, beauty and convenience provider in the United States.  As in all publicly traded retailers, there is intense pressure to reduce costs while providing increased services.  This can be challenging if not daunting at times as the scale of the operation is unmatched in small box retail."
good,"A fun place to start at, but you eventually have to find something else. I liked the team i had, but the amount of work you do doesn't correlate with how much you are paid."
good,"Walgreens Company is a good place to work with, team members giving an Excellent Customer service to their valued customers."
good,it was an easy beginners job to start with. I learned responsibly and a good way to manage your time. the managers didn't take  responsibly very well. the hardest part of the job was the angry customers and keeping the stock room in order. most enjoyable part was my coworkers they were amazing.
good,"typical day at this job, is full of customer interaction and always being happy and pleasant to the customer no matter what the needs are"
good,a lot is expected of you with minimum pay and favoritism and unable to have a life outside work when working full time. favoritism and unfair treatment for some
good,"Walgreens is a company that struggled to live up to its own vision.  It had grand ideas to reshape healthcare in the retail sector, and I applaud it for its vision.  The issue came down to the communication between the executive leadership and field leadership.  Very little support from the executive leadership led to very little follow-through for the field leadership.  Bottom-line: Field leadership and teams had completely no say in company policy or culture or initiatives.  Outside of the individual stores, the company was not a unified whole, but an ""us versus them.""  Very unfortunate."
good,"For most part, I get along well with my co-worker. Ringing up customers for their prescriptions. Enter and fill scripts.  Finding the prescription is the overall killer.  Misplaced a lot."
good,"Great stepping stone, will learn a lot working here, pharmacy, billing, collections etc. however starting salaries are not competitive in comparison to  other infusion providers."
good,I overall like the company but it has its negatives. Sometime the other employees aren't friendly and bring there problems from home to work with a bad attitude but other than that it's great.
good,"Overall there a decent place with people who were generally good to work with, at times it could be stressful and management was not always were it needed to be but overall it wasnt a bad place."
good,"My day consists of helping customers, answering phone calls, handling insurance billing, filling prescriptions, ordering, stocking. Management and co-workers are professional and great to work with. Downside of job is turning away customers when controls cannot be filled. I very much enjoy helping customers with their needs."
good,"I answered phones, rang up customers, put up stock, helped customers with photos, and cleaned the area as needed. I enjoyed helping customers, and being around most of my coworkers"
good,not a bad place to work the pace of working there was pretty cool because it some days were fast days and some days were slow but there was always something to do
good,"Working at walgreens was a good way to learn a lot about the way retail stores run. I learned a lot on how to order items, customer service, how to do resets."
good,My work day as a cashier usually consists of me straightening my assigned parts of the store and also greeting and assisting customers. I get along well with all my co-workers and managers. The hardest part of this job is having to deal with rude customers.
good,The co-workers are friendly. Management changed a lot recently. Overall work/life balance is fine. Not many opportunities to learn new things.
good,"Walmart is a behemoth environment.  Its a  great place to get entree management.  While the work load/responsibilities are adequate, its pay structure is a little low to retain talent across the board."
good,"Company culture and vision are being lost with latest merger. Corporate bosses seem more interested in mergers and takeovers of companies than fixing issues within the current company to grow and become an unbelievable powerhouse within the industry. "
good,"Started off as a great place for me to work at as a college student, but as I got closer to finals, my manager was unwilling to adjust my schedule accordingly. Because I usually closed and had to start around 2, I barely had time to get homework/projects done or study for finals. No matter how many times I explained this, my manager refused to work with me and I was forced to quit my job."
good,"like any other corporations and/or job sites; if one is liked by the ""right"" supervisors; one is able to advance.  like everywhere else subliminal ageism exists"
good,Very high paced work flow. Super understaffed and severly under paid. Lots of goals to meet placing a ton of pressure on the already overwhelmed staff. Goals wouldnt be too bad if there were enough employees to help with the work load. Managers are stressed because of the demands they have to meet.
good,"This was a hard job, my body nd mind seemed to always be tried. Having to work on holidays was not enjoyable. I enjoyed my co-workers they made a bad day enjoyable."
good,"A typical day to work at Walgreens is expecting customers with a good and/or bad mood, always trying to change the ""bad"" ones to loyal customers."
good,"constantly learning something new each day . talking to customers all likes of customer everyday nothings ever the same ."
good,"My customers are the reason I feel excited about going to work. I really believe that the pay rate can better for the amount of things that i have to do like clean the bathroom sweep the floors mop and the store. I also think that due to my age i am treated different from the older employees. My co-workers are nice and respectful management is fine, And the hardest part about the job is that i do not feel 100% secure because dangerous people come to the store and steal and there's nothing being done about it."
good,I have learned a lot over my 6 years of service. I was grateful to advance to management. I enjoy interacting with customers.
good,"Managers worked long hours and assisted other employees on their projects when needed, Customer Service was our number one priority, but we were required to work on projects also. It was a good environment and I worked with a lot awesome people."
good,"a typical day at work is stocking making sure the store is clean. i work overnight, which i have two employees that i have to supervise. they have daily duties that have to be done everynight. the hardest part about my job is the robberies that we have had in the pass at gunpoint. the customer can really lift your spirit and give you hope and keep faith"
good,Great place to work but it's all work! Just get it done! Everyday is hard; wish there was more help. It would have been more fun.
good,"Started working as a cashier at 16 and it was a great first job and teaches you a lot, everyday is different. After being there for 5 years the company had decided to let a bunch of management go and changed the roll to Shift Lead and got a big pay cut because they don't expect the shift leads to do as much work but they do and the amount of work they expect you to do and the responsibility they give you is not worth the pay. As a Shift Lead I am expected to know how to work in every department, Cashier, Photo, Cosmetics and Pharmacy. I am expected to help out in every department when ever they need help and on top of that answer any customer questions, deal with employee issues, stock, check in vendors, handle cash issues and get whatever needs to get done for that day. Not only is the pay not worth amount of work you do but you only get 1 break for 30 minutes and your schedule is completely random, depending when they need you. You could be scheduled to close one day at 11pm and then have to come in the next day at 7am. Messes with your sleep schedule and gives you no time to plan to be able to do anything out of work."
good,I really enjoyed meeting the customers and over time they became like family. Some were starting families and some lost loved one. I became close to many and enjoyed being able to help them through the good times and the bad times.
good,"Walgreens is a nice play to work. The staff is friendly, always work to be done, very organized store. "
good,"8 to 10 Hours of Work Daily. You learn how to Operate a 24/7 Store. Management need to be less automatic. Co-Workers are very unite, The hardest part of this work is the Rotation of the shifts. The most enjoyable part is the customers service interaction."
good,Was a cool place to begin at but we had problems with management they were always getting fired so our store was always in disarray.
good,"Benefits were good except for the fact that you have to use walgreens for any Rx service, so there is the lack of privacy from unethical coworkers who snoop and there are always people like that no matter where you go. Also, being forced to use only one chain takes away options if you are traveling, don't live near one and don't want to travel to your job if you are sick, or if the medicine you need is out of stock. Luckily I never had to to get any prescriptions filled. The job is ok if you don't mind dealing the public, but for every great pharmacist and manager walgreens has, they have a terrible one. So you never know what to expect at work, because there was no consistency."
good,Good training programs and benefits with great co-workers who were dedicated professional and fun at the same time. Changes in culture and management made it more stressful and overly demanding with unrealistic expectations at times.
good,Good Company Management Not good... Love working there the techs didn't come to work offend. Love helping the people learned a lot about.
good,Fun work place with amazing team members. Hardest part about working here was the bad neighborhood and how it was a bit dangerous at times but the Walgreens itself was very well organized and tried to meet all customers needs.
good,"Rewarding in helping customers but feels like corporate management    out of touch, and difficult to see advancement opportunities"
good,All about the numbers. Money was good but it was fast-food pharmacy. Gave me no staff to work with but wanted me to push the amount of prescriptions I did. I got yelled at everyday by the customers and I honestly didn't blame them. I had an opportunity to serve them well if I had been given double the staff. Management didn't get this but their hands were probably tied too.
good,"I Supervised daily operations for 12 employees servicing five locations. Supervised assigned projects, in all aspects of billing, coding and account follow up for held revenue. I learned how to be a dedicated Supervisor and Accomplished leader to my employees. I also learned how to be proactive in various areas of the Job, such as jumping in and helping with other departments such as cash posting, office coordinator helping out to get payroll done or help getting cash posted. Whom ever was short for that day helping in all areas to get the Job done. Teaching employees how to make customers first and how to have great customer service. Handled escalated issues from customers and our branch locations daily. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting. The company had longevity employees which speaks volume that shows employees enjoyed working together. Over all Walgreens had been a great place to work, decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Long/ short days at work"
good,"An ok office environment for a first time/ temp job. Only went in once a month or so, didn't allow for much growth. Didn't get to learn very much, boss was very unattached and uninvolved."
good,"Typical day consist of resetting the shelves and placing orders on items that we are sunning low. I learned how to organize myself in taking care of the inventory, sign out the venders as well as give the crew their assigned breaks. Management was very helpful in helping learn how to manage a business. "
good,handling and dealing with alot of money. keepin a smile on my fae. greeting all customers.stocking and handling merchandise
good,"I work there for 8 years I learn a lot about pharmacy tech,and costumer services.GOOD PLACE TO LEARN TO WORK AS A TEAM.GOOD PLACE TO WORK AND LEARN"
good,"I loved working at Walgreens, friendly employees and management. I loved helping customers, and learning about new products, I had opportunity to make commission off of sales from beauty products which I enjoyed."
good,"Not really many opportunity for advancement. The pay isn't that good either, and there aren't really benefits. Not enough goes on day to day to keep someone stimulated."
good,"Typical day at work is busy, extremely fast paste environment, you are never sitting down, always someone to help or something (merchandise) to put away, phone calls to make, customers to ring out, photos to develop etc. Management changed to often for my liking and as well as the co workers. It almost seamed as if the store was not only a revolving door for customers but for Employees as well."
good,You get to meet new people. The wages are good for this area. Good benefits. No team work. its a doggie dog world. Y ou pick products for the stores.
good,"Co-workers that I managed were flexible and had a good attitude when at work."
good,"Working as a head photo a daily task was to always check on any products that are running low and to have them filled. Always checking out dates on products and ordering items if we're out or low. My coworkers were fun to work with but was not as dedicated to their job like me. When I was put on a project to work with others I was always cleaning it up and finishing it. My management throughout the year has changed but it has became very poor. Very bias management, wasn't very opened minded with others. Most enjoyable part of my job was to help customers to their needs, when they are not satisfied with something I always helped them out until they are satisfied and happy. Upselling in the photo department was hard, but I was the only person in our store to ever upsell the most on our products (ex. suggested selling items) suggested items change monthly. Customers from around the senior homes always came around looking for their daily vitamins and after helping one customer I would ask the next customer that I walk to to see if they needed assistance."
good,"Walgreens is an environment where you go in and have to be ready to help everybody and anybody no matter what mood there in. I learned that patience is the key to solving customers answers. My managers really helped me gain the knowledge and skills I needed in order to help customers in a better way. I loved all my coworkers, but the hardest part of the job is knowing how to take care of all the different type of customers needs, I really loved helping funny and loving customers and will continue to do so."
good,Store discount and some good benefits.  Department co-workers were friendly and helpful.  Culture is very diverse. Department managers can be flexible at times.
good,"This job requires a lot of physical labor, walking, standing, stooping, kneeling, working with metal shelving, climbing ladders, walking on unsafe catwalks. It puts the body (knees, elbows, shoulders,etc.) under a lot of strain. I took 3 months of working-out to strengthen my right side after just two years of being with the company"
good,"A typical work day is boring, management is lazy, some employee dont want to do anything. the co workers hide all day long and take forever on one task."
good,"I enjoyed my job working at Walgreens Mail Service, even though that time was short lived as of 10 years in 2015. The job went down as soon as certain managers came in and just ruined it for us, now the job is shut down."
good,Your knowledge in the field of distribution grows as part of the team. Minimum growth opportunities due to the restructure of management.
good,"A typical day starts with batch release of future date billing, running  branch hold reports including ""Ready To Bill Items"" and reviewing each claim individually before release, noting accounts with in missing documentation or billing requirements, changing, updating hold codes as necessary, or if truly ready to bill, then releasing claims.  The next duty for the day is to clean up Zirmed electronic billing for rejected claims and resubmittals, then on to unbilled report for the day.  Next is on to reviewing each unbilled item for appropriate documentation, including delivery tickets, Rx orders, DWO, ABN, AOB, EPFR, refill notes, etc. before coding items with correct HCPCs/CPT codes per payer contract guidelines, and finally at end of day run billing journal for payers that only accept paper claim submission.  As a lead I am also responsible for assisting coworkers with any daily challenges and reporting to supervisor as needed for additional training and coworker assistance needed."
good,Learned a lot about the work environment here. Some work days were harder than others. Co-workers were friendly for the most part. Did not necessarily get paid as much as I should have.
good,"Love working there but management always push you to sell and say ""Welcome to Walgreens"" or ""Be Well"". Like it sounds way to robotic! The coworkers are awesome but management stress way too much on being ""perfect"". All I can say is, it's a job."
good,"I enjoyed working there for the 10 years, I did learn a lot about the pharmacy business. and the culture of a big business."
good,"This is a good company to start out working with, but I wo.uld not stick around for long. They would not work with my school schedule."
good,"My days as shift leads always started with checking the clipboard to see what daily tasks needed to be completed,  followed by a walk through of the store.  One of the most enjoyable parts of the job was my work environment and co-workers. We worked as a team when needed to get tasks completed. I learned how to correct deposits in the computer if there was an error from the previous day.  I also learned how to receive money from the bank upon arrival as well as making payments."
good,"Employment with Walgreens taught me a lot about the retail industry and was a great learning experience. Although I enjoyed my time with Walgreens, the company did not offer the advancement opportunities I expected."
good,"It was fun, but alot like high school. I got make money by being a customer service rep, and enjoyed every minute of that."
good,Walgreens wasn't exactly the type of company I took a liking too. Management was great an helpful all the time but the long hours with only 7.25 per hour was hard.
good,"atypical day at work  wash helping people  with what they need help with making  sure thing  were in order and clean, i learned that there many people from different walks of life e and you shouldn't judge no mater what never know what a person has been threw or is  going threw and i was happy to put smiles on  others faces. My co workers were great fun an  energetic .my job wasn't to hard  so i cant compliant but the most enjoyable part of the day i seeing  what a change i can make in someones  life"
good,"A typical day at Walgreens as a cashier is to check customers out. You also have to stock in between checking. I have learned that you are more than a cashier, you're the face of the company. The managers and co-workers both work as a team. The hardest part of my job is trying to check and stock. I most enjoy meeting new customers."
good,"It's a decent place to work at if you need temporary work or if you need something to just get you by. Very hard to advance in this company at bottom of the totem pole unless you brown nose to the assistant and store managers. Most of the coworkers are in the same boat of having a temporary job, so it's easy to relate with other employees and have a good time at work. Some of the customers can even change your day completely around and make you smile and laugh, especially for the regulars. But the same can be said for some customers who come in, and are rude, arrogant a**holes. So be aware that you will encounter both amazing and despicable customers. If you do have the drive and enthusiasm, Walgreens will work with you and allow you to learn the daily operations of the store, from cashier, cosmetics, photo and even pharmacy. There's always something to do, but unless you're in it for the long haul and enjoy customer service, this will get tedious and annoying unless you move on up and get promoted within the company."
good,"This job paid very great. I got hired on as a manager. I would recommend that anyone who applies for this job have at least a year of managerial experience. It is stressful and in the event coworkers, or managers aren't present it is the manager's duty to work the entire store, including pharmacy. Many times you many have to work in another city without prior notice. You do get reimbursed for miles the same day which is good. I had major problems with the store manager. She micromanaged me and found things wrong with everything I did. This made working very stressful and unpleasant despite the fact that I got praise from coworkers from all different stores. The only thing that was good about this job was the pay, benefits, and paid vacations. If you don't have experience as a manager it is hard because working an entire store, security, money, and managing sometimes challenging coworkers can be tough."
good,You have the chance to learn about the whole building and how it work and how you could improved it. It is a great way to work on your customer service.
good,It was an ok job...I think they should pay employees more... Be mire flexible with Staff as well. Be mire understanding of employees personal needs.
good,"Good environment to work in"
good,"The hardest thing about any retail job is its customers. You'll get them from all walks of life in every shape and form. Depending on which department you are working in you will get different clientele. Some customers are quite friendly and you will begin to look forward to their next return. Other customers just make you want to walk out and never come back. "
good,Walgreens encourages diversity by actively including all cultures. Management is catching up with the industry in working remotely.
good,Its a great place to start off with even grow into mid management. The benefits are ok but can be better. Its your typical retail setting.
good,"Typical job but it does not pay a competitive wage. The people were ok, but if you work your rear off, you get barely any recognition and they terminate you if you are late 4 mins."
good,"most enjoyable about this job is the people that you meet,greet,and see everyday or few times a week. you get all kinds of wonderful people to talk to sometimes, they even pass on some knowledge onto you.while, they are shopping at our store."
good,"Typing prescription, handling customer in store phone inquiries and in the drive thru while trying to put away medication shipment make work hectic. "
good,"receive truck and vendors"
good,"Learned a lot from working in such terrible conditions, however it made me not enjoy my job as a pharmacy tech. Would never want to work for this company again."
good,"I learned a lot working for Walgreens, I was trained in different equipments, such as Smart Cabinets. Also I receivged seminars about how to focus in quality, accurate. This make me enjoy  what I was doing. Because if I don't do it right, I can affect the health of a person."
good,I was crossed trained which is what I wanted. I was able to do what was expected of me exept my speed was not fast enough. No matter what I tried it was not good enough
good,Lots of laughs and positive attitude with customers. Learned to multitask. The management at the store I worked at was cold and very unfriendly. My co workers were mainly college students and had their own clique. Hardest part of the job was keeping quiet when grouchy customers or management came around. Enjoyed the customers and different personalities.
good,"Typical day involves dealing with customers, doctors, nurses, filling and typing prescriptions, order management and other tasks."
good,I really learned a lot at my externship site. Would love to make a career here. Hope to work as a pharmacy tech in the near future.
good,"It was the customer service, they make your hard work easy with every smile. I  learned how to please each one 100%, and if what they wanted was over or don't find it, I just give them some similar or same quality as they want it."
good,"What started as a nice position and job within Walgreens has turned into a nightmare. Change is inevitable, but it should always be for the good. From a guarantee of at least 37-38 hours a week has been cut to 30-32 hours, with hinting of more reductions. Couple that with the company/management not expecting or even caring that you have a life outside of them (short staffed, overworked employees), INFLEXIBILITY, dealing with customers that have free range to curse you out and degrade you, scream bloody murder and false advertisement when you run out of an item, and being complained to at a management or corporate level for defending yourself against any of these scenarios, and you have a disaster and many people willing to walk out on the job. "
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consists of Stocking shelves, cleaning, providing customer assistance, checking people over at the register. Bake up cashier for brake time."
good,This is a great part time job for someone trying to make some extra money. Management is great and works well with my current schedule and would recommend my current store to anyone.  I have had the opportunity to move up to management but that is not the career I am searching for.
good,A typical day would be overwhelming and stressful. As soon as I walked into my station in the pharmacy I would be greeted with a line of 7 or more patients waiting in line to be helped. This would go on for my full shift of 5 hours with one 15 minute break in between.
good,Walgreens was an excellent company providing benefits to their employees with room for advancement if desired. They are leaders in the retail market with innovative methods to improve the speed of prescription processing.
good,"Learned that teamwork is best component to get tasks done."
good,"managers make their own rules and dont follow corp policy.  change minds to fit their needs not everyone elses.  Cashier, stock shelves, print photographs"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that no two days are the same. I walk into work with a new challege or obstacle everyday. I never sit down and you are always on the move, which makes the day go by very fast. Every co-worker has their own personality and some are easier to get along with than others but they all become family.The hardert part of the job is the amout of time they want you there and the constiant schedule changes as well as working various nights, weekends and holidays."
good,"corporate run from midwest, productive but stressfull enviornment"
good,"Company set pay cap for hourly paid employees. Ever since then, everything has been going downhill. You work like a dog and get treated like garbage. Pay is not worth what you go through."
good,"The day would start out with the opening of the store and preparation of daily tasks. First you would count all the days making sure they are correct and balanced with change so the cashier will be ready for the day. Then you would balance the cash reports and see if any notes from previous night were left. If notes were left you would try to fix those problems for example missing cash, customer or employee problems, and see what wasn't completed the previous days list. After that is done you check the emails quickly to see if any pressing issues needed to be handled and then you start making the list for the day for the employees and fellow managers. That would be the hardest part making sure every person had a job to do and was able to handle that job and can complete in a timely manner. All of the employees were good people and easy to get along with but have different skill levels. Which I feel is the hardest part finding a task that the can handle but not make them feel bad when you give harder tasks to other people. The most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with regular customers that know your name and you know theirs. It make the day go quicker when you can enjoy your work and the people that surround you. That is a typical day in management for myself."
good,"Day to day operations are fast paced you are responsible for all apects of the store operations from loss prevention, customer service, coaching and developing staff, creating and implementing store action plans, Reviewing you P&L statement to work on opportunties, Planning for the month/week/day and following up on these plans, Community and Senior outreach"
good,a tipical day at the office is unloading product from a trailer sorting the orders & shipping it out. hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace. It was a good leaning expiriance though.
good,"Able to lead my team members forward with  great customer service."
good,"You can learn great new skills here and get a better understanding of how medical insurance works, but management leaves more to be desired."
good,Corporate policies not conducive to good customer service.Very little interaction from supervisors is a great concern to all of us. High turnover. Pharmacy Techs no longer properly trained to assume duties. I loved my co-workers however. We worked together well to produce the best outcome and keep the workplace less stressful by helping each other.
good,"At least the store I worked at, it was almost always kind of busy. There was never a dull moment. I always had something to do. It can get a little tiring because some days it'll get a little physical (like bringing down heavy boxes about 10 ft high). It felt very insecure bringing boxes down because it was just you and no on else helping you. Management was a wash. They very stern, never seemed happy and way too harsh on people. Also, I would get scolded for things they THOUGHT I did and people who did those things never were even turned to (such as texting). You do get 2 shifts and a lunch break which is great when the day is tough. However, because you were so busy with so many tasks assigned, 90% of the time the second break was never taken. This isn't a bad place to work at, just make sure the people you work for aren't rude."
good,"Work place could be a little more organized and practice more verbal communication skills,"
good,I worked at Walgreens for almost 8 years was told that I was going to be made lead of the photo department when I came back from having my son and it never happened. The boss gave me a bad review because I went over his head because of the way he had treated me at work. After I quit at least 5 other people quit. They are cutting hours and closing down stores
good,As soon as I arrive and past when I leave we are always busy.  This was my first job as a technition and I was going to school for it at the same time.  The pharmacy manager and all the other technicians were very helpful in training me in all parts of the pharmacy.
good,A typical day at work consists of an over abundance of tasks with additional tasks not related to your position/department. Staff is friendly but can commonly be unreliable causing excessive workload. Management is generally good with quality personnel however the company often hires young managers with no experience over promoting from within too often. Hardest part of the job is excessive workload due to unreliable associates and the need to train your superior on how to perform their duties as a manager. Most enjoyable part of the job is the customer service and having the ability to make their day.
good,"I managed a staff of no less than 10 people daily, delegated tasks, restocked inventory, handled financial activities, supervised photo lab orders, and handled logistics."
good,"A typical work day will usually involve cashier duties, stocking shelves, and maintaining a clean and orderly workplace. Customer service is an obvious requirement and is probably the main source of any stress you will get from the job, but it is mostly straightforward. You'll be working with all sorts of people at the store, but mostly middle aged folks and kids who come straight out of high school. Management will vary across stores; you can get one who will watch your every move or one who will give you a little longer leash at work. Most of the pressure for pushing sales at work will be handed down from the district offices. In most cases however, things will sell themselves."
good,good environment  bad pay and hours. raises are only once a year and no more than 25 cents. hours fluctuate from week to week no stability. love my coworkers though
good,"Flexible hours, excellent benefits. Typical work day varies.  Management is generally supportive.  Co-workers are mostly friendly and supportive."
good,overalli madelong term friends at walgreens but would not work foranother walgreens. typical day is someone getting cursed out or threatened.
good,A typical day at work consists of greeting customers and processing transactions. At the end of the day I face all my aisles. I learned great time management and cashier skills. Management is great and they put fort effort into working as a team. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with rude customers but you learn to overcome this by always being respectful and polite. What is the most enjoyable part of this job is creating relationships with customers. It feels good for them to come back and remember you or call in and give a praise about your work ethic.
good,"Very busy, from start to end, multitasking all the time, with almost no help. Learn to balance task from task. Learn to peace myself, and to performed in a great deal of stress. Learn new selling techniques, as well as to count registers every day after each shift. Management is very demanding, yet very helpful. Very flexible in schedule. Co-workers are nice and friendly. Hardest part of the job is the physical and fast-peace demand in an environment that continuously demands you to make critical decisions that affects customers lives and health. Personal gratification when a customer comes to you and thanks you for doing hard work in preparing their medication."
good,Walgreens was a great place to work until the company kept on changing management
good,"good work environment with the right people"
good,have to love working with the public when they are not in best of heath
good,Walgreens has been one of the best jobs I have ever had. But with the recent (and very expensive) wellness improvement it seems they are still recovering and are in constant changes in management. I very much enjoyed working with patients and have made some great friendships along the way.
good,"we are very busy, because we try to make our customer happy then we have to hard work, Then we can send the order as soon as possible and our customer happy because they get their order earlier or on time. And we can beat the competitor too."
good,"A lot to learn "
good,It was a high school job 20 years ago. From what I recall I stocked shelves and ran a cash register
good,"Operate a cash register, assist and greet customer's daily, assist in other departments, stock and replenish items through out the store"
good,"A typical day at work was stocking shelves, counters, unloading etc. also ringing up customers orders and helping customers whenever they need my assistance and interact with customers. I learned how to move at a faster pace when I work, I learned how to use the cash register and learned how to stock shelves properly. The management was very good they cared about their employees and cared about their customers. The hardest part of the job was the compensation. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"Some management issues, but every store is different. Benefits can be decent, and hours can be manageable."
good,"I had this job while I was in grad school.  The managers are pretty flexible with your time.  However. work can become very boring and long.  If you work with lazy people, it becomes a very dreadful experience.  However, it did give me a consistent paycheck."
good,Working at here taught me a lot about working with people.  Enjoyed putting smiles on my customers face as the enter and leaves the store
good,"Best part of job is interacting with specialty stores that I oversee.  Selling a service is very different and it is very important to distinguish our services versus the competitors."
good,"I was the technical support for the photo department. If any equipment broke or was not performing correctly, they would call into the helpcenter and I would assist them in getting back up and running. If by chance I was unable to do that, I would escalate the problem to the correct technical people for further assistance. During this job, I would say I learned a lot about technical support and dealing with customer service."
good,Is not the company I started with. Has become more into treating employees like nothing more then hourly employees and not like a family.
good,"Stable job, days usually very slow. Very customer service based job. Nice place to began a career,"
good,"Inventory control, ordering, open and close, check in truck, support and encourage and lead employees, problem solving with customers and store problems."
good,Good environment to work in nice staff you get to meet new people everyday and u also have you faithful costumers. and you learn alot about products and other things.
good,Walgreens is a fun and good learning experience every employee is a team player
good,Enjoyed the people I work with and customers I help to serve.
good,it was a good amount of work but I really didn't like the shift that much.
good,It has been interesting working for this company. I have been with them for 3 plus years with no advancement.  There are no holidays off because this company is open year round 24 hours a day.  Management seems to care but it all feels generic.
good,"Working retail can be rewarding.  A typical day would be filling and reviewing prescriptions, counseling patients on problems, calling insurances, calling doctor's offices to resolve problems, and compounding medications, and giving immunizations. The hardest part of the job is not having enough help in the pharmacy.  The people that I work with are the best and ease this problem.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers and helping them resolve their issues."
good,Not much I can say about this company. I just wished it would hire more staff to service the amount of traffic it receives throughout the day. The staff would be happier and more efficient with the customers. More staff. Less complaints in the pharmacy.
good,"Working at Walgreens is beneficial if you are looking for experience as a pharmacy technician or experience that will translate into retail pharmacy experience prior to matriculation into pharmacy school. However, the job atmosphere is lacking. The pharmacies are typically understaffed and filled with overworked and disgruntled employees."
good,"Fast pace, always busy. Enjoy working with the employee and store managers. Hardest part of my job, doing the same job for less money. I love the customers!"
good,If you enjoy a high volume store Walgreens is the place for you.
good,I learned everything I know about pharmacy from this business. I also learned that there needs to be a place and time for every conversation and who to make conversation with. I enjoyed my co-workers very much and I'm still in touch with them to this day. Management had their job to do and it was usually done correctly.
good,I will help customers to find products around the store and check them out when there were ready.
good,"Reviewed patient accounts daily searching for reasons why claims were not paid by insurance companies. "
good,"A typical day at work is a very busy day. It is always high performance and excessively busy. My most learnt abilities at Walgreens are multitasking and communication. Management needs work, which will improve the work environment and employees efficiency. However, co-workers are amazing and caring. The hardest part of my job is not being able to help everyone. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with different people each day."
good,"Usually it depends on how many people you have to service that comes in.  If there is no one there, than if there is any work that needs to be done in the store, I would take care of it and accomplish that which needed to be accomplished."
good,"Help a customer checkout their items on the cash register and restocking items"
good,"good people around company."
good,"Not bad, though there are little benefits and such but "
good,With the exception of my last manager the company had great employees and leadership.
good,"At Walgreens I had to help out in cashiering, assist customers with questions or concerns of the store and our products, stock merchandise and maintain the store looking neat and clean. I have learned to work under stressful days and stressful situations. I get along with my coworkers and they make time go by faster. The hardest part of work was when we were short on staff and having to manage all work duties on your own. The most enjoyable part of my job is having regular customers coming back and knowing customers leave satisfied."
good,"Normal salary and benefits"
good,"Management is pretty good. they try and do the best they can with what they are given. Co-workers, mostly, don't want to work here anymore, due to there being too few hours available."
good,"decent workplace, decent pay, not so reliable hours. weird management."
good,A typical day working at Walgreens consisted of helping customers whether it was answering a question/concern or finding a product. I also stocked shelves and translated for Spanish speaking customers to the pharmacist. I learned how to multi-task faster. Some of the co-workers were very nice. Although most just kept to themselves. My job wasn't hard but the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help a customer.
good,"-Everyday brought on a challenge, which made the job fun. "
good,"A typical work day is filled with constant prescription drop offs, telephone calls from patients and doctors, prescription pick-ups, inventory management, resolve billing issues, and assisting colleagues with daily pharmacy tasks.  The stores I have worked at in the past and the current store I reside in are all high volume customers and fast pace.  I believe my environment for the past nine years has taught me how to multi-task at a high level.  The people I work with are hard-working, honest, and helpful.  Work is manageable when co-workers are cooperative and open.  When everyone gets along, it can be the most enjoyable part of this job and makes the hardest part of the job easier to handle.  I believe the hardest part of the job would be satisfying every need of every customer and keeping the pharmacy operating at a high pace to meet all demands."
good,"-Responsible for inventories turnover and balancing daily cash flows."
good,"Outstanding company to work for when I first started. When Walgreens re-vamped their Management positions the family atmosphere was lost.  Loved the customer interaction! Learned many new skills. Hardest part of the job was inventory receiving. Many of the totes were to heavy and often caused injury, flying out of the delivery trucks . Not enough staff at night in 24 hour stores, Manager was often left to run & work the store by themselves if their only employee called in on overnights."
good,"The day is non stop. You do learn what is expected of you and more. There is not to much micro management, but there is some. Co-workers are like any other. The hardest part of the job is accepting that there is no escape. The most enjoyable part of the job is that once it is done, you go home."
good,At times the pace was hectic but manageable. I enjoyed the challenge.  I was able to keep busy. I found great satisfaction in working with patients. Having dealt with many physicians and other health care professionals as well as the many insurance companies throughout the years has become a learning experience.
good,Was a great place work at one time. Benefits are being taken away on an annual basis
good,I learned a lot of things with Walgreens.  Thank you for the opportunity to become a better manager
good,"I had a positive experience working at Walgreens as I love to assist customers in finding the perfect product for themselves. I learned how to utilize my love of people and Cosmetics to assist people in finding the best product for themselves! I had a wonderful time with my co-workers, we had a great crew at my store and we made work a lot of fun! The most difficult aspect of my job there is the few times when Customers would become upset with the pace of the cashier or the length of the line. This is a problem that is usually remedied with a sincere apology."
good,if you get the right manager then it can be a fun productive place to work.
good,Overall a pretty good company to work for.  The profit sharing is good.
good,"It's definitely not a job for persons with a temper problems. You would typically be one calls majority of the day. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the angry customers, but otherwise it is a good job."
good,"The work was always fun"
good,"A typical day at work would be if I opened, editing cash reports, price changes, checking-in vendor orders, responding to customer service calls, checking e-mail, working on assigned re-sets-revisions, maintaining my area of the stockroom, support in photo or pharmacy when called, delivering change when called, assisting in Brinks pick-up of cash bundles, inventory control, reduction of shrink. As you can see, multi-tasking was key in being an effective member of management."
good,"Just a job to get you by til you finish school, they work arounf your schedule"
good,"A lot of day to day crisis either with employees or customers,  means problem solving and resolving issues daily."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is putting a smile on my customers face. Knowing i helped them have a better day and get the product they were looking for makes me feel good. I also like developing my staff and showing them new things. Helping them grow as a person and with the company.
good,I have a lot of customer stories from working at Walgreens...while it was painful at the time I'm glad I have the experience of working with all kinds of people and dealing with all kinds of customers. It was a good first job and taught me a lot about how a business should be run.
good,My position was eliminated. OK company if you want to work in retail management. The company has moved away from loving their employees to paying them less and expecting them to do more.
good,I learned how to manage different departments and training new employees. I learned a lot about inventory management.
good,Great hours and days. Worked as a Picker in the Pharmacy Department. I attended Remington College for Pharmacy Technician and this job helped me to learn more about different prescriptions and medicines.
good,Great place to grow. Long hours in retail atmosphere. Customers with coupons are the hardest to deal with
good,"In all a good learning experience. While employed here I was encouraged to learn and better myself. I did find that they were often lacking that human touch. HR seemed more concerned with trying to find people ""gaming the system"" than helping and providing support for employees."
good,I would handle and count money while checking inventory and stocking shelves. I learned basic workplace skills by working in retail. Co-workers and management were all nice and made the workplace enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and fast paced, ive learned how to multi-task and keep in mind of the customers questions and needs most of my coworkers are new and follow under the direction of me. My job is only more difficult when we are short staff. The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying the customers."
good,Understaffed.  Co-workers sometimes seem like they don't want to be there.
good,I loved working with everyone but they did not stand up for their employees when they should have they were more worried about loosing a dollar. They promised me full time in the beginning and cut my hours and I told them the only way I would be able to work so far out is if the hours were good.
good,"I loved working with my co-workers, and all the regular customers that came in.  It was a fun and enjoyable place to have worked the past seven years."
good,"I would run the front register, very long days with not much to do."
good,"I worked in a call center setting, the environment was like any other call center. A typical day at work was filled with chatter and laughter due to the conversations we have with the patients. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a patient who was not too happy with pass service from a store. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing a patient say that they are completely satisfied."
good,"Busy Busy Busy... I work hard from the time I walk in until the time I leave. I cannot remember the last day I had down time to even clean shelves. Everyone is pretty easy to work with and make work go by a little bit faster. I hardest part of my job is dealing with rude people that no matter what you can not please them. But, I do it and move on and try to get the happier people out even happier."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens heing the person that put a smile on the customsers face at the end of their visit
good,"I had the privelage of working under great assistant managers at two different locations during my three years at Walgreens. The Walgreens structure makes individual compensation for working hard impossible due to wage discrepancy assurance from location to location. I worked as in the photo department and helped open the store, print and organize photo orders, and customer assistance. I also helped maintain store location moves, as a cashier, as well as in the pharmacy as a pharmacy technician but without pay or position adjustment. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new and interesting people every day. When I am able to give a smile to a person who is coming in for a prescription and they say thank you for being so helpful, that fulfills what words can not describe. Although, some days can become a challenge, I always keep in mind the customer is here because they are not feeling well or just need a listening ear."
good,"Walgreens was the first place I went to work for when I moved to Marco Island.  Each day was very predictable and enjoyable.  I would always check the products and stock shelves when not running a register.  I truly enjoyed my co-worker and all that she taught me.  Our management was great when I first started, but after a few weeks, a new manager came on and I'm not a fan of micromanagers.  The hardest part of my job was keeping the shelves stocked.  My most favorite part was all the new people I would meet and where they were vacationing from."
good,good company to work for but not worth the time and effort it takes for a promotion. when you do earn the promotion all that is given is more work and horrible schedule with the same pay. only positive i can take from my 10 years of experience is the knowledge of how the retail world functions. i offer this knowledge to the next company that gives me an opportunity that they wont regret.
good,"I looked forward to going to work, to helping all the familiar faces I have helped over the years. My coworkers and I were like a little family back there. I was confident in my work. One of the hardest things about my job was not being able to help someone because of insurance issues/costs of medications. But when there was something I could do, it was the highlight of my day knowing that someone received the care they truly needed."
good,"Receiving orders, development of pictures, and correct organization of pictures within proper bins. Customer Service.  Professionalism"
good,"I come to work and talk to the manager on duty to find out how the day has been and what specific things need to be done, if I am closing the store that night. I count the safe. Then I go back to the pharmacy to make sure they are doing ok. At the end of the night I pulled the cash register drawers and balance them. Then I balance the safe and drop the deposit. If I am opening the store, I count the drawers and safe and set everything up to get ready to open. I go back to the pharmacy to help when I'm needed. When I'm in the pharmacy I help fill prescriptions, enter prescriptions into the computer, ring patients up, and answer the phone. I get along with everyone I work with. I enjoy talking to the Customers and Patients. I help the Cashier at the front of the store when needed as well. I'm not always happy with how the store is run, due to the upper managerment that is not in the store. They don't seem to understand or care how our particular store works."
good,"Great workflow and wonderful co-workers in the pharmacy but we are never given enough hours, techs, or pharmacists that are needed to keep promise times on prescriptions. Management is all about customer service but they dont realize cutting hours constantly hinders our ability to keep the customers happy."
good,Little training was given when asked for some was told they were to busy. was written up for to many errors. Then decided to give me 1 1/2 hour of training. Would never recommend anyone to work at that facility.
good,Working in RX and working on floor merchandising the store. Cash handling and making sure the store runs smooth.
good,Training of new employees or even old employees to best serve the customer and to fulfill the managers duties on any given day working as a team is always the goal.  The most enjoyable of the job is getting the list done by the Store Manager.  I learned a great deal in dealing with customers and employees all personalities are different.
good,I worked part-time here. There was always work to be found-whether it was putting up sales tags or stocking shelves.  It made the shift go quickly.  I enjoy helping clients.  They knew my name and I knew theirs.  I worked with great people who worked hard also. Immediate supervisors were always on hand to lend support.  But the store manager was not always supportive.  He had a great responsibility to run the store well.  And many times he was needed in other places and could not be on hand for the workers.
good,"A typical day at work involved filling prescriptions, cashier of pharmacy meds, and patient customer service.  Management was going through changes both in staff and the eventual relocation of the business during this period.  I found my co-workers intelligent, professional and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was the occasional unfriendly customer but the most enjoyable part was the attention to detail which made for fast resolutions."
good,"When I started with the company, it was a great place to work. Plenty of room for growth if one had the determination to work hard. The company has since gone in a direction designed to add more responsibility and a higher workload with little or no compensation."
good,"I was the HPS (Head Photo) at Walgreens. I loved it, but other employees for some reason always seemed depressed. It made it hard to come to work even when you are happy. It feels like that any walgreens you walk into your happiness just goes away."
good,"It started out to be a fun place to work, but once managers switched it became really stressful. it was due to the fact that some of these managers were new and we had to train someone that was new to retail."
good,"Working at Walgreens was repetitive but the co-workers and the managers were usually great people to get along with. The shifts were always at least 8 hours long and during that time i would be at the photo department, cash register, stocking shelves, helping managers with their duties or helping customers with their needs. The people whom i worked with was definitely the most enjoyable part of the job because everyone was uniquely different from one another. Management wasn't very strict but they would make sure you would always have something to work on to make the time go by. I learned a lot of things from learning new technology in the photo department, computer usage in the office and commands on the scanner telxon. Also learned how to approach people differently based on certain judgements i made. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was having to multitask with 5-10 things at once and dealing with angry customers while we were short handed. At the end of the day though we would all get through and start up again where we left off the next."
good,"I've learned a lot new materials from the managers, co-workers, and the customers while working at Walgreen's and still learning new materials everyday."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens.. The hardest  part was leaving..
good,Working for Walgreens corporation was an experience. The company is opened 365 days a year so I worked most holidays. I worked as a cahier and that was a pretty easy job. I enjoyed see different customers everyday.
good,"A typical day would first to walk the store, know what your walking into, count the safe, make sure the money is what it's suppose to be. "
good,Learned lots of customer service skills-dealing with general public and some technical (photo lab). Co-workers were good. Assistant managers were good. Store manager was not that good. Some of the hardest parts of job were dealing with general public and fulfilling other duties other than cashier. Enjoyable parts could be that you met a lot of interesting people and have good co-workers.
good,"Years ago Walgreens was a great place to work, but because of poor decisions made by Walgreens Corporate recently it has now turned into a poor working environment.  Hours are cut, pay is cut, positions are restructured or were disposed of entirely, all under the guise that Walgreens isn't doing that well.  Yet anyone who can research the company will see that they are up in revenue and the CEO while making 14 million a year, thinks it's ok to buy another pharmacy over seas.  But as a work place Walgreens isn't that bad depending on who you work with.  Store level, the employees work hard and get paid very little, while the people in corporate don't do much actual work, make poor decisions, and get paid much much more.  It honestly makes no sense to me."
good,"A typical day at walgreens is always a very busy day.  It began with counting the working fund in the stores safe, preparing each registers with enough cash to service customers.  Checking emails from coporate or regional managers, reviewing sales figures, checking sales and cash reports then forwarding them to the district office.  I would then walk the store to check the overall condition, to investigate its presentation, whats selling, and if things need to be relocated based on the season.  Working for walgreens has taught me about the retail industry and how to attract customers and their spending habits based on meeting their needs and desires of any particular part of the year.  I have also gained experience dealing with people.  Whether they are co-workers, patients, or a consumer who needs a gallon of milk.  The hardest part of working for walgreens was the fact that I was willing to relocate to different stores as needed.  The most enjoyable part of walgreens was working with people who appreciate your attention to detail and the hard work invested into a positive shopping experience.  People would constantly thank me for my attention to meeting their needs and the attention given to them while shopping in my store."
good,"deal with many coustemers , i learn how to solve problems right away the management keeps employees busy , and helps when needed . The co workers are friendly , the hardest part is standing in one spot for a long period of time , the most enjoyable part is interacting with coustmers."
good,"This particular locations needs better managers."
good,"Want to further my career, feeling a bit stifled at this point."
good,"I would clock in the wee hours of the night, usually 11pm and work til the sun rises which was about 730am. Ive learned to keep inventory and product placement. My coworkers were great to work with and even my boss. The work environment was not at all stressful but it was demanding. The hardest part was adjusting to the night life and the most enjoyable part of that job was meeting all the different types of people that you come across and how you can help them."
good,"I had a hectic, busy day. I worked in the cosmetic department and cashed out customers. I learned how to problem solve and handle different types of people. Management was good! My co-workers were helpful and a joy to be around. The most enjoyable part of my job was building a relationship with my customers. "
good,"Fast paced pharmacy environment, Great employees, Mostly hard working people."
good,"Enjoyed learning although management couldve been more organized "
good,"I like most of the people I work with, but it is obvious in this job that the good workers like my self are used by this company without any extra motivations. There have been few times where I have felt like the big guys in this corporation actually care about the people who do all the work. "
good,"The assistant manager job title at Walgreens changed, making it so that I was going to be forced into a ""demotion"". Other than that, it would have been a good place to work. There was a lot of responsibility, a lot of different areas to be knowledgeable in such as pharmacy, photo, cosmetics, etc. The pay was worth the responsibility until they were going to cut pay by $4-5 an hour. Other than that, not a bad place to work. "
good,"Too many changes have happened within the company. Pharmacy doesn't always have enough hours for the the people they need back there, floor employees can't get enough training from management simply from the lack of work management is expected to do each day so their training falls onto other employees who don't see the point."
good,"Great Company!  Good co-workers. Work hard and learn a lot. Good benefits but, annual pay must be increased. Overall, good company."
good,"Walgreens is a decent place to work. Had you asked me a few years ago, I'd have given it a much more positive review. With their recent management restructure, among other changes, I would strongly advise anyone wanting to advance to apply elsewhere."
good,"On a typical day at work I would come in and fill medications, type prescriptions, and help customers. I was responsible for compounding medications, making the schedules, and supervising the other technicians as well as performing the other tasks necessary for a retail pharmacy to run as it should. I would say that I work well with fellow employees as well as management. The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone happy and the most enjoyable is going home knowing that I have done so to the best of my ability."
good,"Check daily ordering list, supervise and making sure tasks are being done correctly. Check on daily cash report for cash handling, review daily shrink maintain money/change order for safe, depending time of shift complete end of day paper work and cash bundles ready for pick up next day and successfully balance for end of night. I've been taught how to run the store on my own by my previous store manager who also promoted me to a shift leader. Know how to work with budget (hours for store) occasionally do schedule for employees, payroll. Good team working environment all co-workers get along really great its sort of like a big professional family working together. Hardest part of my job is my schedule, I do not have a set schedule and work at other stores in El Paso with very little notice on schedule changes. The most enjoyable part of my job is being at my home store I enjoy what i do and enjoy training my co-workers and doing my bookkeeping duties."
good,"A typical day at work was standing behind the counter, you weren't able to go very far. Management was not the best. My Co-workers were fun to work with."
good,"A typical day included getting my cash drawer, verifying the money in the drawer. I worked as a Pharmacy Technician as well as provided breaks for other cashiers within the store.  I learned almost every aspect of working at Walgreens from helping to unload the truck and stocking shelves, ordering special OTC medications to resetting merchandise display shelves.  This job was not hard, you just need to be honest, hardworking, enjoy conversing with and helping people find what they need. "
good,"A typical day at work is busy and as fun as you can make it. I learned patience and how to be a team player. I also, learned to bite my tongue. The management is wishy washy, but certain managers will help you shall any issues come up. A majority of my co-workers are hardworking like myself and friendly. The hardest part of the job is knowing who to trust because there are lots of backstabbers there. Another hard part of the job is not having reliable managers to help you out. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers and learning about others day. I also, happened to like making sales so I would call that another positive. The company teaches the more you know the more you grow; I wouldn't totally agree with that statement because my financial status stayed the same. The company does not believe in giving many raises. Maybe one every other year and we're not allowed to have over time."
good,I love pictures and working with other peoples pictures and the people were very nice to work for and understanding
good,when you punch in you need to put your life aside and deal with customers. I enjoyed getting to know many of my regular customers and we grew to know about eachothers families. The hardest part of this job was dealing with difficult customers that you could not make happy no matter what you tried to help with.
good,"My average shift are mid and close when i come in my first thing to do is count our safe. After that i proceed to check our daily list of task see what needs to be done. I give direction to other employees in their task making sure everything on the list is completed and properly handled. When closing i count all the cash register drawers, recount the safe, and prep the days earnings to be picked up and delivered."
good,"Unfortunately, there was such a high turnover at that job that it was a negative atmosphere at the job. Many people were extremely disenchanted, and left after several months. The job was definitely a learning experience, however, as it showed me many different things that I should be looking for in a job."
good,"Retail Pharmacy is a perfect job for professionals that love to be on the go. It keeps you busy and before no time time, your shift is over!"
good,"My tipical day was placing product in a slot where it would stay for picking orders. Learned how to operate 5 different forklifts, and achieved the certificate of achievement. Management was good, co-workers were nice and easy to get along with. There was nothing to hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning more everyday. I was never late and never called off!"
good,"We work on three different teams yet pull together as one team to get the job done. We must pull together as pharmacists, and with the cooperation of nurses, we can get the drug to a patient for an infusion at a paticular time."
good,I am a pharmacy technician currently working for Walgreens Pharmacy I've been working for Walgreens for 1 1/2 almost 2 years. Working for this company is definitely a challenge but you pull through each day of work because you know you've worked really hard and did a good job. My co workers whom I work with everyday cheer me up so I'm always enthusiastic to begin work. We fill and transcribe on average 300 to 400 rx's per day. Although it gets hectic at times we get everything done promptly. I've learned so many things as a pharmacy technician and I'm anxious to learn even more. Although working for Walgreens has enhanced my knowledge I can always learn more working for a new pharmacy possibly even hospital pharmacy or go into admixture. The hardest part about my job would have to be insurance. Every insurance a patient brings in can have so many problems but if it's too tough for me to handle I always ask my co workers for assistance.
good,"Well a typical day at work greeting customers always have a positive attitudei learned people skills ,the managment is great willing to help people who need it.My co-workers are nice organized and do a good job,the hardest part of the job would be stockng.I enjoyed every part of the job"
good,Walgreens is a great company that everyday tries to stick to the things that got them to where they are today while taking risks and trying new products
good,Responsible for a department; which entails inventories and making orders. Also helping management with accounting.
good,"Soon as I get to work, I check E mails, daily updates about sales, and new promotions, and tasks from district manager, Check daily sales, daily goals compare to LY for each departments like Cosmetics, Photo, Seasonal, Pharmacy, OTC drugs, etc. Then make a work list for my employees keeping in mind their daily sales target and daily task list in their respective departments. We started off the day with a mini meeting every day where I informed my employees about sales, and what we should promote in the store to achieve our goal in their respective departments. The best part of my job was cross training employees in different departments, coaching them to improve and help them grow within the company. The most important skills I learned at Walgreen is Time Management, always making sure to have a backup plan if plan A failed. I learned that its very important to coach employees and how to get your employees to build trust. People's skills/emotional intelligence is very important as a manager, because we are only as good as our people behind us."
good,cooked pizzas and worked cashier the time of my stay. loved working around food
good,"A typical day consists of doing reports regarding inventory, customer service, manager type duties such as returns, or customer inquiries on products, checking in vendors, price changes, etc.; Many multi-tasking duties in a day;"
good,I had many bad experiences working for walgreens. The management was awful. They did not work as a team
good,"For me, being on overnights, its about getting resets and revisions done as well as finishing up any of the daily tasks that the day shift couldnt get to. The hardest part of the job would probably be the third shift. It isnt a normal work schedule."
good,It's Retail - You deal with the public and the public is not very bright.
good,Hours are not a guarantee at Wags. Wages are on the lower side.
good,"A typical day at work would be to sign in your phone and take calls from new patients or patients who wanted their specialty medication shipped out to them. This job was different because instead of helping customer with technical issues, it was more so issues with them getting their medication in order to live or stay well. So I learned compassion and to make sure I give them the best and most accurate service. The hardest part of the job was giving insurance quotes to new patients who insurance may not cover the cost of the medication. The most enjoyable part of the job was making patients laugh or smile through the phone and making their day even while they are sick,"
good,very friendly co workers and very typical day i learned more then i though i would the late hours was the hardest part of the job
good,Structured corporate setting. Ideal for entry level experience. Thrives on process and procedure. Many opportunities to grow.
good,"Good Hospitality, generous customer service, answer calls, take messages, process photos, handle cash, check, and card transactions, provide correct change, sort and balance monies, maintain sales and waste records, stock and inventory, and monitor security issues"
good,walgreens currently has eliminated their assistant managers positions. It is not a company to join if you want to be a manager
good,"it is an ok workplace. you get your check on time, people are friendly and willing to help one another and the mangers are okay to work with as long as you do what they want."
good,I was a cashier and learned how to be peaceful with all kind of customers.
good,I have worked there for 5 years. I started off as a sales clerk and worked my way back to the pharmacy. I know how to do every department in the store I just cant do management duties.The employees and managment are friendly but complain a lot and gossip as well. Customers are very rude though and are right according to he company even when in your face and you feel threatened. I don't mind my job at all i just want a new experiance and new enviorment.
good,"Everyday was a new challenge as to want will happen that day, especially when working in customer service. Have to be flexible to changes."
good,During my time at Walgreens the most postive thing there was the customers because knowing that I helped someone made my day even better than when I started. The busiest time of the year which was the holiday season since the store hours were extended for the customers to come in late to do their holiday shopping.
good,"The compensation at Walgreens is to say the least, disappointing. I am cross trained in multiple departments and have been trained in lower managerial duties. In addition to this, I take great care to offer all the upsells, inform customers of new policies and products, and use the correct verbage as issued by the company with unrivaled consistency. As a cross trained clerk, I also have a number of duties to perform in a given day outside of customer service. The monetary compensation for all the work I do is borderline insulting. I am also greatly concerned with my ability to advance in the company. I (and my managers) feel that I am more than capable of moving up, but of course, there is entirely too much red tape"
good,"I was only 17 when I got this job, it was a good job to have but of course I saw so much more for my future!"
good,Responsible for all total store operations and procedures. I enjoyed with my co-workers and management team.
good,The specific Walgreens store I worked at provided much less quality than other Walgreens store I've been with. Even customers preferred to shop at other Walgreens store (few customers told me in casual talk). The management from the store I worked at was really lacking - three changes in less than six months.
good,"not for the long term, care more about making profit than serving custmers"
good,I would work with customers help them get their pictures developed. I learned how to deal with angry customers. And the best part of my job was helping others.
good,"cashhandling,stocking recieving scheduling,and great customer service"
good,I love the fact that you get to interact with the customers on a day to day basis.
good,"At Walgreens I grew as a person and as an adult. Accepting the job right after college, it gave me the opportunity to spread my wings in the ""real world."" I learned many skills such as, managing people, processing payroll, creating the schedule, cash management, and understanding a cash report. It has been great working at Walgreens but I feel that I have reached the capacity for growth there and am looking forward to new opportunities."
good,"Not enough hours to give details. I filled prescriptions, entered prescriptions for pharmacsist, some compound, worked cash register and provided customer services"
good,To work here you need to live within ten to fifteen min of Ann Arbor. The attendence policy is very strick and the department managers aremicro managing which can make it uncomfortable and unpleasant to work. But they have a nice kitchen area with vending machines and its.fun during the employee spirt weeks and etc.
good,"My schedule is very flexible because I am in school and I also take care of my ill father. A typical work day for me is to work the front counter register. My superiors are very good, they take the time to teach me about the company since I just started working there."
good,"very fun place to work , but need it more pay for there employees, part time job, very busy all the time so i like that"
good,"Continuing the safe making sure all the days transactions accounted for. Cleaning up and straightening up the sales floor. Resets and revisions that come down from corporate. In my 18 years at Walgreen's I have learned working hard will help you in anything you do! I have always loved photo's I worked the majority of my time in the photo lab, and loved making my customer's happy that was truly the best part of my job seeing the smiles and hearing the thank you's. the hardest part of my job was seeing my customer's unhappy!"
good,"daily opportunity to help people, good management, can be long hours, and often work short staffed."
good,"Ok place to work, everything runs smoothly and the job can be rewarding at time, but the hours arent the best and say good bye to spending weekends and holidays with your family"
good,"A typical day of work consists of searching for new ways to build business and improve the overall customer experience. I learned that customers really appreciate outstanding service and develop loyalty when they experience high levels of service. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the uncertainity tied to the schedule. The absence of a uniform work schedule from week to week often makes it hard to stay consistent with certain aspects of the business, i.e. customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you have made a customer's experience, the best that you could have from the time they entered the door to the time they exit."
good,working in the front store seemed ok but the pharmacy was rough
good,"I am a team lead in an extremel busy call center I am support for the frontline staff handling escalations, providing coaching,order audits and tracking daily reports coworker are a very dedicated team and work well with each other hardest part of the job is not having control over some of the errors that affect the patients the most enjoyable is being able to be the one that is able to provide the patient with the care they need and deserve"
good,"It was a great experience overall. Walgreens has state of the art, relatively user friendly pharmacy technology to allow the staff to serve their patients better. I started out as a pharmacy technician, became certified, and got promoted to senior technician within a span of three years. By the end of my fourth year, I get accepted to pharmacy school. My pharmacy manager had me integrate what I learned into my work setting, which helped me develop confidence and strengthened my knowledge base. Unfortunately, Express Scripts left Walgreens in 2012. As a result, the company that I started out with in 2004 is not the same now. I recently graduated pharmacy school, however they are terminating the interns due to the fact they are unable to offer employment. The way the upper management handled the entire situation was terribly disappointing."
good,Walgreen's is a great place to work as long as you can handle having to deal with so many different managers. It can be difficult if they do not tell each other what is going on with there employees from day to day. Hence the reason I lost my job.
good,Lots of projects and displays to build. Stocking shelves and keeping your area clean are daily activities. At our busy location you usually have to back up cashier a lot to get customers in and out and on their way!
good,"As a head cashier, my day was very busy. I learned a lot about the retail business and how it is run. The management was OK for the most part and I got along with my coworkers well. The hardest part of the job as head cashier was that I was multi-tasking all day. Answering the phone taking care of customers, answering questions they might have, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interacting with my customers."
good,"Every Morning i was in charge of the open/ returned/ damaged merchandice to be scaned and print out report. All that merchandise would be tossed to the trash after. I had a couple of reports to do everyday thats had to do with the merchandise. I would organize the warehouse, make sure what we had in the systeam we had in stock also. I was incharge of ordering the merchandise and keeping everything in stock. I would re-do Shelfs that had to re-done and give out the breaks. I hardest part of this job was always keeping up with the merchandise because sometimes the numbers were off. I cant complain i really liked what i did."
good,Pros
good,"Over the past few years Walgreens has made serveral changes to the company at store level. While they are trying to improve the company and make more job titles, they do not give enough hours to run the stores efficiently and do not pay the employees competitive wages. Walgreens is a very customer service oriented business and does do a very good job of providing quality care. But with the cuts in the hourly budget, the convenience of the store is not what it should be."
good,"good work environment, good pay, and good benefits. bad bosses with less than adequate experience"
good,unable to adjust to frequent shift changes having been 9-5 for so long
good,I have been with Walgreens for 8 years and I have learned so much about customers service and team building. I know understand the importance of developing your employees and empowering them to do the quality of work that is expecting of them each shift.
good,It's a good place for someone looking for a part time job while going to school or working another job.
good,It was a typical retail atmosphere with great clientele and an excessive work week.
good,"Great starting pay, your advancement ladder is a little slow depending on if you are working in store or as a pharmacy technician, . They do great charity work , if you want to be involved i.e autism was one them , benifits are great, discounts , every store varies mine was 24 hour so very busy for sure and if that is something you can not handle You can always speak to a Manager who may try and help. Show up do your job and all will be good ."
good,"I enjoyed the experience they trained me on the job I learned a lot during my training here and went on to get certified after they provided classes,textbooks and flashcards to help prepare for the test. I am thankful for this start and wouldnt change anything about my experience.Management turnover was not good but I survived."
good,Walgreens was great when i started off 5 years ago until district management was changed and until recently hours was slashed then it went down hill. Hours was giving based on your rx volume and favoritism in the district 318.
good,"Worked there for over a year and got fired without notice a write up are anything. The employees take care of you like your family, but once the managers think you have violated company policy your done."
good,The management was rude to me because I was 16 and was unable to sell alcohol. I never felt comfortable at work. I never felt like I could talk to someone if I needed help.
good,"Walgreens is an American company that operates as the second-largest pharmacy store chain in the United States. It is a Nice place to work. Professional environment, Career advancement and training available for employees."
good,I advice this to be a stepping stone in your career. not a lot of room for growth here. Learn what you can and take it somewhere where it will benefit you more.
good,The work is pretty easy not a lot of stress.  Hours are good as well.  Also you get to meet some interesting people when working there. I would say if this is your first job or if you are looking for a career Walgreens is the place for you.
good,"Nice benefits, good health insurance, opportunity to move up. I’ve been there 7 years started out as a cashier making minimum wage, now I’m a sr pharmacy tech"
good,"The company is rapidly changing which effects management more than others. They expect a lot but pay little. It's great in flexibility in a sense that expect to close. As shift manager: there is no work balance as you may end up doing more closing shifts than opening and even on your off days, you may be asked work things. It's like you're on call 24/7. Best career move- RX. They train from within and no schooling required."
good,Small town but everyone was great lots of good people. Worked in a transition between Rite aid and Walgreens lead to a lot of customers but the managers were really helpful
good,"I enjoyed the diversity, and treating each customer the way that I would want to be treated."
good,I really didnt like working here only thing I like was I lived by the warehouse. There was always drama favoritism with the supervisors woman wouldn't get along switched departments and it was the same thing
good,"I used to be very proud of working for a company that was going toward engagement with employees and customers, where management cared for your growth and security, and goals explained to be understanded and achieved in a team effort. It's no longer like that, everybody is just taking care of themselves and making sure the goals checklist is done no matter what.  True leadership is missing."
good,I learn a lot from this company my coworkers always give me straight they always give advice and how to work and finish my tasks work with was an amazing experiences
good,"At my time, the beginning was great. I received my Pharmacy Technician IN Training License and was later told I did not get the raise to a pharmacy employee."
good,This company hires a wide variety of people from all walks of live. There all people from different countries and religion. They have flexible work schedules for students and people working more than one job.
good,"It's not for everyone, especially the older generation, or the young. The Pay sucks, the Raises suck you do good just by getting maybe 20 cents. The place is a ripoff they don't Close down for nothing, and don't care about the Safety of there Employees."
good,"great place to work, there are a lot of stressful times and times of being short staffed, but at the end of the day it all evens out ……………………………………..."
good,I learn to adjust the different personality in a open public retail store. As being a customer service associate a typical day of working is giving the customer the greatest experience to come back and shop with us. When working under a management you should always look for them to give the respect and not be taken for granted in your place of work. As management duty is to watch their employee I think we as an employee should always watch the management crew too. The hardest part about this job title is knowing to keep a smile on your face even if your day isnt going as you planned because making the customers feel welcomed is always the motive.This job is worth every experience being given.
good,"good and bad depending what type of person you are. if your a yes man you and advance pretty easy to move up the ladder, if your not well... grin and bare it."
good,"If you’re interested in becoming a pharmacist I recommend becoming a pharmacy technician. If you’re not interested in becoming a pharmacist, find what you’re passionate about and pursue that as there is not much room for growth as a pharmacy technician."
good,"If you have a good team where everyone pulls their weight you will be fine but if you don't everything falls on the asm. Also the overall enjoyment of going to work everyday depends on the store manager and how he approaches the team, or how much they help with small tasks like putting up truck."
good,"As a Photo Technician, I enjoyed working in the photo lab, especially when working with customers on their cherished family memories. There was often a strong sense of camaraderie with my coworkers, and we often worked well together to achieve our goals. In my time, I felt that management cared about my professional development and continually pushed me to explore new opportunities."
good,"The staff at Walgreens was nice, supportive but somewhat clucky.  There were times I felt like I was not ""one of "" them.  I really enjoyed the interaction with the customers,."
good,"When I wasn't tending to a customer, I was making sure my workspace was neat and clean.  I made sure to make the customers feel as welcomed as possible while also moving the line along with a smile on my face."
good,the walgreens location i was at had a few pharmacy techs that werent friendly and made me have a horrible experience. never coming back as an employee or customer.
good,shareholder value is very important to the company now. was not always that way. you have to achieve goals and sometimes the goals are not realistic. not always given enough help to acheive
good,"From the time you clock in to the time you clock out this store being where its located, is one of the busiest Walgreens around. Sadly short staffed due to corporate cutting hours and positions. Some employees unable to make the hours they need in order to keep their insurance active. A lot of changes in Management (ASM's) which affects staff and their work. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what's going to happen with your position and or hours on a weekly basis. There are and have been some good and fun times though."
good,"My first customer service job, I liked it but after awhile the customers who call in become too much there is rare that there is a slow day calls come back to back nonstop until its time to clock out."
good,"Job and worklife balance is ok. During the holiday season they expect you to be available at all times."
good,"Once you get used to the everyday mumbo jumbo Walgreens is one pf the easiest jobs around. The management is easy to work with and well trained, this helps the day go by smooth and easy."
good,Company could be better I feel like they got to comfortable in doing what they been doing for years as far as same sales ..they could upgrade and be more about growth in the community
good,Typical corporate culture and almost impossible to move up the chain of command for most people.  The day to day job is exactly what you would expect.
good,"For my first job ever at 16 it was a great place to gain some extra cash for my age at the time, but management was awful and had a man named tim hitler who would constantly cause issues with all employees, he was later fired."
good,Exposure to varying challenges makes one more diversified and prepared for the future. Time often flies when going through the day as the work environment tends to be busy.
good,"I cashiered and enjoyed most my days of customer service and trying to make all my customers happy. I learned how to use their P.O.S. system, and about company protocols. The management was outstanding, very understanding, professional and willing to give tacit training. hardest part of the job was throwing all kinds of food past expiration date into the dumpster, because everything gets written off rather than donated to emergency shelters etc.."
good,"Cashier and customer service rep,  greet the customers and patients as they enter and exit the store. Make sure every person is acknowledge. The job is a very easy job once you get the hang of it."
good,"was a decent place to work. nice, friendly customers and co-workers. pay was good. management was lacking. overall good working environment.willing to work around family"
good,Hard work isn't acknowledged so much. Proper training and terminology isn't shown accurately. Raises per evaluation are not given per policy. Favoritism is shown to much
good,Working was good but we were constantly understaffed so it was difficult to keep up. Management there was good but with the lack of people it's really difficult to say
good,I would recommend this company to anyone with good building and puzzle skill. The environment is a positive one and the employees are nice as well as the management.
good,Great job to prove that one can stand out as an employee and receive promotions within months. Many instances where there was help needed and not many employees willing to work as a team
good,High turnover rate and unless you were in the pharmacy department wasn't really a place in which I imagine myself staying at for very long. Ended up leaving and avoiding the headaches associated with the company
good,This was my first job at 16 and It was just a cashier job mostly. Manager wasn't really around all the time but he was pretty nice. Co workers not so much.
good,"You can not be lazy on the job, you must know how to face and scan items and place in right position. You must get carts from basement and place all items where they belong"
good,I was put on the register with no training the first day totally clueless about how anything works well someone watched me but was busy. I only had training on basic security
good,good company to work for. company made changes over the years the company change but I have good management at the store where  Im employed...........
good,"working there was really great . what the manager had me do was stock shelves, break boxes down, overstock in and inventory and check for  expiration dates"
good,"Little pay/raises lack of work hours no teamwork or encouragement from manager, not being informed on what the goal for the day is . Shows favoritism."
good,Willing to work with your schedule minimum wage job several departments to work with multiple shifts friendly staff  fun friendly environment easy to get to
good,"Depends on who's managing the store a typical day would be greeting customers and helping them find what they came in for. Ringing them up at the register and telling them to have a great day."
good,"Depending on The location you work at, you can work with great team members to really unhappy ones. My current location will not give me requested vacation time more than 3 months in advance."
good,"I have been there for 10 years, I can say that I have grown as person...you don’t really grow much in this company unless someone sees a good potential."
good,This job created a very great understanding of the importance of good customer service expectations. Working daily in a customer-facing roll helped me build confidence in speaking to customers and helping them solve and find daily needs.
good,I work hard and am a very dedicated emloyee. From early on in my life a vowed to always be an asset to my emlpoyer not a liability. I have only called off 2 times in 5 years.
good,Pay was pretty terrible for the amount of experience I had. Didn't feel like I was compensated for the five years I worked for the company. Newly hires would get paid nearly the same amount I was making w/ little knowledge of the Walgreens system
good,"Walgreens is more focused on meeting metrics than ensuring patient care and safety. If metrics are not met, you get in trouble even when the metrics suffer for the sake of safety for the patient."
good,ok company to work for if looking to stay put or starting out. ok company to become a pharmacy tech at. first time job seekers or students might do well at this company.
good,"Show up 15 before shift begins. I learned customer service skills, cash-register skills, time-management and working as a team member skills. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with customers."
good,"Responsible for managing all cashiers of the front-end, hiring and scheduling of employees, handling and resolving customer complaints, and keeping inventory at effective level."
good,I’m a very loyal employee and they can always depend on me to show up for my shifts.   I’m always early for work and never late.   I enjoy my customers but am not able to spend as much time giving them help do to cut backs and hours in the company.
good,"This was a good experience for me to work in a setting where customer service is valued, this allowed me to use this experience to bring the best customer service to a company I possibly can bring."
good,"Job was okay & fun but it was always an experience for me to see if I would like the job or not , but I honestly enjoyed it but it wasn’t the job I was looking for"
good,"In the contact centers, the company has shift bids regularly and after working for the company for many years I faced an issue in my home life where I wasn’t as flexible as I had previously been and the company refused to accommodate me by working fewer hours or an earlier shift so I was ultimately forced quit. No work/life balance at contact centers. Not family friendly."
good,"I have worked for Walgreens for many years now and have mostly enjoyed my job.  Lately, I feel more like a babysitter than a manager and I am just tired of it.  The most enjoyable pat of the job is getting to deal with the customers."
good,"I enjoyed the customers and the people I worked with.  Even though the management team was great, the company itself didn't pay very well.  I wouldn't recommend the company to people who need the money to live on."
good,"a typical day at work is usually sitting down logging in and praying to god u get to breathe befor the first call. i learned to assist with pa and reprocessing meds."
good,The customers there are not friendly what so ever and the company is very understaffed. The coworkers are friendly to others and focus on their tasks more anything.
good,All the employees are nice and mesh well together as well as the clientele the customer service was always very good as well as how they treated the employees
good,"Walgreens at the moment is understaffed. The attitude towards employees is that they are easily replacable, which leads to high turnover, which in turn leads to being understaffed. The remaining employees are overworked and underpaid, unable to use their vacation time when desired. Since I started there 3 years ago, benefits are stripped one by one, while new programs are introduced, creating more work."
good,This company has a lot of turnaround. It is hard to keep employees when the hours are bad and the management continues to change regularly. Easy job and easy money as long as you can deal with the public.
good,"The best part of the job was the consistency of the role.  As an employee, you understood what your job function was and your role in the company.  The variety of work responsibilities kept the job interesting."
good,"Retail management is all about creating a culture. The attitude that you bring to your job is going to directly effect the attitude of those around you. If you want a positive experience and a positive team, be a positive leader. If you want a team that is no-nonsense and gets their work done the moment the walk in, then be the leader that shows them that."
good,Not sure if company can remain competitive long term in a volatile and ever-changing retail industry in which they seem to be at least a half step behind.
good,It was a great entry level job. I enjoy the experience the company gave me.  I would recommend Walgreens to a person who doesn’t have a family or to someone who just starting out
good,"The best part of me working at Walgreens was helping the customers and interacting with them, especially customers who would come in on a regular basis and would appreciate my work and helping them with whatever questions they may have."
good,Pretty much like any other pharmacy. It depends on who you work with rather than the actual job. If you have good cooperative and helpful coworkers everything else is manageable.
good,"Poor management . I learned good interaction skills with customers and co-workers. A typical day at work is emptying out garbage's, stocking shelves, checking people out, etc. The management was pretty poor at organization and lazy."
good,A great starter job and I was able to move up to their pharmacy which allowed me to get some experience in the major that I was going to school for and it was a great growing experience.
good,I found that I was not well suited for the retail environment.  The number of daily tasks could not be completed within the time required.  Management did not receive corporate support sufficient to manage the store.
good,"Sometime stressful"
good,The job I was given was a difficult series of tasks that I took on gladly for it was my responsibility I took my job seriously and every task as a test of my abilities
good,"Need improvement "
good,"Overall, you could do better than Walgreens. When I was there as a photo specialist, besides doing photos, you were expected to cashier when they called in sick, stock the shelves, manage a section of the store, play janitor by taking out the trash, and stock the cooler. Some of the extra tasks I liked, others I dreaded. There was high turnover, especially with cashiering, which most people dreaded doing. The pay was not that great, but a little better as a photo person. You hit a certain ceiling, and the only way to make more $$ was to become some kind of manager. Working holidays was mandatory. I got stuck working on Christmas a couple of times, and the store was a ghost town at that time.  The employees were a mixed bag. There were some great co-workers, and there were a couple of bullies. One particular manager was so bad, that he got loss prevention called on him and got fired. I'd say it works as an ok second job, but not as a career. Little to no benefits for part-time, as usual. I fail to see how this glorified, oversized, overpriced convenience store can be so profitable and keep going for 100 years."
good,"Supervisors at every level appear to have been taught micromanagement, which results in them acting tired and stressed out (maybe they're also being micromanaged).  Some of the rules and procedures vary based on which supervisor you speak to, which can be confusing.  Finally, the employee turnover rate is somewhat high."
good,I enjoyed my time at Walgreens. I learned a lot working with my team and if I could go back I would go back and work for Walgreens it was a really great experience
good,"Excellent location, excellent drug product selection, excellent mission statement, excellent convenience, excellent concept, excellent ability to have a variety of methods for people to refill meds"
good,"A typical day at work was coming in, speaking with the supervisor on site, receiving your work assignment for the day. Maintaining the work area clean at all times. Return items back onto the shelves. Restocking if items were running low. Interacting with customers at the checkout area. Assisting customers with their buys and couponing."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens, good for people who love working at marketing sales retailers.  It is also good for people who like to give their passion for travelers."
good,"Years ago, Walgreens was considered a great company to work for due to its numerous positions and opportunities available, as well as competitive pay, excellent benefits, and various monetary incentives. Now, with the number of budget cuts and position eliminations due to the company's strategy of advancing by pulling money from its store-level workforce, Walgreens has become a difficult and stressful place to work. Stores are expected to complete more tasks than ever, but with fewer employees throughout their stores and ever-dwindling budgets. The pay and benefits are only moderate nowadays, and are completely outclassed by almost all similar competitors, such as CVS and Target. All in all, Walgreens is well-suited as a temporary place of employment for those who are pursuing a higher education, but full-time employees have little to gain unless they plan to make a career in corporate management, as even store-level management is a distant second option compared to similar positions in other retail companies."
good,"In over two years at Walgreens I've been given one chance at advancement to a higher position and was passed over for someone outside the company who almost immediately left on medical leave and was eventually fired."
good,"So, Walgreens.  It's a great place to start your career in retail at.  If you intend on just getting your feet in the door to have work experience, they'll give you that."
good,Very stressful and demanding with little resources to assist. Customer service is not priority nor is providing good health care insurance to employees that are affordable. bonuses being taken away as well as raises for leadership and pharmacists.
good,The big problem len are store manager and district manager if you are lucky to have one real leader no a boss you going to work better because everything around you is happy comprensible
good,"Walgreens pharmacy is VERY fast paced. If you are a floater pharmacist, be prepared to do lots of driving. unfortunately they only pay for milage if it is greater than 50 miles one way. Pay is ok and benefits are nice for a starting job."
good,I didn't mind this as my first job. Not a lot of room to move up and pay never increased. Was still earning minimum wage even after woking for 3 years and being the store champion.
good,"I started as a shift lead, but soon decided it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I have a bachelor's degree in dietetics, and learning about the pharmacy drugs is usually lacking from what you learn in school. I wanted to make my graduate resumé stronger, by obtaining pharmacology knowledge."
good,"Good place to start out"
good,Worth looking into...good people work here. I would not leave it were not for the hours that no longer work for my life. I work 3rd shift and it takes away any other free time because I sleep too much
good,It's a decent place to work. Good benefits through corporate plan. I enjoy the flexible schedules with this company and also the good work environment.
good,Profits over informing customers. Insurance nightmares. Constantly cut hours making already hard work even harder while increasing workload. Profits over everything else.
good,It's decent to work there. The people are friendly but the schedule is all over the place and the pay is okay. There's a reasonable chance to grow in the company.
good,"Several different job opportunity you can be trained as a cashier shift lead pharmacy technician you learn multiple skills, cash handling, customer service, POG"
good,The Healthcare industry is ever changing as the years pass on.  Insurance companies can decide to switch Pharmacies at a moments time without the benefit of the patients.  The success in the Pharmacies will depend on how much support management will assist when it is truly needed.  The End...
good,"Walgreens was a perfectly-acceptable retail job. Your enjoyment of the job likely will stem from what managers you work with at your store, though I generally didn't have any issues when I worked there."
good,There are moments when you love your job and other times where you are ready to quit. But i believe that is just working in retail pharmacy. Working in pharmacy showed me that I enjoy working in a medical field just not in pharmacy.
good,"While I may not recommend this as a job for someone that needs to pay bills, it would be a good job for a young person or elderly looking for something to fill their days."
good,It was a good working and learning experience but the company requires you to do way too much work without additional help. It did teach me how to work in a fast paced environment  but it is mentally and physically tiring without any job satisfaction
good,Really enjoyed working there. Good benefits.  Focused on good customer service. Great quality control. Provided excellent training and advancement opportunities.
good,"I took the job because I needed some kind of income coming into the house. The pay was not good, especially when you are dealing with money and risking your life not to killed for coins in the cash drawer... that was the one of the worst experience to have dealt with. A gun in the face with the laser.... wow... Till this day I am very conscious when I go in at the store at worked, it plays in my head... PTSD!!! Is no joke."
good,"there was a huge turnover rate, there were many many many call outs, and improper training mostly which were provided on the computer and it was encouraged to skip through for expediency."
good,"If the management does not like you it is does not matter how hard you work. You are getting stuck on a dead end job like Cashier and there is no going anywhere from this position. They all the time needed people, so they allowed certain people to do whatever it pleases them: to call at 6:00 am that they can not come to open the store (which opens at 7:00 am every day), to call at the last second off (sick, emergency...). But exactly the same people were highly liked and they could get away with anything. The health benefits were good. My assistant manager was the one who made me leave and the dead end position. After they cut my hours down to 15-20 weekly obviously it was time for me to go."
good,Good starter job but not for long term unless you want to be management. Not enough hours for more than 2 full time people in many of the stores unless they are busy stores.
good,"I would of stayed longer but I was cut hours and a situation occurred that could of put my life in danger, and I was also offered a better opportunity elsewhere that I could not turn down."
good,"In the two years I worked there, I moved up quickly from Beauty Consultant to Shift Manager. I was also considered for ASM-T. Really good benefits, free vaccinations that they do in store. However this place can be really chaotic and disorganized. I was moved to another store, and the store manager and ASM totally ruined my passion for Walgreens. I’d rate it 4 stars if they hadn’t turned everything sour for me. My advice: find the store and crew you like and do everything you can to stay there. Other managers will not listen to you or think you have purpose and will seek to destroy you."
good,"My location started off as a well functioning and enjoyable place to work. However, due to staffing cutbacks and poor management with increasing script numbers has become a stressful experience."
good,"The job is what you make it.  If youre willing to work, you will go far.  If youre just trying to slide through every day, you wont make it long. Do your job and youll be fine."
good,This could be a very comfortable career if the management team wouldn't be territorial about allowing you to move up into a better position.  A work day would be easy if everyone participated in the daily task. I learned a lot of new skills. Management could have managed a bit better. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers!
good,"Walgreens was a great company to learn and advance my knowledge. Many ways for growth, easy to move into management or pharmacy from entry level if you show interest. Benefits and paid time off which is a plus but in 13 years of employment I've seen the benefits become less and less. They want you available to work any time and schedule. Not conducive for young families."
good,"A typical day at work for a pharmacist involves, reviewing, filling and dispensing prescriptions, while performing daily patient care calls, and administering vaccinations."
good,learn all you can while you work there i learned how to work in the photo department and the beauty department awsome team to work for they are super good with days needed off
good,In the beginning it was okay. Then later into the future I would get less hours and it was not cutting it for me. The employee's there were kind and sweet.
good,"He aprendido mucho en el tiempo que llevo, aun asi es mucha presion a diario, no hay calidad de vida en familia. No tengo mas comentarios al respecto."
good,"You unload the stuff from the truck, unpack them and reprice  them and put them in shelves and the workplace is relaxed and I have learned numerous brands and how to stock them and there is no hardest part of the job and I enjoyed my work there."
good,It's good for college going students you don't have a fixed schedule and need to work on weekends holiday time its gets very busy so more work you can work in pharmacy or in retail or as cashiers
good,"While i was there the working environment was pleasant and appropriate. At some point my schedule was full of mistakes and i also needed less working hours due to class, but at the time it wasnt really an option. I dont think i would recommend this job for full time college students."
good,"It's a busy workplace with a challenging and demanding customer base"
good,"Smaller work environment, not as busy as a super market, very easy to handle. Adaptable to learn the new ways, and fun coworkers and challenges. Highly recommend."
good,"The overall atmosphere was relaxed for the job, the main tasks were detail oriented requiring us to stay focused on what we were doing to avoid mistakes."
good,constant work with many customer/patient demands. would recommend working if wage increased. most of the work revolves around dealing with insurance and knowledge with operation the Rx system.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working as a certified pharmacy technician but you are not paid enough for the work you do and the things you are expected to put up with.  I am usually very stressed out and do my best to get through as many tasks as possible in a day, yet it is still difficult for me to pay my bills because they simply don't pay their employees enough."
good,"Overall experience at Walgreens was decent. Towards the end of my time with the company, they seemed to care more about production than the overall concerns of employees"
good,I worked there for almost 4 years and my experience was ok until i had to dismiss myself from employment because of my pay and other bad experiences with a horrible co-worker that was a flat out bully.
good,Retail enviroment consistent with other chain environments.  Specializing in retail pharmacy and front end seasonal promotions.  Growing international company that offers growth opportunities.
good,Doing externship  here was very quick but yet i'd  finished. My hands on training here is not enough  . They teach me only few of it because were so busy. I'm just filling medication all day. They are trying to train me so i learned how to be patient and attentive on what they teach . I also understand how stressful are they in work. They are good and respectful to me...
good,"When I first started working here, I actually really liked it and I was always excited to go to work. However, as time went on, the love for the job just started to decrease. "
good,"My Walgreens was originally a Rite aid, so the transition was a bit overwhelming, however we got through it as a team. The job can be a bit stressfull sometimes, but its worth it when the customers and patients are satisfied."
good,"Overtime the company used to care about it's employees at a store level. Now it is all about satisfying the corporate budgets. Managers are overworked and very underpaid. Yet I am always productive at work, it can be a fun place to work when there are great workers."
good,"lots of work, not enough hours or help, was a good learning experience, wasn't always bad, some good coworkers others not so great. Teaches you the real workings of a busy pharmacy and what to expect"
good,"After a while working there, you start getting used to working there and everything that happens on a daily. Not a bad place to work but need to have good communication skills for customers, be able to listen and follow tasks by managers, and be positive for customers. But I do wish the pay was better and the hours. You do not get to work all the hours you want because the hours they have are limited and there are only so many days they can give you while giving other employees hours too. Overall I think that Walgreens can be a good place to work at for people that are just starting in retail because Walgreens is small, which is easier for them to learn."
good,"A typical workday in a pharmacy is all but typical. There will be days where insurances will approve every medication, then there will be days where PA,s are required for most prescriptions or medicare chargebacks. My duties were to properly bill insurance plans, dispense medications, prepare compounds, assist with PA,s and appeals. The hardest part of my job is not being able to give every patient the results they were hoping for. The best part of my job is patient interaction and being proactive towards potential problems."
good,"Buena compañia pero deseo incrementar mis conocimientos. Una compañia de mucho auge y mucha clientela,  busco crecimiento profecional y un horario fijo."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working with my coworkers and the regular customers. The job can be a bit overwhelming for new employees but there is always someone willing to lend a hand.
good,"The people were friendly, managers were never mean and as long as you do a good job they'll let you be. You get two paid lunches which pretty spill over to 30 minutes at a time so an hour of paid breaks is pretty dope.  If you're cool with a very stable job, don't mind essentially a union environment, and solid pay ($20+) an hour at three years I recommend this company."
good,"Walgreens was a great first job. I started as a cashier and they trained me in all areas of the company, including the pharmacy. After being in the pharmacy it was clear that this corporation is 100% corporate. The pay is not competitive, they have benefits but come at a high cost. You feel like you can't get caught up on work and are constantly understaffed."
good,"A typical day would involve operating the register,answering the phone a lot of paging and multi-tasking. Also a lot of cleaning, facing, and keeping the store looking good."
good,"Walgreens pays their employees well at 10/hr walking in and after 6 months or so they give you the opportunity to sign up for insurance. If an employee wishes to move up they can very easily.l, unfortunately the managers are weak and ineffective. They are condescending and half of the them just hide in the office.  My current store managers distrust the whole staff and talks down to his leadership team until you threaten to call corporate. He is known to retaliate if you make him angry or some cases report him. Company policy bars retaliation but it’s well known in the company that he does"
good,"not too bad, but it really depends on the store and the store manager. my store is busy and hectic at times, but it’s not too bad. it’s a good job to have until get your dream job."
good,"I started working the 2nd shift at walgreen's and then would move to overnight. The intensity of the work does change with the shift, 1st is a bit slower since people are just waking up for work getting busier towards lunch rush. 2nd is fast since you're dealing with lunch rush and the post work rush with a generally slower pace in-between. 3rd is generally slower since most people are in bed and you usually get emt's and hospital workers."
good,"Walgreens is typical corporate. Cutting hrs so getting more stressful as not enough help + as many or more rx's, and adding more required  tasks  throughout day, etc They are also cutting pharmacists pay more and more, as well as hours. Insurance premiums+deductibles also going up much higher, so less take home. Depending on store and district, mgmt can be good or not so great."
good,The company has more appreciation for its customers than they have for the employees. They push you to every limit and still ask for more. The great things aren’t noticed.
good,It definitely kept me busy and I liked that it was a fast pace environment. I met so many people but to be quite honest i think my store in particular was problematic.. there really wasn’t much communication and lots of favoritism/cliques within managers.  It’s a good job to work if you need something meanwhile but in my particular store there just wasn’t any growth.
good,"Good place to work to gain experience, they teach you many valuable skills that will help you be successful in the position. Opportunity is flexible here so the job is what you make it."
good,"It was a good place to start if your interning. I didnt like the fact it was only me as a cashier, and i had long wait times. I couldnt do my job properly due to being understaff still gave it my all. But its a good place to start."
good,Walgreens started out great but started taking benefits and promotions due to lack of funds which made the workers not interested anymore. The management and staff where great most customers where nice a real family feel.
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work. The unfortunate part is the work/life Balance is more work than life. the company is always changing to accommodate and become more modern which is a good thing for everyone, especially someone like myself who lkes technology."
good,didn't have any real equipment to do our jobs. we all had to try to make it work with what we had. management had favorites and they expected you to do a lot for one person.
good,As a manager at Walgreens it is a very stressful job. I don’t feel you are  compensated for the work you do. Over the years the company has completely changed and they have taken away all the extra perks they offered you.
good,Entry level positions at Walgreens are great for first jobs and for students. Pharmacy and management jobs are great starts for the making of a career.
good,"Pretty easy job, there is just the occasional difficult customer to deal with. This job is not for anyone who cannot multitask or solve problems quickly."
good,"Your experience will depend on the location you work at. My store can be really stressing to work at, and it is fast passed. If you perform well there are opportunities."
good,"Good it went well , they were very nice people it was just tut o fsr from where iij no lived. Over all the company was fun to work for. The pay was decrnt"
good,We are currently short-staffed and short on hours so we are running around crazy trying to get everything done that our store manager and upper management wants done
good,Managment thinks they just have to give orders and not do anything else. Sit in the office on their cell phones. Then get upset at the underdog when they need help.
good,Ok company to work for. Management can and will play favorites. Constant change in stire and policys...could be better. But not horrible as a starting job. A lot of work
good,They don't care about their employees. Make it impossible to relocate. Fire employees for no reason. I am relocating to be closer to family and willing to be with them only if necessary.
good,If you are in need of a source of money then this is the job for you. The team work is lacking and the training is subpar at best. They dont care about you as a worker but rather need somone to cover the hours. This is probably because my particular wallgrens opperates in a worse-off part of town.
good,I didn’t enjoy what I did. The job itself wasn’t the problem. I just wanted more I want to do something I can enjoy. I didn’t like where I was. I felt stuck I want to broaden my horizons and try something else.
good,It's all in the summary really. If you don't want to permanently stay in retail then this is just a temp job. It's good for kids getting a start or an in-between job.
good,Part time sure.  Full time.  I don’t know.  I never felt like it was worth it.  Maybe back when it was actually Walgreens and not booths alliance. Who knows.   Maybe it’s just me.
good,"Not interested in patients, but on sales figures and profits. Anithesis of what a nurse is trained to do.  Sales rep was micromanager but has since left.  Too much competition in the area to get much business."
good,"We filled 900 to 1000 prescriptions a day. Our pharmacy hours are 8am to 10 pm . The place goes crazy every 20 minutes. We make calls to patients, doctors, and insurance companies."
good,The job is simple but you a required to have a lot of energy but there is nothing really for you to do to gain that energy . The only reason I would not recommend this job is because the hours are inconsistent. One week you may have 25+ hours the next week you may only work for 6 hours
good,Walgreens provides many ways to advance your career with them. They are a culturally diverse company. They offer a competitive salary and love the engagement of all team members.
good,My co workers is the only thing that made me stay at this job. Management doesn’t really care as long as you do your job for corporate. But if you show initiative you can move up to senior technician pretty fast.
good,I enjoyed working there but then I was in a car accident and had to go in to disability. They had classes to help you get certified for you pharmacy license
good,"Its not bad if you can't find anything else. If you are driven and want to grow, I wouldn\t make this a long term job, because the company doesn't about the team"
good,"The stores were understaffed but will overwork their employees. Depending on the store the work environment may be either stressful or enjoyable. Management in certain stores are really helpful, while others are extremely rude."
good,"I have loved being a Pharmacist for Walgreens because it still has an overall very good reputation with the customers and that makes me proud.  I have had some very good supervisors and that helps me continue to expect the same of others.  Compensation drops have cost the company in the quality of employees, but overall there are more great co-workers than in most other retail locations."
good,Lacks proper staffing which makes it hard for your job to be done . Every store I worked at was completely under staffs which’s makes it hard to maintain a personal life because every thing is about business needs
good,"For my position, I mainly stayed at the register or worked on the sales floor stocking the shelves. The hardest part of the job is when they ask you to help in departments that you don't know anything about, such as the photo or cosmetics departments."
good,"It's ok for someone starting out but if you really want to do tech work then go to a store with no senior techs or somewhere else because you're just a Pharmacy cashier mostly. Maybe 1 hour of every 9 is actual technician work and you gotta fight to get that bc the senior techs get to do all of that stuff and they don't want you to learn it."
good,"Management is constantly changing. Pool tables in the break room (in need of TLC). Slogan is ""Happy and Healthy"" but they do not practice that with employees. Talking to HR is like talking to a brick wall, highly incompetent."
good,"Being hired as a Photo Specialist was great! However this was not my main job. I also had to stock shelves, check out customers at the main register, help in cosmetics, and more. I learned about retail business and that minimum pay is where its at. The people I worked with where there to make a living, as we all do. The environment was fun and alive as best as we could make it, but it was not for me. The hardest part of the job was that I did very little photography. The most enjoyable part was when I helped customers with their photography questions on how to improve their photos."
good,The company is always open to teach those who wish to move up within the company. I learned many things about inventory management and team building while being a manager.
good,"While working at walgreens you learn how to work with people, you also learn how to deal with money and keep track of your own tasks. It is a great starter job!"
good,"Decent experience overall, very helpful people, can get a bit stressful but it is definetly doable. would of liked to be hired at that place. very flexible when talking about scheduling."
good,Was a great place to work and was really excited to move up and make a career out of it. But after the merger and the new ceo came in the whole company really moved to the negative and they cont care about their employees anymore.
good,Great place to work. Company does believe to promote within. I enjoyed the 5 years I spent with the company and the support I had from the management team.
good,"They kept cutting our hours which made it difficult to keep your full-time status. We used to have a cosmetics representative and the position was removed, so now the floor person was overextended between taking care of floor responsibilities, photo department, and cosmetics department."
good,Cost-cutting initiatives are occurring which is changing the culture and some top talent has left. Great place to work if you're team is well rounded and supportive.
good,"The job itself is easy, but the management always scheduled you to work more than you were available and often in the incorrect time you picked. They were also not flexible with the time off."
good,It is an ok company to work for. I have met a lot of people over the years of working there. The hardest part of a work day is when it is really busy and you don't have a lot of help and when you are behind on filling the medication and you are being called to do other things or go help out with the long customer lines.
good,"It's a great place to work, unless you plan on moving past a shift supervisor. It takes a long time to move into an ASM or SM role with this company due to hardly any turnover. Which is great for them, but bad for you if unable to relocate for a promotion."
good,"policy chages were not related very well or on a timely manner.... changes to benefits were not communicated to p/t associates.  supervisors were not ever on the same page with associates... very frustrating. nice place to work if you that kind of enviroment."
good,Working there I learned a lot about businesses and they way they run and to see that management can really be awful that job is a place you leave eventually
good,"Typical distribution center. A regular day for maintenance included scheduling and/or receiving your daily/weekly/monthly preventative maintenance tasks, scheduling, and completing."
good,Not too much to say about this place.  its an ok work environment.  Not some place to retire from but a pleasant working environment & co-workers.  Not a good demographic though.
good,"Nice place to work, very customer friendly, fast pace, it can be a bit challenging at times, lots of changes with insurance companies and Doctors. Walgreen's is very strict when it comes to follow the HIPPA law."
good,"Going through a lot of changes where the motto basically is ""do more with less"". And no concern for work life balance. Hours have been cut drastically"
good,"You should be flexibe for time,willing to take on other training. They do need need more training with peope who have special needs who work for them."
good,"Walgreens is a job with great opportunities to move up in the company. It requires long hours with holiday pay, vacation days, and sick and personal days."
good,"If you're a slow learner this is not the job for you. Also has to be able to take constructed criticisms."
good,Typical day varied depending on the hours you worked. Learned patience and how to deal with elder and ill customers. Management varied depending on which department you worked. The hardest part of the job was meeting the demands of impatient customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles on the face of satisfied customers.
good,"Walgreens has a very clear and effective training program and system for maximizing efficiency within its company, but the store managers tended to not follow them perfectly, and were unnecessarily harsh with starting employees."
good,"A company is only as good as it's team. When it stops supporting the team and starts worrying about the bottom line too much, the team suffers. People don't get trained properly and this causes issues with displeased customers."
good,Productive workplace. staff is easy to get along with. Management is nice. Work hours are long but worth it. Well kept store in general. Easy to get along with others
good,"Walgreens is a good company. Managers are expected to also be pharmacy technicians as well as experts in the photo department, which requires updated technical knowledge."
good,There's a lot to learn and always work to be done. Co-workers are great and willing to learn and teach each other. Sales are impeccable. There are many opportunities for advancement if you are willing to put in the work.
good,"The job varied form very busy with non-stop work to quite slow with little to do. This mostly depended on the time of day, and how difficult the work load usually depended on how well the last shift did."
good,"Excellent company to work for.  Customer oriented.  Clean, well stocked.  Great benefits.  Professional pharmacists and Managers.  Excellent training for pharm techs."
good,"Been with the company along time. Started out in photo department. Took 2 years to get promoted to pharmacy which is what I wanted at the time. In hindsight I wish I would have stayed in the front of the store. Pharmacy does pay the most, but the stress is not worth the pay."
good,"The store is kinda slow so it gives you time to get projects done. I love the atmosphere and the people i work with. There is always something to do like stocking shelves, putting away the warehouse shipment, and performing resets."
good,"Good company to work for , hours seem to get cut a lot. Growing business. You can move up in the company. You can buy stock in the company. You get discounts! Work is  relatively  easy."
good,"They pay good money and provide good benefits, but expect a lot. In leadership, expect to work around the clock and expect your peers and others to stab you in the back. It was a lot of competition and they churn and burn through managers."
good,The job was very chill and at times could get boring especially when it was slow. Sometimes understaffed. Some coworkers were cool others were childish.
good,"Fun to work at, the work is easy, learned how to work with customers , the other employees and managers were very helpful in teaching me new things . B"
good,"Walgreens is a fast paced global company that has positions available in almost every aspect of healthcare and retail.  Combining the best of beauty, health and pharmacy, Walgreens cares for millions of customer each day."
good,"Just very up and down hours, schedules.. I have a great manager.. There are many benefits to working for the company, as well as it has it's cons to working there as well"
good,"I used to love Walgreens but I've seen the company change over the years. The work became more and the pay became less, so the job became less appetizing. The culture changed as well and that's what I liked the least of all the changes."
good,I would prefer not to make my opinion known/heard at this time. I will update with a proper review at a later date. The most enjoyable part of the job is working at home and no formal dress code due to that fact.
good,Great eviroment company beliefs have change a lot we evolve with the company its more than a job more like a family.Lots of learning opportunities on the day by day operation.
good,There was a lot of favoritism at the store I worked at. Bullying was also a problem I felt I was more qualified for my position but still didn't get the pay I deserved
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work, and treats their employees with the upmost respect. I strongly feel that they should pay more than minimum wage for all of the work that is done there."
good,I was sent to work here by my college I was attending. It was very face paced and stressful. The people I worked with were very rude. I was very happy to leave at the end of the month.
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with at my Walgreens location. The managers were laid back and my co-workers were really funny. However, the hours were inconsistent and never more than 25/30 a week."
good,"Overall Walgreens isn't a terrible place to work for a pharm tech. It pays decent, they work with your schedule, and the management is very nice and understanding. However, it's extremely high stress. It's a neverending stream of things to do that never get finished. We're told not to multitask for risk of messing something up, but then we're so understaffed and busy that we are forced to multitask if we want to get anything done. If you're someone who really works well under pressure and at a fast pace, then maybe it would be a more enjoyable job for you."
good,"The hours were tough, the pay WAS WAS NOT ENOUGH for all the work that needed to be done. TOP manager was unwilling to cooperate when I told her I needed a different shift because I found out I was pregnant.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
good,"great work environment, advancement options, competitive compensation, PTO and schedules vary, great team work experience. unable to stay due to school schedule."
good,Walgreens was only a externship filling prescriptions for three month prescriptions.  On some sessions because I was used as a full technician even thought I had not taken the test
good,"Nothing really exciting about walgreens, It is pretty laid back. You come in, do what you need to do and leave. It isn't very stressful, it is pretty simple."
good,"Managers can be great! Although when it comes to hours and scheduling, they tend to hold favoritism. I feel they do not educate us well enough to perform our jobs to their high standards."
good,"I really enjoy working at Walgreens as a Designated Hitter. Some days are very crazy and busy, others are very quiet and slow. You have to be able to think quick in some situations including the Pharmacy. Downfall right now is store hours are being cut which is putting full-time employees under 30 hours."
good,"Ability to grow. "
good,"Able to move up as senior tech if willing to learn in Texas. In "
good,Walgreens is an alright company to work for.  They offer challenging work environment while being able to learn how to manage different types of employees.
good,"New people everyday, same returning customers always made for a fun day.  I was in training for lead tech but after 3 months there was no word on the promotion"
good,"Day Shift:"
good,"Working  as customer  service  associate since 2015. In that time I got experience for cash handling ,photo, cosmetic, fedex, western union stock room department."
good,It’s just job but it can be better  we have great customer that comes into the store.overall the store  atmosphere can be better. The store needs to be updated and a new  air-conditioner needs to be put in.
good,"filled prescriptions, stocked shelves, made calls, worked the drive up window, took temps, put scripts in computer, helped customers, talked to customers, doctors offices, etc."
good,The walgreens I worked at had two very different vibes.  One way very slow paced and the other was very fast.  It depends on your personal preference.
good,"Walgreens is a fast paste, highly activate job. It can be stressful but rewarding. Managers can be tough to work with depending on the manager. Their are plenty of rewarding positions."
good,This was a good job.  I have nothing else to say about it. I think it is ridiculous that I am force to write a review on a company I haven't worked for in over 15 years.
good,"Walgreens was an OK place to work if you like the retail environment. There was a lot of interaction with a variety of customers that was mostly enjoyable. The work could be stressful due to a lack of budgeted hours/short staff which made it difficult to devote 100% to the various duties. Walgreens is open everyday of the year and working holidays is required. I did like everyone I worked with, it's simply not in my wheelhouse."
good,It is a productive and fun place to work. I have worked for the Walgreens company for twenty years. The company has changed over the years but its mission remained the same.
good,"It was a job. I worked there right out of high school, it was okay for what it was the pay wasnt amazing but it was enjoyable for the most part. A little boring for my taste"
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for in my opinion.   I started out in cosmetics and then I transferred to the photo lab where I was fully trained. "
good,"It was a fun and fast pace environment.  I enjoyed helping customers, training staff, and helping out in the pharmacy. The job was very active, but it was good."
good,"enjoyed working there, it was nice. i was very upset that i had to leave. the people were very kind and understanding of my disability, and they treated me fairly."
good,a typical day at walgreens. is good and what i learnded is very good and the managenent is o=i don't know much to say about them a nice clean and culturally diversed work place and the hardest part of the job is the job
good,"I learned to compromise with the customers in order to satisfy their needs. Everyday was a typical day, come in clock in, count your cash coming on and at the end of the shift. I was on time for clocking in, for lunch and clocking out. The culture was of different ethnics, and a busy environment. The hardest part of the job was to get someone to give me my lunch break on time, yet the most enjoyable part was when I could make someone's day a better day with a good conversation, inspiration, or just a nice smile, as I meet and greet each customer. And watching them leave happy/satisfied, made me feel like I had achieved my goal for that day!"
good,"Overall the company is cutting too much financially as an austerity plan making for a difficult work environment. Health care is changing  nationwide  and the company is attempting to adapt.  However, the work force makes the company and the plan is affecting morale."
good,decent to work for day to day was mainly helping customers and putting away stock. Not much room for advancement unless you want to go to pharmacy day in day out sort of job
good,"This was my first real job outside of babysitting. It was a good place to learn about basic retail duties and responsibilities, but overall was not a great fit for me."
good,Walgreens was a good start for me. It was what put my foot in the door for pharmacy. I appreciate all the opportunities afforded to me because of my employment there but I had outgrown Walgreens. There wasn’t much room for advancement as far as promotions were concerned in pharmacy.
good,I have met multiple store managers and have worked with them for quite some time and they all do a very good job on solving problems within the store but talking about issues with corporate there is not much they can do because corporate do not care what employees think even they say they do.
good,"I have been working for Walgreens since I was 16, it has been my only job I have had . I love the  The opportunities and skills it has provided for me. I am also ready to put my  knowledge that I have received from working with Walgreens company to a different company and spreading my abilities to do better ."
good,"I would love to stay at the job, but unfortunately I’m being forced to move earlier than planned. It is a slow paced job, leaving you time to get your stuff done and put of there easily on time."
good,"It was alright. I feel as if the company should do more for the workers. It is so easy to get fired based off of the simplest things and not even by managers, by the company itself."
good,"In the early days, it is always a lot of fun coming to work even though it is busy. However, in recent years, the company has focused more on payroll, budget, then on patient care. Also the employees are receiving less support and recognition from the upper management. There are more reports to complete daily, at the same time labor hours have decreased."
good,"In order to keep within budget, hours are cut and more tasks are expected with less help from pharmacy technicians and there are expectations to try to bring in more prescription volume by encouraging patients to fill all refills regularly and consider 90 day refills to help increase prescription volume...  "
good,n/a i do not want to write a review yet this site is forcing me to. Got me through school wouldnt do it long term. Little consideration for family/work balance.
good,Good Team and nice people to work with. A typical day is very busy with users needing repairs to their PC and asking questions. The workplace culture is very nice. What I enjoy most is the trouble shooting in my current position.
good,"I love working part-time at walgreens. Besides stocking and checking out customers, I love the friendly smiles and helping the customers in finding products and offering my services."
good,It was tough because they don't train you long and then when you make mistakes get upset because you didn't do something right. They don't understand and respect people with children or health issues.
good,"I worked full time for Walgreens, but I didn’t work a set schedule. I was basically the person to fill in the gaps in the schedule between the full time morning crew taking days off, or the college kids taking classes. Rarely ever got 2 days off in a row. They expect you to know everything about the store as soon as your done your trainings. If someone didn’t train you, you would be SOL. Only one 30 minute break in 8 hour shift. Budget cuts only have you, the cashier, and the shift lead on the floor. Also the managers constantly push you to ask for surveys, and will write you up for whatever they think you did wrong. Also they raised the minimum wage from $9.00 to $10.00 company wide. I worked for Walgreens for two years at that point and now I make the same amount as someone just starting out."
good,"It showed me how challenging the pharmaceutical world can be."
good,"Every year, Walgreens cuts back on benefits and incentives for employees to succeed. Pay is barely competitive and is very stagnant. Benefits were good, but cuts are becoming commonplace."
good,"The company has changed DRASTICALLY over the past 15 years. We were once team driven and family oriented.  Now, it is all about how can we take more money from our customer?  Let's offer so much more services but let's not provide the team members with more support."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for, but my manager in particular was terrible. If there was a mistake that I made or something I should’ve made improvement on, I was never made aware of it, and my hours were cut without explanation. That particular location has had a high turnover rate for that reason alone since about 2013."
good,Good potential for promotion if you are willing to sacrifice work/life balance. The problem is the expectations and workload are very unpredictable based on the DM in your area.
good,"On any given day I interact and assist various customers whether in Photo, Pharmacy, on the front register or on the sales floor.  I enjoy helping the customers and pride myself on a very strong work ethic."
good,"I’ve worked here almost 4 years , been promoted twice so opportunity to grow in the company is there . They have flexible work hours but usually hire according to company needs . Staff is very friendly but the work place can be very stressful at times . The hire and fire rate is high ( meaning only a very few ppl are there for a long time ) . Management can contribute to stress in workplace . Watch out for favoritism . But overall it’s a good job if not looking for long term ."
good,"Distinct gap between people who were hired from college and had long tenures  versus new professional hires."
good,"Great team of people.  Opportunity to work remotely from home.  Virtual meetings with occasional trips to headquarters.  Ideas/concerns mattered.  The larger organization is endlessly changing, leaving an employee with a constant uncertainty about the future of his/her job.  Unfortunately, many excellent people were eliminated or left as a result."
good,"The company seemed a good one to work for, but the location was not at all fun.  There seemed to be a lot of favoritism. If you were not friends with the shift managers, you had to expect to have the worst tasks and the hardest work."
good,This is a good starter job for those working for the first time. You can advance here but it takes a while & alot of reminding management of your interest in moving up in the company.
good,I only interned there but it was an amazing experiance. Everyone was helpful and treated me nicely. It was a very fast work pace and you are constantly moving. the management was very helpful and work with emploies to improve the store.
good,The short little time I was given the opportunity to work at Walgreens as an Intern it helped me learn a lot about the real world and getting myself ready for life. I was happy to have gotten this opportunity and would assist anyone else to put there selves in this program.
good,"Company has decent pay and benefits for pharmacists but not really for technicians. The company mission is constantly reiterated and that limits your direction in the pharmacy. As such, technicians are difficult to fill, and they constantly make cutbacks increasing workload but not pay."
good,"Walgreens was continually cutting the available technician hours each week - which meant full time employees rarely got close to 40 hours weekly. Not only that, but we were continually short technicians which caused constant strain on the employees I worked with. During my one year of employment at Walgreens, we lost all of our Senior Technicians - some who had been there 5+ years - for other opportunities."
good,This job was slow paced and didn't take much to do. The store was big but not many people visited. It was really making sure the store looked good and assisting the customers that did come in.
good,Good workplace with flexible shifts and schedules. Management is supportive. Sometimes there is room for advancement. But limited opportunities. Decent morale.
good,Many of the customers were nice but also some were very frugal and very demanding.Coupons are a big deal at Walgreens. I would still recommend working there.
good,A typical day at Walgreens is very crazy and very stressful. I have learned a lot from the company but I feel like I could have learned more. Management at Walgreens is fair. You have managers that knows what they are doing and then there are some that doesn't need to be in the management position. Work culture is very crazy and not everyone is very helpful. The hardest part of working at Walgreens is communication. The most enjoyable part of working at Walgreens is the new people you get to meet.
good,"Typical work day consists of overseeing the daily operations of the store and pharmacy. As a store manager we are responsible for making sure the team of customer service associates and leadership work together to ensure the comfort and needs of our customers are met. This consist of greeting them, assisting them, and managing the inventory to keep our shelves full for what they need. The pharmacy focuses on patient care and provides our patients with not only their prescriptions, but also consultations, immunizations, and other services for the convenience of our customer. As a Store Manager we are required to hold a pharmacy technician certification and have knowledge of not only store operations but pharmacy operations for we are responsible for the entire store and serve as the direct supervisor for all store and pharmacy personnel."
good,"I enjoy working there with my employees and helping customers with items there looking for and exchange items , working for Walgreens was excellent I enjoyed working there"
good,"• Met and/or exceed pharmacy needs of customers within a high-volume and fast-paced retail pharmacy and utilize an attentive work style to compound and fill prescriptions and dispense medications. Additional responsibilities encompassed: effectively answering and problem- solving inquiries from individuals via the telephone and in-person while implementing viable solutions; providing patient counseling; and maintaining high-level quality control of all pharmaceutical supplies."
good,"Pharmacy is a tough place to work.  Most of the time 1 tech is up front, waiting on counter, and doing drive-thru, as well as other tasks that are assigned.  Working in a very busy pharmacy it pretty much is non-stop patients from 8 am to about 8 pm.  line of people (4-5) waiting at counter, line in drive thru.  Patients are upset because they have to wait."
good,"Depending on your store's location, your working environment may vary. I have been to several different stores and the one thing that they have in common is the fact that there aren't enough hours given to the techs, so we are frequently understaffed. Raises are based on an annual review and 99.9% of the time, I have seen store managers dissuade pharmacists from giving techs the necessary scores to give them a raise. My pay has been capped for over a year."
good,The company as a whole is a okay company to work for but when the company is constantly restructuring its management programs it limita options for individuals who don't have business degrees. I have a BS degree in Emergency Management with a minor in Logistics.
good,Good job to apply if looking for something that doesn't require much. I was asked to take a drug and background screening in 2015. Lots of questions on questionnaire once I got the job it was easy to maintain but the questionnaires are required at least once a month for re certification and updates in policy.
good,Too busy in the Charlotte location. Adjusting to the work flow was the easiest thing to do. The management was great and understanding employees still in school.
good,"I liked that I had flexible work hours and if I needed off they tried to give me off"
good,"Responsible for essential store operational requirements such as management, customer/client service and satisfaction promotion, financial reporting, merchandising, loss prevention, vendor and account relations, sales and inventory management, profit and loss, marketing, operations, hiring, training, and mentoring of new employees."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is a busy day full of duties and responsibilities especially related to Customer Service. "
good,"Came in every afternoon and develop the film for customers.  I learned how the film was processed. It was difficult to balance work and school. I got to meet new customers everyday,"
good,"You basically train yourself bc it's too fast paced for someone to train in the pharmacy and I don't advise asking questions bc you WILL be a burden to them and you most likely will be treated very rudely to the point of making u feel very uncomfortable and the same goes for any time you make a mistake!! New employee or not, they dont care. The store manager was fair to everyone but the pharmacy manager was nice to you face to face but will gossip about you otherwise. Walgreens also has a large percentage of the rudest customers world wide which makes it even harder to get through a days work. You MUST be able to extreme multi-task and you also must have tough skin or else you WILL NOT make it as an employee for long and be prepared for working the hours and days that nobody else wants to work the first few months of being there."
good,I worked all different shifts and hours even after working over a year the schedule hours were different each week. Once you start working the hours begin to get low at 23 hours from 38 hours for a year.
good,Working here can be stressful. It is very fast pace and there are a lot of things to do before your shift is over. resets are extremely difficult sometimes.
good,The walgreens i worked at was directly next to a college campus. This allowed for a fun work environment. The management was nice and understandable of my academic schedule.
good,A company that is diverse and constantly changing to position themselves at the forefront of the pharmacy field. Many opportunities to develope yourself
good,"As a photo tech, we have to do multiple jobs at a time. We are photo techs, Western Union agents, and FedEx Package Holders. The last one isn't too bad. The Western Union thing has been so stressful since it was installed and added to our duties. Especially when people get hostile, or violent. But wages didn't go up despite doing the extra work."
good,"It really depends on your manager and the store. I worked at one store for a while and loved it. The moment I transferred, it was a total change. The manager can make or break you loving your job at Walgreens. My second store completely ruined me with horrible management and corporate did nothing about it. I watched so many people suffer at the second store I went to. I wish I would had never transferred. Walgreens can be amazing or it can be your worst nightmare. My advice is get a feel for the store manager before accepting a job!"
good,It's always the people that make the difference. The biggest problem though is Walgreens start people off at $10 an hour. The only people who apply to such positions are high school and college kids. If they can move past that they will gain more talent.
good,"The company as a whole does not show much interest in employees as people and will often ask for opinions, just to ignore all of the ones they dont want to hear. That being said, individual management of each location is usually a pretty decent, fair, understanding bunch."
good,Hardest part about this job was working with the people. Enjoyed helping the customers and learning the different measurements with liquid firm of medication.
good,I really don't have anything good  to say about Walgreens. I was a loyal employee for 17 years 8 months and when face with a difficult situation they did not support me.
good,The management expects you to accomplish a lot of tasks in little to no time. You are expected to reach sale goals for your department as well and have to try your best to reach them.
good,"You would get box after box of returned merchandise to scan re-box into other boxes and track location of all the different merchandise. It would then be palleted, wrapped and shipped to another distribution center."
good,"A typical day is mostly customer service , cashiering, putting stock away reorganizing departments and shelves. The employees are friendly and fun to work with. Meeting different customers everyday and helping them with there needs."
good,"Working at any retail pharmacy has its ups and downs. At the end of the day you have to help the customer and follow through with company policy. Over the course of a typical 8 hour day, you can have customers dropping off, picking up, and asking questions. Simultaneoulsy, you are reviewing/filling prescriptions, answering phone calls, making phone calls, counseling and administering immunizations. "
good,It is a great place to work at managed are usually all pretty great and especially if your a student most work with your hours. It’s discounts works great with coupons and sales
good,The job depends on the management of the day and if you don't want to go to pharmacy you won't make as much money or be treated fairly given that the customer service associates are not as important as pharmacy techs
good,"I have enjoyed working here but the turn over rate at my store is getting out of hand."
good,"Walgreens was a Great company to work for.  I learned alot while working for the company.  My job was a job you had to multitask so it could sometimes be stressfull, but I enjoyed working with people."
good,I haven't worked there for long so I cant say much about it. everyone looks friendly haven't really interacted with anyone so im very unfamiliar with who all works there. I think there are four managers in total and oi got to meet the District Manager who is very friendly.
good,I like how the store employees helped keep the store clean and free of spills and boxes in the aisles. The on site  pharmacy was helpful for elderly..
good,My boss was awesome!  The benefits were actually pretty good when I worked here.  If you are not a Pharmacist then I don't believe you get paid very well here.
good,"It was one of the best experience I had in my working life. "
good,"A typical day, Upon clocking in i was responsible to count in the safe, lead the staff in their daily tasks and responsibilities.Complete my own assigned tasks, respond to change requests and pick ups. Counting down the drawers and closing out the day and closing the store. I learned all that i could during my time with the company. Hardest part of the job was not reacting or responding to the theft. And the most enjoyable was the employees and customers i got to see daily"
good,"fast paced, i learned how to face floors, how to stock, management could have been more professional. most enjoyable part would be meeting the new people everyday."
good,"Generally a good place to work, although the pay and work life balance are lower than people would normally like.  Stores should also not be open Christmas Day."
good,"working on reports printed in the office with re-calls and new pricing and expired items, ordering and receiving in new items helping out in other departments"
good,Needs to pay employees better. They did have good health insurance and short term leave. They need to think of safety of employees working under others.
good,"Walgreens has what it takes to be a good company but it seems to want to change its identity every year.  For management, it is crucial to have all team members involved in day to day activity as budget constraints are very challenging."
good,Walgreens is definitely a good company to work for but at the same time you have to be able to stand on your feet for a long periods of time and I strongly believe that they need to get a better security system because a lot of Walgreens get robbed a lie and that’s one thing they really need to work on especially this late night shift
good,My shift starts as the other one leaves.I perform various transactions.I also make sure the shelves are neat and tidy.The hardest part was standing all day.the grouchy customers was the most difficult part.
good,"As a pharmacy technician it is my first job at Walgreens. Whatever I learned I learned from this pharmacy therefore, I'm always very thankful for that. However, I could learn more and more or I could become an expert if there was anyone who could train hand on experiences."
good,"I really liked my manager and the customers.  However, I felt that there were not enough hours allocated to complete required training videos.  The regional manager in charge of our store was extremely unhelpful, a bully and unprofessional."
good,"Walgreen's is a typical large chain retail pharmacy, governed by a myriad of rules and regulations.  Many that make sense and many that do not make sense."
good,"On job training. E learnings available for anything you would like to learn or need to learn, Likes to promote from within. A good job if you are looking to move up to a management position."
good,"The job was mostly boring and the overall feel of the store can be very draining at times (lots of fluorescent lighting and baby blues, kind of soul-sucking). Some of the other employees were nice but the management was very all over the place. Often times they'd give contradictory instructions and there was never a solid chain of command."
good,"The lack of a full staff makes day to day tasks increasingly difficult to accomplish.  While management does help lighten the load there is still so much to do and yet not enough people to do it.  The work schedule is also very erratic, going from opening the store one day to closing the store the next, and visa versa"
good,"Customer service is important.  Answering the phone and assisting the customer.  Typing prescriptions, counting pills, and doing inventory. Placing orders for needed medicine."
good,Work from home was a nice experience but I don't intend to work from home again. I would recommend this employer should someone ask. Work was steady and help was abundant.
good,Fun workplace. Friendly Atmosphere. Employees all are very friendly. School season very busy. Managers all are nice. Very good environment. Walgreens never  close on holidays. It’s one way helpful for medicine.
good,"Overall the work was fine.  It was retail, so it could be stressful at times. Most of the managers were easy to work with as long as s you did your work."
good,"All in all, my experience with Walgreens when I first started working was overall positive. However, changes in management and corporate decisions made working there less tolerable."
good,"great place to start, teaches you how to work efficiently and quickly. teaches you customer service. teaches you how to properly bill insurance. highly recommenrd for people fresh out of highschool"
good,"Retail is retail. Days off vary week by week. Hard to make plans outside of work. If you need to call off, the work just piles up. It will be there when you return. Do what you can in one day. Tomorrow is another day."
good,"Always busy, improve observation skills to watch customer activity. Management could improve communication skills.  Very little dependability from fellow employees.  I did enjoy working with my patrons."
good,Good and bad days works with my schedule. You have to be on your feet. New system always modern. Technology. Face paced never a dull moment. My team is well put together.
good,"Working at Walgreens you get to interact with each client."
good,Great place.but new leadership not great. Working remotely is a bonus and saves on expenses. Life/ work balance is average; Leadership encourages PTO be taken.
good,"Once you clock in you have your tasks sheet. You do whats needed to be done on that sheet then you go around your area and start to face all the products, you take notes on whats low. Then you go to the stock room and see if you have anymore products so you can fill the shelf. Once you see a customer you show gratuity and show them what products are on sales and what kind of deals that they can most benefit from."
good,"Good job for those in college looking to have some play money,  but not a job you want to retire with. After 25 years, you lose your benefits.  If stores had enough hours and more competent and motivated people to run the store and assist and carry the load of tasks, it would be much more pleasant company to stay with."
good,"Poor management, always playing favorites with employees, and the breaks are too short for the long hours that you are required to work. Very minimal discount for being an employee"
good,"I was usually helping in the photo lab, restocking shelves, or at the front cashier. I learned how to recommend products based on the customer's needs as well as how to interact with the consumer public. Management was ok; either they were too strict or too laid back. It was pretty boring but for $9 an hour, I didn't mind. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the schedule changes because management would prioritize other people. Most enjoyable part of the job was my pay check."
good,working at Walgreens was a privilege. I have learned many things while working there as an intern. The team that I was working with was the best team.
good,"Palatine, IL is a huge city with 3 zip codes back in 2005, currently it has 7 different zip codes, this particular 24 hour pharmacy was a very busy location"
good,Upper management seems to think bullying and disciplinary techniques will help establish their position and inspire respect instead of actually acknowledging the hard work that goes into their pharmacy's
good,"Great opportunity to learn. The scope of learning is truly vast. If you are looking to gain domain knowledge, this is a great start for you. Flexible work hours and variety of resources and tools are available to learn"
good,"It was just a place to work, they really don’t care about you personally , they want that dollar, they don’t even close for Christmas, Easter or any other holidays"
good,I'm sure other locations aren't as bad but I had to deal with a lot of hood rich stuff at the location I worked at. Work load wasn't too bad and I worked with friendly people.
good,"My time as an intern was very good, I learned how retail pharmacy work, learned how to look up patient profiles, very nice and pleasant place to work."
good,"When I started at Walgreens I was part of a team. We had manager led daily meetings, Everyone knew what their job was and there was enough people to get everything done.  I enjoyed going to work. "
good,"Pretty average retail job. Steady hours, easy work days, and a calm environment. Management was good and did not discriminate for military service. A good first job for teenagers."
good,"Not enough hours in the budget to cover store needs, they expect too much of thier employees and do not pay enough to live on. The managers are expected to not take lunches or breaks. The holidays have been terrible. The schedule is all over the place and the hours make for a poor work/life balance. I am applying at other places. Struggling through at Walgreens for now."
good,Answer phones for doctors offices and patients.  Assist customers with refills and new prescriptions.  Help get rejected claims through by calling insurance companies.
good,Demanding without the the time to complete a long list tasks. No very hard to do if that is your only focus but anytime you are in the business of caring for customers with care takes time but is never taken into consideration
good,The pharmacy was extremely busy and we were normally understaffed. We had to make do with very little which greatly increased customer wait time. Customers were usually upset with us
good,Walgreens is a okay place.  they pay well but you are expected to give more than you receive.  You are given a skelton crew budget for payroll and expected to have top notch customer survey results.
good,The work place was ok to say the least it’s all about the area where your store is at. People are rude most times but customer service is always dealing with that so for most part the job is what it is
good,"Could be better, this is a stupid survey that shouldn’t be required to talk about my job because who cares? Walgreens is an alright company with half decent pay"
good,"I worked on the overnights , so if I had an issue, it was hard to get to talk to the Manager or Assistant Manager. Sometimes it we would be a while before problems were addressed."
good,"A typical day would vary depending on the station you were working that day . They had a beauty consultant position, Cashier, Photo lab, restockers, Pharmacy, and Floor personnel."
good,Walgreens is an ok company to work for. My co workers were good to work with.  Afvancing in the company is not a plus.  Too many employee turnovers because of non advancements or unhappy employees.
good,"Walgreens is not a technology company. And it is made clear by upper level management. CEO seems to have a focus on healthcare, pharmacy & retail. Which healthcare is a safe bet with the folks at Dow currently. IT is seen as assisting rather than a primary focal point. There are a lot of consultants that do the digital engineering, like a lot a lot."
good,"Typical day at work involved supporting all departments, while leading the team to efficiently run the store.  I was able to get a lot of experience working with a team and keeping them motivated.  Also I spent most of my time fine tuning my experience with customer service.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of control from the corporate office.  This did not allow me to execute ideas that I could have implemented to improved sales.  The best part of the job was the amount of retail business knowledge I had received to further my effectiveness in the future."
good,It was always busy when I came to work at the Pharmacy.  I had a great Pharmacy Manager with a lot of Pharmacy experience.  He made coming to work fun.
good,Its a great career if the company still cared about family values. With cutting hours its truly hard to keep up with the companies expectations. Alot of the stores are under staffed.
good,"Of all the big chain pharmacies, this one has the best software. I have to give this company credit for requesting suggestions from pharmacists for making the software user friendly."
good,"Nice manager and supervisor. 1 supervisor I had a negative run in with, however once a meeting was had and issues discussed, it was fine. Schedule I worked was flexible and team was helpful."
good,"i worked for the company for almost 2 years. I once upon a time wanted to be a pharmacist, but after learning that this company doesn't appreciated graduates. I have decided to take my degree in use it doing clinical research."
good,It was a nice quiet friendly atmosphere.With a lot of different opportunities to rise up in the company.nice friendly workers and managers are respectful
good,Many  changes which amount to company becoming less employee friendly. The founding father's of Walgreens have always valued their employees. but that has changes.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work in. I have only worked for 3 months but I have learned alot. It keeps you busy and is a good learning place. The drive-thru and front can be handled by one person depending on the area
good,Its not the same when I started 20 years ago. No work life balance from assistant store manager position and up. Keep giving us more task but taking our hours away. With the starting pay at $10 a hour they want us to find amazing employees and make them do so much work but they can go down the street and find a higher paying job and less task. But Walgreen's do offer discounts from other company's which is amazing.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for, as opposed to most other pharmacies that are out there. There is definitely room for advancement if you work hard, but they also allow you to move around in the store to be able to do different positions from within. Management is iffy depending on who you have at the time. Unfortunately, as soon as you get a good SM, they end up getting transferred to another location and you get a terrible SM sometimes in their place. I have had some really amaing SMs, and then extremely terrible, lazy ones."
good,"I worked for Walgreen's for almost 3 years.I learned so much about customer service working here. This is a great company to work for if you want to move up into store management,"
good,Walgreens train you to do your job but management can be confusing with a lot of miscommunication. There will be some form of favoritism that will frustrate you.
good,"very lovely people, nice work environment, occassional problems but overall good. I would recommend this job for people looking for something fun and closeknit"
good,Overall I loved working at Walgreens. Good teamwork. Friendly customers in the community. I especially gain more knowledge at the pharmacy. The pharmacist was really nice to teach me more than i expect when I first started. I loved working at Walgreens
good,Walgreens used to really value their employees. Things have changed. They have slashed budgets so much that stores and pharmacies are forced to operate severely understaffed.
good,"Cashier, stocking, photo development. I learned basic store procedures including store closing, receiving shipments, and zoning products for the next business day."
good,The ours conflicted with family. Worked all holiday and nights. Hard worker and never was agnolidge for the good work and on time. Did the work of 2others employees.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job would have to be the customers. When I see customers leave with a smile on their face, It really brightens up my day. It makes me feel like I’ve accomplished something so important, and that’s making sure customers are happy and satisfied."
good,"Its a great place to work but you give more than you get. There are tons of benefits. Walgreens can either make or break you. If you ever have a complain, don't keep your hopes up because nothing is going to be done about it. Once you're in a management position there's no work life balance."
good,"low pay not much availability if you need to change shift plenty of work, numbers were important over quality, felt like a robot at times  Hope for more variety in daily work"
good,"Had a lot of fun at work."
good,"The store was calm, not many disruptions. The managers were laid back and the employees were able to get discounts. The tasks were simple, but it would get boring."
good,Fill about 200 to 300 prescriptions per day. The most difficult thing about being a pharmacy tech is dealing with the insurance and most enjoyable is being able to work with patients.
good,When Rite Aid was purchased employees were told that we would be placed in stores with our same positions as close to home as possible. We were placed in a work pool until we got a permanent placement. If they couldn't place us then we would get a severance pay. I'm not happy with Walgreens. Besides not being happy with Walgreens I have come into some physical changes in my life and can not stand that that many hours anymore. So I'm looking for a work at home situation where I can still get a paycheck but take care of my health.
good,It can be a good place to work at all depending on the location and the people you have in your team. Most days were great and others you wish you would have called off.
good,A typical day at work was to stock items as well as work cash register. I learn how to stock and zone item. Management was pretty good and help a lot in the store. The hardest part of the job was lift some heavy items. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was getting to know customers as well as building a relationship with other employees.
good,"We focus on selling cosmetics, prescriptions, customers donation, flu shots and customer service. Store is well kept, stocked with product to ensure customer experience."
good,fun environment. meet many different people which i very much enjoy. of course there's always that one customer that tries to push your buttons but you just give them a smile and a big thank you
good,They  make  goals  that are  impossible to meet  and no one is happy  working there.  They  give raises  that are  insulting if you even  get a raise.
good,"Great place to wok, the staff is great, the store is very clean. I enjoyed my time working here and the pay was comparable to other places I have worked."
good,"The job was very stressful and not worth the money I was paid for it. But, they did pay for my state license and I had a 15% discount. But overall, it sucked."
good,"good place to interact with customers and a great place for problem solving persons like me, if you have a good mangers you will be fine otherwise search for different place"
good,"typical work day was stocking shelves, ringing up guests , often helping in developing photos , multitasking often working the front cash register and sometimes helping in the makeup dept"
good,Its a good job to start with if you need one. It will help move you up in the company if you wish to stay but like any other job its got its difficult days.
good,"a great place to work. they easily accommodate with my schedule. working specially during the day, I enjoyed the store location and design. great team work"
good,My first job was at walgreens. I started working on the cashier and after doing that well for a few months I was starting to do more work on the floor. This was nice to get a little promotion off the register and I did enjoy the floor work. The management was good and I have no complaints.
good,I never planned to stay i8n the retail field long. But I am glad to have experience working in Walgreens. Met a lot of people learned a lot about customer service in another more face to face.
good,Overall the company itself was a good job. Management in general is less than perfect. I loved my customers. After you have worked there for a long time your pay is capped & there is little room for advancement.
good,Hours vary from day to day and I work in different areas around the store .  If I wor at 8 and get there around 15 minutes early and then start my shift.  If I work a later shift the same I get there 15 minutes early.  The management is okay.  Good place to work for
good,"Unhappy, no benefit for loyal long-term employees. I enjoy my location and most of my fellow employees, but the company has lost touch with their employees."
good,Opportunity for advancement and flexibility in work hours.  Work environment depends on the store. Medical benefits are not that great but the profit sharing program is ok.
good,it depends on the stores and management and how they run the location. I've came from one of the busiest stores in Houston and they knew how to run the store overall; But they never trained employees and that makes it very hard and adds more wok for people in management. this has definitely been an issue at all the locations I've worked for. Training for new employees is very poor.
good,Walgreens does not give us enough hours to be able to give great customer service. I’m not able to get my 40 hrs to be able to provide for my family. I’m not able to have a flexible schedule to be able to pick my daughter up from daycare on time and take her to her curricular activities. Walgreens is taking a week of my personal time off away which is something I’ve already earned which isn’t right.
good,"Benefits are better at CVS than at Walgreens, especially regarding salary, profit-sharing, etc.  Walgreens stores had more micro-managing from Corporate than what CVS has."
good,I enjoyed my position in cosmetics my main goal was sales and customer service; it was a small store and on average I still at least 85% met my sales goal every day of $2000.
good,"The thing I liked most about working at Walgreens is you could get your foot into the door of medicine without any preliminary training because they train on the job and pay for pharmacy technician certification. However, the pay is not fantastic and most often the pharmacy is short staffed, so it is pretty fast-paced work. If someone is planning on being a pharmacy technician for the rest of their life I would suggest hospital pharmacies because of the pay increase and you don't have to deal with the customer service aspect."
good,I've been with the company for 3 years and it seems that they don't value loyal employees when all the new hires come in making more money than you and you're training all of them.
good,"Walgreens was my first job and they were able to offer me good pay with decently flexible scheduling. I wish I would have had more freedom with the number of hours I could have worked, as Walgreens prefers an 8-hour shift, and I would have been able to work more if I could have done 4-hour shifts. I also wish there would have been more done to make work more comfortable (ie better break room, seats at registers or at least pads to stand on)."
good,As far as retailers go it's not bad. Pay isn't great but benefits are pretty good for full time employees. The company focus on 'new management style' is nothing but a time consuming gambit to try to put extra responsibility on part time employees in reference to company performance.
good,"The management was hit or miss, with the leadership making questionable decisions.  The typical day was mind numbing with no social interactions, even with customers, as you stand behind the counter all day and hope for good reviews."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens except for the fact that it was difficult to work oneself into a full time position, and for the pay grade offered part time hours just didn't offer enough money."
good,"Walgreens. has been good to me and I in turn am a loyal team member. "
good,"The culture at Walgreens depends on the store you are assigned. If in a very busy store, it can quickly become ""robotic"" compared to one that is more laid back. Definitely be ready for redundant work but patient interaction is priceless."
good,"A good place to start out, but its a job, not a career for most people. You go in, do very basic work, and clock out. It's a minimum wage job. Each store is different, so management and culture vary from store to store."
good,"Is okay company to work for at first. Then once they train you, they put more pressure on you. Increasing becoming difficult to work with payroll cuts and decreased benefits."
good,The setting is a little sketchy. The customers always have give off a bad vibe and not necessarily the most safe location to be working at. especially if you are overnight.
good,Walgreens is all about customer service and making sure that the shelves are always stocked. The best thing about Walgreens are  the amazing benefits.
good,"Job was ok, No benifits. Customer service was tolerable. Customers were somewhat tolerable. The job was demanding but it was my prefence since they need the help. The hours were flexable and the pay was somewhat decent."
good,"Decent place to work considering it is retail.  I worked there part-time so I got about 20-25 hours a week on average.  As with any store, it was extremely hectic during the holiday season.  Since they are a 24/7 365 days a year store, one year I had to work on Christmas morning."
good,Fun place to work because everyday will be different. So if you have a personality and diversity you will enjoy working at working Walgreen's or any retail job.
good,Great job. I mean I was in high school when I worked here and my co workers were two pretty girls so honestly that's all I remember about this place it was a long time ago.
good,Management changes duties and obligations of staff with little regard for the time involved in accurately achieving professional goals. Management appears to find fault as a method of proving their value.
good,"I believe Walgreens is a great job to START out in. If you can be cross trained I would highly recommend it. They will pay for you to become licensed and certified in the pharmacy. The bad thing about Walgreens is, they don't have many opportunities to move up in the company, especially in the pharmacy. Also you will never become full time in the pharmacy, The only way to become full time is to be in management."
good,"Walgreens is a place were hours can be flexible, and it is a great place if you are a student. Pay varies, but they do help if you want to advance into pharmacy."
good,Haven't worked for this company in years. The hierarchy has changed drastically since I have been there and the Walgreens family no longer owns the company. It has turned into the CVS of the West.
good,"Walgreens provides good compensation for pharmacy interns and teaches you the ropes of the business. However, you may not get a position as a pharmacist with the company upon graduating, even with a good work performance and the recommendation of your pharmacy manager."
good,"Hard to say, when I first started working here I enjoyed it, but then sadly I got comfortable, too comfortable. I had to leave due to poor pay and absence of organization."
good,When I first started with Walgreens it was an excellent place to work. The mindset was if you take care of your customers and your employees the bottom line will take care of itself. It has slowly become how many other companies can we buy up while reducing compensation for store level employees.
good,"Fast paced environment.  Must be able to multitask by answering phones and helping customers.  Helping customers not only with pharmacy related questions, but help them find things in the store."
good,"The job was like many retail pharmacy jobs. Fast paced, but corporate always trying to save money so they cut hours and pharmacists are forced to work with as little technician help as possible."
good,They over work you at Walgreen's. Too much work and not enough pay. The hours are very ugh. You work very long hours and do not get paid much.  Working there was fun sometimes
good,"-typical day at work (typical responsibilities) -rotate/receive inventory, stock shelves, help customers, cash register, photo lab (easy PC work), tidy/clean store, check expiration dates"
good,Very fast work place has to keep along with everyone else and be prepared to stand for long period of hours . Management is very helpful for all workers and everything is done together .
good,"Skeleton crew with too high of expectations.  They expect you to drive results and give great customer service, but they only let you work a bare bone crew.  The front end and the pharmacy are always understaffed and there are errors that go without being taken care of.  The staff is overworked,  underpaid, and miserable.  Huge turnover in 2018 that they want to blame on ""Frontier"" but in reality it's simply budget cuts.  The bottom up mentality is bs and the staff know it.  Hard to be bottom up when only top down can be scheduled.  Advice: Don't work here expecting greatness.  Don't expect a good schedule. It's retail.  Don't plan on getting anything done or organized.  Do look for other opportunities. Do find something you love and can be acknowledged for.  Do move on."
good,I met a lot of great people. the hours are flexible for mothers. management needs some improvement. I enjoyed working for the company because of the customers.
good,I really enjoyed working with my Assistant Manager and co-workers. I enjoyed working in photo and beauty departments. I really wanted to stay so I could of learned more about working in the pharmacy department.
good,"The only thing keeping me here, are my co-workers. Customers are just extremely hard to deal with, and nothing you ever do is good enough for this company."
good,"not applicable"
good,"Walgreens was at first an overall good company to work for. Currently with the lack of employees due to low pay rate, It has made it difficult at this to run the store effectively. There is very low engagement from the employees due to low pay rates. Walgreens has excellent benefits for its employee, but due to the amount of time you have been with the company some employees complain."
good,"Efficiently operated cash register and handled cash, checks, and credit card transactions. "
good,I worked in 2 different states and it depends. Career advancement was easy to achieve in one state but once I moved I was limited with store availability.
good,"Good learning of retail practices and marketing, Good opportunity to manage people. Great opportunity to move up within the store. Can be long hours, but gain an appreciation for customer service."
good,This company is a very large company and does not care about what they pay and show any appreciation for them when reviews come along. they are only there to make money
good,"I worked for RiteAid, which was sold to Walgreens. I spent about three months with Walgreens until the merger was complete. The time spent with Walgreens wasn't bad."
good,"Long days, low pay, too much inventory, high ad tags to be hung, hard hiring good staff due to low pay. Store Manager has no control over what is ordered for ads or how to set."
good,"Fast paced, multi tasking"
good,"If you work hard and apply yourself, you can get promoted. You are paid hourly here and this is a global company so honestly the pay just doesn't cut it."
good,Walgreens pharmacy is a very high paced place that requires a lot multi-tasked and communication skills. The enjoyable part is you will have a chance to know your customers and be able to help them with their health needs. The hardest part of the job is you will be interrupted all the times.
good,"Store managers and pharmacy managers don't seem to talk to on another, when request are made to continue one's training it's overlooked, having good attendance and being available to work for others doesn't seen to be appreciated salary increase came to a halt my last year for what the company refers to as a revision to the assessment"
good,too much work and theres only a few people hired. its always packed and they only have one cashier. why only one cashier.... they need more people... wow
good,"-no set schedule"
good,"I worked overnights. I loved that I had the work 7 days off 6 days. The scheduling was great, but the pay did not balance with the amount of work I would do. I was an overnight cashier. I was responsible for restocking the whole front of the store including Cosmetics and outdating. The labor on my feet was not worth the amount I was being paid. My shift manager was awesome though, but my body took a beating for not that much pay. $8.25 (I got a .50 cent raise for dong overnights)"
good,"A typical workday is very fast paced.  I have learnt a lot of pharmacy technician work.  Management is very creative, good work place culture.  Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the required metrics. Most enjoyable is constantly learning new things."
good,The managers were so terrible. All had attitudes and didn't want to work. Didn't actually train you. Would get irritated if you asked questions and were trying to learn.
good,Great for those looking for a non stressful part time job. Or a teenager fresh out of highschool. not many complaints I had working there. Pretty ok experience.
good,"This worked out well for me t the time. I w going to school, working at another job full time and the manager worked with me on hours. It just got to be too much for me to handle at the time."
good,"It's a very busy store, short staffed. Paid time off is great. Things could be more organized. Walgreens pays for license renewal, thats great too. The A/C doesn't work most of the time."
good,Very busy retail pharmacy. The staff is expected to do a lot with the bare minimum support. The technology is very good and if you have a great team it can be a good environment.
good,"Very fast paced job with many patients to attend to. Had to perform various duties. Fill prescriptions , manage insurance claims, Pay was very low for job duties."
good,I applied for this job when I was in college and stayed with the company until I graduated. This company was very flexible with my school schedule when it changed every semester. I transferred stores with this company around 3 times when I would go back and forth from my hometown and college town. I had a variety of bosses it really depended on what kind of relationship you developed with them. I made some of my very best friends at Walgreens. Easiest job you will have before you graduate.
good,"Flexible hours allow for students to work when they can. A typical day at included working at the register/customer service, cleaning the store, and stocking shelves. Not too hard, but not a place for someone looking to make a huge difference in the world or have fun."
good,"Walgreens is an ok place to work. A large part of whether the job is enjoyable or merely tolerable depends upon management. I have worked under very good and very bad store managers, and the difference in the job is night and day. I learned how to interact with all different kinds of people, perhaps patience being the most challenging lesson to take away from this experience. Walgreens tries to send their employees a message that they care about them, but that message only partially translates. Overall, I would say it's a job. You can find opportunities if you look for them and advocate for yourself, but the higher you go, the more stressful your work environment potentially becomes."
good,"As a pharmacist at Walgreens, I have to be able to multi-task and resolve customer issues in a timely manner. The work day is usually pretty involved and full of tasks to accomplish."
good,Walgreens is a good involvement to an it’s very laid back and cool but the cons are your always standing An your feet go to hurting but you get pretty good hours
good,I enjoyed the experience and training I received there. we have a wonderful staff . the hardest part is when we short  of staff. I'm not able to give my best service. you get to move around a lot covering and helping different department with whatever they need.
good,The company allows employees to date Shift Leads which is so annoying. Company is greedy with hours even though they make trillions. Always cutting pharmacy hours
good,"I enjoyed learning more about customer service."
good,it was cool i enjoyed it wasnt bad it was okay it was work it paid the bills i guess it was alright like it was work you get up go to work and go home lol
good,"I didn't hate or love my job at Walgreens. It was just a basic job, with basic expectations and basic pay. Regular day was simply just showing up, cleaning up, and working registers."
good,"They continuously kept us on our toes! The lunch breaks seemed short. There were many customers stealing daily without a care in the world. We had no choice but to let them steal from us.... as long as it was under $500.00, we really had no control over what they would take from us."
good,Sometimes hours can be conflicting in that schedules are not as flexible because being regularly short staffed. Otherwise the regular team members were amazing people
good,"This is a fast paced job which is rewarding if you have a great manager, if not it can be very stressful. THis is a great starter job for a pharmacy tech but I would not want to do this forever."
good,It was hard to work there for me because I had been a trained pharmacy technician for 5 years and I felt like a glorified cashier working there while others who I knew were not even certified worked in the main area of the pharmacy
good,I have learned a lot at Walgreens and the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers.       It can be very stressful but also rewarding.  My manager is real nice and respectful.
good,"I enjoyed working here as a first job, however, the environment in this location had clients that would make me uncomfortable because of the part of town it was in."
good,"the staff was great, management could have been better. Hours was switched around a great deal of the time, which wasn't the greatest thing working night shift and then going in the next morning"
good,People are great but scheduling leaves a lot to be desired. Only get your schedule every other week and its never the same so you cant make future plans and the pay is on the low side
good,Fun and also a learning experience for me. Being in the pharmacy there was always new situations and things changing just about on a complete daily basis.
good,"Staff is fun to work with until busy times in the pharmacy, then very short and to the point."
good,Employees are under compensated. Management constantly changes. Photo Equipment constantly failed and needed repair. Corporate constantly found ways to take away opportunities to make more money.
good,"walgreens sucked, managers we're awful and the whole corporation is ran very disorganized and poorly. Everything about it was awful, the work isn't at all challenging halve the time you just stand around waiting for one of the managers to stop picking there noise and give you a task."
good,"Busy, stressful work environment, my store has well-trained technicians. Store hours get cut periodically. The schedule is not realistic for someone with a family."
good,The workload was always light. The pay could have been better but it was ok.
good,"I enjoy my job as a Pharmacist. Getting to help people is very rewarding.  Because I have been in the same area for over 15 years, I have established strong relationships with the providers and there staff in the area.  I have learned to multitask, on various levels,  As well I have learned empathy for my patients and what they are going through. I have also learned to work with different staff, management, customers, and insurance companies.  The hardest part of my job is watching what some of my customers are going through. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to help and meet people."
good,"I think it's ok to work for walgreens. My DM is not really usaful but it's ok. the scheduler is difficult, floater is really hard. some store is really bad"
good,"Appears to be a disconnect between store level management and Corporate.  Corporate Support also seems to not understand the running of a store."
good,"I liked it , not a lot of moving u in the company .you would have to work to be seen . a lot of stress and little pay . moving up in the company is annoying , feels like a waste of time"
good,Usually calm place to work and not to much stress everything is written out for every team member on what the need to complete for the day. You are allowed to take brakes to rest.
good,I really do not like how repetitive the job itself is. I wish the district managers and the heads in the Walgreen's corporation cared a little more about family time and a little less about money.
good,Helping customers with daily shopping needs. I would help stock the store and handle management job requirements for a shift lead. Open and close the store on a routine basis.
good,They are an ok place to work need to treat employees fairly along with promoting within and  not lying to employees about situations that involve them and their colleagues
good,just another retail job that doesnt pay well unless youre at least a shift leader or have been there long enough to get enough raises. can be very stressful if understaffed
good,My internship at Walgreens was a very good experience. I had a good manager so she was always willing to teach me. I was able to work on different projects outside of the pharmacy.
good,Walgreens provides extream flexibility with hours. Great way to pick and choose if you'd like to pick up hours at other stores Incase hours are scarce
good,Inconsistences within the company can come back to you in a good or bad way. The rules can change on you before you know it and not enough training for fraud.
good,you are working retail where customer service is always first and customers are always right. depending upon your manager and fellow coworkers will determine how good or bad you experience with working there is.
good,The walgreens that I worked for was a 24 hour one I was close the night before 4 pm-12 am and I would have to open the next day 8 am to 4:30 pm. They would occasionally throw in a grave yard shift.
good,The company  is deteriorating. Their focus has shifted from people to image. They have taken so much away from employees' that it is almost difficult to survive working at Walgreens. Turn over is very high.
good,Pay is good but inconsistent hours. A typical day at work is slow paced. My managers are great to work with and easy to talk to. My co workers and I help each other often.
good,"It was a good job to get on your feet , but definitely not something you’d want to do forever . It can be fast paced but for the most part it’s pretty slow , and not hard to figure out ."
good,"my experience was very pleasant co-workers and management to work with. the training program was long , thorough and extensive. received full time hours of witch was flexible . multi tasked all areas of the store"
good,I have no review great starting job if you love slow paced work. Great for people who are trying to get their foot in the door job wise but if you want to make money and go to school not your best option.
good,"I worked here in high school. I would recommend to young people looking to earn some money, and add some work experience to their resume. There are multiple departments you can work at within the store which is nice. Pharmacy, photo, beauty section, etc."
good,Working 4 10 hour days was perfect for my lifestyle.  Walgreens constantly implies there will be layoffs.  It was to stressful to deal with on the daily.  Reason for leaving
good,"I typically managed a few employees, assisted customers, set up merchandise on the shelves, and maintained stockroom inventory.  The hardest part is the constant activity in the store."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy, sometimes the shift would go into overtime because all the work wasn't done. Very good learning opportunities but only for a short time."
good,Due to the lack of proper and professional management team the rest of the staff is lacking in opportunities to grow within company as well as outside
good,I guess it really depends on your manager of making your life stressful at work. there is no life and work balance. Also my opinion doesn’t matter when coming up with new ideas.
good,"Retail definitely has its ups and downs, however, I did find that Walgreens tried to provide a positive environment.  My employers at the time were understanding and interested in your life."
good,nice place to work with great coworkers. the work itself was pretty busy making the days go by faster. the customers could be difficult at times but overall manageable.
good,"Walgreens is a good company, but the schedule as a retail pharmacist is not very conducive to having good work:life balance. Benefits were good and overall a positive experience."
good,"Overall its a nice job to have. It's about the same as any other retail chain. Turn over rate is a bit high. The employees are nice, management could use some improvements. Not the worst job in the world, but definitely not something to do long term. Would recommend for a first time job. Gives you good work experience and can easily move up in the company if you have good work ethic."
good,Was treated very poorly. There were favorites and people that werent a favorite were left out very often. Forced to work holidays even when you have a family to celebrate with.
good,"The company has gone very much downhill. When I first started 9 years ago, it was a very different company and a very different environment. Hours have been cut, useless programs have been implemented, and too much is being pushed on employees."
good,Typical retail position in a small store in a small town. Got to know the regulars and would. Was able to work most positions in the store with obvious exceptions such as the pharmacy and management positions so a small crew could run the store.
good,I've worked there for 7 years and make 11 dollars. I worked hard and any hours they wanted. After working and going to school to get my GED  to move up into management. But after achieving its I was told that they are on a hiring freeze. Yet if you check job sites you will see Walgreens on them.
good,"Work/Life balance was is great.  It allowed me to go to attend school, study, and take exams to earn my Phlebotomy certification.  Fellow team members are great to work with and are like family."
good,"a typical day at work would be clock in greet who ever is at the counter assist a customer with processing prescription when i working in pharmacy. When i worked in front i organized the stock room,placed items that were over stock neatly in the stock room, filled the shelf's with what ever items was needed, assist customers at check out . "
good,"I didn’t enjoy having to drive so far to work. "
good,Walgreens is a friendly fast paced job. That requires a lot of work for less money. Working here I met plenty of people.But its the people you work with that can either make it harder or easier to work there.
good,"Employees are stretched to their limits in terms of what they are expected to do and how many hats they are supposed to wear, and while the benefits are decent, as the years went by, it seemed like they appreciated the non-management workers less and less."
good,"This isn't a bad job, but it is quick to out grow. If your goal is to own your own store or become a store manager, this is a good job to start at. If retail isnt your long term goal, don't get stuck in it!!"
good,"The job for me was relaxing for the most part. it was a lenient environment but had stressful moments as well. I would recommend this job to someone who is looking for a job while still in school. however, the pay was more on the low end. I did always feel valued by management. Advancement opportunities are very sparse. My district kept having hours cut, especially in the pharmacy. Seems like corporate is stretching itself too thin and can't afford to give their own stores enough hours."
good,"I enjoy learning new things and Walgreens truly gave me that opportunity, unfortunately their budget as a company and my need to work is just not making a good match together. I love the job that I do because it is helping people I just need more time spent there."
good,"When I work for Walgreens in Hesperia Ca it was a great place to work, management was always encouraging you, if you wanted to learn new things management was always there to help. When I transfer to Walgreens in Rocky River Ohio it was a totally different environment management didn’t want to support you, they didn’t encourage you, and if want to learn they always put your request on the back burner"
good,average work place.  great for a first job for a student.  gives opportunity to grow in the company.  fixed hours but flexible and management is a hit or miss.
good,Was there 21 years.  Great place to work for first 16/17 years.  Then company changed.  Changed bonus rules.  Budgets not big enough for work being asked to perform.  Especially in pharmacy.
good,Be prepared to stand for the majority of you shift. Each dept offers there on rules and dedication. People can be friendly and helpful with the new hires.
good,"Decent company to work for, get paid decent for the position, but went through about 5 store managers while there. There was lack of communication between management. Just seemed ""drama"" took over the vibe of the store. Not every store is the same, but I was ready for change."
good,"Decent company to work for, differs district-to-district. The amount of understanding or knowledge from upper management makes a difference for the work environment created at the store level."
good,The cleaning at the end of the night was easy since we had a whole hour. Everyday we had something to do from checking expired candy to organizing product on the shelves.
good,Very fast paced environment. Involved with customers over the phone and in person constantly helping to make sure their prescriptions are being taken care of.
good,"I've worked some great managers and also terrible managers. Some of them i wondered how did they become a manager? Who trained them? What did they do to get there? Some of them think they own walgreens, you gotta kiss their behind in order for you to get promoted even tho you know the job better then them."
good,Great innovations and use of technology. But not enough help. Too many duties performed by pharmacist that bottle necks the entire prescription process.
good,"Photo technician"
good,"Dedicated most of my career working here, only to see no future growth within the company. Thank you for all the bittersweet memories. I am off to find better opportunities that actually utilize my extensive training."
good,"I worked part-time I cashier. I also cross-trained for other positions. As a cashier I developed relationships with customers. Many of which would only shop on the days I was scheduled to work. I also dealt with irate customers. I left the position soon after the minimum wage was raised. In order to keep wages low, they reduced the hours an employee could work."
good,"Everything's changed after the transitioning. It used to be a great company to work for, great management and gave great benefits. Sadly, it became less people engaging, more for profiting"
good,"Receiving clerk for all inbound and outbound orders from distribution warehouse.  Operated multi-type of sit-down to stand-up forklift to cherry picker to clamp lifts.  Responsible for loading and unloading freight from prime movers, placing in assigned bin locations and ensuring 100 percent accountability of merchandise. Maintained a 3.4 million dollar inventory of various products for daily consumer use with a zero loss to employer. Reconciled all discrepancies with customer orders that generated an unconditional loyalty with the public."
good,"Can be a ok job to work at. Some of the people here are good to work with,but some are not they have attitudes towards one another. Also did not get a pay raise after working for 3 years"
good,My review on working at Walgreens is that it slow but there was a lot to restock the items that people left behind or didn’t want. I liked it but at the same time I didn’t like working at Walgreens because it wouldn’t be that busy as other jobs.
good,Customers are the worst and management didn't back me up all the time so i would get written up for stupidity rather than performance which i was one of the best for that store...
good,"The sheer knowledge that it took to perform the tasks was equivalent to flipping through channels on a tv. This is a very laid back, but professional retail environment."
good,"Walgreens got rid of the employee appreciation rewards and have higher expectations with minimum room for increase in hourly wages. It is a bit disappointing because it has the potential to be a great, caring company for the future but only if it could really appreciate the employees that spend tremendous amounts of time and work effort to help Walgreens achieve its goals. Walgreens needs to give more opportunities to earn extra income."
good,It was always busy there. Got to communicate with different cultural people. Worked in a fast based environment. Mangement was good. Multicultural workplace.
good,"If you were sick or had an emergency, there wasn't enough employees to cover and managers kept track of that and didn't like it. Managers expected a front cashier to constantly be doing something even if there was nothing to do other than wait for customers to line up. "
good,"Schedule is crazy, you know your working schedule for 2 weeks at a time. Pay is low for expectations. Management was friendly. Overall moral was low.."
good,As a beauty advisor I loved this type of work I had to learn about new products that were going to be promoted and if I sold the promoting item I would get a bonus per item. My only complaint was when closing the store the beauty advisors had to clean the bathrooms.
good,Work here if you need something to do. It isn't meant to be a Wall Street kind of job if you're in the customer service department but there are avenues to working your way up.
good,"Management picks and chooses who they like and who gets special treatment. Can never go to management and complain because your personal business gets out to everyone and they will give special treatment to their favorites. Honestly if you aren't their favorite nothing you say matters, but also can't tell management that because they'll obviously lie and have an excuse like ""Productivity and reliability"". Plus you might get fired for complaining, so you try to just keep to yourself."
good,"Turnover rate is high. It's rare to see a new tech stay with the company because we are always busy, understaffed and the compansation is really low. This makes working at Walgreens unrewarding."
good,"I worked as a cashier and ""beauty consultant"". As such I stocked shelves for the aisles assigned to both front end and cosmetic counter, greeted costumers and assisted them with shopping needs"
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers, performing cashier duties, engaging customers, stocking, and keeping work area clean.  I have learned a lot about retail and found working in the retail business can be somewhat stressful.  The workplace culture is good because I have met wonderful employees that I enjoy working with as a team.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the occasional rude customer however, the most enjoyable part of the job is the diversity that makes the job interesting."
good,"Nice company"
good,Walgreens is a good company to start your career in customer service. This job is enjoyable if you take pride in giving customers a great customer service experience.
good,"My typical day at work I worked as a cashier, i stocked product, I organized the shelves. I learned how to work together with my team. I learned how to provide great customer service. The hardest part of the job was working night shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was my lunch break."
good,Walgreens was something to help me through i have been employed there for 15 years plus i started out with 8.50 and ended with 9.75 and hour. I was mistreated by staff and associates as well as denied an additional raise due to the fact i need an set schedule because i have kid to attend to morning shifts was a must for 15 years i had a set schedule until suddenly we became under knew management and the decided to change my schedule that has been the same for over 15 years
good,"I have worked for Walgreens for several years. The pay is good, but with a large student loan, I have to work someone that pays well. With the staffing cuts and constant need to do more with less, I have gotten frustrated."
good,Although walgreens is really good and has many benefits it’s not the right fit for me. I get paid minimum wage and over the summer it gets really hot which I really do not like.
good,Personally did not work there too long but seems like an okay company to work for. Retail is retail. Depending on the team you have it will be a good experience.
good,"wasn't a horrible place to work, but constantly understaffed and had a high turnover rate for employees. because of always being understaffed the employees were often expected to cover multiple areas while also dealing with customers, which was often impossible."
good,good starter job but if you are looking for a career I cant recommend Walgreens as a workplace. my experience was in the store so maybe working in corporate is better than in the stores.
good,"the hard part of my day was developing photos. developing photos can be very confusing if you don't know what your doing. sometime the photo machine would break down and you would have to do everything manually. If you know how to develop photos manually, you know its no easy task with old equipment."
good,"generally nice place to work ,at times very stressful coming from management customers basically nice at the store i worked at most of staff got along fine but, there is always that day when no one was getting along"
good,Walgreens is a place thats not to bad i cant speak on all the Walgreens but just maybe the one at my store locations is very difficult but i am not the one to complain or quit a job with out an purpose . the store is always getting rob at some point i have talk to my supervisor in hiring an Armed Security  guard at night to ensure the safety of employees but unfortunately the did not do so ...
good,Okay company to work for if your a college student or looking for a part time opportunity. Not really suitable looking to sustain a lifestyle or take care of a family off of.
good,I was a vendor so don't have much information about the workculture in client. The client was generally good but there was a constant fear about the lay-offs in the team members.
good,"The pace and work flow is nice, there is usually something to do but not so much I'm overwhelmed and overworked. The constant interaction with people can be a lot some days but is usually rewarding and energizing.  Management is understanding and flexible with hours and sick days but scheduling for vacation is a bit of an issue: there usually aren't enough people to cover for a full timer taking a vacation longer than four or five days. I don't take a lot of vacation its not a big deal to me but its a small gripe.  My coworkers are generally nice and helpful, I feel supported when I need extra help. The team is small enough that I can get to know everyone. One of my few big complaints is how little the raises are; only once a year we can get about a five cent raise maybe even less and I don't think its enough since I've worked full time for three years, I'd expect it to go up maybe a dollar over three years but it is entry level. Day to day working there is nice but I think it should pay a little more for loyal employees."
good,"The company hired me to take position in the pharmacy to be a cashier and instead they put me as the front end cashier, even in training they told me not to do the videos and training on the pharmacy. I found it odd and after 3 months of not working in the area they hired me for i quit."
good,"Worked as a pharmacy Technician, they offered great training, but the coworkers were not very friendly. Management did nothing about the bullying, in fact the manager of the pharmacy was doing most of it."
good,"This is a good job for young adults and high school students looking to start their career or gain experience in customer service. There aren't many opportunities for growth in store, but the corporate positions are constantly up for grabs. Good job."
good,"Walgreens is a decent job for college and high school students, a nice part time job. You may not get the shifts you desire but you’ll get your hours."
good,"Depending on your manager, which could change fairly often, the place was decent enough to work for."
good,"I've worked in stores where team members are highly engaged and have solid direction with store plans and future. However, I've also worked in stores that are the complete opposite."
good,They consider there workers . It's a good place to work the timing it good for people who are parents. There flexible which is a very good thing. Great job
good,"Getting the day started with a Tier 1 meeting. I've been fortunate to learn how multiple departments come together to achieve one common goal and how those departments affect each other. I have been in the Lean culture now for over 5 years. The culture and the workplace environment is a productive one, due to the employees and their years of work experience there. Management does their best to insure the work day goes a smoothly as possible. Some challenges of the workplace can have to do with some departments having a lack of employees for the day, for a variety of reasons, and due to unseen circumstances such as equipment malfunction. The lack of growth there is also a challenge. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing our department, and if need be helping other departments meet our run times and or deadlines."
good,Walgreens has provided me with a lot of experience and opportunities within the company. I have enjoyed working for Walgreens however looking for a more stable 8-5 type job.
good,"After school I would clock in at 4:00 pm and get to work by doing the registers, checking out customers and cleaning the area. When I am not doing those things, I am restocking shelves and putting up new items on each aisle. When that was done I would clock out at 10:00 pm."
good,"very top-heavy management; 5 managers working per 2 employees each day"
good,A typical day starts with clocking in and then scrambling to figure out where you are supposed to be. Once there you get to juggle problems outside of your scope of practice and engage with insurance companies and customers while trying to figure out which task you were supposed to do in the first place.
good,The job as a cashier was very monotonous. It required very little skill which explains why you most likely will be working with high school kids. The environment is great until you encounter a co-worker that is lazy and doesn't' feel like doing their work.
good,The work is stressful but I enjoy talking to the customers sometimes and helping them with their issues. The hardest part of the job is when they call in yelling at you and you have literally done nothing wrong.
good,Walgreens taught me a lot of customer service and be patient but the people were just to much to handle. Very demanding and non informative. I didn’t feel I was welcomed.
good,A typical day at Walgreens is always about customer service and making sure items are always available for sale. Working in the photo lab ensures there is always something new to learn with the computers and printers. It can sometimes be very stressful when we are busy and there is still so much to do but I have been able to attain a good sense of time management so I can accomplish my tasks in a timely fashion.
good,"As long as you work hard for Walgreens, they will let you go far. Walgreens is a company with decient opportunity. Management Varys drastically depending on store."
good,I was promoted 4 times in the 5 years I've been working there. The last position I had was an Assistant Manager. I delegate tasks to my coworkers and count the safe twice a day.
good,"In the beginning, LOOK Boutique was a great job. Lots of commission, spiffs, incentives, gratis, and bonuses. But as time went on, there was less and less support from corporate, even one of the Beauty Area Experts straight out TELLING me that corporate doesn't find it to be worth it to invest in any longer. I had to move on, because I can't be expected to succeed, when ALL my tools for success are taken away."
good,"If you: keep your mouth shut, do your work, don't steal, expect for managers to be incompetent, want a lot of corporate interference, ridiculous changes, an inventory computer system that is 35 years out of date, and don't make friends...yes, you'll love it."
good,The company is making changes thats not good for the employees.They are making it a very stressful work with more demands and less support from the higher bosses.The employees are stressed out over worked and under paid and that's sad because every one needs a job and they are scares to speak up about any thing.
good,"Standard, boring retail experience. Just come in hoping that you have some fun coworkers and managers to get you through the day with as little pain as possible."
good,Walgreen's is a good place to work.  On day to day you assist customers in seeking products.  Assist them to find what they are looking for.  Make sure all customers leave happy.
good,I didn't like working at walgreens because there was this one time I called out sick with the flu and the fever and when I returned to work the managers were talking about me being out sick (HUGE HIPPA VIOLATION) and they said my mommy should've just of have me ibuprofen and sent me to work that day. May I mention it was an 103 fever and when I returned I my mouth was still covered in fever blisters and I was still extremely sick.
good,"need a change of scenery, walgreens changes things every week"
good,You are able to learn a lot while working here. To me I learned a lot hands on. There's a lot of opportunity for you to train for various things/positions.
good,"Good benefits, customers friendly, clean atmosphere. Alot of housekeeping involved. Manaement needs more training on how to treat employees without bias."
good,They were very slow with the promotions or advancement in the company. Very sloppy not professional at all when it comes to management at the beginning.
good,I enjoyed working at walgreens and would have stayed but overnights were hard on my family.  My children were young and it left my husband to do more than his share of the workload
good,"On an average day you greeted the customers as they entered the store, ran the cashier register, stock items, and answered the phones, work the photo lab, and at times did resets and plan-o-grams"
good,"over all not a bad place to work; I have been with the company for many years. store needs more help,  good dependable help.  although I don't think there is much room for advancement; Ive tried for years. Holidays are rough but makes your shift go quickly. I feel with any retail your forced to do work then family."
good,Get to know you at this employment opportunity. You'll be in charge of how the sales end caps look and get a chance to be creative. Also chances to move up the employment ladder.
good,"I worked with the company for almost six years, in pharmacy for 3. I was still treated like I was a new person and given the worst schedule hours and duties to do within the pharmacy. I complained to management for over a year, nothing was ever done. When I told them I decided to leave, I was given a 2 dollar raise and told I'm the best technician they have. But the problems I had been complaining about for over a year were still not being addressed. It's a fast paced job dealing mainly in customer service. I enjoyed my job, and loved my customers. But I was tired of being treated unfairly and working in a hostile work environment, with a manager who didn't manage."
good,Nothing special or bad to say. walgreens is a decent start up job as a teen as i was. you can grow and advance in the company though. so its up to you.
good,This is a very laid back company. I really enjoyed Walgreens and their way of viewing customer service. It's always about the customer and that's where I've learned that if the customer is happy you are too
good,"Sorry for any disappointment, but this is the fifth time I've had to write a review on a company just to look for jobs.  If I cared that much it might be different."
good,"full day multi tasking always have a sense of accomplishment drug information and medical liason"
good,Walgreens required a lot of work but there was a lot of down time when business was slow. I was the youngest worker because i started working there when I was 16. I left because they were barely giving me any hours.
good,it was ok company to work for during my 5 years there. cashiering and helping customers with there pharmeacitical needs. i learned not to get to comfrontable at any job. manaegment was ok.
good,great place at first until they changed all aspects of the company downsizing and taking away pay. workers are great people very friendly and helpful.
good,"Overall it's a decent job I'm just tired of the drama and lies. My management isn't the best, 2 of the four I enjoy working with. I feel like there is a lack in communication which could really improve the quality of work. But as long as you do your job and don't mess up on anything no one will have anything negative to say about you. Keep your head down and do the job. Keeps you from being dragged into the drama."
good,"The only thing I don't  like, it seems like they care more about meeting numbers rather than spending more time helping patients. Also they have been cutting pharmacist hours a lot lately"
good,Cool place to work started in college and they help you advance if you want to can be hectic from time to time but it's a great stepping stone to a career in healthcare
good,Good job and Good pay. Temp position. Work schedule cancelled a lot. Looking for other work to supplement the job. Pretty upset that the job was sold to  me as full-time but I have only worked 2 days so far.
good,"You will learn a great deal about medications, interactions, as well as time management. I will have to say that pharmacy technician are over worked and underpaid/ appreciated for what they do."
good,"It  has  gone  down hill since  i  started,  too many shift leaders  that  don't  give respect to  other  co-workers.  lack of  breaks,  team work,  I  enjoy  my  job  because of  my  customers,  hate it because of  shift leaders respect not given to all team  members,  Should  always be  able to ask  questions  without  feeling belittle"
good,"I would greet people with a smile ask them if they needed help"
good,"My position at Walgreens was for Pharmacy Technician externship.  Learned a lot about working in a pharmacy and developing customer service skills.   "
good,Job is relaxing and easy if your on the floor doing stock. Staffs are very nice and always meeting new customers can help you on your customer service.
good,Though Walgreens I believe doesn't pay their employees enough. The work environment and co-workers make the job more fun and enjoyable. The managers are really nice and understand situations and help motivate employees to do their best.
good,I sorta of enjoy walgreens. The hours are not the greatest. The usually only have three people working every shift at night. Hardest part of the job is definitely running the register talking with the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people i work with
good,I worked as an occupational health nurse for Michelin North America.  I had contact with a great deal of different nationalities.  That opportunity alone would be worth the job itself.
good,A typical day at Walgreens was pretty fast paced and a lot to do in little time. I learned how to manage my time correctly in order to get all my tasks done for the day. Management at Walgreens was decent but there were also times when it was not good at all.The hardest part of the job was pleasing everyone at first but now I'm pretty good at it. The most enjoyable thing about the job was getting my tasks done the right way and helping other complete what needed to be done so we wouldn't have no extra left over work for the next day.
good,Spent over 9 years at one location with out a hitch; transferred to the only open spot in the urban area I desired.  Warned about the manager there.  Lasted 8 months.  Resigned due to hostile work environment as my predecessors did.
good,"Working at Walgreens is a good starting job that gives you the traditional customer service experience. The daily duties of helping customers, stocking the shelves, and working the front register can seem daunting at first, but it eventually becomes second nature. I feel that the level of enjoyment you get from working at Walgreens is based on how well you get along with your coworkers and the regular customers."
good,Working as a cashier you really cant complain about the pay. The job is easy and sometimes it can be a little slow paced. It can also be a little fast paced as it depended on the day
good,walgreens is a great training pharmacy. they go over and beyond to make sure you are where you need to be with the company and if your want to further your career in pharmacy.
good,"I've worked for a particularly busy Walgreens for the past 2 years. Generally, the work load is far more than the budget allows for hours so while there is always something to do, its usually very stressful mentally and physically. One advantage is that my coworkers have become a second family and I love them as much as my best friends. If you honestly care about your position and voice your desire to move up, the opportunities will come. Unfortunately, the pay does not match the requirements of the work and you may feel stagnant in a position. Walgreens is a great place to learn customer service and team work."
good,"The company considers the pharmacist in their workflow design.  I found it very enjoyable, however it was very stressful, as one can imagine.  Corporate pharmacy, though"
good,"I grew friendships with the people I worked with and that made me hang on to my employment with Walgreens. Without them, I don't think I would have stayed as long as I did. Advancement is not great."
good,"It was fun to interact with costumers, even though some are not as great as others. I learned a lot from my Walgreen's experience. If you go and do your work its easy as pie. The coworkers treat you with respect, its like a big Walgreen's family. The best part of the job is working the register meeting new people."
good,"Great managerial experience ,excellent customer service ,great benefits ,customer focussed,pople are really nice to work ,excellent work atmosphere .And great place to work"
good,"I don't want to give my opinion on a typical day at work, what I learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the ob or the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,This was a very fast paced and stressful job. I liked it but after a few years you do need to take a break and clear your head to just relax from everything that is thrown at you in this situation. There are a lot of stressful situations that can be life or death and a lot of the time you are the one to catch these.
good,"Was a fun slow paced job I was in-charge of the cosmetic area, keeping it stocked, rang up purchases for customers and helped when needed. Boss was really nice."
good,I like that you could move up in the company start off as a cashier to now been a pharmacy tech. I was about to learn about the photo department and even a beauty advisor as well as before I was placed in pharmacy.
good,"Worked for almost 11 years at Walgreens! My husband has congestive heart failure. I do not know how much more time we have together.I asked if it would be possible to have weekends off in order to spend more time with my husband and was denied. I loved working for Walgreens and all of the customers that I built a connection with really loved me and asked me not to leave. I  just felt that after devoting so many years of hard work and dedication I certainly should get some consideration for my request.. That is the main reason I retired. It seemed like the younger female employees did not have any challenges securing days off requests. Walgreens is a great company but upper management should be more aware of what us happening at the Store Manager level,"
good,"Walgreens was a great place for opportunity, but the pay for my cost of living wasn't enough for me to survive. I enjoyed working there. Overall okay."
good,"Walgreens was a great place to work when I first started but has definitely changed over the past few years. New company policies that don't really make sense, benefits aren't that great, insurance costs alot more and going up every year. It's very different from how it used to be."
good,"If you're looking a job, Walgreens is fine but if you're looking for a career you can do better. Hours are flexible but customers can be so irate and their doctors are never wrong."
good,I don't remember too much since it has been a while since I was employed there. It was a good job for a teenager looking for extra spending cash for when they go out.
good,"I was in Pharmacy technician school when I started at walgreens, I learned how to be multi tasked. I learned how to do data entry because some store short hand was required and some stores were not. I learned a lot about the pharmacy exam which walgreens paid for when I passed the Louisiana board of pharmacy exam. the hardest part was trying to mesh with other staff members."
good,"answered multiple phone lines, assisted pharmacist, data entry, filled prescriptions, inventory, order medications, filing prescriptions, customer service"
good,"Being one of the first jobs I've had as a college student, Walgreens allowed growth and development for anyone interested in business or just great customer service. I'll admit there may be some rough patches, and not all locations are the same as far as productivity and welcomeness, but that can be forgiven due to the many benefits one receive with this company."
good,"It is a good place to work if you like people. Walgreens is a good place for young people or retirees to work."
good,Walgreens is a wonderful place to develop teamwork skills. Every day the staff would work as a unit to make sure that all patients and customers needs were met and that all of our duties were accomplished.
good,The manager at the time believed in me always was happy with my job. Promoted me to a job with higher pay and was always happy with me and had confidence.
good,I was a nice company to work for. I think that they could improve on their benefits for part time employees. They also should offer promotions differently.
good,"was a great company to work for before 2013, but with management restructuring, only 2-3 people in my position are promoted a year out of an entire county . and with the assistant managers being retitled as ""Leads "" "
good,"As with all retail businesses, Walgreens main objective is to be profitable.  Therefore, the primary goal of the pharmacy is to process as many prescriptions, give as many immunizations, and sell as many related services/products as possible in the least amount of time and with the least amount of pharmacy technician help. There are times when more help is needed in the pharmacy but none is available.  This happens frequently and the staff is left to manage as best they can.  Customer comments or complaints are considered part of the process and seem to be a minor concern for management but are a huge concern for pharmacy staff. "
good,"Been at the job for almost 13 years, I am very committed to my workplace and will do anything for my job. "
good,ok up and down.  had to find something that would better meet my cost of living. Raises were not fairly based.  Should be based on how the employee works and not on how many hours an employee is scheduled.  PTO is also based that way.  This is beyond the employees doings.
good,"- Great team "
good,"I've work for walgreens for 4 years now. I started out with hope for my future with the company but in recent years, poor management has left me with little trust. The company seems to care less and less about their employees. They seem to throw out money needless for insignificant things but can't put some in to show that they appreciate their employees. I know that this is the climate for any company now a days but you'd expect more from a company doing so well. Also the lack of communication can be extremely frustrating."
good,Nice team. Nice management. International team and clientele. the work is straightforward and management provides constructive feedback. Lots of training opportunities.
good,"Working at this establishment for 9+ years has had very many negative and positive outcomes. The first several years I had worked there, every day had become a new learning experience, not just for the daily tasks that needed to be completed, but I was able to gain experience in customer service, as well as becoming more experienced in tasks I could take with me in the future. Communication skills, organizational skills, the ability to multitask,  and most importantly, the ability to work hard."
good,Walgreens was a great experience. I felt like I had a lot to learn from the technician position. It was a little nerve racking learning all the medications.
good,"A typical day at work for me would include; standing at the register, helping out customers, and cleaning up the store. I learned to be patient, how to work the register, and how to deal with customers."
good,"A typical day at work consists of multitasking. I take in prescriptions, type them and fill them. I work with insurance to get medications billed and i talk to nurses about med lists to make there are no errors."
good,I would have recommended Walgreens before they changed there pay structure by taking away $5.00 an hour for the same work which caused them to loose many good employees now thay cant replace with same
good,"With the buy out of walgreens, salaries dropped as did the moral. There was no job stability."
good,this job was very stressful at times just keeping up to date inventory and dealing with damaged merchandise and returns.  It is a typical retail job and you have to deal with patience.
good,A typical day at work was filling prescriptions at the Pharmacy. The hardest part of the job was trying to enter prescriptions while customers were building up on the line and expecting to be seen at that moment. It was difficult to receive help while learning on the job. The store manager was pleasant and easy to work with.
good,if i was unloading trucks or stocking stuff it was a cool job but sitting as cashier was just kinda boring if there were no customers you just stand there
good,"Stock the shelf, order products, help customers. Floor team members generally had a grasp on most aspects of the store except for pharmacy. Easy job to learn."
good,This job is more so a good starting place for someone looking for a first job. It is not too stressful and makes the transition into the working world pretty smooth.
good,I have not worked at Walgreens in over 15 years and far too much time has passed for me to feel comfortable to give them an adequate review on Indeed.
good,"It was what was available at the time and it let me go through with the chaos of working in the pharmacy which is something I thoroughly enjoyed, so not bad"
good,I worked at Walgreens for a short time but in that short time I learned somethings about retail. Management was great. Certain employees of course were all about drama.
good,working here i got a fair share of stocking and re stocking. at Walgreen's i looked for out of date stuff to take off the shelf's to replace with new things.
good,"A typical day at work is just ringing up customers, asking them if they have a Walgreens Balance Rewards Card and signing them up if they don't have one. It doesn't take no longer than 3 minutes to sign them up. No hard work at all, but you will stand up majority or all of the day."
good,"Worked at Walgreens for a while, did every position excluding management. Cashiers will do everything from zoning aisles, go backs, clearancing, defective and expired merchandise, end caps, trash, and sweeping and moping at night. On short staffed days they would watch over their department and usually the photo department. Management expects the most from you for a minimum wage job. Sales floor either has an impossible work load or is running back and forth all over the store."
good,My other employees was nice enought to make our work day not seem like work. We did our job but we had fun doing it. I worked in different roles and departments and the challenges that had in those departments was fun when you had fun managers.
good,Works well with student schedule. Never enough people. Very self serving company. My pharmacist is great and deserves better. Walgreens is just money hungry.
good,"Company overall was decent to work for, Management and other staff were pleasant and great to work with, however there were high expectations with limited resources to perform tasks."
good,I don’t know why I have to write any of this when I want a new job not at Walgreens this is ridiculous I just don’t like Walgreens as a company cause they don’t pay good
good,I learned a lot of managerial skills working for this company.  I am proud of what I accomplished but am ready for a new challenge.  I meet a lot of great people working for this company.
good,"Work began around 9pm got off at 7am if someone showed up on time. I learned to be a good listener and liked my job okay. Management was good on the night shift but the day shift manager was kinda mean. Good place to work if you get the right manager. The hardest part of the job was leaving, because I was upset with the way I was told ""NO"" I could not leave and go to my in-laws funeral. The most enjoyable part was working with the night manager and the customers."
good,"Long days but the pay was acceptable for the work being done. The culture was very formidable, and everyone was held accountable for all of their actions."
good,"I was able to obtain and learn customer service skills that would prove invaluable later in my careers. I enjoyed the people I worked with and enjoyed my managers,"
good,"Retail can be a pain in the butt, but it can also be ok if you hang in there. Personally it was starting to really get to me and just wasn't the right fit."
good,"Walgreens is a fast passed job that may cause stress, but working with every coworker is key and 100% customer service is required.  There is plenty to learn from operating phones to operating the photo lab.  Responsibility is a big deal and being organized is very recommended."
good,"Laid back depending on store's location. The coworkers are friendly along with management. I learned how to run a cash register through this company, no paid lunches, common customers which is nice to see on stressful days."
good,"cool place to work, good managers and great ambience"
good,"Not enough employees per shift, on your feet all shift, minimal breaks. Can be stressful during peak times such as after work hours and lunch breaks. Customer satisfaction was are greatest goal to meet."
good,An average day at work is very face paced. It makes more fun having a good work environment with awesome co-workers to lean on when you have difficult customers. There was never a dual moment
good,"-Either filling prescriptions or working up front( ringing customers out; taking in and entering prescriptions)"
good,Worked here for for many years. Many changes have occupied since. Restructuring and recoding positions. Having people change job titles for less money. Doing the same amount of work for less money.
good,"Because it was a warehouse job therefore all employees had to use forklifts and other equipment in order to move merchandise from one place to another. One day I was Using a fork lift that had some issue with the battery it would show it has full charge, but sometime it was almost dead and would not show. One day I was waiting on the fork lift and all the fork lifts were being used by other members, I had to make my numbers and decided to use the same fork lift that sometimes the battery would give us problem. As I moved the products close to the truck door the fork lift stopped working and I had to hand stock everything. It was good lesson for me because sometimes better to wait a little and do things the right way instead of rushing and make mistakes. The management was very easy and helpful. hardest part of the job was, it was a physical job and sometime depending on what type of load you get it would make it harder to make 100% percent of your numbers. The most enjoyable   part of the job was the lunch time because they had a big lunch room and you would get to meet new people and make friends."
good,"staff were great"
good,Job is not hard but the hours are hard to deal with. Hard to manage school and family life with the way that the hours were set up. Management lacks some things which make it hard to work in that type of environment.
good,"A typical day at work begins with some office and paper work, followed by performing tasks previously assigned on a list.  While completing tasks is important, taking care of customers comes first.  Over time, I've learned how to better assist customers, and help other coworkers as well.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate or high-maintenance customers, and overly dramatic coworkers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being a part of customer satisfaction, and knowing that the job has been done right."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work, however, there should be more room for growth and advancement. The job is not difficult, and most of the customers are awesome."
good,"I did great job."
good,"Walgreen’s hires you and will tell you you’re going to work 40 hours a week on Day shift. In about two weeks you see a huge change and you’re no longer working days, you’re working days & nights. They’re not honest when they hire you."
good,Ok place to work . We  worked together as a team. Good benefits. co-workers were very helpful. Always tryed to keep my self busy. I loved helping the customers In any way I could.
good,productive work place very fast paste and organized team members. Easy going mangers. you leave work on time so you do not have to worry about leaving work late.
good,"it was productive if you just wanna do your work,,, challenging dealing with difficult costumers. also being full the work what you doing . and let you start doing another work without finishing the first task."
good,It is an okay position. The hours aren't that great (11-7:30) and it can take a while to climb the ladder to get to a normal 8-5. Management here was so shady though.
good,"Typical Day"
good,"Behind on HR policies/procedures. Changes in leadership and regions/area are constant. If you like this type of environment, this would work for you. Hard to break culture who wants change but not accepting change."
good,"It's been a long, stressful career. Need to find something less chaotic Too many changes have happened over the past several years and the feeling of 'family' is gone. The focus is no longer on the patient and seems more focused on growth."
good,"A typical day of work at walgreens, for me, coinsists of coming in, counting the safe, be given a project, and complete that project by the end of the shift. It seems simple but its actually very labor intensive. Being the shift lead means you grab all management calls, all customer care calls, and all IC3's (this means a long line that needs help) in our pharmacy department. What i learned from this job is simply that titles are enough to calm a person. Many of times, I have walked into a customer being upset with my employee about an issue and when i re'stated that it was policy, they instantly calmed down. Management works hard here and doesn't really get the pay they deserve for the work they put out. It seems being store manager is the only position that has the right pay to work ratio. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable part of the job, the customers. You will have wonderful people who are down to earth and kind to you just simply cause they believe the world should be that way. Other people will likely be angry and take it out on you. Others will blame you for everything they have happened to mess up. Retail has always been that kind of way, the thing that makes the difference with Walgreens, is that it is also a pharmacy."
good,It use to be a great place to work but the culture has changed.  It's not the family atmosphere that it use to be.  The personal experience is gone and now it's all about the numbers.  My position no longer exist so I don't know how helpful this review can be.
good,For the amount of work that you do the pay is no where near enough the mangers have you do the work they don't feel like doing on top of the thing your suppose to be doing working there just isn't worth the headache and the stress
good,Very productive company. Overall is very organized and fast paced company which works alot with kaizen events to make it more easy and efficient for workers to get the job done
good,I loved the job at first but the boss I had at the second job was over demanding and excepted more than normal I also felt under appreciated and was expected to lift to much
good,"Good place to work for, hard to take breaks though as always short handed on employees. Never closedid for any holidays. Long hours  to have to work. Great customersite who were loyal  to the store."
good,It has good and bad days. You would have to be able to multitask and work well with customers. The management has some work that need to be done but the employees are great.
good,"A typical day at walgreens was pretty fast paced, lots of customer intereaction. I learned the secret to providing excellent customer service is being patient and personable kind gestures and pleasantries go along way and really means a lot to customers."
good,It was great while I was in school. Allowed me to make just enough to pay my bills and by food. The management staff were great and understanding. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone looking for that stepping stone in relation to my position.
good,I don't really remember my time at this position so yes i would recommend it to others who want to gain experience in the specialty pharmacy department.
good,"Good to get some experience and some advancments to make some more income by getting a raise yearly, good work, nice customers, friendly staff, fun working in pharmacy."
good,Fast paced job. Have to learn very quickly how to handle different situations. Coworkers are great with offering assistance. Must multitask and have effective communications skills.
good,"Managers do not receive an actual lunch or breaks. Most days there is no time to eat a quick meal. That is one major downfall about management positions. The other main disadvantage is that you must work holidays. Walgreen's is open everyday of the year. "
good,"It's a good place to make extra cash on the side, but unless you've been there a while, don't expect a lot of hours. Most of my managers were great, but there were those few you could tell didn't want to be there."
good,The job is easy. Management expects a lot for little pay. The customers expect a lot. Flexible schedule and willing to work with school schedule. They change management a lot.
good,"This is retail / pharmacy there are a few positions in the store but still just classic retail.  Some stocking, cash handling, and plenty of cutomer service."
good,Good management. Nice and clean environment with hard working associates. There was opportunity to move up in the company if you so chose to do so. The company benefits were good.
good,Walgreens has great benefits horrible job security. They do not like to keep employee's around they are more likely to hire from external than internal even if they are eliminating another position.
good,Best part about Walgreens was there staff but the pay was horrible and they made you overwork. The company waned everyone to do more work but they were not willing to give any of their employees a raise.
good,"The opportunity I had at the time was great but no longer offered. I worked in the pharmacy. At my current store the group of people no longer work their, but they are the reason I left. They worked there longer and bullied. Of course my boss wasn't a fan but only so much they could do. The biggest reason I left is full time there is 30 hours instead of 40. The pharmacy went to cut hours down to 20 hours a week. Was not enough to work at. They do in home drug tests randomly."
good,It was a very helpful experience in terms of getting ready to meet the real world of responsible adults that have to work to pay for their bills. Really enjoyed it.
good,Typical lower end customer service job. Not many benifits. The pay was low and unable to really support me and my child. Not much room for advancement.
good,"Pharmacy is always busy. Technicians are grossly underpaid and unappreciated by corporate. Something has to change in that aspect, other than that, my immediate supervisor is awesome"
good,Sacrifice vs Reward ~ not worth it  Very stressful environment due to work load and rude customers every now and then. Culture is awesome though. People that work there usually get along and that’s what helps the days be more bearable.
good,"If you like fast paced and problem solving along with helping patients, then this is for you.  Paid breaks, and benefits for full time employees. Improve pay and you may get more staffing."
good,The pay is not fair for all the work you do and the stress you are put under. I have worked here for a year and the only thing that keeps me here are their benefits.
good,"It is so important for a team to work TOGETHER and exemplify what it means to be PURPOSE-DRIVEN. I found there to be more selfishness amongst management and team members which led to conflicts. Communication is essential in the development of the company. Hierarchy is exaggerated when the behaviors and capabilities are unaligned. I worked as if I was 5 people and when I needed help it wasn’t offered freely. I need to be supported with my ideas and vision whether I cashier or manage. I believe in caring, inspiring, and working together."
good,"Depending on the store, employees and management this can be a fun place to work employees are friendly and helpful. According to what your looking for it can be a good career for you."
good,Good overall company if the store manager or district manager is doing a good job but they tend to hire people at busy months and not be able to give them hours when it's a non holiday month.
good,"I loved the customers and regulars, and employees, I learned a lot of new things about products around cosmetics, I stocked on a daily and handled cash."
good,"A hardworking environment with typical retail experiences, on a much higher volume.  Many managers and employees, though due to call ins, seem low staffed compared to the workload."
good,"Walgreens paid for my certification. Despite the job environment being stressful and our store being understaffed, it was a worthwhile introduction to the pharmacy technician position. I hope to take what I learned there and apply it to my next job."
good,"My job required me to take prescriptions from patients, verify that the prescriptions were valid, and then type them for the pharmacist to review. I would then find the medication and fill it. It would late be sold to the patient. It was also my responsibility to manage the order and return of drugs to and from the pharmacy. I enjoyed working in a medical setting and learning new things often, however, my job was often difficult due to lack of help from my coworkers. I believe that the pharmacy could have had happier customers and been more proficient had everyone worked together instead of me and one other employees doing the majority of the daily tasks."
good,"Overall the experience of working at Walgreens has proved to be more taxing than initially thought.  The atmosphere is always rushed, customers are rude, there is little to no room for advancement.  Skills and/or education are not recognized and pay increases are few and far between."
good,This was alright while in school. The hours were really flexible and I had accumulated a lot of vacation days. I would recommend this for someones first job.
good,"I just need to fill up this text box with a minimum of one hundred and fifty characters. Therefore, i am continuing to write all of this nonsense so i may proceed to the next page"
good,It’s a nice company to work for but your hours get cut you form a bond with customers it’s not a fast paced environment but it’s not slow either and your working with a team
good,Working as an assistant manager at Walgreens was pretty simple. You are basically a stock associate who is responsible for customer complaints and all returns.
good,"Walgreen's is a good company, its just now that they have a new CEO the company seems to lack compassion for its employees. Otherwise I enjoyed working for the company."
good,the culture has changed since that time. it is nolonger the same. the company is trying to adjust to newer times and has recently aligned with Boots Inc.
good,most people get burnt out fast. It is not for most people. It is good if you only want to be a front cashier. Leadership is giving too much with little staff.
good,"Fast paced, multi-tasking environment."
good,"Depending on your location and team, it can be tolerable or it can be a nightmare. It is customer service based, so that is a major factor in what you will experience. If you are not a people person, you will likely not enjoy it."
good,"great place to work, nice cowrokers, great customers challenging work environment lots of variety great coworkers busy all the time time went fast every day"
good,"Our store was extremely busy, so i feel as if my experience may not reflect everyone's. It was fast-paced and time went by fast most days. Training is VERY boring, you will be reading very awful lessons and watching low-quality videos on a computer for several hours your first couple weeks. Best part is that every time they update, everyone is required to take the lesson again."
good,"i learned how to stock the shelfs, it really wasnt anything hard about the job. i was on he casheir most of the time ,but i was also cleaning as well."
good,It’s a good 1st job stepping stone I got promoted my 2nd year there just so your best. Show that you can learn quick and you’ll be ok. That’s all I can say
good,It was okay management just sucked. No one wanted to see the next person succeed. A lot of snarkiness went on behind the scenes. Other than that it was a decent place to work.
good,its was fun workin there had alot of experience with cashier talk to alot of people thru oyt the day every comprehensive had to stock shelve unload delivery truck cashier associate
good,This position varies a lot from store to store. If you have a good store manager that understands that you have a life outside of work it can be good. Corporate employees do not really do a lot to help the stores.
good,"Trusted since 1901. Nice coworkers, flexible working locations and hours. Be prepared for constant changes from strategic focus to organization structure."
good,the pay was not enough for everything that i had to do. loved the people i worked with. they were the reason i stayed as long as i did. i earned less than what i though i should for all the work and traing i did for the other techs
good,The work place was very slow paced. The management team were very poorly handled. I learned how to take care of customers need and how to please them with my service.
good,"We are overworked, stretched thin and not getting paid for the many different hats me and my former coworkers wore. The Store Manger never would come out to help us with anything. He would also change the rules because he didn't want customers to call Cooperate and complain even though he knew we were doing our job"
good,My job was ok working there I worked in the photo lad and in the cos department . There was a lot of cut  Throat going on. So it stressed me out and I just started getting sicker and sicker.
good,A typical day at Walgreens was filling prescriptions and dealing with customers that assumed their medicine should be ready in less than five minutes everytime they called it in. The management was great. The hardest part of the job was when the pharmacy would get busy and the most enjoyable was interacting with customers all day.
good,"I ran the cash register upfront so dealing with customers was not a issue, i had a well rounded staff, we all went out of our way to make sure shoppers were pleased. Plenty hours to obtain there."
good,"The district manager was very judgemental and vindictive. But the store atmosphere was great. Selling Flu shots was awful and forced upon us. Other than that, it was good."
good,At walgreens I was constantly busy with too may customers and not enough staff to serve them. I liked the people I worked with and we all did what w could with our resources but it was tough. Walreens made a hard rule of no overtime and there we just not enough people and time to get the work done.
good,It was a great work environment. There were a lot of great benefits to working there. It was a fast paced environment and I loved my regular customers.
good,The job had its ups and downs but I would recommend someone to work there. The job has its challenges but it can be avoided. I will say some of the pharmacist tend to over step their authority
good,"I would recommend them for someone that is in College or just needs some extra money, because the pay is pretty low, but not a bad place to work. They offer great benefits."
good,A nice place to work depending on who the store manager is.The staff is very friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the rude customers. Working there will teach you to have patience.
good,"I enjoyed meeting the new people and assembling the end caps. My co-workers were really nice and polite. There were even times where we would all gather outside of work together for fun and entertainment. The hardest part of this job was being the photo technician due the film processing machine being a bit older than the new ones at other stores, which often times caused a delay in productivity and caused customer inconvenience. The most enjoyable thing about this job was the hands on experience, the customers, the staff, and being able to have the essential tools and training to generate sales as well."
good,"Help costumer around the store, ring up costumer ideas, help in the photo lab, help in the phamary. Talk to my customers about anything, help customers who need help shopping around the store."
good,"I worked as a pharmacy intern at Walgreen through Fitzgerald High School. A normal day at work seemed really fast paced and sometimes stressful because of incoming patients, and calls. I have learned a lot of good skills in customer service such as filing prescriptions, operating drive-thru, working at the register, picking up calls, stocking new medications, and registering patients into intercom plus. The work place itself was really interactive, everyone helped each other out when there was a problem involving a patient, overall the employees were really helpful."
good,"Job required employee to spend 3 hours and 45 minutes of shift giving all employees lunches and breaks (including myself) and you had to stay in your zone while giving others breaks. Management often had to cover for me in photo which wasn't a desirable outcome on their end, but it couldn't be helped due to the structured nature of the position duties. Photo clerk was the manager's right-hand person for special projects & stocking. The job also entailed maintaining to freezers and coolers."
good,the company just bought 2100 rite aid stores and wull soon complete the transfer of all stores in the spring. the size of the company will greatly increase
good,Good place to grow if you are a new worker but it's all about location. It's a great place to work. You can move to pharmacy if you have managements support
good,It was a typical retail job. It's worth noting that the training was somewhat driven at your own pace. You work the register and then also maintain the selling area.
good,"Had to work every holiday, even thanksgiving and christmas morning. Was not fair some employees did not have to work any holidays."
good,While I was there the store I was at needed at least two more employees but they said we couldn't hire anymore and we were short handed enough that at least one person was having to work 9 days in a row and then have one day off the work another 4 or 5 days. It was exhausting.
good,I have no complaints about the job. I do think supervisors are underpaid for the work they do. They put in a lot of work for barely over minimum wage.
good,"In the time I worked there, I had 5 different Supervisors. There was never anyone to help assist if there was a question that needed to be answered. All employees were bounced around to different queues. Very unorganized operation."
good,"Working at Walgreens was a great experience for customer service. I was a photo specialist, stock boy, cashier, and all around store operations staff. It was nice to help customer's and learn how to become a photo specialist developing photos. Stocking merchandise can be cumbersome but it's part of the job. Being a cashier kept you on your toes, and helped you interact with the customers. Great experience."
good,ended up working in 2 different departments for the same pay. at the time minimum wage was 7.25 an hour. not enough to suppport ones self aloe. needed to work two jobs at once.
good,Walgreens is a very quick paced pharmacy. Especially since it has changed from a 24 hour pharmacy. The other coworkers are fantastic but not the managerial staff.
good,"Price changes when sales were going on. Enjoyed helping customers in the beauty department. Enjoyed helping customers in the photo lab department, printing pictures in person or off the website."
good,"I worked the day shift which started at 7 am. My day started on the register where I would greet and cash out customers. I would cover the register on Sundays and breaks during the week. Otherwise I was on the floor, stocking, facing, and unloading trucks to the warehouse. With customer service being the key. Scan out / out dated products, marking sale items. Being sure that all the correct tags were posted during the sale week. Keeping the store clean and clear of debris, collecting carriages outside and bringing them in. Assisting where it was needed. Customer first!"
good,"Long hours, short staff, no supervision, need to care about employees, low pay, no benefits, no lunch, irregular weekly work hours, must give flu shots on own time."
good,learned how to properly manage employees. how to deal with different types of people and different attitudes as well. also learned to be dependable and reliable.
good,"The people I worked with were nice, my customers were nice, I loved my job but I was part time and I couldn't survive on part time hours so I had to find a full time job."
good,"If you are the type of person who is okay with doing nothing all day, then this is the job for you. I worked at the register, which meant i had to stand there for an entire 8 hour shift. I didn't like that. Although, sometimes it can get fast-paced, especially if there are a lot of customers in the store. There are different work areas (Photo Lab, Pharmacy and Cosmetics), which are pretty busy as well."
good,"Need excellent customer service skills to work in this retail market"
good,During this internship I was able to obtain management experience by being an assistant manager in a local store. This internship taught me how to lead a group of people through delegation and teamwork.
