bad,"it was the worst experience in my life, the management was not great, they did not care about people working there. unprofessional! there were a lot of people leaving at the same time"
bad,"Worked here for nearly 7 years. Managers main focus is the customer's needs regardless of how they've treated the employee. The employees do not matter to the higher ups. Safety is a strong issue. Customers may be abusive to employees without any repercussions from the company. They even have a policy where if a customer hits you, you're not allowed to defend yourself. There's no room for advancement. There's only one position so no promotion. The managers constantly demand you do things against company policy to save money. For example, employees are not to clear units full of abandoned goods and are to request a vendor to do work. However, managers constantly use the excuse that the work would exceed the budget and tell employees to clear them or risk being fired. All around terrible place to work."
bad,Bad job hiring manager fake n will fire you without proper steps watched her fire multiples. They don't pay enough for rats an spiders n mold everywhere
bad,You could have the number 1 store in the nation and noone would know or care. You are only as good as your last months numbers. And you are forbidden to be anything other that a store manager if you are in a store. You don't want to work here. Ever....
bad,Would not recommend this company to anyone. Mostly worked by myself. Incompetent coworkers who cared less. DM was inefficient and had too many personal issues and never cared about day to day issues and had favorite workers . No work life balance. Wasted my time here
bad,"No room to grow and you are under paid for what they expect you to do on a day to day basis while being single staffed and trying to help customers, tenants, answer phone calls, make late delinquent calls and reservation calls within the first 10 mins they pop up on your screen"
bad,Very dishonest upper managment and extremely decietfull practices.Not a good company to work for.Would not recommend this place to anyone.Not to rent from or work for.
bad,"Public Storage lies to you as soon as they hire you. They will lead you to believe there's room for advancement and pay raises, none of this is true! You get hired at cap on both. Unless you want to live on property in an apartment they provide but your wage will be dropped by a minimum of $2/hr. They tell you they are all about positive reinforcement, but all you hear is what doing wrong. you're"
bad,The district manager is racist she only likes the african american employees an favors them. Time off requests were never met an the other employees are rude an stuck up. Very poor customer service people.
bad,I quit recently from PS and my whole experience was shoving merch to new customers and hustling for reviews..there isn't much growth here..and the bi/weekly pay will keep you in more debt
bad,"This company does not care about their employees, pay is low, have high turn over rate due to  all the BS you put up with, benefits are terrible, insurance is not good very high deductible 5,000. I would never recommend this place to anyone working or storage"
bad,It's an Easy job. Terrible DM/RM. no growth. No one cares. Your just a body. The pay is terrible. My expectations for this job were to high. It's just a meantime job.
bad,"Sucks. Customers are very agressive because no one in upper management can get any help approved by this cheap *** company, so they pay property managers min wage to get screamed at instead of them."
bad,"If you wanna work for a company where you are paid to sit on your butt this job is perfect for you. This company plays favorites, you get underpaid, the district manager sucks and plays favorites with his employees. They offer on site living, but it's just a trap to get you to continue to work for them. They hold it over your head. It's just all around a bad company to work for."
bad,"It's all sales. Selling $20 locks that people know they can get a 2 pack if same at home Depot for $8. Always pushing to sell. Whose buying boxes at $4 a piece? Nobody, that's who. Pressure constantly to sell, sell and sell. Then days if collections calls. Honestly wouldn't recommend if someone was desperate. MGMT "
bad,If u have no bills live at home with parents have no kids this is the perfect job for u the pay is horrible just $10hr even for property manager yup that‚Äôs right everyone is paid the same this is the worst job to have if looking to have a future buy house start kids college fund etc... upper management wants U to sell sell sell but for $10hr not going to put in the extra effort
bad,They are the lowest paying storage company and not organized at all too much drama within the work place management can't handle his crew stressful work environment my blood pressure stayed up I quit was not fired so be aware and stay drama free
bad,Too many tasks and no tools to complete them. All they care about is money even if it means you have to lie to customers. Theycouldn't even provide us with drinking water. We had to buy or own just to stay hydrated when they wanted us to clean everyday outside.
bad,"I was an employee and had to put my stuff in storage and rats destroyed my things and they refused to do anything about it, all they care about is their numbers your family events are not important to them, the  upper management is racist."
bad,The only good thing is you work alone. You‚Äôll do more cleaning than anything. Management wants you to move hazardous items to save money for their end of the year bonus. Most locations if it‚Äôs an outdoor location will have rodents and the insurance company does not pay so you‚Äôll get cursed out by customers. Lowest paying storage company!!
bad,"It‚Äôs an okay job if you are just starting out for college students, graduates or new to the employment force. No promotions and they are not fully honest with what they tell you during the interview to get you to accept the offer. High employee turn over rate. As a long term employment this is not one to consider as the pay is low, you will make the same as a new hire coming in."
bad,"Do not apply for Public Storage, they lie to you to get you hired so they have a ""body"" to open and close a store. Your job description is you will do everything for a low wage. You are not just renting units and collecting payments you will clean property which means picking up trash, diapers, dead and live RODENTS, human FECES left around the property and clean dirty rest rooms all by yourself. I won't recommend Public Storage, if you want to work for a storage company at least go somewhere else with better pay. If you're lucky you will get a 5 cent raise from Public Storage."
bad,"Have multiple job titles for little pay "
bad,Management suck and no advantage with the company a lot of favoritism  u don‚Äôt want to work for this company  they don‚Äôt pay u enough for the work you do
bad,No room to move up and u don‚Äôt get raises for anything . Pay stays the same . Customers were horrible to you . Dealt with crazy homeless people that would lock u in the office and dms wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it . I had a guy tell me he could kill me and lock me in a unit and no one would know. Upper management did nothing about it so I quit .
bad,"Public Storage Do not explain how much they want you to clean . I dont mean just sweeping and mopping . Keep in mind they want you to clean out people abandoned storages. Basically your a Sales men , Bill collector , most of all janitor! Other then that it cool with hours and cool for a  minimum wage job if you need something fast."
bad,"Public Storage doesn‚Äôt give raises, no career advancement, this job is for young adults that still lives with parents.Your job title requires you to do various multiple tasks but doesn‚Äôt offer any raises nor bonuses and starting pay remains the same over time;district managers receive all the bonuses and praise for your hard work"
bad,Company is completely unorganized and pays employees terrible wages while demanding you do a lot. Completely scams customers out of there money by offering deals while not advising them of fees.
bad,"They are all about selling merchandise to the customer. They and you omit the fact insurance is an option. Instead of saying its just an option they call it a ‚Äùrequirement‚Äù. When in actuality they do not have to get it.You have to get customer to buy their over priced merchandise if you do not get a certain percentage of customers to buy merchandise, insurance, and their overpriced lock; you're going to go on probation then your job will be put on the line. It's not worth the stress honestly. "
bad,I will just say this. I worked too hard there to financially struggle the way I did. Horrible management. Senior district Manager is ABSOLUTE TRASH! Talks down to employees instead of to employees. I hated working there and I was glad when I got firedüòä
bad,"*Improved the operational systems, processes and policies in support of organization‚Äôs mission. "
bad,"It‚Äôs a call center that you read a script to potential customers. There is no paid holidays even though you will work them, and vacation accrual sucks. You get 5 days off a year. Also no yearly pay increases, so new hires make as much as the people who have been here 9 years. Bonus is good but very few hit the high numbers. Trust no one, everyone gossips and leadership lies to your face but keep a paper trail to fire people. Oh and you are subject to automatic OT added to your schedule. "
bad,"Horrible place to work Racist management, gossiping and condescending. Have no regards for parents or kids. Dangerous and unsafe at times due to low security."
bad,"Was awesome working at public storage at first. Was fired for accepting a 5$ tip read employee handbook you can accept gifts up to 200$ value. When discussed with manager she said she knows the handbook they act like they care about you. "
bad,"The worst job ever. These people don't even care about their customers let alone their employees."
bad,Only way I would recommend this job if you need a place to live. They don‚Äôt drug test and you will become a salve. Run from this job! Don‚Äôt work here at all! I slaved here for 6 years and there is no promotions no raises nothing.
bad,"You have to amake collection calls, rent units, clean units, mop floors, diamond shine, auctions, pick up trash and furniture customers dump also rats are everywhere mold. Customers verbally attack you and physically."
bad,They dont pay enough for all the work you do. Conference calls every week. Have to be like a robot. No raises or bonuses. If you have an apartment and they did a cost of living pay increases you dont get it. They would rather pay people on YouTube to make videos then pay employees.
bad,"Everything about the job is terrible They expect the most amount of work to be done with the least amount of pay. They don't give raises or bonuses. The only bonus we get is a x-mas bonus which is added onto your paycheck and is taxed along with your hourly pay. This company is owned by the cheapest billionaires EVER! They expect to clean a disgusting a property from the inside & out.The maintenance work is bad enough for the company to pay a vendor. We don't get paid enough to clean built up dirt on doors/floors, sweep dead mice and deal with disrespect from the tenants. The company itself does not care about their employees. They offer on site living but it is not worth it. The hourly pay won't go over $12.50/hr. Never worked for a company that cared so little for their employees."
bad,Manager don‚Äôt know how to manage he lets his employees cuss and fight each other lack of communication and some employees steals money the stores where you work or horbile.
bad,This is worst place to work if you have some Integrity. They are money hungry. The place is ran down they don‚Äôt fix nothing. No raises or bonus the dms are terrible they ask for a lot and don‚Äôt pay nothing. u robbing the poor. They make you sell merchandise and $20 locks. It‚Äôs horrible I tell you
bad,I didn't care working for this company it was very unprofessional and the compensation was very low.   I personally didn't care for the setting or the work atmosphere.
bad,"This job sucks terribly, this is the kinda job you get when you desperately need some type of income the pay sucks the district managers treats employees terribly"
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs I have ever had. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here. There is tons of cleaning, working outside in the heat during the summer and in the cold in the winter. The pay sucks too much work not enough pay. Management only cares about themselves. The customers are out of line, hard to deal with, and go above your head to complain to the DM. There was no enjoyable part of this job. You also have to sell merchandise with (no commission). If you do not sell merchandise or get social media reviews you'll end up on a conference call about not selling any merchandise and end up having to role play. Everyone is required to work on the weekends (except the DM's) which is a big inconvenience for those who have children."
bad,"Having the title of manager is the most you will get out of this company.  You are not able to have availability, you work the hours and days they give you, and the payrate is really low."
bad,"If I could rate this company -100000 I would . This is the first time I have ever left a review for a company I have worked for. I feel like it's important for other people to know what they are getting themselves into . Public Storage is a money hungry company. They do not care anything about their employees. This is a billion dollar company and only pay u 10.50 a hour . If u choose to get a apartment with them u get 8.50 a hour . If you are a relief manager u have to travel pretty much every day to different properties . Now if u are working with a property manager it's a high chance that your district manager could call u to travel to another property. If somebody has called out and u are a relief manager the district manager will ask u or another relief manager to go to that property . This company is 2 cheap to allow to people to work together . I can't even describe the amount of work that is done . I worked for the company for 2 years and 1 month and I highly regret it . Once I became a property manager it was 100 times worse . You have to open the store , handle cash , check , credit debit card payments , collection calls , cleaning the office and bathroom . You also have to check the property twice a day clean units do monthly auctions with your district manager . You also have to do a monthly unit inventory which pretty much means u have to print out a list for all the units and the information have to match the paper . Also do a merchandise inventory, counting all the merchandise , and a unit audit . A unit audit just means everything that is wrong with the property"
bad,"Fairly easy job with basic benefits, but the company has unethical tactics to push services that are not required, employees are expected to travel for work but are not compensated appropriately, extra titles given without pay raise, and there is no advancement towards upper management. Living on property is a nice perk, but not much work/life balance and you are expected to act as extra security with no compensation other than cheap living. The job feels like incorporated welfare."
bad,"When renting the space at Public Storage, after the space unit agreement process, manager inform that Insurance purchase is required and presented to make selection, somewhat enforcing this selection as it is required, but by agreement on a certain section and clause related to insurance, states 'it is not required', this makes customer frustrated and conflict information of manager's statement.  Therefore, it seems that Public Storage is enforcing to tell lies about insurance facts."
bad,This company only cares about its bottom line. Employees give up bonuses as pay for living on the property. They don't care about their customers that have rented at their properties. Raising rent every 6 months.
bad,"Worst business environment I've ever worked in the past 30 years! Call center is located in former storage space where the are no ceiling panels or drywall. Dozens of industrial size air conditioning units sit directly over the employees' heads, and sound like huge bombs and wind tunnels when they go off and on throughout the day. You get a headphone and a computer. That's it. If you need office supplies like file holder, tape, scrap paper or a paper clip, you must bring your own. They change the bonus structure AFTER the month is over so you never know what you're actually earning. Employee turnover is huge, except for a select group of long term employees. They don't care. It keeps the people in training department busy, training class after class. As soon as they hit the sales floor, most are gone within first 6 months. Dirty floors, dirty/smelly bathrooms and break room. Do not recommend."
bad,"This company makes billions, and still dont properly compensate property and relief managers. They put so much pressure on selling their insurance (that's not even required) and merch and make you feel like you arent doing your job when you don't. I consistently have top numbers in my district, but I am stressed all the time from it, cause has soon as I get an insurance miss, I know I'm gonna get yelled at about it (even though it's not required and a customer can use their own insurance). With managing the property, you're the customer service rep, bill collector, exterminator, maintenance person, maid and repairman, all for 10 bucks an hr (in Houston area). You get to get yelled at by customers about their rent increases, that come from corporate, the script they tell us for that is to say, the rent is raised to help take care of property, when in reality most of these properties are run down. Obviously, the increases are so they can build more props, make more money, that they arent going to pay us with. There's also no chance of advancement. We are literally at the bottom position, this company has no respect for the ones that make them the money. It's a good 1st job fulltime, if you're trying to get back on your feet, and gain work experience, but as soon as you do, find something else."
bad,"For public storage to be such a huge company they pay their managers the lowest out of all storage companies.  The District Managers and regional managers has to be the ones making all the money because they only start you out with $9 and they need a new bonus program, but i haven't worked there in almost 7 years so hopefully that has changed."
bad,"You have to drive to the bank everyday,sweep and mop hallways on a daily basis, Clean 5 unit doors a day,Do collections calls (200-600 calls a month) depending time of month,Move in  rental Walk-ins  or Reservations or both.Clean bathrooms everyday,clean units out, get rid of abandon goods left behind(dressers,wet beds etc) maintain building by inspecting pipes everyday and check every single room.  NO raise. 30 min lunch break. All for a grand total of $25,000 a year. You do the math lol"
bad,Prompt and efficient Courier Driver with 6 years of incident-free pick up and delivery. Extensive trip planning geography and package handling knowledge.
bad,"Horrible place to work. I No security, poor management. No room for advancement. They tell you when you can take time off. HORRIBLE. All management cares about is numbers."
bad,If you want to be yelled at from morning til night by unhappy tenants than this is the job for you! Trainers are a joke. Gossip like children. Half the staff. Are drug addicts
bad,I did not enjoy working there. It was a temporary job. Management was hard to work for. There was lack of promotions. They did not have your best interest at heart.
bad,Lighting was a big problem and still is.  For the amount of rent they collect they do not keep up the properties.  The manager and assistant can only be out of office 15 minutes and double coverage is a joke.
bad,This job is cut Throat !! the company demands turnover and if you don't comply your employment will be terminated. The bonus program is changed thru out the year making difficult to reach
bad,I truly enjoy my co workers.  They help me when I have questions. I really wish they would at least give us raises. That would help a lot. It would make working at Public Storage much easier to deal with. I would be happy with a 50 cent per hour raise.
bad,"Pay is terrible. They don't promote from within. You work every weekend and all holidays except Thanksgiving, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. It's impossible to use your PTO because they are constantly under staffed. They expect you to do $16.00 work for $10.00 an hour or worse if you live on property. They only get paid $8.50 an hour."
bad,They don't allow going from sales in property management to a district manager. Property managers get the most work and stress while district managers work from home and get paid 10x more. It is constant stress on getting more sales. Backbreaking lifting in cleaning out abandoned units.
bad,"This is by far the worst job I have ever worked. They DON'T have ""free"" live on for property managers (PM's) they charge $300/month (which is cheap and still cool) but it isn't free. I don't know about other district managers but my first DM would go out and party with coworkers; people she was the boss of- completely unprofessional. On her days off she would be at a PM's house just hanging out, she even babysat a relief managers newborn whenever she was off. Just overall completely unprofessional. When I transferred districts the new DM was so lazy, he didn't do anything at all. We would have to run errands (like getting key cuts) and run to other properties to get toilet paper, or boxes, things that weren't our job or in the job description. This particular DM wanted me to work at a property where very terrible things happened. (Everytime I list what happened indeed doesn't let me post the review) i have medical conditions and can work at any property besides that one. (in this district there were 10 properties we worked at...) We had stupid scripts we had to read from PS has you violating laws left and right (forcing new tenants to get insurance when BY LAW it is NOT required and the brochure says it's NOT required) opening tenants units if there was no lock on it.. just as a whole NOT a good company to work for."
bad,"A typical day was coming in printing out the morning paperwork, making calls, lock checks, keeping property clean taking calls as well as making call,bank runs from previous days payments.At end of day was making sure petty cash was correct and closing out the end of day paperwork."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Very unorthodox environment. Have worked here and never seen anything good! The only thing I can say is that we have great customers and we had convenient locations to accommodate them. Never received 0.50 cent raise after 6 months. Started with a team player attitude with a team that just didn't like each other. There is no chance for growth because there is only 2 positions (Property Manager) high position, (Relief Manager) Low position. Relief manager goes to all properties within district meaning property to property kinda allot for little pay! When I was there the district manager evaluated the property manager position off how long they were there not off performance???? So if there's a person who's been there longer they are probably going to be the one at the all at district I worked."
bad,"High turnover! The manager , relief manager and district managers are always quitting ! They really don‚Äôt value you as an employee! The pay  minimum wage when at first it wasn‚Äôt! You get 30 minute breaks and all work is left up to you! Make calls , clean property , clean bathroom (which consists of fetuses) rent units fix certain things that might break, etc"
bad,"Worse place to work.. All they care about is lining their pockets.. they took all bonuses away and expect you to do even more work at minimum wage.  "
bad,"Most stressful job I ever had...I was there for only a week before I was left running 2properties alone. "
bad,The complete lack of management involvement was repulsive. The only time they were involved is when they saw an opportunity to gain advancement. The work loads were off balanced and the requirement to meet was unobtainable.
bad,"one of the worst companies I have ever been a part of. you are not paid fairly for the amount of work you do. you are told to basically lie to customers to get insurance sells. they force merchandise sales down your throat, and promise bonuses. the bonuses work out whoever the dm decides to get the bonus at the end of the year, and if your not there favorite you get $0"
bad,Overworked under paid stressful as ever. You better have thick skin to deal with the crazies that need storage units. No work life balance. no room to move up in the company.
bad,"Glendale corporate people are horrible especially HR don't bother"
bad,The room for growth is 0. thy pay you a standard rate of 12 dollars. nothing more nothing less even though their competitors start at 14. they make you read scripts that dont work and have you to hit irrealistic numbers. worst job ive ever had
bad,They Do Not Care About Their Employees. The Stores Were Getting Robbed And They Had No Security. And They Fired Ppl For Not Wanting To Get Hurt Over Money.
bad,"Probablly the worst company I have worked for. Empty promises, low pay and constantly being threatened of being fired. Hard to get days off, split days off and con list is crazy long. I have witnessed employees of 10 + years get fired without notice. Companies that are always hiring is a red flag and this is one of them."
bad,"management is horrible, they don't care about their employees. They expect for the employees to do so much work and not compensate the employees, do not even acknowledge the good work."
bad,"I worked there for 15 years and then new management came in MANY high profile executives but no advancement for the ""lotto"" people.  Only more work cut in benefits every year and most importantly not even a thank you .... VERY SELFISH PLACE AND SO MICROMANAGEMENT!!!"
bad,This job is a rip off its one of the lowest paid storage company. They want the employees to do waaaay to much work for the little money they make. No room for advancements at all. They tell the employees that getting insurance on the storage unit is not mandatory but penalize the employees if the customer does not want there insurance. Beware this job is bogus!!!
bad,This is the lowest paying self storage in the world but they are the biggest self storage in the world. They expect so much for you to do but pay you little and treat you like nobody. They only care about renting units scripts and selling merchandise reservations. This is a sad company. Will fire you if you fail a mystery shop. You have to clean units deal with crazy customers you do everything with lil pay. They always hiring because people always quitting! You better off applying for another storage company that pays you more and don't do half of the work you do here. Everything is scripted. It's not worth it for the pay!The company is selfish they treat the face of the company like nobody's!
bad,"I ran the green valley property for 3 1/2 years. I double merchandise sales. Met all quarterly goals such as merchandise, locks, occupancy, rentals. I lived on property and made multiple improvements. I cleaned it up removed spiders and webs increased sales and customer satisfaction. ."
bad,The company only cares about making money and can care less about there employees. its  like a revolving door over there people just get hired and fired or leave within a month.
bad,"Public Storage requires a lot of physical work, and has an upper management team that that is more interested in setting goals for the employees that are near impossible, with very little if any recognition"
bad,"Public Storage has to be the greediest company there is. They will suck every single penny out of these customers, and if you try and defend the customers the DM says something stupid like ""well why do you care it's not like the money's coming out of your pocket"". Excuse me for trying to do what's right for these people who've rented here for 15 years and are paying $800 for a 10x30 that's going for half that for new customers plus a dollar promo on the first month. The dollar promo by the way is actually a scam, you'll be paying at least $25. The admin fee went up from $22 to $24 in the year I worked for them. And they need to take insurance and a lock. So the $1 promo will total to about $58. I'm always embarrassed when I have to tell them the total. What does the admin fee even do, we don't see a dime of that money. They make you work everyday by yourself, literally doing the work of 2 or 3 people so they can only pay you for the work of 1 person. I was miserable every day. If the DMs aren't treating you like garbage then the customers are. ""We'll treat your stuff like its our stuff."" Please. There were leaks in the ceiling that ruined people's items and it took forever just to get the work order approved to fix the leak, and then you get an alert for having a unit on maintenece for too long. And have to answer questions from your DM like What can you do to prevent this from happening in the future? They have conference calls about getting social media reviews and put so much pressure that you just ask your friends to do it to get them off your back. They make you follow"
bad,"There is some major reasons that this company has major turnover issues. Low pay, no hope for advancement, and a constant fear of getting fired over not reaching ridiculous goals."
bad,Shady business tactics. Micromanaging district managers. Low pay. No weekends off. No bonus' or commission. This company has no pride in itself and only cares about profit.
bad,Don't give your time to this god-awful organization. They will suck your life then terminate you if you or your spouse get sick. They fired me and threw me and my now departed wife and 2 small kids in the street shortly after wife's diagnosis of breast cancer.
bad,This company says they care... They left a few words out...they care only about money and sales. They lure you in with false promises of bonuses and job security. Don't believe it!
bad,"It is all about the numbers. They are looking for robots on the phone. They will get upset if you vary from the script in anyway. Was a basic 9-5 job to pay bills,  no room for improvement"
bad,Typical day at work consisted of being outside or in the office taking care of sales. I learned about leasing. Management was horrible too much favoritism. Co-workers were nice. Hardest part of the job was dealing with stupidity and gossip. I enjoy the work schedule.
bad,never in my life have I ever worked for a company with such an un realistic Job description. These people literally want you to manage a property all by yourself on most days for terrible pay. Between having to clean and weed the property constantly you also have to deal with very rude customers there is no room to grow in this company at all !! and they will work you like a horse ! this job is not even worth the free apartment which isn't actually free so don't believe that mess for a second. STAY AWAY !!!!
bad,"I have applied for work with this company every year I see their ad. I have e-mailed them several times. Can not get a response from anyone. Not even the corporate office. If they treat me like this now, I could not imagine what it would be like to work for them."
bad,"this is the worse company i have ever work for, they don¬¥t pay their worker any money,pile on a lot of work and only give a raise a 22 cent per year"
bad,"Absolute WORST company ever. Micro-managing, and threatening management. Senior leadership makes tons of money but don't pay field team squat. If you like being taken advantage of and in turn taking advantage of your customers, this is the place for you. They're always hiring for a reason!"
bad,"cleaning restrooms and cleaning storage units "
bad,I wouldn't refer anyone to work here.  The upper management doesn't care about their employees.  The bottom line is the money at all costs.  Employees are just a number.
bad,"Poor management, high turnover, very stressful, a lot of responsibility with no regard for compensation for work ethic and poor benefit coverage for field employees."
bad,"If you like making minimum wage, and being treated like garbage this is the job for you. Management doesn't support you on anything, you often deal with people living in units(which I believe is illegal) as long as they pay, people look the other way. Everyday is a nightmare with customers who are mad you sold their stuff or feel their not paying is your fault. You often clean units that were vacated but the tenant decided to leave everything they didn't want. You also work alone so when you are on the property you are greeted with mad people waiting or calling. People were threatened with violence and management didn't do anything. "
bad,"Not only do they refuse to be flexible with life's challenges, you're glued to your seat, told to read a script. There is soo much drama in that environment that even if you try to avoid it you are somehow still sucked in it. The managers don't care about you they just want you to do good so they get paid and if you don't they find ways to fire you on the spot."
bad,I rented storage space for this company-nothing more to review on it.
bad,First job I have had where there was no job advancement. Once a property manager always a property manager. The pay is horrible you get no bonuses or raises. Wasted a year of my life at this job.
bad,"This was a horrible company to work for. You get verbally abused by customers, your manager wants you to call delinquent customers every day, yes every day. Ridiculous. The management staff is highly unprofessional and they think they can push around their reliefs. Very odd hours and they expect you to come to work in a blizzard. Awesome. Biggest mistake was ever working there."
bad,"Lots of responsibility for not a lot of pay. Hourly rate is below industry standard. Constantly changing management and rules. No regard for their employees. Demoted, transferred and harassed when I told them I would be requesting a leave of absence under FMLA. When I wouldn't quit, they fired me with no explanation before I could complete my leave of absence request."
bad,Well we had to start on paperwork and then start cleaning and walk the permitter and my co-workers were great to work with and i did not enjoy this job due to me calling and calling customers.
bad,"typcial day is meeting and greeting customers, renting units, selling packing supplies. i learned how happy i am helping customers, my store was close to the university and that was an experience meeting students and their famlies. i met a few local famous people as well. Like the number one baseball coach."
bad,This company does not care about the fact that we have families
bad,"I have worked for public storage for 2 years I have seen it all. District Managers play favorites. And they pile more work and never increase pay. This is the job where u are over worked and underpaid. This company is profit sharing so DMs get a percentage of everything they don't spend. So nothing ever gets done. I used to be a property manager and my climate controlled building is always hot DM don't wanna fix because it takes away from their pay. A typical day of work is reviewing and notate reservations, rent units, make delinquent tenant calls, you must do your own maintenance, property checks, vacate units, and also complete other assignments the DM comes up with. its a lot of documentation for no cause. Their pockets get bigger why we are stuck with the overwhelming customers and the headache. We raise rent every 6 months and say it's due to the revolving market rate. I got sick to my stomach of working there and taking advantage of customers and decided to quit. I WOULD NEVER EVER RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE NOT EVEN ON MY WORST ENEMY. IF THEY CALL YOU WITH A JOB OFFER RUN LIKE HELL"
bad,"Grueling days- 6 days a week, sometimes seven. management is not very helpful nor caring. i would not recommend."
bad,"rent units , show units, clean units, sign leasing agreements. go over in full detail.. be customer friendly"
bad,This company will do nothing for you.. They think of themselves and do not care what happens to employees or their customers. Do not work here.
bad,management didn't care how well you did. the co- worker and customer was fun to work with.
bad,"Starting off,its SEEMS exciting and new..You come to work ready to get that bonus and work to get that apt and ""Property Manager"" title..and then reality hits...and youre faced with so many scripts that DO NOT help in daily situations THAT U MUST KNOW. Youre also hit with revolving DM's and many policy changes....When it comes to customer service,prepare to NOT tell the whole truth...prepare to PUSH for Google reviews,insurance and high priced locks. Bonuses..yeah thats a thing of the past..."
bad,"I know their number one in the industry, stock well over any of the self storage companies and yet the pay is a joke, management is a joke, customers seem to get what ever they want and you can't count on a good bonus. If you're not looking for a good future then this is the job for you. Hell McDonald's pays better!"
bad,"My district manager called all of his employees names on a daily basis, as did the managers of the individual stores. The pay was and still is terrible, the benefits offered even worse."
bad,This company was the nightmare of my work experience. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. My co-workers were great to work with as a team. Management was not professional. The hardest part of the job was getting through the day. The enjoyable part was leaving the job at the end of the day.
bad,this is the worst job i have ever had. DO not apply to this position.
bad,"This company's upper management are sharks! They pay the hourly store employee's peanuts for their hard work and run them into the ground. The senior executives drive around in their BMW and Mercedes and squeeze the store level employees all the time. THIS PLACE IS A FRAUD - YOU HAVE NO FUTURE HERE. ONE SECOND THEY LIKE YOU, THE OTHER MINUTE THEY PUT YOU ON THE STREET. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN PROMOTING STORE EMPLOYEES INTO ANY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS, THEY DON'T TRUST THEM TO RUN THIS MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS. GO INTO ANY OF THEIR STORES, THE EMPLOYEES ARE UNHAPPY AND UNFRIENDLY. WHO CAN BLAME THEM WHEN THEY HATE WORKING FOR PS????? THIER TOP LEVEL MANAGERS EARN $400K+ ANNUALLY, THEY COULD CARE LESS WHAT THE REAL EMPLOYEES EARN, WHICH IS REALLY JUST PEANUTS!!!! THE DISTRICT MANAGERS ARE JUST ROBOTS WITH NO LEADERSHIP, MANAGERIAL, OR ANALYTICAL SKILLS. THEY JUST FOLLOW MARCHING ORDERS FROM THE TOP, WHICH IS TO SPEND LESS SO THEY CAN EARN BIGGER BONUSES."
bad,"enjoyed working with the cusotmers, solving problems, bring solutions to help them, most of 90% of co-workers were the best mentors and helpful when I first started. hours were not bad. DId earn vacation time and I was off if I needed it."
bad,"Public Storage takes advantage of their employees. There is so much turnover that they can't even property staff their facilities. Management will threaten your job in order for you to produce. Things change daily there, so what the company tells you one day may not be the same as the next. Also, management will tell you to break company policy, and when you follow their directions, they will fire you for it."
bad,"This company is constantly changing and does not permit any weekends off unless you use your PTO time and then you are required to give a reason for using your own time. Out of 365 the company only observes Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day as holiday's. You are a general custodian as well as an office manager. The customer's are the best part of the job. There are no advancements, it is a dead end job. The district manager and staff is constantly stirring up gossip and there is no such thing as confidentiality. You are allowed a 30 minute lunch daily."
bad,"horrible middle management, they will fire you at will"
bad,The district manager is very rude.
bad,"A typical day of work includes all the daily operations and functions of the running the property including cleaning, customer service, tenant management, and managing delinquency. I learned a lot dealing with customer issues and tenant problems, this job has greatly increased my problem solving skills. Management is pretty poor, the company does not promote from within so there is a lot of friction between lower and upper management. My co workers defiantly made the job worth it every day we all were a great team riding the ups and downs together."
bad,District managers lead out of a book and know little of how each property actually functions. they have little knowledge of customer relations and are more interested in forcing employees to learn company scripts which are missleading and direct lies to customers.
bad,They want to keep you in the minimum pay range even if you have experience. The raise is a joke from .10- .25 cents. Other storage companies pay better than P.S.
bad,"I use to work for public storage off and on for 4 years and it has been the worst decision of my life. I was offered an apartment in two states and although it was beneficial; you still end up paying for it in the long run. Public storage is the lowest paying storage facility in the WORLD but they expect you to wear many many different hats. They expect too much out of their employees without"
bad,"As in horrible - all around - to work at and for this ungrateful company. Company is all about how to better ""take shortcuts on this or that"" with their hourly workers AS WELL AS their CUSTOMERS. Not to mention the bogus lies that flow fluidly about anything - including the marketed ""1st month free"" deal. Total BULL."
bad,"This place plays favoritism, especially the customer service department. The supervisor hangs out with certain people going to bars and things, and of course that person is the one who gets the promotion and privileges. You get yearly raises but it‚Äôs .05 to .10 cents a year. If your looking for a job, I would recommend staying away from this place,"
bad,"I worked here for a year it was good till we got a new dm and he was rude unprofessional"
bad,"Honestly, public storage used to be a great company that cared about the customers AND employees, but not anymore. They‚Äôve taken away monthly bonuses, they do not provide the employees with the necessary tools to complete your day to day tasks, they do not hire enough people and employees are being called in on their days off. Upper management does not even follow their own policy  upper management does not back you up when dealing with customers"
bad,"Public Storage is not a bad job is the worst they just want to have one person , working at these commercial buildings or one story storages . Meaning they want you to be the janitor, cashier, answer phones, file , lock check , may I go on. And they dont want pay you at all work you to the bones for $10 and they don‚Äôt give raises been here two years and only received a .20 cent raise and I‚Äôm property manager."
bad,Don‚Äôt work here ! Honestly don‚Äôt waste your time or energy. They make it seem in the interview and first couple of days that it‚Äôll be a way better job than any other. That‚Äôs a lie. These people are liars. They started me off at $xx an hour and keep raising the rate just to get more people in. So many people are quitting because of poor management and being over worked. There‚Äôs people that have been with the company for years and haven‚Äôt gotten a raise in years ! Being a relief manager was the same thing as being a property manager but with more work. The DM was a creep and was always hitting on me and he was just trying to get with different co workers ! It‚Äôs super unprofessional and disgusting especially when he‚Äôs hitting on 18-21 year olds. Not worth it ! Not worth the trouble at all
bad,"Public Storage is a money is everything driven entity to the point it negatively affects both employees and customers. There are few advancement opportunities. One lady worked for them for seven years and received only one pay raise...and it was for five cents more per hour. Properties are run down and have constant  equipment issues. There times you are scheduled for eight days straight, but they make sure it falls in such a way to avoid paying overtime. And there are many times you work alone and usually on the busiest days. There's a constant push to sell merchandise but no commission or reward is given. Its mainly a job you take until you can get a better one."
bad,Public storage is more likely for someone who does not have a life outside of the job. Public storage does not promote within the company only outside of the company and the compensation isn't all that good. Here in the state of Maryland they start you off at $12.00 and it's all a lie far as potential growth. It's more cons than pros with Public Storage.
bad,"Tons of dream selling. Tons of travel required because they never have enough staff to cover locations. They love you when you‚Äôre saying yes but as soon as you say no it‚Äôs a different story. Management is only concerned with sales and google reviews. Only promotion from within is from relief manager to property manager you cannot advance further. Too much work expected for too little pay. Non understanding management, will pressure you into coming to work if you attempt to call out for sickness or any reason. After being there a year and a half I was fired for calling out without sick time, while I had a doctors note. District Manager filed termination paperwork before allowing me to provide doctors note."
bad,"KTP positions and above are all jokes. They favor employees and will ensure to knock down the ones they see ‚Äúagainst‚Äù them. The company presses for sales and reviews without proper reward or commission, acknowledgement will never be enough for those selling. The district managers and above put facades offering their help but when you reach out, it‚Äôs a different story. All everyone does is call compliance and try to get each other fired based on story telling lies."
bad,"Management makes over 70k but you are lucky if you make 20k. They don't care about their employees at all. People who have worked there for years are not making as much as the new people. There are no raises,bonuses, or advancement. And the company will screw you over on your PTO just to not have to pay it out. In general the company will screw you over first chance they get.All they care about are their bonuses so they can take trips to Greece or Paris. If management doesn't like you for whatever reason they will make your life the worse including lying to their bosses about you. Anytime you complain about anything the only response is ""you are lucky to have this"". This job and management are extremely stressful, we have had 3 employees in the last 3 years that have ended up in the hospital for heart issues.They forced another employee to quit cause they refused to pay workers comp. You have to work at different locations within the district and they don't care about what's closer to home or if you have children you need to pick up by a certain time. You have multiple scripts you have to follow word for word. You are forced to get lock,insurance, merchandise, auto pay, and google reviews with each rental. If you do not make your numbers your job is threatened often. For those who smoke you are required to find a small hidden place outside and ""only during your lunch break"". You have to get hall passes to go help with other properties with anything. Your other daily tasks are timed. The other employees are fine for the most part but there are some lying, scheming, caddy children"
bad,"The first district manager I worked with was fantastic. There was communication between management and employees and enough employees that if you needed to call out you could. The second one fired my relief manager and wouldn't allow me to call out sick after working me 20 days straight and threatened me with a write-up if I didnt come in. Twice I was told that I couldn't call out and ended up in the office vomitting under the desk. When I switched districts I was forced into a trainer position and into taking over a property after requesting that I stay a relief due to a recent accident I was in. The amount of stress this has put me through, the fact that I get paid barely over minimum wage and the fact that because the company is based in CA the health benefits on the east coast are a joke leaves me eager to leave and find a company that can appreciate their employees. I enjoy training,  I like the challenge but the turnover is ridiculous. He doesn't hire people before firing so the district is constantly overworked and underemployed."
bad,"If you are looking for a quick job to land this will be the best temporary job, but they do not do any promotions and no raises. I've been working for this company for many years and have used it to advance in school, but it is a dead end job. I say this because if you are striving and a hard worker."
bad,"By far, one of the worst companies to work for. First off, Property Manager is the highest title you will receive.  Your hopes of advancing in the company will be squashed very quickly.  Their benefits are the ONLY benefit you will have. They expect you to sell their ""packing supplies"" and locks, otherwise risk getting written warnings and possible termination if you don't.  They con people into buying their insurance because it's ""required"" even if someone has renters or just refuses.  "
bad,Company pays twice a month. The district manger plays favorites depending on which district. They want you to sell sell sell but you get nothing for it.
bad,"Make sure you've got an IPhone, when your not cleaning gross units you sit behind PP present. doing nothing listening to a trainer gripe about it all."
bad,"This company is all about short-term solutions and cheap shortcuts to screw over their entry-level employees and all of their customers - it's why there's such a high turnover rate and most employees are miserable. It's easy, in that there are specific scripts you must stick to, and there are very specific policies and procedures in place to keep you from making serious errors with customers. Management will promise to schedule the staff a month in advance, but typically the schedule for the following week isn't fully finalized by the Friday-before. Management will leave you out to dry in front of customers and essentially strip you of all power and authority if it costs them a good review (that will reflect on their bonuses). Speaking of bonuses, they took away our bonus incentive program and blamed it on the employees who asked questions like, ""What exactly merits a bonus, and why didn't I receive one for working just as hard as so-and-so?"" Customers are typically difficult, and sometimes you feel like you're scamming them by following company policies (not telling them upfront how much money they should bring for a rental, for one, and sticking with the, ""It only costs $1 for the rent, plus the one-time $24 admin fee!"") We CAN'T tell you that you'll most likely need one of our specialized locks to secure your new unit ($22) or that you're required to have insurance (and in my opinion, it's a complete rip-off). The work itself isn't terribly hard - rent spaces, make collection calls, deal with ornery customers, and do lock-checks to make sure that the property is secure and"
bad,"When it comes to customer service, I would do anything to make the customer feel happy and respected. Then they receive a late charge, or they go into auction, or there is a roof leak and expect a refund, whatever the case may be. When problems happen with the customer or just with the property maintenance, good luck getting in contact with the district manager to get things fixed. District managers don't seem to care about their employees or their customers or their properties until either their boss is coming to visit or there is a corporate walk. Don't get me started on gossip with the employees. You would think that most of us are in the office by ourselves but everyone in the district always has something to say about the next person. DM's need to get it together, especially in this district! Not recommended."
bad,"I enjoyed my coworker she made it bareable. My DM realizing it or not talks down to people. They want you to Sell everything every time or get talked down too. You are expected to pull weeds, pick up trash, clean everything including washing the doors everyday. All for $9.50 an hour. If pay was raised and bonuses were giving for selling merchandise they could keep good employees."
bad,"Horrible place to work...no advancement no job security corporate is only concerned with numbers. Dont perform necessary repairs needed to maintain property or apartment. Live on, patio door had no lock the entire year and a half I lived there."
bad,Working for Public Storage requires physical labor as well as a tolerance for a non-progressive environment. There's no growth opportunities and no real long term career goals below the District Management position.
bad,"Ive never had such a negative experience with a employer before ever. . The training  for starters had 5 supervisors and /trainers for a class of 8 people. It was very overwhelming having 5 people to answer to and being trained by all of them at the same time!.  And then each ov them  would give you conflicting information. . One supervisor would say to do it this way and the next minute the other trainer is telling you thats wrong. The trainers would sit behind you while you took calls all day and this began on my 1st day on the phone.! I was expected to know everyhting from the 1st day ,  Each of them  would crticize everything you did wrong on the call even though it was just the beginning of training and you werent trained yet. . Instead of showing you how to do the job they sit there and tell you what not to say and then coach you all day long. . This happened for at least 6 weeks .All 5 trainers just  micromanage you all day long and harp on everything you did wrong. There was no positive feedback or support.   It was very uncomfortable to have a trainer sit behind me and listen to me take calls all day and tell me everyday all  the wrong things I was doing, It was very emotionally draining. I dreaded going to work  The  trainers would coach me while I was on the phone with the customer, they wouldnt wait until I was off the call. The enviroment was just unprofessional ,very negative and stressful ,I would not recommend"
bad,"I took this job back in 2008 because I had a new baby and needed a job. When I first started it was great! All the employees were like family to me. I also liked the business hour schedule and even though I had to work Sundays it was only 10-2. As time went on I got promoted from relief manager to property manager. The dynamic changed when they decided to make the company more about sales and less about the employes. They did away with our bonus system, our Christmas parties, the raises everything by the time I left a little more than 2 years ago. I hated my job. I hated waking up to go to work. They completely exhaust you. Take everything you have in you and the fire you or force you to quit when you don't make good numbers. The only way to stay around is to be a snitch or brown noser and that is not me. I made it all the way to KTP and a A Property Manager and my pay was so low I still had to have State Issued insurance. This place needs a complete face lift. All they care about is the share holders and the bottom line."
bad,"I woraked for Public Storage in Pensacola Florida for 2 years. The starting salary of $8.50 per hour was tough to live on but I stuck it out to advance to $9.00 per hour. They sell you on the opportunity to make an annual bonus of $3000 but only the top 5% of employees actually achieve this. They set unattainable sales goals expecting you to sell their locKS and insurance to 90% of your rentals. You are also required to sell merchandise to 40% of your rentals. "
bad,"At first it sounded like such a great gig and I went into it with better expectations until you realize it's just like working for any other large corporation. They do not care about their customers or their employees. Every time I would pass one of their "" we treat your stuff like its our stuff "" signs I couldn't help but laugh. I have scene basically every possible bad scenario that could happen to a customer and trust me they don't care about your stuff. Basically the only things they care about is is revenue. This is probably the greediest company I have ever had the displeasure of working for. The biggest focus management had during my time with PS was constantly about merch sales. Which BS oh sorry I mean PS tries to accomplish not by the standard proven methods used by other companies such as selling merchandise at competitive prices or even offering their employees commission for sales. At Public Storage they would prefer to sell merch at such a high mark up rate and use nefarious methods to peddle their products. This is the first sales job I have ever had that actually made me feel embarrassed when working with customers. The merch presentation was basically almost on the verge of harassment. It was a requirement to get at the very least 7 no's from a customer. So if you get a job with them not only will customers see you as being desperate and pushy they also do not give commission on anything. They make you sell by pushing sales numbers down your throat. To make matters worse if it's not the company that is treating you like garbage then it is also the tenants/customers."
bad,Working here was ok. I learned many things from this company selling was the most. The management sucks! Coworkers gossip a lot. Worrying about your job was the hardest part here. Being able to help customers with their needs was the best part of working here.
bad,Management is very unprofessional and unfair to hard working employees.
bad,"I was employed here for a very long time. I managed to work my way up to trainer. Great. That whole 54 cents an hour extra. Woop. I at one point was training for 3 separate districts. They threaten your job if you dont beat your numbers from the previous year and they pay squat. I had an onsite apt at a different site from where I worked and made $7.25 an hour. I couldnt afford anything. The company micro manages. You can get noting fixed without having to email your boss....who emails their boss and so on and so forth. You have to know at least 7 scripts verbatim or you are fired. If you miss one word they scold you and you fail. "
bad,"no room for advancement, this company wants you to clean doors sweep the property take out garbage like you are a cleaning person. DM's dont care about if your property does good one month. And gets upset if you dont meet the goals set for the month. All DM's care about are their bonuses. OAN they took away the bonuses now it's yearly. Why do we have to wait a whole year to get our money?"
bad,"The company has changed significantly in the past five years. One requirement is to learn sales scripts verbatim and sound like a robot when dealing with customers. They call it ""Customer Centric."" I call it impersonal and phony. They continue to whittle away at the bonus structure. Yet another company that values it's owners/investors ahead of the customers and employees. Not my idea of a great company to work for."
bad,BEWARE! There is a reason why PS is always recruiting! The culture is horrible and dishonest. They will NOT promote from within period! I was told by CEO at a conference that he believed managers & DMs did not have the skills needed for advancement. I injuried myself cutting locks for auctions and had limited duty but was told to work anyway by RM. RM fired shortly after I left due to padding his bonus with incorrect reports. If you want no advancement- shifting bonus structures - unsupportive and cheating upper managers- no pay raises - horrible health benefits - PS is the place for you
bad,"In my near 10 year tenure with this company I have endure a lot. I've had manipulative, disrespect managers, been cheated out of SEVERAL bonuses and a prime store location due to favoritism. This company does not know how to treat or pay their employees (at least the ones at store level). Competitors STILL pay more than PS and don't require their employees to do as much as PS. The Competitors have better hours and offers time to be with your families during the holidays. PS is about making their Shareholders happy, period. Remember that, when you apply and agree to work here."
bad,Business on 920 Cortez Rd is spider & rat infested.  Must sell so much merchandise at time of rental.   You have no job security.  Worst place I've worked at.
bad,"Very much a blue collar management position. Out in the elements sawing off locks and drilling over 100 locks per month. You WILL work 7 days per week, as the staff you employ is minimal, and simply struggles to handle the tasks. Your results will be measured daily, and it WILL be thrown in your face if the day before wasn't successful. Facilities is non-existent. Upper management is awful."
bad,"Depending on which location you're sent to depends on how stressful your day is. You have to travel ALOT, you're almost never at the same location. The manager has HIGH favortism wihtin the employees and if one of the favorites dislikes you they find ANY excuse to fire you. Manager is VERY understanding. I had a death within my family and she fired me because I didn't look happy when she was well aware of the situation however when a coworker passed the entire company shut down to mourn."
bad,"You only get paid twice a month on the same days there. You have to go outside and clean, rent to customers, and do a lot of other just and the pay isn‚Äôt great. The district managers are evil and there‚Äôs no growth in the company. You do all this work for little bit of pay. They tell you that relief and property manager is the same thing but both get paid the same thing and do the same job"
bad,I worked for the company close to 5 years. They use and abuse you until you cannot take it anymore. I was with company for close to 5 years and only made .50cents more than a new person. Do not work here!
bad,"It is your duty to run the entire property more often than not you will be by yourself all day. You take customer's payments, trouble- shoot customer issues, sale merchandise, and clean the property."
bad,Lack of proper leadership.  Property managers and new hires get same pay.  Required to sell insurance when not necessary.  Lack of positive feedback.  Not always able to get breaks.
bad,"Worst hours,non full disclosures of bonuses up front,they pay same as car dealers,they rob money from units renters,they do double billing,repetitive job,filthy,disgusting office in a warehouse, noisy.headset and computer sucks,they make start at a strategic date in which it will take you two months to see your first bonus. No perks,supplies,employee  decent benefits,nobody talks to nobody,you are chained to a 3 foot wide cubicle,grotesque.  STAY AWAY"
bad,You high up management look at the your a dime a dozen and doesn‚Äôt care about anything but them selves. You wok all holidays but thanksgiving and Christmas and you don‚Äôt get holiday pay either that‚Äôs a joke.  Also you have to learn all 12 of the scraps and sound like robots. You never can get holidays or weekends off but upper management does get holiday pay
bad,"when company was sold is seem like the new company was always looking for a way to replace employees from the company that was bought. after over seeing a number of different location. and working with no staff, I trained a employee for six months the district manager came in and said was was not needed anymore."
bad,"had to travel a lot before getting situated on one property, even then I was still required to help other properties, which was fine. When I was hired I was hired specifically for one property, but throughout my employment I was put in 9 of the 11 properties due to those other properties needed assistance meet monthly goals."
bad,"storage company has high turn over rates with upper management, public storage does not pay managers well at all, and does not promote from withen if you would like to move from property manager to district manager or higher, public storage would rather hire someone unfamiliar with company.  sales are really important to public storage to the point where you are unsure if you are taking advantage of customers .  you pretty much keep property clean, do maintenance (if you get hurt, you are at fault) collections/ to the point of harassing people  with calls who at times arent aware thier number was given as a alternate contact, and storage has nothing to do with them, auctions, leasing, sales all for the low amount of  $10hr  in some states lower. Alot of properties are not well maintained. with mold in units and i personally seen DM have someone paint over it  instead of replacing dry wall. no preventative maintenance, so tons of roof leaks, that ruin customers belongings. they will have you rent units knowing a customer could lose there stuff to damage. you have to deal with angry customers that the higher up managers ignore and it can become dangerous"
bad,For a company to be the #1 leading self storage in the us they treat employees very bad. No advancement no bonuses but they want you to sell sell sell!!! You basically do everything collections clean units sometimes fix golf carts depending on your dm. When I say the worst company thats why they always hiring because people always leaving.
bad,"Although the job security is high at this job,  there is no room for growth within the company.  It's an easy job,  but corporate management is hired from outside the company which makes interacting with them on a daily basis difficult and disconnected."
bad,Worst job ever. They start in Maryland at $10 an hr which is less than any other storage company. They only give you 38hrs a week. The store opens at 9:30am and you may not clock in before 9:25 and in those 5mins you must prepare the cash and paperwork for the rest of the day. Last year's raise was only .21 and to top it off only white people have set days off.
bad,"Job advancement is awful, pay is awful, expectations are over the top and the only advantage is if you live on site, but the apartments aren't on every site and need to be like little homes with a backyard so if you have kids and they pay real bad so unless you live on site not worth it.."
bad,"For all the stuff you have to put up with there, pay is horrible especially living in Los Angeles, hard to make ends meet. They are quick to acknowledge your awesome sales you've made, but quick to fire when you don't continue the same..."
bad,"Between underpaying the staff and selling tenant's belongings at auction, you will be a hollow shell of yourself. The pay is average, although you have to use your own vehicle with very limited re-imbursement. Public Storage does not encourage independent thinkers and will do its best to weed them out. I have now had 4 vacation requests denied this year. Even offered to let my Regional Manager pick the weeks I can go, still denied every time. Of course, if you don't use the vacation by the end of the year, you lose it. So, there goes 140 hours. There is a reason the hourly staff turnover is 140% and the DM position is 50%."
bad,This Company Is A Very Depressing Company To Work For They Have You Do A lot Of Things Through Out The Day That Multiple People Should Do And Their Pay Rate Is Not At All Competitive They  Do Have Set Hours And All Their Positions Are Full Time But This Is Not A Company I Recommend
bad,There are many versatile task to complete with this position. Strict literature and code calling is mandatory. Lose management and friendly co workers. The hardest part of this job is leaving on time. The most enjoyable party of this job is communicating with diverse clientele.
bad,A typical work day is getting all set up by running reports and opening up the store. The management teams is not a good team my co workers were ok but lazy because they been there longer they get away with a lot of things. the hardest part of the job was been rude to the customer. the most enjoyable was helping out the customer
bad,"If you like working by yourself to make extra cash for your family, this job is for you because the pay is too awful to make it your primary job.This is not a family company unless you are at the top.Indianapolis area is poorly managed."
bad,"You MUST memorize 5,000 scripts for everything you do!  District Manager plays favorites.  Certain employees allowed to cuss other employees and leave work whenever they want!  NOT a very good place to work, especially with the pay and you have to do everything!!"
bad,"I hate this place, customers are such drama queens, certain co-workers are impossible to work with."
bad,The job in itself is AWESOME and I live and breathe it...forming great relationships with my clients while striving to provide a great experience and customer service. I would not recommend this company to anyone that has any long term goals. .
bad,this job has no security for there employees. DM and managers are rude
bad,The management is uncaring and unresponsive at all levels. Most of the co-workers are friendly and good people.  The pay is poor and compensation changes every year because the bonus structure is altered so that total yearly earnings decrease. Employees are required to be deceptive to customers. Terrible benefits.
bad,"All they care about is taking money from people. They don't care about anything else. They want you to sell the items so the higher ups get more money, you get nothing from it. If you don't sell it, they yell and scream at you."
bad,"thats the word i would use for this job, no advancement, terrible management, no respect and so much drama in my district. i would recommend you try somewhere else or keep applying for something better."
bad,"Meeting different people, having to learn different scripts ever couple months, management is horrible, my co-workers are great, hardest part of the job is dealing with management. most enjoyable part is meeting different people and the hours"
bad,"Public storage make billions of dollars off the front line employees which is the Property Managers,  But they start their Property Managers off with $10 an hour and do not care about given them a raise if they do give you a raise its10 cents. Any time you ask about wages they will tell you to give us a hiring referral. Why would I refer anybody to work hear if I'm not happy here"
bad,"There are no incentives to working with Public Storage. The benefits are horrible and insanely expensive, there are no bonuses, there is no chance for job advancement, and there are no raises. In short, someone who does the bare minimum on the job gets treated the same as someone who goes above and beyond in their performance."
bad,"They make promises and raise your hopes to make you stay so they have someone to work for them. They don't pay adequately for the amount of work they want you to do. They want you to sell their locks, insurance and merchandise which is fine, but if you don't meet their numbers, they treat as if you're not doing your job right. Terrible company to work for and the management does not care about you."
bad,Horrible work place!! Only good thing about this company is the hours! Company throws employees under the bus for a quick buck. Don‚Äôt work here useless you really need a job!!!
bad,"This company doesn't promote within. They say the most important thing you do is rent units but they force you to up sell high priced merchandise to customers. They force the sells so the district managers, senior district managers, regional district "
bad,RUN!!!!!!  This place does not hold people accountable for their mistakes. They expect the property manager to clean up every mistake and maintain certain stores quotas. Do NOT APPLY HERE!!!
bad,"If your into extreme micro-management that this is the job for you. Upper management will micro-management every move you do as a DM and then you are required to do that say with all of the property managers. The work life balance doesn't exist. The way that PS coaches its employees is very degrading, this causes the high turn over rate."
bad,"It wasn't until after I started working for Public Storage that I found out there was no such thing as moving up in the company. I asked the manager during my interview and he said yes there is when in fact there isn't. Property managers receive the same pay as the customer service representatives/relief managers. The only difference is that the property managers have the option to live on the property but they are still charged something like $300/month for rent. There is no way for long time property managers to move up to the next level of District Manager without leaving the company for a year then reapply for that position because they DO NOT HIRE FROM WITHIN. District managers starting salary in Chicago, IL is $72,000/yr with a guaranteed $12,000 bonus in the first year. Whereas, the property managers and CSR/relief managers start off at minimum wage. Does that seem fair to you?"
bad,"Steady job for a while. Until company decided to go from a more customer service oriented job into a more retail based company. Pay remained low for all the task performed by ""managers"" From collecting rent, renting units, selling overpriced merchandise, janitorial duties collection calls, customer service, etc. You are punished for not meeting sales goals even threaten with job loss while DM (District Managers) get a cut from the sales. You get nothing no sales commission or even a bonus at the end of the year.  Co workers are friendly in the positive side. Over worked to say the least.  You have to deal with rude customers most of the time. Some situations where out of the store ""manager's"" hand. Broken in units due to lack of security.  Company was more focused on ""Curb Appeal""  then updating and investments in older stores.  I had to run a store all by myself and yet my title did not say store ""Manager"" I was a Relief Manager. DM's do not invest enough time on each individual stores. Some DM's are ill equipped for the position. Unreachable. Communication is low. You are left to fend for yourself most of the week.  Some would not spend time with you to talk over company procedures. Almost forgot you are given scripts so you loose all human or personal touch with customers.  No creative input or  output whatsoever.  There are no more advancements besides from Relief Manager to Store Manager. Company does not promote from within. They keep field operations separate from corporate operations.  They require you to have a bachelors degree to apply for the DM position, also quit"
bad,"Dealing with different customers different attitudes "
bad,"I started loving my job, you meet all kinds of  different people, I love help and this job gave me the opportunity to feel helpful. The customers for the most part were awesome. I did not like the memorizing of scripts in order to sell the insurance. I believe that in order to come across as genuinely  caring you must be genuinely caring , not speak by script. The  district managers use scare tactics to get you to sell the maximum merchandise. I was told I would be living out of my car and on food stamps if I did not sell a certain amount that month. That was the day I quit. I loved my job and would like to believe I was great at it, but management was not the most professional, they seemed to look down on property manager because there is no chance of advancing in this company. Once you become a store manager that is the highest you can climb up that corporate ladder."
bad,to much work for the salary they provide. some coworkers are nice some are to bossy. the hardest part to work in the heat outside.
bad,"Used to be a great place to work in Toronto, but management doesn't care. The person in charge, who was a lousy District Manager, can't be trusted; Lies to everyone (EVERYONE!) in the organization. "
bad,"A typical day was checking reservations in am to prepare for possible incoming customers, checking emails from superiors, calling Customers back that left messages, solved problems or followed up for solutions. Drove golf cart around property to check for vacated units, possible problems, cleaned grounds, cleaned empty units. Showed units, rented units , did collection calls. Sold merchandise. I learned what it takes to run a mini storage business."
bad,"horrible company to work for,no loyalty to long term employees,no room for advancement"
bad,I worked for them for a year and I love co workers there but  management don‚Äôt help you when customer need them to help with lock cuts or explaining how things work there. Alot of security issues daily. too many homeless trashing the place.
bad,I only recommend working here if you are a mother or if you are married. Other than that there is no way for you to move up in the company or to increase your pay. Management is horrible and they do not care about the employees.
bad,"Horrible place to work, training is next to non-existent, trained 4 days and was thrown on my own.  No further training, dealing with customers that are irate."
bad,"Public storage relief managers are wonderful and very helpful also hard workers and they dont get the credit at all everything the managers sale district managers get bonus also the reviews relief managers/employees get ,also they dont allow over time anymore because once it go over the district manager budget it come out they pay they dont pay out paid time off or sick time YOU accumulate working all those hours"
bad,The harder you work the more they don‚Äôt notice. There is a serious favoritisms issue with this company. They want you to sell but there is no incentive for the employees to want to sell. The employees do well and the bosses are rewarded for there hard work!!! Not a good company to work for.
bad,"Public Storage dangles ""free apartment"" to all new minimum wage hires. But, there's only at most one apartment at each location. Some locations do not have apartments. Usually the apartment is already occupied, by the minimum wage property manager. Good luck replacing that property manager."
bad,"We used to have employees and managers that cared about the job. It has become out of control. "
bad,"worked here for over a year and your work really goes unappreciated, as long as you're making the goals that is all they care about, you are not important to them the business is, you work alone and sometimes have to walk the entire building alone including staircases to make sure nobody is in when closing, completely unsafe. pay is very low for what they expect from you."
bad,i love the employees but it's the company  they do not treat their employees right they want to more work but less pay  they took bonuses away last year and took away PTO time as well. now this year No raises this company  will walk over a dollar  to pick up a penny they are so cheap
bad,"I actually loved my Job at ps..the managent for 9plus years were ok the company went  down hill and started hiring horrible District managers ..ones that lie about the work they do .. they care nothing of the employees and no matter how hard you try you arent good  enough ,if the ceo only knew of the great worker they had and how the Dm's and rm's  treat the employees back stabbers"
bad,"if you like to be micro managed and only punished for the negative things you do, then public storage is the place for you."
bad,There is no room for promotion. Pay raises are a joke. They are company wide raises. Transfering locations is almost impossible if you are good at your job because your district manager makes huge bonus off of you but you dont get anything. The bonus change all the time. I worked there for 5 years and brought my property up 20% from the previous manager and always had the top numbers and end up only making 75 cents more than when I started. Other storage company pay a lot better.
bad,"All this job gave me the 2 years of working there, was stress leading to heart issues from all the stress. Really all this job helped me with was get 2 years of office experience. Co workers also helped get through the day of stress."
bad,I love my boss the company is the worst. Most people at public storage do not complete the task we are giving to complete and no one has anything to say about it. I only like my coworkers outside of work.
bad,"I was terminated after 6 yrs of service because I was training a new employee and we had a 200.00 cash shortage and we were both working there register. In my 6 years of work there, I have never had a shortage or overage 1 time"
bad,not the greatest place to work unless you are a single person with no children you are required to work opening to closing of everyday you work and the compensation is very low for the amount of work applied daily
bad,"I've worked for PS twice. The first time was because they bought the storage company I worked for and I was absorbed by the company. The second time, I really needed a job and had no other option at the time. Public Storage is a multi-billion dollar company that pays their employees the bare minimum so they can continue to line the pockets of the men in suits. The only growth potential is to District Trainer. You will NEVER be a district manager or anything higher. They only hire college graduates who have never worked storage in their lives, so they have no clue what it's like to work in a rental office. They have unrealistic expectations of how the offices should operate and punish you for not doing your job according to their plan. You are also not allowed to have a brain. I was fired for questioning why things were done. You don't do that at PS or they will dig and find the most miniscule reason to get rid of you. They just want you to do as your told. Sorry, but that's not me. "
bad,"Policies have certainly changed over the last few years..for the worse. Scripts,and pledges to sale merchandise, and basically no bonus for the field employees.  If you are with the company for over 5 years,be prepared to be harassed to the point of quitting or you are fired. The District Managers push for sales,which they themselves cant complete successfully when conducting a rental,however you are expected to do with each customer. Its a nice place to get storage experience,I have learned a lot. However its not a place to stay"
bad,"I worked for Public Storage for a mere 4 months and couldn't take it anymore! The only thing you ever hear from management is scripts, scripts and sell, sell!! You must memorize scripts and yes your manager will test you on them monthly! Compensation is a joke considering Public Storage is supposed to be number one in the storage biz! Most of the other storage companies pay $2-$3 more an hour! Yes they offer you a company apartment but keep in mind that it is not inspected and that they are usually substandard and full of mold! The job itself is mundane and boring. You usually work alone and must take a half hour lunch but there is no suitable place to eat and microwaves are prohibited! You will be working every weekend and the company does not offer advancement opportunity! And don't count on being honest with your customers... ypu must lie and deceive to make sure that no one walks without renting a space. To top that off you must sell the ridiculously overpriced merchandise and cleverly add the $20 lock (that can be purchased anywhere else for a mere $5)! Take my advice pass this job up! Its not worth the hire on paperwork you'll have to fill out!"
bad,Well I can not even honestly say that I disliked my job because I loved my job and the people I worked with. It was management that was the problem. I came to work and did my job and I did my job well. Management had a way of talking to people that would make you want to quit every time you seen them. This company has let several people go with unexplainable reasons. I understand there are right to work states but if a person is dedicated to their job and does their job to the best of their ability with given resources then I see no reason to terminate without just cause. This is not a family friendly company nor is it a female friendly company in regaurds to single female with children. I would NOT recommend this company to the homeless.
bad,"I got tired of the pay and picking up rats. I hated this job .The DM is rude. "
bad,"The job is low pay and a ton of work!  You mostly are by yourself but you can have an overwhelming amount of work!  There are no pay increases yearly, but is controlled by the company.  You can work close to your house which is good but that‚Äôs about it!  Coworkers at other properties are great. Management can be good or bad!"
bad,"Typical day is renting spaces, which is not hard, but they also wants you to sell overpriced locks, insurance, merchandises, and get 5 star google reviews, all these gives the upper management quarterly bonuses and you get nothing out of it. Collect monthly rent and make collection calls weekly. You need to clean and manage the property, fix any issues yourself or it won't get fixed for awhile till customers start to complain on Google Review. Starting pay is $10 which is not enough, as you do everything to run the place in order for Public Storage to profit. Other storage companies offer $12-15."
bad,When I first started working for this company the benefits were great and the job duties were also.  The management cared about their employees and the customers and now the company is just another competitive company that does not treat their employees well. and expect ridiculous tasks for the pay.  The duties are so ridiculous and management so poor that they can not keep anyone.  The turnover with employees tells the story and the sad thing is the company doesn't care.  The once great benefits has all been taken away and there is no incentive for you to work there.  Definitely no advancement.
bad,"Public Storage pay rate is rediculous for the things they want you to do. Like most business all they care about is money. If you are over the age of 18 stay away. They pay you 12.50 an hour and then make you drive to different locations to work as a releif manager. You could probably make more money picking up cans off the street."
bad,"Property repairs are never done, management does not support employees, customers are often rude and violent. Expectations are unreasonable. Understaffed for what we are asked to do. Company is obsessed with google reviews"
bad,This is a good job for a retired or young person with minimal bills. You must enjoy sales and be very flexible. No weekends off. You'll have more bosses than co-workers. Look forward to being given a lot of responsibilities with no reward. The best part of the position will be your customers.
bad,No bonus program. Does not promote from within. Extreme favoritism from management. Way too micro managed. Generally when you work for a company you make more money every year due to raises and whatnot. With this company you will make less and less every year...I did anyways.
bad,You are your own boss so to speak. you open the store sometimes with a co worker moslty not. Your duities are to call the customers to inform them to make a payment. sell unites and packing supplies.
bad,While I was working there it was great but I had to do everything they are short staffed doesnt make the schedule a month in advance u neverknow what days u had off unless a district mmanager took a vacation they constantly quiz u on scripts  not to mention scheduling u by yourself at an A property that requires 2 or more ppl then the property is down the road they expect utoo watch for ppl dumping trash when u have an office that is packed oh and if your car breaks down and u can't get it fix they look for ways to fire u
bad,"This company is all about numbers you can't reach. They'll tell you 13.00 per hour during training and 15.00 after truth and it's a lie. Commission is not possible. It's a bonus if you hit your numbers. You take incoming calls and most are misdirected. Which will drop your numbers for bonus. Once they get you on the floor. Them the info is told to you. During training, they won't answer any questions per pay."
bad,After being with PS for some years. I could not tolerate my supervisor rude comments during conference meeting who was disrespecting myself and co-works.
bad,"Don't work here, ever!!!!! This is a job for a kid living with their parents. No money, you can get a nickel raise. No advancements, they rather hire former Hollywood video managers than promote someone who has been with there sorry company for over 12 years. Grown people please do not waste your time or energy!!!!!!!"
bad,"The job it‚Äôself was not bad at all. The work schedule was inconsistent never had a weekend off if you want a weekend you have to request. My boss was very easy to get along with, other employees felt like they could micromanage other managers. Overall I enjoyed my time there just didn‚Äôt like the schedule and not being compensated for my sales. The higher ups push you to do so much but there‚Äôs no appreciation"
bad,"Typical day, this was the decent part of the job.  Renting storage units, taking payments from customer,upsales collection duties, maintaining a clean and productive property.  "
bad,"Everything they promise is a lie. They push you to sell, sell, sell but you get no commision. Your DM does. Also, as a manager, you are not allowed to make decisions. Your DM does. Your job as Manager is to get yelled at by customers so your DM doesn't have to deal with it."
bad,"This is a good starter job and has a good balance of outside inside work. They used to have a couple good perks but they are all lost. The have taken any benefit from working here away. No decent bonus, no commission (not that it was much)."
bad,"Not able to comment at this time. (I have a lawsuit going on) uble to talk about it at this time. Started out in Houston,Tx it was great. Transfer to California"
bad,I think that management could be better. I would love to work in an environment where i love coming to work.
bad,cool laid back kinda job very easy once traning is done however no bonuses when you have good sales making collections calls renting units very easy to do
bad,The worst job I have ever had. No one stays past 6 months. So much work for 12.50. They expect 2 pick up dead rats rat feces and urine and human fecus.
bad,Stressful. If you have little kids and are a single parent you will never have time for them because your always working. Never off on weekends or holidays.
bad,This company don‚Äôt pay their employees well for the amount work we have to do. It takes a long time just even move up within the company and the training of the new assoicates
bad,The atmosphere is what keeps you going in the doors everyday. The leadership is great and a lot of room to grow. The pay is really good and hours are flexible
bad,"This company does not cater to their employees at all. They constantly want more and when you give them what they ask for, they want more again. Not worth it."
bad,Manage property and provide customer service as well as office duties
bad,"If being arrested by a customer makes sense, try asking the police officer to lock doors to the business. Wasn't worth telling evicted to use some form of bank payment."
bad,"I worked here for 6 months and was interested in management position, I aided the DM in preparing one of the sites ready for inspection. This site was one of the worst sites due to location (rodents). No thank you, not taken serious, a lot of HS drama."
bad,"This company really do not care about employees or customers. Always changing policy. You only get paid holiday on New Year, Christmas and Thanksgiving. No bonuses or annual raises for performance. We make customer get insurance that do not cover their belongs. Were harrassed by managers about google reviews and merchandise. Very high turnover with Dms and employees. No one stays with this company for to long."
bad,Management sucks. They don‚Äôt care about your personal life they over work you and there is no room to grow with the company.  You will be a relief property manager and go to a property manager with the same pay.
bad,Have the best training in the industries but truly do not know the correct way to treat their employees. When you live onsite you can't get away from your job!!
bad,Great freedom that allowed you the ability to take responsibility for your property. Reached out to potential customers and wrote up contracts while also managing payments and delinquency.
bad,"Never organized low low pay for amount of work. No advancement. Management doesn't help you at al. if you suggest new ways to do things you get fired. They want the most for little pay. "
bad,"Terrible company, favoritism, no advancement, No work life balance. Hard work is not rewarded being that they recently took away all bonuses and incentives, the only pay you have to look forward to is $9.50 per hour which is the minimum in the self storage industry. But, if you need a steady paycheck with steady 40 hour work weeks for a short period of time and you do not look to advance within the company. Apply this might be for you."
bad,Worked as a DM for PS for over 2 years. Horrible place to work if life balance is important. They hire for this role from outside the company knowing there is very liitle room for growth. Thank God I was able to secure a better job with progressive leaders that truly value their employees. Quite frankly would not recommend this position to anyone seeking quality of life.
bad,working for public storage has been a blessing and a curse while I have been with the company for years career advancements just aren't realistic and they honestly don't care must for their employees
bad,"You are performing several job functions for low pay. You are doing maintenance, customer service, collections and heavy on the sales side for very low pay. High employee turnover and management for such a large company speaks to morale."
bad,"I chose to come to work at Public Storage after several life changes caused me to try a new career. I found that even though I didn't go looking for storage management as a career that I was very good at it. Managing the cleanliness of the office, grounds and storage was a real pleasure for me. Sales with the customers came easy to me and I was able to retain customers based solely on my customer service. The office was run very accurately and I even received perfect audit scores and excellence awards with my time there. I was trainer for new employees and a constant contact for all employees to help with day to day operations. I was in charge of tracking all new call potentials for sales and accuracy. I enjoyed the co-workers while they lasted but most didnt' stay long. Public Storage paid very poorly and expected more than 40 hours of work from managers with out compensation. The upper management was often rude and difficult to deal with. Even the upper management was constantly revolving and most didn't last long. In the end I couldn't afford to stay working for the little pay and found more enjoyable work with another similar company."
bad,This has been one of the worst companies I have worked for. You are told in the interview that there is no room for advancement as they only hire from outside the company. There is a bonus program but nobody knows what it is and only 40% of the employees who qualify actually get paid a bonus. The company does nothing to improve the current conditions of the property because they don't want to spend the money. Employees are expected to do everything on the property from running the office to doing all the maintenance...again because they don't want to spend the money. I would not recommend anyone to rent here let alone work here.
bad,"I got hired at $9 per hour and then 3 months later the hiring wage was raised to $12. When I asked to be raised to their new hiring wage I was told no. That they'd have to do it for more than just me. I say to hell with that. Why was I working at 100% and getting paid 30% less? When I asked my DM to go to bat for me, all I got was ""Hey, you're point is valid...but no"". I quit and I bad mouth PS for all I'm worth...which is a hell of a lot more than $9 per hour. Ever since they bought Shurgard...the company values changed from family oriented (they got rid of all company picnics and Xmas parties) and went to bottom line...screw the workers bonuses but give the DMs and higher better, bigger and more bonuses. I am glad I don't work there anymore. My self esteem is worth more than that."
bad,"Un-appreciated! Cover your butt! I was a 7 year employee, faithfull, dedicated, responsible employee. All depends on your District Manager. My attendance was Perfect, after topping out on paid time off, was held Against me! New DM hired off street didn't like me due to sexual preference so I was fired for doing my job by refusing to remove customer late fee or give out managers cell number. Corp.choose to back idiot DM and not back proven trusted employee, then later fire incompetant DM only few months later. Not a place to work if you take any kind of pride in your personal preformance!"
bad,"No way to advance in company past property level.  No bonus structure.   Management harps on employees to sell,sell,sell to feed their own bonuses;  Employees get no bonus.  No yearly reviews/pay raises.  No job security; hours get cut all of the time.  Human Resources are a joke to reach out to.  Public Storage forces employees to sell false insurance to customers, and property security is terrible.  Stay Away From This Company."
bad,"In the beginning of my career with Public Storage, I was happy and felt that I was accomplishing my short term goals. After the District Manager had personal problems at home, she became very agressive and verbally/mentally abusive to me in particular. Other employees commented on her unfair and cruel treatment of me. I was skipped for multiple promotions. regardless of"
bad,Terrible place to work they work you so hard and underpaid you. You will end up cleaning so much stuff even mildew picking up  rodents customers trash even heavy furniture that customers have left.They pay the district manager Way more than the workers for our work.  District manager is barking like slaves to receive their monthly bonus. If you are offered a apartment don‚Äôt take it it‚Äôs disgusting
bad,"This job is easy physically but there is a lot of legal aspects to it. Remember, you are dealing with the public and their items. Thing may get crazy and do not expect to be backed up by your superiors. Take this job for what it is, a paycheck. Do not expect to advance in a career here, there are not opportunities."
bad,"Dont get me wrong, i enjoyed my coworkers and some of the customers. But the pay was NOT worth the amount of work we were required to do. In the district i worked for the dm was terrible at communicating with customers that had a problem, expected you to sell merchandise and when you didnt you had to email him and tell him why. They expected us to do things that we shouldnt have had to at all"
bad,"Been with public storage for over a year and a half and have had 2 different District Managers in that time. Both were hired from outside the company and both constantly seemed like they have no idea what they're doing. Management doesn't seem to understand how the jobs actually work at a property since none of them have worked a property at all besides a very brief training period. Constantly giving unrealistic goals for employees to meet when it comes to sale of merchandise or property cleanliness and they get mad when the goals aren't reached."
bad,"This job is ok, if your  a student and need something while your going to school. Outside of that, it's not worth it as a ""long time job"". The company constantly changes their own rules and scripts. They tell you to do one thing and then they switch and tell you to do something completely different. There is zero compensation for achieving sales goals."
bad,Company should reconsider pay for employees or at least some kind of Commission. Management could be better I guess that comes with payout. Turnover is high would probably have to say it‚Äôs because of pay and management.
bad,"Multi layered management and many of the managers were over rated and strutted around like they were something special.  Working conditions were sometimes poor, like one summer when the A/C went out in 106 degrees in the office, we were told that roofers and construction workers work in those conditions and if we didn't like it, we were free to leave."
bad,The customers and friendships you meet are unforgettable and most rewarding. Although the way corporate and management is ran very poorly everyone is not treated the same or fairly.
bad,"I was hired as a manager and dealt with way more than I should have. As a manager i did not has access to much other than the property. The benefits were horrible, they did not cover anything. When a hurricane blew off the top of my building, I was forced to work with no AC, no electricity, the entire building was filled with mold and yet I would have been fired if I did not agree to cleaning the facility. The entire building was falling apart but they acted as if nothing was wrong. It was against my own health and dignity to work in this facility. So could no longer put my health at risk. And no I did not get paid more than 10 an hour. It was not enough."
bad,"I became property manager, so I lived on the premises. I feel I did a great job while I worked there. I got my numbers up where they needed to be according to the company, my secret shopper scores were great, but the regional manager didn't like me so I got let go. I put all of my effort and skills into this company for low pay and still it still wasn't enough for the regional manager. My manager got fired because she would'nt fire me. My manager thought I was doing a fantastic job."
bad,The job is not that bad just the environment! Rats and so many unsanitary situations. Bad communication skills from management.The position was stressful.
bad,"The amount of responsibilities assigned on a day-to-day basis falls far short to similar management positions in the workplace. Organizational structure is top-heavy, micro-management intensive and dismisses opportunity for advancement."
bad,"This is a great starter job for someone just out of high school taking a break from forwarding their education or someone who seeks nothing more than a ""job"". This company provides no room for growth, with monotonous duties that leave no rewards, no room for advancement, Always ""watched"" by management and secret shoppers for mistakes, but never praised for jobs well done. Great start out job but after a few months you will be more than ready to leave."
bad,"A typical day at work is to handle money, montior the property all day, help the customers, answer phone. I am the property manager and my co-worker is great. The hardest part about my job is to pick up rats. The most enjoyable part about my job is that my customers love me and I can help them out as much as possible."
bad,"All this company cares out is Google reviews, pushing customers to do them in office while in front of you. If you are not a pushy sales person do not apply. They do not care about their employees safety regarding parking lot lighting, lighted drive way and working security cameras/DVR."
bad,I've been working at ps for about 3 years as a prop manager and the job is simple and easy your main goal is to rent units drive revenue district manger and regional manager will scold you and yell at you for not selling over priced merchandise to your rentals you are not only in charge of making hundreds of calls a month but running the office taking care if all issues by yourself but also cleaning an entire property with a broom and dustpan sweeping an entire huge property daily also mopping and cleaning cobwebs and cleaning doors and taking care of abandon good customers leave and much more without ever being able to leave office for more then 15 min at a time or your get yelled at its honesty completely unfair for paying minimum wage living onsite sucks as well no rent is great but it's completely terrible your constantly being bothered by dm and customers when your off the clock have no where to sit outside you never leave work its suffocating
bad,"I was happy with the company until a new district manager was hired for our district. From that point on I was verbally harassed, ridiculed, and made to feel intimidated and threatened by my new supervisor. After attempting to talk the situation over with him and making 0 progress, I reported him anonymously to the company and resigned my position."
bad,This job is good if you need to get back into work life and use as a stepping stone but do not get stuck into the housing. There is no growth opportunities besides a resident manager at minimum wage.
bad,Not a great company for advancement or money opportunities. Worked here for almost 2 years and became a property manager. no perks on becoming a property manager over a relief manager. Same pay as a relief manager put more work and responsibilities.
bad,My District Manager was  horrible !!!  Would never answer the phone when I needed something. He was a procrastinator on everything but I had to be face-to-face with the customers not him  so I would get the blunt of the problemas. They do not promote within.
bad,"I worked at Public Storage for nearly a year and I hated it. It is NOT safe. Typically, I'd be scheduled to work a property by myself right off the highway that was well-known for break-ins and loitering. As a woman, I felt threatened by many of the men hanging around, smoking and drinking, and they certainly would not listen when asked to leave. "
bad,"Public Storage is a joke, there's no higher position. Once a property Manager that's all you would ever be here in New Orleans. The new DM, she works 5 days a week and schedule EVERYONE else 7-10 straight to work.. Please don't store there if you don't want bedbug's and homeless around you all day. You are responsible for cleaning the property inside and out, the units, picking up on furniture, mopping up urine constantly, putting up delivery alone majority of the time and dealing with unpleasant customer. If you are a customer or employee  Run and I mean Run fastüò£üò´üòïüòà"
bad,"Large buildings, long corridor like hallways with flickering lights. Poor sanitation in unit buildings. Small office depending on location. A lot of foot traffic typically throughout the day."
bad,No matter how long you work there or how hard you work there is no advancement. You are made to push and sale merchandise with no commission or bonuses. There are no raises no room for advancement they hire outside of the company instead of promoting in house employees. They raise the rent on storages every 6 months but still dont give hard working employees a raise . if you just need  job public storage is excellent . if you want a rewarding job this is not the place .
bad,"My manager was excellent, but nothing was consistent with this company, what was good for one was not good for the rest. Too many people trying to tell you how to do your job and no 2 were the same. Great health benefits, you work your butt off and get nothing in return. Your fellow co workers are cut throat, they will lie about yo if they think they can get ahead of you"
bad,This is a very demanding job with little reward.  It's all about sales.  No matter how good you are with your customers they don't care if you don't sell the overpriced merchandise which continues to go up in price but doesn't change in quality.  Raises are horrible and so is starting pay.  They do offer a bonus but not everyone qualifies and those who get one usually get the lowest one offered.  I would not work there again.
bad,"At first, the job was fun and enjoyable. After a short time, it became apparent the customer did not invest much in their employees. Training was at a minimum and infrequent. Pay scale was much less than other storage companies in the area. Upper management rarely listened to or acknowledged employees. I remained in storage but went to a better employee-friendly company when I left."
bad,As a relief or property manager you must be deceptive and sales and follow precisely a sales script. District managers and above have little to no respect property level employees. No room for advancement past property manager. District managers are hired externally usually with years of experience in supervision. Most property level employees will not qualify for district manager position
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of, providing customer service, booking reservations for storage units."
bad,"A typical day at work includes cash handling, renting spaces, doing deposits, taking trash out, cleaning, doing lock checks, reading emails, coutesy calls, as well as confirming rentals."
bad,"If you have never worked for a publically held company before you will be sadly disappointed upon your arrival. Low pay,(after 2 and a half years and 3 raises I was still making less than 10 bucks an hour), ever changing schedules, and sophomoric policies. Management constantly slapping your hands and setting unrealistic ""goals"" You'll feel like the proverbial monkey trying to pick up the hot rock. Don't plan on any advancement because there is none. Average job life expectancy is about 2-3 years and the company seems fine with that. Even.the positive reviews are from ex-employees. Doesn't that tell you all you need to know. Would NEVER go back there."
bad,You become a ping pong ball in the company.  You do tons of work but the most you can be is a trainer.  There wasn't a lot of room to grow and the management team was just money hungry.
bad,"This was a temporary position, the people were great the organization it self needed better structure. To many mistakes as a company."
bad,"Given the relatively low pay, the job description seems reasonable.  At hiring, we are required to have a vehicle and car insurance, but this changes into having a personal cell phone.  Management feels entitled to call and text you at any time regarding work.  I was once even asked to use my cell phone for company business when our telephones were not working."
bad,"A normal day is taking payments and leasing storage units to reservations or walk in customers. One also has to maintain property, file paperwork, clean office, and the biggest part of the day is making phone calls. "
bad,"Initially upon being hired, I was happy to have a job with what seemed like a good company. After nearly three months now, I have learned that it is impossible to advance beyond the role of a property manager, something I do currently. They do not promote for corporate jobs from within, but rather seek outside folks so as to prevent favoritism. For the hours and headache you have to deal with, the pay is pathetic. There is a limit of ten dollars an hour that doesn't get any better with the title of a property management position."
bad,Good and bad days with the DM nothing to smile about not good at that time at all.
bad,"A typical day at work is getting out the golf cart, cleaning the bathroom, opening the office, counting the cash, checking emails, phone messages and reservations, setting appointments, making bank deposit run, performing lock check, renting units and selling merchandise, making collection calls, compiling and submitting reports, cleaning vacated units and handling any customer concerns."
bad,lots to do little to learn. not much room for advanement. on site management has its cons
bad,"When I read all the positive reviews for this company on indeed I thought it would be a pretty good place to work. I've been employed for publix storage for 6 months and have already put in my notice to quit. There is NO ADVANCEMENT in the company. You will only ever be a property manager. The pay sucks, and they make you their own little public storage robot by making you read a script for EVERYTHING. The only perk is you get off at 6pm everyday. You are required to work on weekends and all holidays except Christmas, New Years, and thanksgiving. Sweating, cleaning bugs, and cleaning up after people is in the daily routine, nonetheless making delinquent calls every week to all of the same people who have not paid on their rent. It's annoying. You will have no future with this company."
bad,"Great training program for agents."
bad,They don't have your back in any situation but yet expect you to handle the business. They keep getting new relief managers that want to call off all the time
bad,"In the interviews, they dont tell you how much you actually work. 9-6pm, your days are pretty much taken up. Relief managers are thrown around. If the staff is short, you're forced to work overtime. I started while I was pregnant, couldnt get fmla because I didnt work there long enough. The benefits are california based so its very expensive. $66 for medical every pay period. Paid twice a month. Work load is pretty heavy at the end and beginning of every month with little to no help.  Work every holiday besides christmas and Thanksgiving with no hokiday pay"
bad,Public storage does not care about their employees nor customers. They make you do more than your actual job titles and try to underpay you for the job you do daily basically your treated very unfairly there.
bad,"No room for growth in this company they don't want to give you a rise, and they don't have any incentives either. The only good thing about the job is that it not to busy and you don't have any one over you monitoring you."
bad,"Management was only concerned for their bonuses, didn‚Äôt care about your workload and scheduling was a joke, 7 days in a row with 1 day off? Sometime 8-9 in a row! Then to ask for a day off was like you were bothering them and cutting into their bonuses. At first it was great! I loved meeting the people and always being able to help the guests. But then when you take on the full time property manager, god help you! Don‚Äôt ask for a holiday off because it won‚Äôt happen. I honestly would not recommend this job to anyone. It would only be good for a summer job but get out of there fast! No room for advancement, no incentive to stay. Also if you need something to be fixed on your property good luck because if it went ‚Äúover budget‚Äù it wasn‚Äôt getting done. I had broken locks on my buildings that were never fixed, a golf cart that sat in a unit because it didn‚Äôt work and they wouldn‚Äôt fix it. Absolutely ridiculous."
bad,"A typical day at Public Storage involved helping customers find a storage unit to help store their personal belongings. Also, employees are expected to sale moving products to help customers protect their personal goods. Used software system to review reports pertaining to billing, unit occupancy, and time gap between customer request and contact made with potential customer. Also, asked to clean storage units, restroom, and parking lot."
bad,"The job itself is not bad.  But the company does not respect the employees.  I really felt most management personnel did not respect the employees, and this was particularly true with upper management. Pay is low, and very little in benefits."
bad,"HORRIBLE company to work for. From corporate all the way down to management is bad. They don‚Äôt care about their employees. Turn over rate is very high, the job is cool for a little bit but don‚Äôt plan to stay very long. Employees literally do EVERYTHING around the property, Cleaning (restrooms, curb appeal, windows, doors, and stairwells, just to name a few) Maintenace (Changing light bulbs, and fixing broken hasps) Only reason I stayed was for the benefits."
bad,"You'll work overtime, with little notice. Pay is low compared to similar jobs. Management won't fix property issues and customers will not be helped efficiently."
bad,"I found that the management had very high goals and when we met them they increased them. We had conference calls 3 times a week and if you were off that day or had a customer you didn't receive anything about what transpired. This also happened with the month in the district meetings. Management played favorites for property positions. "
bad,"This job is a stepping stone job at best.  Pay is not competitive, no opportunity to advance. Forced to sell overpriced merchandise to customers.  Guides and scripts are given but dont always work."
bad,This is a good place for just a little extra cash. Don't apply if you have life to pay. 10.50 is the highest you go. And for dealing with the customers. Cleaning each unit. And more. It's not worth it.
bad,"You are just a number at Public Storage. District Managers and Regional Managers and all the high ups expect you to scrub gutters with tooth brushes and doors for ""appearance"" when most of the properties do not have pest control or working security systems. No room for advancement and they take away bonus's but then still want you to sell our over priced merchandise."
bad,"Renting storage units, selling merchandise, cleaning the property and buildings.  Selling merchandise that was way overpriced."
bad,"I typically started my day off walking the property, checking each unit to make sure it was properly locked and that the property was clean and seeing if anyone had moved out the day before. If they had moved out, I would clean the unit and make it ready for the next tenant. Then I would move inside to the office and make calls to delinquent tenants and rent units to new tenants. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with different people and helping them get the right unit for their needs and the apartment that came with the property. The hardest part was cleaning units in the extreme heat during the summer or cold during the winter. The benefits weren't great but, they did include a 401K and the employees are all like family."
bad,The job is not for someone that wants to do other things with their life. The management does not work around your school schduele. They want people who are willing to stay for the rest of their life at a job.
bad,"Pay is low, benefits terrible. There is no room for advancement they expect you to clean, sell and market but you get paid less than people who work at fast food places but more responsibility.At the time I worked there the was a high turnover people got hired and fired just about every day. They want you to sell things to people that don't want or need it and get mad when you cant. Storage is not a need and people can store at home so prices have to be affordable and comparable to whats around to get people in. They do offer apartments but they are in horrible condition except for a few locations that purchased from another large storage company."
bad,Job can get stressful with people acting as heathens trying to rent a space for dirt cheap. Not everyone has been disgruntled but the majority will ruin working for the company. Company cares about numbers and gives small incentives to workers to meet the goals.
bad,The most enjoyable part of my day was providing assistance to potential tenants but also maintaining company standards. I worked along side a lot of great people.
bad,"Profit above employees and clients. Micro-managing with relentless  expectations. Employees treated like commodities. No real sense of loyalty with leadership until individuals have weathered at least a decade of work. Successful tend to be ""yes"" men/women."
bad,great customers just hard to make everyone happy. Company management isn't that  great and district managers don't last long enough to get a chance to change that opinion. /
bad,"This job holds many duties like customer service in the sales office, cleaning of the property, and sales and business practices through role plays. The hardest part of the job can be the highly escalated customer service issues you will encounter in this business."
bad,the management sucks it was a fun job I liked it but they expect a lot and don't want to pay you for what you do.
bad,"it was a great place to work as far as your coworkers are concerned but the pay is ridiculous. you do EVERYTHING from cleaning, leasing, landscaping, janitorial work, moving furniture i.e. mattresses, couches, TVs, etc., and cleaning up ungodly things like human feces. its just a lot to do for $9.00 per hour and you don't receive a raise until 6 months later, if you last that long and its only 50 cents! the Google surveys and ""scripts"" that they make you follow is a bit over the top. as a previous sales professional, I've realized that people feel more comfortable when YOU are comfortable and not being a robot when your managers are around. to sum it up, I really enjoyed my coworkers, my DM and a couple of customers I got to know but the stress and pay of this job is not worth it."
bad,"A typical day at Public Storage is checking screen for new reservations to confirm appointment times to rent storage units. Posting payments to customer's account and daily making collection calls. I've learnt that having a storage unit is a good idea if you have no place else to store items. Management, my first 2 years working for the company management was great. They were easy to get a hold to and cared about the customers. Over the past 2 years Public Storage has changed management and their attitudes stuck. The District Manager acts like a High School girl with a bad attitude, she only interact with ALL the employees when her managers come around. She also does not communicate well  with the customers nor employees. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer's whom items have been sold do to non payment, the most enjoyable part of the job is working at your own pace."
bad,your primary objective is to rent storage spaces to anyone who walks into to your location. you make sure the facility is well maintained and clean. you do lock checks of the facility daily. management is no ideal and can improve on a lot of areas and lacks they ability to communicate with employees on their front line. they do not promote higher than a property manager. coworkers and customers are great people that you will encounter and you may actually get an actual District manager who is a good person. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the continuous changes within the company and the ridiculous scripts .
bad,I have learned how to manage difficult situations. I have learned to manage my time and how to be self motivated.
bad,"At public storage you have a lot of people you will find are nice and very good at their job. The problem is you have no actual authority to change anything and you are given the brunt of the complaints even though you don't have the power to solve them. Management is very clueless, mainly because they don't hire for upper management within the company, which shows in how little the upper management knows about how the employees job works."
bad,"While I loved the people I worked with at Public Storage and had wonderful interactions with our customers, during the time I was working there, the company drastically scaled back employee benefits and incentive bonuses while increasing the work load. The pay was far less than other local storage companies and, while the initial incentive bonuses more than made up for that, the reduced bonuses were barely a fraction of what was paid when I first started. Constantly shifting policies and procedures made it difficult to keep track of what was required of employees and an inconsistent work schedule made planning for a personal life outside of work nearly impossible. We had a high turnover rate and employees who had been with PS for years were fleeing like rats from a sinking ship. If you want to work in the storage industry, I would suggest nearly any other company. You will be better paid, have a consistent work schedule, and have your hard work compensated and appreciated at a much higher level anywhere else."
bad,"well i typical day at work would consist of printing out all daily reports countting out petty cash daily, and there we complete lock checks and cleaning of the property while management mans the office completes there phone call list and we complete our call logs also."
bad,"typical day is renting units and cleaning, being a landscaper, minor maint at a low pay rate."
bad,"They could be better. I feel like they could try and be more accommodating to those who work there, and have lives outside of PS. Somethings are nice, but it can also be stressful"
bad,"You get moved around to 3 or more locations in one week .just to clean and do work the property manager could have at least started on they just wait till your scheduled at their location to actually do some work.. woodlands location has a old racist white female beware . Very low pay but good benefits ..good management but still not worth it .. you feel dirty for more than half your shift "
bad,"Only apply for this job if you are to the point to accept almost anything. The company always has internal changes that trickle down to the overall operational team members that work at the properties. There is no room for personalization, you are to do what they ask, how they ask and only when they ask. Job is metrics based x10."
bad,"The typical day at work was to take care of customers (retail sales, rent units, answer questions, resolve problems), daily paperwork, inspection of the property, open and close the site, call customers for appointments, collection calls, request repairs as needed. What I learned was, you need to know the answers before doing the work. Management was all about management. The workplace culture was all about rental of units and sales of merchandise. Problems caused by upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,Public storage was very much busy but here was also a lot of down time. I learned to be very fast paced. Management was very helpful in turns of making sure you the business. The Workplace culture was ok but there was no appreciation for the employees
bad,"I would not suggest anyone work here. They set goals that are so hard to reach and if you dont reach them you get on trouble. "
bad,"Very relaxed most slow days, was trained by someone who cut the companies corners, bad experience . Training and training sites were unclear, working at others worksite can be a stressful hassle if they're not organized"
bad,When working it's good at first but then you start to see what the company is really about. From there you'll get demotivated of working there to the point of Depression. (I'm currently going though therapy because of Depression)
bad,The job was easy and laid back if you really would like the truth apply for the company and you than truly understand the job and company a pretty   good company in my opinion.
bad,This company expects you to do more work then you are paid for. You work by yourself at a property which is unsafe and expects too for too little. would not recommend.
bad,changing expectations. high sales pressure. placed in situations with customers that are upset and you cant help them. lots of scripted contact. expected to preform maintenence thats outside your knowledge and should have a vendor fix. managers dont listen or act on problems unless it largely impacts the company bottom line
bad,no real advancement and bad pay for putting up with difficult customers and dealing with corporate bosses who have no idea how the policies they write affect the actually worker.
bad,"Typical day includes doing ALL rolesof a normal retail establishment. Management is hired from outside is constantly rotating.  Workplace culture disregards customers and focuses on  increases uppermanagments pockets. The average ""property manager"" any where else makes double what they offer."
bad,Management wasn't too understanding about child care. They would not work with me being part-time instead because there was nn part-time positions. I really enjoyed what i did and didn't want to leave but management wasn't understanding or tried to work with me or someone like me (single parent with 3 daughters) to get a part-time position for struggling mothers who can't get child care from family or that was free. With the cost of living nowadays especially raising kids on your own is tough and very expensive that I couldn't afford to pay for child care.
bad,"It's an okay company to work for. Only off (other than your regular days) 3 holidays Christmas, Thanksgiving and New Years. You travel from site to site."
bad,"Pay was not the best but it was a stepping stone until I found a better paying job."
bad,"Public Storage is a decent place to build your resume and gain transferable skills. Other than that, after you become a property manager there is no way to advance in the company. They tell you directly that they only hire outside the company for corporate positions. Out of the many storage facilities Public Storage is one of the least paying. One of the things I didn't like the most is they tell you it's not a sales job however that's all you doing is selling. Also the lack of customer service throughout the company is sad."
bad,"Sale Storage Units, Customer Service, Collection's, Clean units, Cashier, making sure all customers are satisfied and need anything to make them happy"
bad,"Working in the storage industry is challening, just by its inherent nature. It is hard, sweaty, dirty work, even on the best day. The benefit of working for PS or another storage company is mainly if you are able to secure a residential manager position, which allows/requires you to live on site. If you are able to handle the work and living on site, then you can recieve a check and live without rent or utilities. On the other hand, you are never truly ""off the clock"" since you live on property."
bad,"The job was as described at the interview but there was never adequate staffing so employees were doing the work of two. Critical items such as Heat/AC and bathrooms when they went out of order took far too long to get work orders fulfilled. Schedules would change at the last moment and employees would be expected to alter their plans to accommodate. There are some great employees that I met, but after working there, I would neither work there again or store my belongings with them."
bad,"fun place to work and deal with the public, and driving sales. all of the work that  is required to do is way too much to manage and for a mere $10 an hr."
bad,"This company is not for anyone who has a life outside of this job. No room for advancement. You will work 5 days a week but you work every single weekend. You can have days off when they do not have a black out dates and no weekends. You DO get in trouble for faults they have with their company and rules. You will work in ALL weather. there could be 6 feet of snow outside and they will still have you come in there to work no matter what/ literally. This is not an inside job you will be doing alot of moving trash that people dont want. The DM's play favoritism and they do not care about you as a person. You brake you arm your fired they do not care. "
bad,No advancement or job security. Management is terrible. Company does not provide any training or support.
bad,"There was a lot of work to do in a day, with cleaning and renting units."
bad,"They do not pay nearly enough for all the work you do. They tell you one thing and then you look in the policy section and its completely different. They are terrible about finding district managers that actually care about their employees, and when they do the DM gets fired for some mysterious reason. I use to love my job but once you reach property manager the furthest you can go is KTP and not many of those are needed"
bad,"My district manager was great. Then you had to be ready for visits by a senior district manager, regional manager or some other manager from the corporate office. You better know your scripts and be ready to role-play, even though most middle and upper management didn't know the scripts verbatim like we were required. My regional manager was a true narcissist. The senior district manager had no clue how to deal with employees. My DM was a great guy but you could tell his hands were tied when it came to making a decision. Looks like all issues have to be filtered through the regional manager and he was too busy looking at himself in a mirror to respond in a timely manner. They want you to keep your property clean but they're unwilling to spend any money to make it happen. They expect us to haul away abandoned goods to the dumpster even when we're single-covered. The pay is OK. The benefits suck. Not a great job if you have trouble memorizing scripts."
bad,"the district managers work you hard so they can make their huge bonuses. employees also get bonuses but not on the scales as the DMs. I worked as the Property Manager for over 6 months at that location and my DM never gave me my raise, because that would have taken out of his budget, so he would have gotten lees of a monthly bonus."
bad,Management is inconsistent with expectations. Training district provide false sense of accomplishment in capabilities then you get assigned to district in chaos. Very little help and guidance.
bad,They don‚Äôt care about you or your well being. My boss is great. You have to do a lot of work for very little pay. Expect you to sell merchandise with every rental then they get mad if you don‚Äôt. They never give bonuses or raises. No room for growth.
bad,"This job is great for a starter job to get some experience. I would not recommend this job if you don't like to be micro managed. Company requires merchandise sales,  delinquency to be low, your annual review for raises is a joke. This company runs off great loyal employees due to no appreciation shown by them, also they make empty promises."
bad,"There is no opportunity for advancement with this company. I worked in North Hollywood, CA. Management is poor district manager. He lacks basic leadership skills, and people skills. Process always changes, and forced into scripts. If you are not a property manager ( I was) the job is not worth the job duties to compensation. Apartment benefit is great but relief managers best hope is getting a property, but after you receive a property not much room for advancement within the company no matter work performance and achievements. I graduated and tried to move up within the company and was quickly shut down from upper management when reaching out to upper management. This job is good for someone who is complacent with receiving enough to get by and never advance."
bad,Everything was fine until they changed the District Managers and he ended up not liking me due to having better numbers at my store then the rest of his district.
bad,This company is good for learning the ins and outs of storage only. If you are looking to get the title manager on your resume then its for you. ideal job for a student in college. If your looking for a career and advancement then seek elsewhere.
bad,The company was not employee friendly. Yhe was no bonuses for the employees only for the management. Lack of advancement within the company. There was no security on the premises.
bad,Public storage is not a good place to work they have unrealistic expectations on the employees . And the managers are very rude to employees . They pay very little for the amount of work you are required to do.
bad,"Public storage pays what their competitors pay yes, however they only go up if their competitors do. They give very little to no raises and the medical insurance there is costly. They do give PTO but they will always give yo a hassle about taking off. Even if you been there for a long while. I wouldn't mainly because they don't care to protect their employees to detour or prevent robberies. Some locations don't even have camera to see who attacked and robbed you. I would NEVER recommend working there. I am sorry i stayed as long as i did."
bad,"Management is not that great. A typical day can be very busy especially at the beginning of the month. You are expected to make a lot of phone calls to get customer to pay the storage bills or to try and rent units. You are also expected to sell moving supplies. The work environment can be tiresome. Walking around checking units, cleaning, units and just doing general inspections of property. I have encounter unwanted critters at times. The most enjoyable part of this job is interacting with people. I have gotten to meet some very interesting people, to include NBA player."
bad,"for less than $13.00/hr you practically run an entire property either by yourself or with 1-2 other people. renting out units, going though tons of paperwork, makng dozens of calls a week, cleaning out garbage people leave behind, walking the property completely at least once a day. taking care of transactions and deposits, going to the bank every day, and dont get me started on spiders. It takes leaps and bounds for things to get fixed around the property. Once people were breaking into cars/units while I was on shift, I knew I'd had enough"
bad,The month is planned out. From collection calls to auction days. Very little to no advancement passed property manager. Customers can be stressful do to their situations
bad,"This job is great for people who like being bored and scamming people out of money. They charge upwards of $20 just for a lock! Very pushy sales environment. Drama and gossip between employees, even though you rarely work with others. This place is for people who don't like to think, just sit around and waste time."
bad,It can be difficult to experience stability as there is a high turnover rate amongst field operations with min. training and follow up.
bad,"Management is almost abysmal besides the required ""scripts"" that all employees must learn. Advancement is nonexistent, do not expect pay raises or even COMMISSION for the merchandise sales/quotas they expect from you. You must be able to work alone and you must be able to multi-task and do all the required harassment calls PS wants you to do. Co-workers are hardly there with you, you work alone unless you're at a big property. The most enjoyable part of the job is the schedule stability, you work at 9:30 and come home at 6."
bad,"Often worked alone."
bad,"Every day we deal with several different people. Most are good calm customers but every single day there is a few who are verbally abusive. As employees we have to put up with that and take the abuse. They say it's equal opportunity but the fact of the matter is I don't believe it is. When your car breathes it's last breath you have to run to get a new one but management has no consideration for your other living expenses. It basically comes down to either you get a car and lose your home or keep your home and lose your job. However, there are other people who are employed that get to live on property with the property manager and own no vehicle. They have been like that for over 5 years and not one word is said to them about not owning a vehicle. The healthcare options offered with the company are ok but you get paid so low for what you have to do and put up with that it is a hit to your wallet. The best part of the job is the people you work closely with. Those who go through the struggle with you and always stand behind you."
bad,Public storage is a job you should apply for if you need a Job to get your financial issues.
bad,there is so much they want you to do in a typical day including leases and selling and google reviews. If you don't get a sale or google review you have to be on a conference call with the DM which takes 30 minutes away from what you need to get done. If you do not get all of your duties done you then get another call from the DM to which you have to tell him why you didn't get your duties done. they want you to keep up with the upkeep on the grounds I.E. taking care of abandoned goods and making sure things are clean. however will take their time to pay for maintenance on thing we cant do or will get upset if we hurt ourselves trying to do what they have told us to do.
bad,"Hired as a relief manager. All you can do is become a property manager, and go no higher. They cut your pay $2 and give you an apt on site, so you get to live at work. management is a bunch of sheisty number driven morons who don't care about anything but themselves. don't get stuck here. oh, and at some locations you literally clean up fecal matter. often."
bad,"loved working for public storage, gained lots of experience working with the public and handling everyday problems."
bad,"Depending on what you are looking for this can be an o.k. job. Your customer base is a WIDE range of customers. Some days were quiet and peaceful allowing you to work on the property or in the office,but most day's you just wanted to bang your head on the desk."
bad,"The job itself isn't bad. Work hours are your typical hours, 98% of your customers are decent enough people to deal with, you don't have a manager phyiscally breathing over your shoulder every moment, and PTO accrues quickly."
bad,"routine type job, handled customer's account, reporting balances, taking payments, reporting and solving problems.Management here were kind of a joke. their reviews were from outerspace, and disconnected. Managers changed like a revolving door. (later employees did too, this company has absolutely no respect for seniority) It was upsetting to see company fire regular employees on a regular basis. Company kept changing their tactics, had quite a few unhappy customers, along with unhappy workers, Company only seemed concerned with their bottomline/stockprices. All of my fellow employees except 1 were let go 6 months after I quit. No job stability whatsoever. Not a great job to make money at. you'll be working 6, sometimes 7 days a week, some months without any days off, and you still will not get paid overtime, company will not work you over 38 hrs a week. continuous calls coming in, absolutely no break in calls, one right after another ALL TIMES. Nature of business? all I remember is customers screaming about how badly Public Storage sucks, and they feel ripped off because they feel like it is unethical that PS changes their prices in the middle of a contract. (I agree with the customer, doesn't earn me any medals or brownie points!) I wa also refused a 12 cent raise my first year working there. I didn't stick around to be insulted the 2nd year. (lol)"
bad,Public Storage do not care for their customers nor their employes. The company is not truthful and when something happens they do not take the time to properly fix any sisuation unless it's going to hurt the company's name or a certain individual.
bad,The management at Public storage does not back there employees when it comes to customer relations. If a customer lies and says you did something then that's that and they will fire you. They don't stick up for you. There is no chance for advancement as they. Hire from outside for higher positions. Overall a horrible place to work.
bad,Job needs to compensate employees with more pay like other storage companies in the area. Maybe the turn over rate wouldn‚Äôt be so high. Also treat employees as if they are appreciated.
bad,Overall Public Storage is a great place to work if you like job security and you don't really have a lot of motivation to physical labor and it's great for someone who is in their older years or near retirement or retired with part time job are people with disabilities but they do not hire within you have to quit your job if you're part of the team to get rehired as district manager and there's not a lot of growth for wages people can be there for 10 years and stomach minimum wage but it's great for people who want to live in the public storage apartments that are attached they offices for people that need a place to live and all utilities are includedim
bad,"this is not a place for you if you want a career. They do not promote any higher than KTP on the field level. They don't take field employees who know the front line and move them up to district managers. This is something they should do but do not. They are constantly telling you to clean, even when you just cleaned your entire building. It's all about your sales. If your numbers aren't looking good they HOUND you to make them better. our number effect the bigger bosses bonuses, so it kinda makes sense now why they hound us, but they took our bonuses away. This place is just unfair, which is why I left."
bad,This job is scripted and very repetitive. The daily work operations is fairly simple. It just become too much when the upper management do not think realistic when it comes to customer services situations.
bad,Not for someone trying to make a living. It had good benefits and a few perks. You work by yourself most of the time. Felt like the management and co-workers treat you badly if your numbers are not where they want them to be. Really kind of sucks the life out of you. Not so bad hours. Great training. Good for someone who really loves sales and can handle a lot of stress.
bad,"Selling is a big aspect of the job, you have to sell units and  merchandise. Hours are good you can only get 39-38 hours a week in at 9:30 out by 6pm weekdays, 5pm weekends, they start you at $10 per hours. This is a good stepping point job to a better one but has no room for advancement. The highest a field employee is allowed to go is an A Property Manager and KTP(key training professional) They do not promote field employees to district manager or higher. We do not get commission, and our bonuses are once a year if you get one, and are based on numbers/if the higher ups feel they like you. If you have a family it is hard to just work here, having an emergency or needing to take time off is like pulling teeth. Some many people leave you never have enough help. All they care about is if you sell a lock, insurance, merchandise at the time of the rental and if you get a review, which might I add people have lost there jobs over."
bad,"As a former property manager, sacrificing life and family was a part of the job.  Totally unwilling to adjust scheduling.  However I was always expected to cover other employees who were lackluster to say the least.  "
bad,"Renting out storage units and selling packing merchandise. Not really something that i enjoyed so much, i decided to get a new career moving to brasil and took up teaching."
bad,"The most unprofessional environment in which I've EVER worked. Management is so far removed from the culture of employees within respective groups. The entire corporation is technologically illiterate."
bad,"a typical day at work included taking deposits to the bank, renting storage space, making collection phone calls, walking property and identifying unsafe conditions, light cleaning, restocking merchandise, meeting and greeting potiential customers and problem solving for currant customers. I learned to think twice before saying nothing. I learned to be a better listener to customer issues and problem solving. Management treated us like ten year old children, and constantly had us walking on eggshells to the point which we were hesitant approaching them with problems. When it came to coworkers , there was good mix, but to much gossiping . The hardest part of the job was dealing with our direct management . The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, we had a respect for one another, which led to a smooth overall operation."
bad,It was a great place when i first started with this company i loved the job and loved the people i worked with but once the new distract manager came into play he never trained on things that were being done wrong. I was mystery shopped and i know for a fact i never did anything wrong. The new distract manager was a jerk and would never hear me out. he is cold and has no clue what he is doing.
bad,I can easily say that this company had one of the smaller and more contained environments I ever worked in. So much that I actually made some pretty good friendships while working there with both management and representatives alike. I also really enjoyed my time working there my first year but the second year was plagued by issues. This was mainly due to the company constantly changing its structure based on the feedback of outside sources. So sales goals were constantly being changed forcing many employees to leave or be terminated. I went from hitting all of my sales goals right out of the gate to not meeting them at all without any real changes in my performance.
bad,"On a typical day you handle angry customers, rent units, and sell merchandise. You have to maintain the grounds and upkeep on the units. You make outbound collection calls."
bad,I loved working at Public Storage unfortunately when they couldn't work with my hours I left and got another job however that job didn't fall through as I thought it would have because of what they told me so I tried to go back to Public Storage they told me since I have not been employed for at least 6 months that I was not eligible for rehire I think that is totally unfair being that I was never late always completed my work one time and satisfied every single customer
bad,Hourly pay does not even come close to the amount of work done in a days work. Raises are very minimal if at all. Week work days are not rotated and employees are required to work major holidays.
bad,"You start making $9.50/hr. WOW!!! $9.50/hr?????? Really??? How the heck can you survive on $9.50/hr??? No room for advancement, The farthest you will move up in this company is a Property Manager, they make a terrible .50 cents more an hour."
bad,"Scripts/Sales/Goals are mandatory, overall typical corp  , you get 1% back for reward on good performance has to be 100% , the company always try to help you improve"
bad,"You live on site, which adds the cost of rent and electricity to a 10 dollar an hour job...basically an extra 900 dollars a month. However, the management treat you like you're an idiot, and they do not promote from within. Bonuses are non existent, and a joke. When I started there, the bonuses were up to $2.00 an hour for every hour you worked in the quarter. I just saw a job posting, and the bonuses are now up to 50 cents an hour for every hour worked in the quarter. Guarantee the upper management didn't get their bonuses cut!"
bad,"If you want to work like heck for a little over minimum wage, this is the job for you!! Managers have very high expectation, but the compensation does not match the workload and stress that comes along with the position. There is no advancement at this job and everyone is paid the same rate. No Bonuses!!"
bad,"They don‚Äôt value their employees that are in direct contact with their customers. That want us to keep focusing on our numbers but take our incentives away. This year will be the first year that I haven‚Äôt received a raise, granted the ones I did get were only 4%."
bad,"I worked as a relief manager for a year. Great experience as manager. Slow paced during the week busy weekends. If you worked in a small store it is good.  Collections, daily property checks, deposits, sales. Mangement can be very rude but co workers were ok. Worked for the largest Public Storage where District Manager was aware of a lot of illegitimate that were occuring but only gave warnings. Although there was drama i feel like it was stirred up by DM. Highest positon is Property Manager with possibility of live in apt which makes u somewhat 24 hr security."
bad,Good place to work for people who like to work different places daily and spend time outside in the heat and/or cold! Your coworkers are also considered your managers because they tell you what to do sometimes not so nice.
bad,Pay is locked in and not really room to advance within the company for long term employees. Employment is secure as long as you fo your job and the management was fair. Company does promote from within.
bad,it was a good  place to work. over al expirience was  good .i told alot if people about this company. i moved up in a little time. i recommend this company to
bad,The job had varied hours and job responsibility. A large focus was on sales and account management also upkeep of a storage facility. You were assigned a property to work and maintain.
bad,It's a good place to pick up some skills however there is no growth within the company. chances are you will get stuck at the bottom and stay there forever.
bad,"Great place to get the basics of the business down, but that's about it.  Poor benefits, poor pay and general lack of respect for their employees AND their customers."
bad,"The work day is never predictable, but that was not necessarily the con of the job. I can handle unpredictable to a certain degree.  The consumers vary by area and there are all levels of personalities.  I was able to brush up on my clerical skills and there was always an opportunity to advance my customer service skills.  The co-workers where happy with their job and did as little as possible to get through their days.  The co-workers for the most part did not show much drive to exceed in excellence.  The hardest part of the job was to various incidents that involved the police and out of control customers.  I like the hours with the exception of the weekend work.  It made it difficult to spend time with my family and my young step-daughter.  I had hoped that the hours would allow for more time with my family.  "
bad,all sales but no incentives. everything is based on what the district manager needs or the regional manager needs to get their bonuses. They talk down to you yet they dint take into account anything you say.
bad,Loved my job when I first started  but after awhile it became old as you have alot of repeat customers and to sell overpriced merch which is a requirement is not a fun thing to have to push onto someone when the customer knows. Making deliquent calls 3 x a month or more if in auction  and dealing with people who are mad about thing you have no control over but you are the one whose there and easy to get should of unlike customer service.
good,"Poor pay, poor management, poor safety and maintenance of it's properties. High expectations when given limited resources. Gossip and favoritism a huge negative factor."
good,"Help customers rent a storage unit."
good,"Overall it's a standard not-retail-but-retail job. You have customers who yell and swear, and then you have the ones who you want to be actual friends with. It's not a terrible place to work but the pay is ridiculously low for the profits they turn and what they expect."
good,"Opening the store and balancing from the night before. Assisting customers with sales, performing maintenance, performing job training. I learned patience, multitasking, management skills and diffusing difficult guests. The work place culture is dull. The hardest part of the job was being under staffed and over worked. The best part was being able to have low cost housing."
good,"You are the face to new tenents and customers however, you don't get much assistance from mangers. They are usually at other locations, on the road, or working at corporate office. There is no room for advancements and no career incentive. Even when I went to college for a degree, I had to quit my job since I was not able to complete my internship and still be an employee or lower my hours."
good,"Everyday was a good day on the job. I enjoyed being able to get to know the long time customers and even the short term customers. Being able to help them in their transitions from home to home, or even if it was just extra space to store household goods, always brighten up my day. I was able to work on my own or with a co-worker with little to no supervision from my supervisors because I knew what I was doing and what was expected of me. The hardest part of the job was hitting the goals set forth from our corporate offices when we were already at a high occupancy and had a high revenue intake."
good,"After working for Public Storage, I would have to say I would never recommend working for this company to a collegue or friend. Management is horrible. There is no training involved or resources to turn to. Pay was good and the other departments I dealt with had hard working, good employees. There is a fast turnover most departments in corporate and after working there I understand why."
good,My typical day at work  was to clean out storage units to prepare them for the new customers.  The people that I worked with at that time were nice people.
good,Good work experience learned a lot from the workplace. I learned how to over come very difficult situations and how to over come negative customers in a respectful manner.
good,My review on working at Publix storage is it was OK however there‚Äôs No working your way up the ladder. Meaning there‚Äôs no advancement with working at public storage. I would however recommend the job to someone that is really in need of work and a steady paycheck
good,"Hours were good"
good,The hours were long and tedious with the required calls to clients a pressure-cooker of frustration. The Environment was satisfactory but the work did not sufficiently challenge the intellect.
good,"Get on Yelp Google Reviews at the location you wish to inquire about and see what past and current customers have to say about the management, the facility, the rates, and the whatever else customers had to say about their experience"
good,"I did not feel that the company was concerned with it's employee's safety. Most of the time you will be working alone in the office and you are required to privately show the properties and units to customers at anytime during office hours. You will be expected to walk through basically an empty facility either indoor or outdoor despite the weather conditions and time of day. (Typically open 9:30-6) The hours aren't that bad but you will NOT have any weekends off and they only are closed Thanksgiving, New Years, and Christmas Day, expect to be working a FULL day any other holiday. Even though you will be managing an office, you will have 'retail' based days, meaning you'll always work the same hours, but never the same days. The pay is not sufficient in comparison to competing markets (lowest paying storage company) and they require more of their employees as well, even if they're paying less. They also have sales expectations and quotas they require to be met by their employees and do NOT offer any type of commission for their sales. They have a lot of expectations for how little they pay. There is no room for growth, they do NOT promote within. They expect their employees running the office to clean storage units and any mess that is left on the property, bulky furniture included."
good,A typical day at Public Storage was renting storage units to people that needed them and maintaining the property. I learned different things almost on a daily basis from different scripts we learned on different things that we handled daily. My District Manager was a pleasure to work for and he really cared about his employees and job. He was understanding and made sure you had help if you needed it. I do feel that there was not much job security because it is a corporation and they do not get to work with the employees on a level that the DM's do. I didnt feel that the job was hard you just had to be committed and willing to do the work. There was alot of busy days where you was on the go all day and I enjoyed those the most because I like to stay busy but when there was slow days I just found something to do to keep busy. I do feel that they could pay the employees more especially the way the economy is and when you have a family its hard to get by sometimes.
good,"Typical day of work would be opening up the property, printing daily reports, counting the cash and deposit, and calling all new reservations. I would like to say I learned a lot, but really didn't. The management is not terrible, but they ain't exactly the best. My co-workers was probably one of the best things of the place, even though half of the time you would be working alone. The hardest part of the job is the whole SELLING locks, insurance, etc. Management really gets on you for that, and I hate that if you don't do it right, they tell you than this ain't the place for you. I would recommend this job to anyone who needs pocket cash, because pay ain't all that great."
good,There is no room for advancement at Public Storage. Its just a place to work when you need a check.
good,Had to work outside a lot in all kinds of weather. Had to a lot delinquent call's. Lift 50 pound iced doors in winter and shovle a lot of snow.
good,"Follow procedure. Just follow procedure. Dont question, they know. Just follow procedure."
good,"I been with PS for a little under a year and a few things I will point out. It is a very high turnover rate. The job can be boring some days or hectic. I worked different locations but it is irritating when they randomly ask you to work in another district where you don‚Äôt know anybody a HOUR away AFTER you already budgeted your gas money around the schedule made. Everything you do is for the higher ups. Stuff that is out of your control they hold you accountable for. For example with reviews, they want you to harass people to give 5star reviews and then belittle us if someone states their 2 star opinion about how they raise the rent. 100% here is NEVER good enough. You have to be perfect every month or you will hear it. No bonuses no raises, just complaints. No comment on coworkers cause people are people but the person who handles my check is different. Worst part about this job is having to throw peoples stuff away after 0 bids after auction. Ashes, baby pictures, birth certificates, you name it. This job can make you bitter and non sympathetic if you let it. Me, that‚Äôs just not who I am so this job was never a good fit for me."
good,"Public Storage is good in the sense that you decide how your day to day goes. They do not promote from CSR. You can become a trainer or run an ‚ÄúA property‚Äù and that‚Äôs only a small bump to pay. They faded out bonuses and commissions but still expect you to make your sales mark. Using fear to motivate a sales staff does not work and affects morale. Management usually does not know what the Relief Manager and Property Manager struggle is and that is by design. They do offer onsite living from time to time but expect a heavy pay dock to 8.25 or 7.25 to compensate for your rent. So weigh that for your own situation. I like my job because I learn who my customers are and I get to decide when and how I do most things. But I don‚Äôt like the lack of promotion from within. People who have worked here 12 plus years, who would make great district managers still make 13.00 an hour and get no more than a pat on the back here and there. So if you‚Äôre looking for a place to grow, this ain‚Äôt it. But if you want stable, consistent hours this may work for you."
good,"I was promised a large bonus at the end of the year as long as I was the top salesman of the year. I worked really hard and got top salesman in my district for 10/12 months of the year. When I asked about the bonus, I was told that I was hired two days after the cut off. I had made them a lot of money for no reason. They knew what they did."
good,I loved my customer and there are some you have to work with. Be very detailed oriented working there. Always keep notes on everything don't miss a beat they are always watching.
good,"It is a nice and Quiet workplace, enough work hours, opportunities to meet great customers/tenants, yet there is NO Room for advancement and the pay wage is Low! We are under paid for the amount of work provided and expected."
good,Public storage over all is a good company. You will not make very much money. The people are great. Its just not a job you have to work very hard at. very easy
good,"The job itself is pretty simple depending on the district you work in. Out of the 8 hr day you really only do about 3 hrs of real work spread out through the day. Just sell the storage space the tnt needs. sell merch. maintain the cleanliness of the property. keep tnts happy. that's the job. Now depending on who your manager is and how the go about operating, may make these things I have listed easy or unnecessarily stressful. All in all its a cool job to learn from and move on when you have grasped the basic concepts to this job"
good,Management makes personal decisions verses business decisions. District manager hates his job and takes it out on anyone who does not kiss up to him...
good,"The day to day entails renting storage units and cleaning those who have moved out. Collection calls to customers who owe as well as reservation management for new customers. That is the easy part that any normal individual can handle. The downfall for this company is the pay, hands down! The employees are over worked and asked to do a lot of mundane tasks that simply is not achievable is certain instances. Raise the pay and simply get what you pay for, BETTER EMPLOYEES willing to do the work."
good,"It was good at first but after a while it was too intense constantly trying to get online reviews and meet certain quotas within the company itself.  They don't pay enough for the amount of work they expect to be done, little consideration for their employees and are very bad liars to customers and their employees"
good,the instruction I was given has often times lead me into chaos with customers. i have been in life threatening situations with customers who were given misleading info from another employee and i personally value my life much more. there is no security or guarantee of safety.
good,"I gained a lot of good training and skills working for Public Storage.  Unfortunately there is no room for advancement.  It is becoming more of a retail environment and you are expected to sell, sell, sell.  The hardest part of the job is some heavy cleaning and collections."
good,"Working as a field manager in Public Storage is not going to pay a living wage nor will it give a sense of fulfillment. Based on your level of intelligence and determination you will either find this job to be just barely suitable or not suitable at all. The company will recognize talent in selling, cleanliness and leadership but it will not always be promoted when favoritism is involved. Field corporate is lackadaisical on a regular basis and job security lies in who knows and likes you. If you're looking for a job to bolster a resume for a year or two then this is it, the hours are great and the benefits are on par with many other jobs. If you're looking for a job to challenge you or increase your knowledge in the workplace then look elsewhere, you can only go but so far in this company before you would have to quit and come back in to continue up the ladder. This job is not for the ambitious."
good,"Hours are ok but you can work any day of the week. OT based on two week period. You could work 9 days in a row but no OT. Performance based on sales of over priced locks, boxes and merchandise with no compensation on sales. Pressure to get instore Google reviews, quota required every month. No job advancement and low pay scale compared to competitors. Two days off a year open 7 days a week while some competitors closed on Sundays. Hard to get time off which you are required to arrange yourself. Some people have not had a vacation in two or three years. Good training provided and day to day operations delinquent calls are scripted. Dealing direct with public and will face unruly and unhappy customers at times. High turnaround on employees."
good,Public Storage was a great place to work for the experience only.
good,the best part of the job is the people. you met new people every day and it has a rewarding feeling of helping others
good,"Facility grounds needs to be cleaned up, due to trash from the main street which is pacific coast highway. Many units are in need of maintenance that have be fixed by professionals. Daily delinquency calls to tenants who are late in their monthly payments. We get constant irate tenants complaining about rent raise and other matters. We get a walk-in customers and customers by appointment."
good,"Well compensated at the DM level, but required to work potentially any day and any hours. Management is recruited from within, so no new ideas or processes. Everything is done only the PS way."
good,I absolutely loved being a property manager. Interacting with the public and helping them with their storage needs. However their are no raises or advancement in the company. And it could get a little competitive between stores.
good,they defiantly make you work your butt off for the job but are not good at rewarding those who are. The company as a large turnover and there is a reason
good,"Working at this company is not for those who need constant stimulation or tasks to complete. A majority of the working day will be spent waiting for customer to show up or a phone call to answer. Working here at a young age or with expectations of a fun work environment is not recommended. That being said if you are someone who needs a more laid back job or are becoming elderly this is a good choice of a job as it is not physically demanding. In some cases you will be working alone at a facility for your entire shift multiple days a week. Get used to being all alone and being very, very bored."
good,"Great co-workers, but high turn over with constant flip-flopping from the higher up and not all for the good of the worker or the customer. Good for a stepping stone."
good,"This company is not one that I would recommend to anyone that doesn't have good time management skills. You often work alone and they have you travelling to may different locations for the job. They do not pay enough and you cannot argue your pay amount. I learned a wide set of management skills, however, the lack of personal safety and care from upper management on the situation is down right sick. The most difficult part of this position is that they expect you to do the work of 3 people alone while also maintaining the property and customer service."
good,"Hard to disrobed the job, because I am never it the same public Storage place, because I float at different facilities. There are no words to describe what I do."
good,"You have a lot of free time during the colder seasons, but once it starts to get warm out, you will have a lot of rentals and have to clean the property almost daily. You also have to make sometimes up to 125 calls to delinquent customers in about 4 days. You also are required to sell to customers, even if they don't have the money to spend. Also, management has told us that if our numbers don't get better, they will have to take more ""serious action"". Serious action, as in, firing people? For their numbers, which are determined off of your customers and if they get insurance, if they buy merchandise, and if they buy a lock from us. All PS wants to do is get as much money out of our customers as they can."
good,The first and last day of the month are the hardest ones because there are a lot of move in/out customers. Collection calls are made on a weekly basis. You are responsible for keeping the facility clean on a daily basis. Too many responsibilities involved on running a rental office. Days off are on weekdays and have to work weekends all the time but  a Property Manager has Sunday and Monday off.
good,"No room for growth.  Less and less time given in a day to devote to actual customer service.  I am required to seek out the needs of my customers with what they are storing and get the best storage unit for the best price for them and sell them supplies to meet their needs.  This is the part of my job that is wonderful.  I am required to make collection calls regarding unpaid rents to many many customers, again not a problem.  I am required to do security checks on the grounds as well as clean and maintain empty units and remove rubbish people leave behind, while maintaining the office and a smile.  This is not always very easy.  99% of my customers are my very favorite part of the job.  I also assist via phone, coworkers.  I am safety captain for 11 stores and supply captain as well."
good,"If you choose to work for Public Storage it is important that you realize it should be to grow your management experience only. It is not a long term career because there are currently only 2 positions for lower level employees: Relief Manager and Property Manager."
good,Low starting pay with little or no chance for advancement in the company. No freedom to make decisions. Must follow script to the letter.Sometimes required to work at different locations on short notice.
good,management is always on your case for something.  they continually change the compensation plan and reduce the amount of commission you can earn.  you receive no yearly raises and there is no room for advancement.
good,"Managed 14-17 agents on a team including attendance, adherence, 4 QA reports monthly, On going sales and customer service training behaviors and skills. Create positive work atmosphere on a daily basis."
good,The people that you work with are very nice but no raises or advancement.
good,"For someone with no property management experience, Public Storage might be a valid place to begin a career. However, anyone with any experience should probably think twice. Public Storage will train you to manage a retail store and storage property on a very basic level. Most of the job is very basic and you will be doing a lot of collection calls, customer service calls and sales calls. These calls will take up nearly a third of your time on some properties. My problem with Public Storage came from the fact that District Managers were very rarely (if ever) hired from within. That means that you will likely never, ever be anything than a very low payed store manager. So if you can work for less than ten dollars an hour for years on end,  and have no previous management experience, then this could be the job for you. Otherwise you would do well to find other employment."
good,"Good company to work for and room for advancement, but life always at risk of danger due to the environment of locations. This company is known for always been robbed and theft of merchandise. It was great working there but the customers that come in are always ready for a battle and confrontation about prices and merchandise.  The pay was average, min wage. "
good,overall pretty good company. I would recommend to anyone with sales experience.
good,"It was truly a pleasure working for Public Storage. The company was number 1 in their field and it felt good being a part of successful team. It is unfortunate that they do not offer career advancement and annually changed incentive goals/strategies. I got along well with my peers, as well as management. I learned a lot about the storage industry and how customers benefit from our service."
good,"Working with frontline workers, customers and vendors. Managing employees, schedules, customer concerns, sales, audits, auctions, responsible for end results against goals set by corporate."
good,"The company itself is a good company, but they are flawed. The amount of work you are required to do does not add up to the amount you are paid. There is no room for growth and it takes weeks for ""management "" so help respond on an issue,(not solve it)."
good,"High turnover rate, constantly left at locations without backup. Stressful during the beginning and end of month. Felt as though working multiple jobs for minimum wage. Had to work front desk, assist customers, make appointment and collection calls, process paperwork and payments, make deposits, inspect entire property daily, clean entire property daily. Properties were huge. They say 9-6 but expect you to stay after if customers come in. Repeatedly left an hour late."
good,"The company culture stressed sales and collections of delinquent accounts, but didn't really provide the tools necessary to get the job done.  There are a LOT of chiefs in the corporate structure of the company, and they are all so incredibly detached from the actual day-to-day business, never having worked at lower levels in Public Storage and always being hired from outside the company.  That mentality left a huge gap between the monogramed-shirt-wearing hierarchy flying-in on their private jets to tell you you should sell more bubble wrap, and the people who were paid minimum-wage to sweep out filthy storage units..."
good,"If you are trying to move up in rank and make a career, this is not the company for you. They do not promote from within period. My only other complaint is that the units are not properly maintained and often customers experience water damage when storing for long periods of time"
good,It was a relaxed place to work when the area supervisor didn't come in. Loved working with the public great co-workers. Good hours. Got to work inside and outside.
good,"enjoyed working with customers, management did great. productive and fun work place.  No holiday Pay, short staffed, no breaks, not providing the right tools to do the job. best part of my job was meeting new customers."
good,The biggest publicly traded company who pays the least in the industry and demands more then the other companies. no room for individuality in customer service. you are given a script and taught to learn it...droid comes to mind.
good,"Self storage management couple means managing the daily operations of the local self storage facility your assigned with your co-worker. You will be reporting to a District Manager, or for a smaller properties directly to the owners of the property manger."
good,"Public storage as a company does not care for there employees. They expect you to clean office/property clean out units all without being out the office more than 15mins. Customers will threaten your life and management will require you to rent to them. They do not offer any comission but expect you to sale merch to every customer, also took away bonuses and raises. You can not grow with in the company"
good,"Managed very well but the pay could be better to match the work expectations. Full filling public storage needs, are always met on my part, because I put all of my effort and take pride in my work duties"
good,"the Job is not too bad, there is lots to learn, lots of teamwork involved, districts work in conjunction.The best benefit is the apartment and the worst thing is the lack of recognition and advancement. I appreciate all the blessings but I'm feeling trapped lately."
good,"NO work and personal life balance, Culture was very poor, leadership talk down to employees and lower management. Good pay."
good,"PS is the largest self storage company in the world with over 2200 facilities within the US alone.  I worked as a construction manager for almost 7 years managing over new construction, renovations and acquisitions for much of the Northeast and Mid Atlantic,  While the company is financially in good standing and growing, there was an increasing imbalance between work and personal,  The amount of projects, the time required to manage and travel, the turnover in the company created a very difficult working environment."
good,"My typical day at work consists of opening the store and updating all reports such as sales report, delinquent report petty cash report and inventory reports. Go outside and check the property for any safety issues and to make sure that property is secured. If any space is found without any security, the customer is contacted immediately. All delinquent customers are called. Made courtesy calls to existing customers. Making sales. Creating new account for 1st time customers and reoccurring customers, etc. I learned that there is a lot of effort in working with the public. Out of six years with the company, I have only 1 really bad experience with a customer. When I was first hired, the management was good. The company was becoming more customer oriented. As time went on, the company became more numbers oriented. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the change of customer oriented business to a numbers oriented business. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and satisfying their needs."
good,Public Storage is a very busy place to work especially as the property has more units. I enjoyed my team yet I couldn't understand why they kept changing management from the outside when they have employees that are qualified to be management. The pay is not feasible to all the work that is required. I learned a lot from upper management who actually cared about those below them instead of just the numbers to be reached. I dislike how no property is run the same though it is supposed to. I disliked having to use port potties and not having a break room or an area eat lunch. The policies & procedures change so often its difficult to learn a retain plus execute all the changes.
good,The company has room to grow but the local manager informed me that in that area there was not advancement pass my position.
good,"Public Storage is a large company. It is very easy job in Public Storage. All day i just had to sit and wait for people. I learned in Public Storage how to sign contracts with customers. Most important and difficult part of the job was to convince people to sign the contract or make the reservation at least, so we can get them back after few days."
good,"Beginning and Ending of the month are super busy, lots of paperwork on a daily basis, middle of the month is slow. District Manager is awesome. Hardest part of job is memorizing scripts that do not fit customers needs and continuous changes in policy that are not always relayed to employees. Most enjoyable part of job is customers, the good and bad and actually helping customers with their storage needs"
good,It all depends on your manager and you have to deal with a lot of out door work 
good,"Public storage is a good job just needs to pay more, and not make their workers uncomfortable about doing things that would bother the way people see with character. It seems to be more about money then customer service at times"
good,No room for advancement. Low wage salary. Nice managers. Some housing. Customers are usually nice and friendly. Google reviews important regulators of work
good,"Whatever salary you are hired as, you‚Äôre stuck with it until you leave. There‚Äôs a lot to do with this job that makes you feel like you just don‚Äôt get paid enough. You‚Äôre a handyman, Salesman, Collector, Manager, and more. A day as a relief manager or property manager involves bank runs, collection calls, renting spaces, cleaning spaces, cleaning bathrooms, fixing security gates, fixing doors for guests that won‚Äôt open, fixing computers and printers that won‚Äôt work, keeping up with file cabinets filled with paperwork, walking the entire property 3-5 times a day, risking safety since you‚Äôre alone 100% of the time unless you‚Äôre training  (guests sometimes get physical and it‚Äôs just the 2 of you) and more. When you start off you may be jumping stores from city to city for coverage. If something breaks it‚Äôs up to you to fix it if it comes in between your job duties and online task list because maintenance may take months to come fix it. It‚Äôs a lot of work for little pay but it can be great working by yourself if you‚Äôre like me"
good,"They hire one person to do a three man job. They expect you to make calls to all there deliquent customers on a daily, clean around the property and clean all empty storage unit and then sell storage and merchandise, all in a 8 hour shift. There value system is profit above honesty and dignity. Their main priority and to get the sell. They watch they profit value on a daily and encourage the employees to do the same. There is little opportunatety for promotion or growth. I have not seen any one of color apart of the general management team or regional manager."
good,"No training provided, the skills you bring in are the skills you will leave with. No raises above 3%, you will pay heavily for your benefits, and although you are provided with Vacation time, you will no be able to user more than 1 week at a time."
good,"This company is okay, there are plenty faults such as staffing issues, being able to get the time off even if requested 2-3months in advance. The way they have to go to get something fixed at a property is way more difficult than it should be."
good,Training is adequate but not long enough to learn the job. On the job training is good. The pay for the job stinks. The benefits are quite decent. Customer service experience is a plus!
good,This company has great benefits. The hours are ok also. Far as the job itself is not worth the pay. Security is another issue at a couple of the locations.
good,"As a store manager, you are required to do everything. Outside in the Florida heat and bugs cleaning units and showing units. Majority is outside. You work alone."
good,The hours were good but the company showed alot of favoritism and promotions were only offered to the DMs favorite employees. They were not fair when it came to alot of decisions made.
good,"Daily customer service and collections."
good,I was responsible for renting out storage units to new customers and also maintaining the pre existing tenants. Sales for merchandise. Customer service
good,The storage industry is good industry for a first time job in a relaxed atmosphere. Its also good for those looking to retire soon and would like a laid back environment.
good,"Work was easy as long as you don't miss daily job duties"
good,Was a tough job taking over a location where the prior manager stopped working and left me with a mess. Regional manager was clueless to anyone except for the manager he was having an affair with. My experience was not the great but others have had a different experience and have been the manager for the same location for over 20 years.
good,"I worked at public storage for quite some time and the company use to have great incentives and it was a fun environment. They recently took away the bonus program and all they care about is making sure you hit the goals so the upper management gets there bonus. If you speak to a higher up they don't do anything to help and support you.  No appreciation for hard work and it's never good enough.  It use to be fun,  but things got so demanding with lack of steady workers that was required. The weight and pressure fell upon me.  I expressed I wasn't happy because I needed help.  Nothing was done to support me."
good,I was able to work independently and there was opportunities for housing through the company. Their is much room for growth because the job title and independence were what I appreciated the most.
good,Is great for people that like to work alone sometimes and enjoy customer service work but it isn't paying a lot for the amount if work expected to do.
good,This was an upbeat fast paced multi tasking job. You build relationships with customers as they face a transition period in their lives.
good,"I was a Store Manager in Orlando, FL starting pay was 9hr as a sub and got to store manger not making much more getting paid semi monthly. it is a self starting job and fairly easy you are only really busy at the start and the end of the month."
good,"The daily hours were great.  The job itself was interesting, meeting many people.  And able to help them out when they needed a storage solution.  "
good,"Typical day is lock checks, rate verification, signage placement, bank and post office runs. Tenant rate management and delinquencies, curb appeal, storage rentals and merchandise sales and inventory replenishing, coordinate with vendors to make repairs or upgrades. Inspect and log equipment, both truck rental equipment and facilities equipment,  golf cart and hand tools. Rent units and sell merchandise.  I feel it is very important to interact with all of the tenants and get to know what it is they are interested in and end up being able to help them with knowledge of products or services offered the tenant may not have been aware of like insurance or hand cart/dolly rental available, suggest merchandise, mattress/furniture covers, they forgot about during the rental process."
good,"Public Storage is okay to work at.  If you are good at sales tactics then this would be a good job for you however there are ZERO opportunities for advancement. Public Storage does not hire from within. The best you can get to is the district trainer but there is only one per district so the chances of becoming a trainer are very slim.  As my own district manager told me, this job is not something you stay in long-term.  They really don't expect you to stick around more than a year and not many people do.  "
good,"there is alot that you can learn at this job, you ll get plenty of work experience, they will provide housing if availible, you will get alot of face to face interaction with customers, and also will gain alot o customer service experience"
good,"You are expected to do so much and meet ridiculous sales quotas without any motivation. Pays barely over minimum wage and this job is a lot more demanding than min. wage. My days off were Tuesdays and Wednesdays, never the weekend. You do not get to work with coworkers, you are always by yourself and constantly have to deal with threatening angry customers."
good,"If your looking for a job that is laid back and you dont want to be on your feet a lot and prefer to be in the office, public storage is great. Atypical day at public storage is quite slow so you are in the office majority of the day. There are time where you have o walk to the property to check things out and clean up after some tenant. There is no hard part about the job, it is pretty straight forward. Public storage has set hours so if you are in school or working another job public storage is good to work for."
good,I liked working a public storage. I got to work one on one with customers. Although the area I worked in was not the greatest I loved going to work everyday. 
good,"Its was a nice commute to work everyday, 3 steps. I enjoyed my renters and helping them with their moving needs."
good,"I was hired as a Resident Property Manager for Public Storage. My responsibilities included renting storage units, property maintenance, book keeping, audits, auction coordination, and of course stellar customer service. I ranked #1 in my region four months in a row once. I left this job because I was ready for career advancement and was advised by my District Manager that the company only hires District Managers from outside of the company."
good,As a relief manager your in charge of opening and closing the business. at the end of the day i felt good and needed.
good,"This is the kind of job you have while looking for something long-term. They are by far the largest storage company but pay less then their smallest competitors and health insurance deductible are way to high. This is a sales job (Locks, insurance, merchandise) without commission and bonuses go to management. The units rent themselves due to incredible demand. The job itself is fine. You will have to talk down angry tenants who get rate increases since at the time of lease they don't want you to discuss anything other than when tenants next rent payment is due. If you want to work in the storage business and can't get hired by anyone else, this is the place for you."
good,"The job is ok if you live close near by. If you have to travel for an hour or 2 than don't work here, you'll be tired. The DM's are all different on how they operate there area, you might get lucky and have a good DM. The whole sale aspect is what got me to leave. If you do your job right you'll be fine, but once they start talking about your numbers falling then it's a pain. But other than that it hard to get fired for anything because you won't be doing anything that can get you fired. It's a long term job if you let it be."
good,PS does not give merit or cost of living raises and weekends are mandatory. They do have good benefits if that is all you need. Overall. I am not happy here
good,The job is 50% janitor and 50% customer service. Co-workers good.. HR unhelpful. Minimum support from the management who do not appreciate your opinion.
good,i open up the store everyday at 9:30 and proceeded to go sown the checklist of tasks: provide customer service for customers needing to make payments and also rent storage units. close store to do daily bank run from deposits day before. I cleaned the office space and bathrooms daily for customers. daily trash pick up on the property...Host monthly auctions for goods sold...cleaned abandoned goods out of units..Daily lock checks
good,"Job is spent maintaining and fixing issues whether it be changing a light bulb or sweeping the floors, making sure the bathroom is clean and the hallways of the property is clean as well. Makes a big difference."
good,"It over all okay job. You need to know how to work individually with no supervision. You need have good communication skills, problem solving skills and be well organized."
good,Personally I feel that public storage is a better suited job for people who are retired or have more time to spare.Time between this job and your personal life it can be a bit of a juggle.
good,"There is no backing from Management , facilities are in poor conditions, there i no chance in advancement, You must hit your numbers no matter, Google reviews are a hit or miss but they require you to get them."
good,"Easy job overall. I was over qualified and certain management issues were not handled professionally. I have high expectations from a company that they did not meet. Overall, good work experience if you can lead your own path within a diverse group."
good,"Provides a variety of work demanding a variety of skills.  Great opportunity to enhance customer relations skills.  No opportunity for advancement beyond becoming a trainer, which comprises less than 5% of the employee base."
good,"No opportunity for advancement, standard policy is to have the employee resign their employment and then apply for the job desired,  "
good,"It was fun and I liked it, what I didn't like was that you have to drive so far for training. I applied to work on Georgetown. They never have enough employees to work where their suppose to and want u to go work all over the city which is what I didn't sign up for."
good,A typical day at Public Storage consists of renting storage units to customers who have made a reservation or walk into the office gathering information. You're also making calls though the week either to customer who have rented the previous month or customers who have yet to make their monthly rent payment. Some things I've learned is that each state has its own rules on when a customers unit enters the lien stage and when it can be auctioned off. The people I work with are great. The hardest part of the job is making calls to customers who are behind on their rent.
good,"The hardest part of work were the the bugs, cleaning the storage facility could become dreadful if you have a 10x30 that moves out but doesn't clean out anything and you're on your own."
good,Public Storage is a company that is all business for the customers  but does not give the employees the benefit of their work like always the customers are always right.
good,Job becomes more selling than management.  Retail days schedule with no recognition for management skills - only sales.
good,This job is okay but no where to grow I am happy for but not for long term. You have to be a self-starter there is no one there over your shoulder.
good,"arrive- opening operations, bank run, a couple rentals, lock check, clean and maintain the property, daily paperwork, collection calls, collect payments, handle vacates, closing operations, "
good,If you want a company all they care about is getting numbers when you are not getting move ins. They dont care about their employees.
good,"Rent storage units, and sell moving supplies. Clean and maintain property."
good,"Nice big properties, You can feel pressure even before you star your shift, and when you open the doors you are on your own, many times my partner did not show up to work and I had to sweep, mop, rent spaces, trucks, clean, type, answer the phone, and be ready to answer call from your superiors. Asking for numbers and all things related with the property. It was hard but good because you had to do your 110% to solve any problem and put your abilities to work of course no with the professionalism that you wish. But at the end I learned a different way to work."
good,I would love to work here again. Nice and laid back not too much more to say.
good,Ok Place to work ....this company has strong values and rules and regulations they want you to follow.
good,"Like U-store-It, Public Storage had the right idea. Great customer service skills, knowledge of what the customer needs was, but began focusing more on the companies pockets than the customers. I don't have much more to say about public storage other than it was a good starting point for me."
good,"The typical workday was fast paced, daily duties, paperwork, appointments, and customer service calls. I took away from this job a better awareness of time management and productivity. District Manager and Property Managers were very involved and willing. Co workers understood the common goals and worked as a team to achieve them. There was not one thing hard about this position. The most enjoyable part of this job are my co workers and district manager made it a wonderful environment to be in."
good,Working at public storage I have gained alot of managerial experience.I was able to work independently and with a team. Ive been able to gain excellent customer service experience as well.
good,The company ask more from you and won't compensate you for it. If you want to work in the storage industry it can give some experience and then venture off to another that will show more appreciation for your hard work.
good,"Not a bad place to work, some times very fast paced. Very low payment, the customers are pretty bad some times. Lots of cleaning. The summer is particularly bad time to work here in Houston. Some of the properties are only outside buildings with no AC and it is very hard to clean in 110+ F. Very pushy with all the merchandise sales, but the employees don't get any bonus or commission for them."
good,Ok place to work. Pay sucks and property manager think they the head boss. But overall it‚Äôs a good place to work at. Training was easy and you get paid for mileage.
good,I loved the people just felt under paid for everything we were required to do. We did everything from opening the store then running day to day operations and then closing the store. Everything in between from taking care of customers and cleaning the property.
good,"Even after hitting goals, the upper management saw it fit to remove yearly bonuses for field employees, but kept their own bonuses 'because they deserved it.' They expected us to keep working at the same level without recognition."
good,"Interview went well. Move around to different locations. Cleaning buildings and inventory supply, in of the month closing, bank deposits, Relief at different stores."
good,"Must like working in the storage industry, in order to be able to do a days work for this company. The hardest part of the job would be the customer calls, the easiest part of the job is the flexible schedule."
good,"Overall decent company to work for. Daytime hours. Decent benefits, but extremely low pay for Property Manager position. Does not promote from within. No opportunity for raises."
good,"This company offers the oppurtunity to live on site, if you get promoted. However, promotion is seldom, due to the fact that there are very few properties with apartments, and when they do open up it is very hard to get in because many people also apply for the position."
good,Stressful....lots of hard work pretty much you are your own boss set schedule very nice District Manager. Paid time off and paid time Illness. Overall ok job. No advancement.
good,"Public Storage is a great company to work for.  The job is not hard at all and has its perks as well as downfalls.  There is no room for growth/advancement so once you get hired, that is your position for the length of employment.  You may get promoted to property manager or trainer, but the compensation is not much at all.  Management is fantastic, but once again, the biggest downfall of working for this company is that you cannot advance and grow."
good,"The only way to get a raise is how much merchandise you sell and try to meet your quota for the month and the more money they make the better the company, but I don't no how they do for raises and how much of a raise they give,"
good,It is good to work there as you can live on site but that is not what it's all cracked up to be.  I was the youngest property live on site manager and had the cleanest property but still was bullied by DM.
good,this company was low paying salary. other than that it was a nice atmosphere to work. customers was nice to speak to. managers was nice. we got good bonus.
good,"Public Storage has a sterile environment due to  among other things the ""scripts"" that must be followed for customer interactions.  The reliance on the scripts creates a robotic, sterile atmosphere."
good,"Rent storage units did leases, answer phones, take payments, and get units ready for auction. Most of the time we would sit and wait on people to come in. Way to much down time."
good,"The job itself is super easy and can be fun assisting people in a transitional period, as this is when people typically need storage. The pay is not ideal for this job but you can gain skills that are beneficial to take into other employment areas."
good,"Public storage does not promote form within for district manager positions, raises are also not available. Stuck the rest of your working life here making the same wage and never going anywhere."
good,"Good to get property management experience but you will be under paid for all the work you have to do, no bonuses, no raises, and no way to move up into corporate as they do not hire within the company. Corporate does not care about how the property managers are treated and if your a horrible employee that deserves to be fired they will never do it because they are always desperate to keep you."
good,"Overlook daily operations, sold insurance policies with month to month lease. set up appointments  received payments. made bank deposits, called delinquent account holders, sales and customer services."
good,"Workplace drama,alot ofgossiping,unprofessionalism,not alot of understanding when emergencies come up ie: deaths,sicknesses,family situations.Better pay would be nice for what was expected from bosses."
good,This job is perfect for somebody who's just looking for a job if passed away time maybe finish school and look for something else to do you can't really move up so it's hard to see if future in it especially with the pay being solo
good,A typical day at work involved taking payments and helping customers decide which storage unit works best for them. Cleaning was also apart of my everyday schedule. Because public storage doesn't promote from with in no future was available in the company.
good,"I love this job and what I do. Daily responsibilities, fast paced, customers are awesome for the situations they have to go through. The company on the other hand lies and is deceitful and I do not feel that management has the right to bully employees to get what they want out of them. I was brought up on respect and honesty and will continue to look to find that."
good,"decent place to work if in between jobs no advancement from within"
good,Company does not promote from within. They would rather hire district managers from outside of company that Property Managers have to train. Property Managers are over worked and under paid
good,I feel like the salary is not enough for the type of work given. You'll have to do everything(as expected) but all by yourself. You have to clean the area while keeping an eye at the office.
good,Make collection calls. Do a lock check. Process payments. Clean the property and units. Sell merchandise. Give a tour of the property to new customers.
good,"Work long hours and for not much pay. Management Team was great but, work life balance was not there. Enjoyed interaction with customers and vendors. Like my staff."
good,"Well paying job with long lasting hours. You work about 6 to 10 hours at the most everyday of the week, usually from Monday through Friday. The only thing is the work isn't easy."
good,i was always busy and I enjoyed that.  the main reason for my departure is the pay. I liked the people I worked with but we all agree pay us !! Work enviorment was terrible.
good,"I liked working for Public storage, it was a great place to get experience as a property manager. Public Storage had a great environment and co-workers were excellent."
good,"Public Storage is a Company that does not allow their Property Managers additional training or advancement. "
good,"Been with Public Storage for a few months and I must say it is a ""okay"" job but you really have to do everything to make sure everyone is happy around you. Nothing is wrong with that but I do feel that as a employee for the company you should not be doing everything and anything certain people should be in charge for different things."
good,"Decent pay, a lot of hours, they say no nights and weekends, but customers and employees call all of hours of the day/night, your number is posted publicly at the counter for customers to call.  They keep suburban pay same as city pay, so if you get a job with them in a city, your employee base is sub standard as compared to surrounding talent.  The company moves slowly and deliberate, so it can be frustrating with old infrastructure and systems."
good,If u like working alone...most properties only one person....i enjoy my work and most of the customers are great...but the pay rate for what we do is not enough.
good,Rental storage and transporting rental and long distance trucks to other locations. Responsible for cleaning of storage units.Responsible for rental trucks being cleaned out by the retail manager. Very hands on.
good,"Managed day to day operations of multi million dollar operations including but not limited to securing rentals, monthly payments, and merchandise in accordance with directions from Corporate Office."
good,"Overall, the company gives it's employees lots of freedom and independence; however the environment can be very sales driven and filled with pressure to meet certain goals."
good,"‚Ä¢	Negotiated pricing and fees, while ensuring the continuation and enhancements of services. "
good,"After over 6 years working with the company, I had reached the highest position I could as a field level employee.  I reached this position before my 3 year mark,  so I had been in the same place for over 3 years with no hope or goal of being challenged and doing something that would be more pay and lead to growth.  If you don't mind not ever being able to get another promotion after 2 steps up then it's a great job.  Flexibility is awesome,  pay is decent for the work you do.  However, bonus structure is set up that only property managers are likely to bonus and most  get the minimum amount,  if they are lucky enough to get anything."
good,"Easy business to work for to build up experience for your resume, wouldn't make it a career choice though. Pay rate is average would be better if it was raised to at least $11. Management is good and easily accessible."
good,I enjoy the customers at my workplace.  The management at the job is okay.  The job culture is unfair the company does not always look out for the employees needs.
good,"The organization definitely gave me the freedom to manage and build my managerial skills, as upper management is barely present and are sometimes hard to contact. I felt safe in all of the locations that I worked in. There are very few opportunities to advance within this organization and that is why I didn't consider this a career option. There were not many company events within the districts that you worked and therefore the disconnect from other employees is very real."
good,Working alone was nice at times. Not having to worry about other people watch your every move. District management wasn't the best.  When working with others was nice cause u have extra coverage when you need to work on other things.
good,"Property Manager must complete daily task about the property.  Customer service.  Assist customers with payments, unit size and availability.  Cash handling and bank deposits."
good,The job doesn't allow you to advance once you become a property manager. There is a bonus once a year but not every is not guaranteed to get it. There is the same office hours daily but your off days vary.
good,"Again, I like working with my customers and helping them. I help each customer determine their storage needs and insurance needs. Management is professional and the co-workers were helpful. The hardest part about my job was telling people no and the most enjoyable part was helping my customers."
good,"It was my first experience living on-site which, I guess was ok. All of the people in the district worked well together but didn't have much of a Distric Mgr."
good,"management was very rude. The pay was very poor . there's absolutely no room for growth, the District Manager, 'was very unprofessional when communicating with their Managers, and the customers. When following the company's policies, the District Managers wanted their Employees to go again ts them."
good,if you like working out doors this is the job for you. there is a little cleaning and you get a chance to meet interesting people.
good,This job was too labor intensive and would not provide full-time status. It was not in the medical field. Management was not professional.
good,Great place to work. Enjoy working with various customers (in person as well as via phone calls). No opportunity to grow.
good,Public storage management have never been on top of things like they should be. They rely to much on the co-workers especially when it comes to bank runs and certain things management should be in control of
good,Learned a lot but wasn't happy with the schedule. You would always get the same days off. Enjoyed the auctions and enjoyed the fact that I was always home at the same time every night for my kids.
good,The job itself is not complicated but the goals you have to meet can be more than challenging as they are set extremely high. Most customers are friendly depending on the area you work in but otherwise can be difficult or even abusive.  Not a great deal of management support but the team you work with are usually helpful.  Lots of physical work cleaning and maintaining units and lots of demands for sales numbers.  Most of the time it is not complicated but occasionally problems arise that you will get little upper management support dealing with.  If you are capable of handling crises on your own you will flourish in this job.
good,doing everyday maintance of property also taking payments doing leases and selling merchandise.handling customer problems and helping to resolve the problem.working with other employees and doing phone calls.
good,"Long and unhappy. "
good,"No one enjoys moving, so it's always a good feeling to know you were able to help someone in a stressful time."
good,you learn a lot the hours are long but its a good place to work. you meet a lot of people and you can go far in the company
good,"just did not have the right management in charge. hired people that didnt know what they were doing, but the pay was good at 15 an hour plus bonuses"
good,"A day at Public Storage includes helping customers, via phone and walk in, cash handling and generating new customers. I am able to work indoor and outdoor. I clean units and property everyday and maintain a high level of security. Responsible for documenting all communication between manger and customer. Keep District Manager up to speed on daily operations of property. I have become more confident to present and sale services and merchandise. Co-workers  are an essential part of the job to help you  with questions to policy or customer questions.The hardest part of the job is meeting required percentages of merchandise sales, delinquent accounts and rented spaces. The most enjoyable part is being able to help people in a time of need."
good,"Did not like to rent trucks. Ok workplace."
good,I enjoyed working at Public Storage I just didn't like being there by myself when customers came in to pay their rent.
good,"a typical day hanging clothes, fixing fixtures and ringing out customers."
good,"In a typical day we would make phone calls, clean units, keep up office tasks, help customers rent units, fill out lease agreements, and take payments. Management was the district and area managers, Relief and property managers worked on the property. Work days may not always include other employees."
good,This is a very fast paced environment. I have learned how to assist many customers at 1 time. I have also learned many tasks to help reach a monthly goal. The management could be better. I loved all of my co-workers we were a family. The hardest part of the job is trying to please customers who do not want your help. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing at the end of the work day I have done my job properly and helped as many customers as I could.
good,"Laid back job. No type of advancement. Low pay, compared to other companies in the same industry. They push you to sell, sell, sell, with some shady sales practices, that eventually will make you not want to sell for them. I could go on and on. The only other benefit may be the onsite apartment, but beware you may feel stuck, once you realize how much cheaper it is than renting an apartment elsewhere."
good,I learn how to handle a property also by able to multi-task more always being busy deal with all kind off customers. How to explain a rental leased agreement. Once on a while was enjoyable to work making it a fun day for the team and the customers.
good,"Worked inside the office and out on the property"
good,Overall a good company but has very high turnover. Very goos flexibility in schedule and average pay / benefits.
good,I enjoyed meeting new customer's daily. The work load was light and there were a  variety of job duties that kept my attention and made the shift pass.
good,"pay isnt the greatest, co workers are great. Management tends to micro manage"
good,"Located in glendale, it was an experience that helped me grow in the field."
good,Great sales supervisors and sales floor. The company is constantly changing for the worst.
good,this job was very challenging due to dealing with the irate customers. for the pay that went with the job and its duties it was not worth it. the most enjoyable part of this job was clocking out everyday.
good,"Property manager of large storage facility in charge of all customer activity: customer service/problem resolution, accounts receivable, leasing, sales, inventory control, core standard audits, collections, scheduling"
good,Great company as in flexibility with life but strenuous at times while working on simultaneous projects. No room for advancement whatsoever.. Most of the mid exec level were hired from the outside. Job security is always going to be an issue so i see no point in adding that next to advancement. They are 2 totally different things. Politics is challenging. Overall experience was beneficial both ways.
good,"Open office. Verify money in safe and count petty cash. Make bank deposits. Call reservations to confirm appointments. Call delinquent tenants, do thorough lock checks, rent storage space to walk-in customers. Sell merchandise, clean property and units, work independently to manage the property. The hardest part of the job is being the only person on the job, especially during busy season. Also traveling to work at other properties. Most enjoyable part is working at your own pace, with no schedule restrictions."
good,"customer service , and cleaning , inventory , good cutomers to talk to"
good,I really liked this company and the people i worked with. The Management were ok and the secret shops they do on you is rediculous.
good,I personally think the company os much more flawed than it is in the right. Company does not supply Employees with opportunities to climb up in the company.
good,This job was as an assistant property manager for a storage facility. The job itself was pretty simple and straightforward but the company itself does not treat its employees very well.
good,"The job can be stressful, also rewarding. It is demanding, and sometimes  worth the struggle. It is a good starting place to learn how to juggle an office, customer, sales and preset goal expectations. I worked alone most days to open and close the property, take inventory of units, clean property, manager customer rental accounts (such as payment due dates and reminder of missed payments), meet goal requirements of lock and insurance sales, as well as office merchandise. The hardest part were the demands and restrictions placed upon the staff, high turn over rates, and lower then standard wages of property management. The most rewarding was meeting and getting to know some of the long-term tenants, the versatility of the job."
good,"Site visits of building appearance and morning meetings with Property Managers. Daily audits of Operational procedures and budgeting in regards to P&L records. Promotions very limited, upper management gave me autonomy which I enjoyed! Upon leaving I throughly enjoyed working hand in hand with Property Managers!"
good,It helped me develop my customer service skills and learn to identify customer's needs more efficiently.
good,"If you are a people person, liked being micro managed, and inconsistent scheduling this is the place for you. Office and outdoor work. You only get a 30 minute lunch break, my experience at Public Storage is bitter/sweet."
good,"Hours and money are good. Culture is rough - people and service do not come first. Money, money and again the bottom line are all that matter. Work life balance is pretty decent."
good,"It's okay working for Public Storage, but the upper management act like nothing else matters but that job and opening up the property. A typical day at work is fine, you have nice customers coming in. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the upper management that seems to not care about your personal life at times. They don't know how to talk to their employees at times and act as if they care but they don't. Most enjoyable part is working with the relief and property managers."
good,"Typical work day is - count money, answer phones, make numerous delinquent tenant calls, fill out chart, clean outside all over property, clean units, present units by following scripts, must sell merchandise and no commission for what you sell, dm is extremely persistent if you do not sell merchandise, restocking merchandise, filing, office work and cleaning, rude and homeless people trying to scream at you for their problems not being able to pay their rent and you selling their items at auction. Auctions and lock cuts were fun but very stressful job which is not given enough pay for. Great job, BAD PAY and you need a car no matter what because they will constantly force you to relocate"
good,"good starter job, no room to advance into upper managmnt, sales push is a joke along with all other metrics. apartmente are available. pretty hard to get fired."
good,"Very boring so be prepared to keep yourself busy. You will make daily phone calls and walk the property at least 3-5 times a day. But relax most properties have a golf cart so the ""walk"" is mobile."
good,"The stress associated with this inside sales job is enough to drive anyone insane. There is intense pressure to make a sale that I saw many cases of False Sales just to make their stats look good."
good,The company is a good company but it could use upper management  tweaking they should take better care of us and make us feel appreciated in their actions instead of it always being about their scripts and numbers they expect a lot but give little to nothing in return no incentives but real good at criticism not even constructive
good,Inbound 40+ calls a day but up to 80 calls depending on the time of the year. Forever changing bonus structure for the sales team. OT during busy times meeting the company's needs. Summer contest for top performers.
good,Walmart was OK at first. Its a very good company but when you decide gp make that move and step up in their system walmart becomes tour life! Sometimes hectic but still pays the bills!
good,"Work day starts at 9""30 am---review and call pending reservations for confirmation time/date;  verify petty cash till; 8-10 pages of delinquent customer calls daily (each employee); daily lock check(verify if customers have vacated overnight); monitor upkeep of property/ scheduling vendor weekly for any repairs needed); prepare all auction files( Certificate of Public sale; Delinquent Tenant Checklist; Change of information forms and original rental lease)  Cash/Credit/Check payments;  ( Preparing weekly goal charts -- Occupancy, Delinquency; Reservations; Walk-ins; Reviews; Merchandise sales;)  Resolving customer issues; clearing voicemail daily with followkup calls to customers;    .  I learned that all change is good--creates poductivilty and trust for the customers;  The hardest part of all jobs that I have had opportunities is working with our young generations.  They seem not to have that self motivation and pride that one should have with every job be it may be short or long tem.   The most enjoyable is knowing the each day I have in some way provided aboave and beyond customer service to our clients and that knowledge is power.  Share your knowledge and experience"
good,"District, regional, and divisional manager were all great. They give you the training and recognition you deserve. Pay could be considered low, but there are good benefits. There are a lot of changes, though. Once you get used to a certain way of doing things, it would change."
good,"A typical day at work is using 10 sales & service scripts for customer Payments, Reservations, walk-ins, Rental Agreements, Insurance, Locks, Vacates, Merchandise, Welcome Wednesday & L.A.S.T. I learned that the customers are what make the business thrive. Sales get the customers & great customer service keeps the customers. Management is under constant pressure to make sales goals. A   constant competition for rankings and to be on top month to month. Nothing was hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting, knowing, helping & keeping hundreds of great customers satisfied daily with excellent customer service"
good,I enjoyed working with my co workers we had a great team. We always worked together as a team should work.
good,"Its a performance job, sales are necessary. You call delinquent customers and show spaces to to potential customers, keep the property and vacant spaces clean."
good,"A typical day will have you sitting in the office, making collection calls waiting for customers to walk in.  During the summer time you could see as many as 8 rentals done during a shift, while the winter you will be lucky to get 3 per week."
good,"For the most part this job is laid back. I learned that no matter how many times you explain to customer policy, it's always the company fault; even if its in a contract Signed by the customer. My manager is the best. Co-workers I love most of the job. Explaining to customer why their items are being sold. Being able to live for free."
good,"This company was not for me. I did not like the way it was operated and the managers where never around when you needed it, This company was not well ran,"
good,"Each day I open the property, manage bank deposits, print daily reports, find daily percentages of sales, occupancy & adjustments, check property for security breaches, manage appointments, sales and rentals, clean and maintain the property and extensive customer service."
good,"Pay is low, hours are great. But no pay raises or bonuses.  Benefits  are expensive and no real room for advancement. Have worked here over year and a half still make the same $$ . They keep adding work loads but do not pay raise increases unless the government increases the wages."
good,"Public Storage was a great place to work , the only thing I can say is thry should promote with in . The only reason I left after q0 years is for career advancement."
good,"fast paced,  learned something new everyday. Most managers are great. "
good,"The pay is low, but at least the hours are good. Hours are consistent and benefits are good, except that they are based out of California and I work in Georgia."
good,"It‚Äôs an easy job until you have to meet numbers. Employees are expected to meet all the same numbers when realistically it‚Äôs highly unlikely to meet the same numbers as others in larger more busy properties. The employee friendships are really the only thing you can look forward to when working. The benefits are great. You‚Äôre a leasing agent, janitor, maintenance tech, and office clerk(Maybe even more than all that) all in one."
good,"Public Storage has not just given me a job but also a home. Since I'm the Property Manager I as provided a place to live. I have learned to be self motivating, since I work alone everyday."
good,Scheduled shifts. Paid vacation and sick days. Paid travel to meetings. Can be stressful. Make collection calls and rent units. Usually work on your own
good,"The people that I worked with were cool. It was like we took care of each other. Even though my DM was fairly new and he didn't know a few things, he tried to be helpful as much as possible, even when I was let go. I wasnt there long due to transportation issues, however I was planning on staying for only 6 months. There is no mobility within the company itself. In order to be  DM you would have to quit then reappy."
good,"Great hours and ok pay."
good,"The typical public storage is all about being able to make connections with customers so that we try to meet their every need during their moving or business storage needs. Also making sure that the company is making awesome amount of sales and providing again 5 star service whether its in the the direct office and or over the phone, Also making sure the buildings are safe and clean to keep customers content during their rental process at our company."
good,"Gathering over night payments, daily bank deposit, lock check, "
good,We do the same thing every day so its really simple once you learn everything during training. Follow the scripts and you will succeed
good,Working here has been a joy at times. Everyone worked together to make sure that everything is done. The customers were our first priority and we worked hard to make sure we could fit all their needs.
good,Overall the workplace was alright. You get to work by yourself but the manager at the time was not very good and did not do his job well. He would play favorites which was not right.
good,"Good place to work if you have strength in sallies, easy money, chilled laid back spot!!! Very friendly staff! Easy money and casual dress atmosphere......"
good,"Good benefits did not see opportunity for advancement in regards to pay or position only title, big negative. Disconnect between management and work force."
good,I had customers that things were damaged due to rain and leaking ceilings they did not want to repair the issue or often did not want to compensate the customers for their things. Heartbreaking
good,Very fast paced at beginning and end of month. You have to be able to be outside a lot in all conditions. In spare time there are tons of collection calls to make on a daily basis and a lot of typing notes to customers accounts.
good,"Public storage needs to raise their hourly wages, this co. is a money making machine. The duties required are vast and the responsibility are GREAT! They worry more about stockholders, then the wages of the people that bring in the profits on a daily bases. I managed one and my number were sick and below co. standards by miles. People make more money in fast-food nowadays then here...they need to get with the times."
good,"For those who have a fear with rodents and are allergic to dust, I would not recommend this job. It can be quite demanding as you are dealing with customers who do not like to follow company policies"
good,"Although the managers at every property is a little different the service provided is consistent throughout. A typical workday consists of a lot of different things. From confirming reservations, making and receiving calls, and keeping up with proper maintenance of the property. All the while providing each customer with the proper size unit at the right price, helping them making their move in as easy as possible. The District Managers along with the KTP's offer wonderful training and assistance to their employees and coworkers. The most difficult part of this job is juggling all of your tasks throughout the day with minimal help. However the support system provided from all who work here is fantasic."
good,A typical day at work consists of a long check list of scripted activities. I learned to follow scripts for all types of scenarios and 90% of clients will buy after they have said NO five times.
good,"Great interaction with the customers"
good,‚Ä¢ Develop best practices to deliver exceptional customer service.
good,this is not a job you get to sit around. There is always something to do.
good,Only if they let me work the days that works for me like Monday thur Friday. And if they could give a brother a rise I could see myself working here till its time for me to retire. Still getting pay the same amount seen i I been there. That sucks!
good,"A typical day at public storage is opening the office, doing rentals, taking payments, helping customers, doing auction files and cleaning units. Best part of the job is team work"
good,"On a regular day, you will have a nice flow of customers coming in to purchase a sotrage unit or make rental payments. However, be sure to full explain in detail what the lease says because customers will often say they didn't agree to something when they already signed stating they understood. Also, daily maintence can be tiring sometimes when people leave things as f company is a dump site."
good,"This job is an overall ok place of work. I really didn't like the way that the customers were treated nor their items.The managers were good to work under, it was just the company."
good,Depending on who needed to store you had to evaluate their storage needs. You also tried to get side sells by helping them protect their belongings when they stored. each property had different secutity features you would explain while you were showing the customer the unit. You always greeted with a smile and tried to make the customer comfortable from the begining.
good,"PS is a great entry level company. The hours grant each employee is given two days off a week, every week. Not a good career for students, is full-time 40+ hours."
good,Great for young adults just starting out in the work field. Down side no room for advancement.You get to meet and greet a lot of people on a daily basis.
good,"a Typical day, was rentals, sales and overall customer service, I learned how to run a property, I was a property manager for 4 years, hardest part of my job was to try and help customers not lose there property to a auctions, the most enjoyable part was helping customers with there needs."
good,"Going to work everyday there was always something different happening. Your only constant was going to the bank and opening the door every morning. That was just the nature of this job, you had to be prepared for anything."
good,Public storage is a great place to gain management skills. 90% of the time you are there with maybe one other associate. If you dont like your manager hovering over you this will be the perfect job. The pay could be better. 9 times out of 10 you are making collection calls waiting for you next customer to come in. I would recommend this job for people who just  got out of High School with High School with diploma and active drivers licenses.
good,"This job was ok, I dont think it paid enough but. The hours of work and Flexibility were great"
good,"In a normal day at work my crew and I would start the day by putting together our commitment of rentals for the day and calling all of our reservations for the day. As property manager I would be on a the morning confrence call and relaying the current business and our commitment for the day. The hardest part of the job is trying to get that commitment utilizing all the tools the company has provided us. The best part of the job was working together with my co-workers and hitting our commitment and then some. Working together to help each other close the rental and that feeling of knowing we did our best, was the most fun."
good,"Working for this company at the time, I worked mostly solo. I was in areas of Chicago that needed 2 works but the staffing wasn't there. The hrs were 9-6;30 and you had the freedom to take a lunch when you wanted as well as breaks."
good,Some property managers were offered an apartment if there was one onsite for free while others did not. I feel like those who had an apartment was basically making more money because they didn't have to pay for housing expenses. The starting pay wasn't that great and being paid twice a month was hard.
good,I volunteer here and LOVE it because it keeps me busy while looking for employment.
good,In the Office most of the time spent on the phone or at the computer. work with customers who are paying there months rent payment as well as working with customers who due not pay on time. Emailing faxing phone calls typing and cleaning units when the customer moves out. the company is open 7 days a week and want you to work almost every Holiday and no time off when they are busy.
good,"You will wear a lot of hats working for Public Storage especially if you are the Property Manager you will be in customer service, sales, merchandising, janitorial, real estate and many other jobs including cleaning up the property, changing light bulbs, making timely collection calls, keeping your office clean, taking payments, and renting spaces to customers."
good,I currently work for Public Storage I have found my experience in my time here to be very educational pay is a little low and the management changes quite often but the experience was wonderful and it is a nice start to being in the Property Management Field I would recommend this position and this company .
good,"it was fun, learned a lot and would recommend it to anyone of my friends for the same experience. At one point i wanted to open my own public storage and still might."
good,This job is high volume sales and a fast paced work environment. I enjoy the job and all the responsibility but there is little room for advancement. Over all this is a decent job with good benefits.
good,this company is a wonderful company if they can just get the right staff and more security every thing will work out. i also believe the  workers dont have a say so with any thing and they work so hard more staff needs to be hired
good,Working for Public Storage was a OK job. There were times that you worked with people that would not do their part of the jobs. Cleaning storage units and picking up after people that stored their belongings.
good,"management has their ""favorite"" staff and if you're not part of the ""in crowd"" you won't make it."
good,I've been with P.S 5 years. Over all its not bad. The turn over rates are high and there aren't many people who make it as long as I do. Work/life is ok I guess. The no point system is nice but they make you feel guilty if you need time off due to the lack of staffing.  Over all if you do not ever plan to advance and don't ever want a raise then it's fine. The hours aren't bad but I cannot remember the last time I didnt ha e overtime.
good,This job I was told was very easy and just involved little tasks. What I didn't know was that u have to sell stuff to people and if you don't you get in trouble
good,public storage is a great place to gain Experience. the days can some time be slow but depending on your work ethic there is always something to do. working for public storage has also taught me a lot with dealing with customer relations .
good,"It is not really $20 an hour per ad,"
good,If you have kids not the best place because you do work a lot of hours including days off when needed. OT is always paid Great benifits. Lots of stress. You will get yelled at and cussed at by customers.
good,"This was an exciting place to work even though this was going to be a temporary position for me, but to my surprise was there well over 7 years it thought me a lot which would further assist me in my career"
good,"But no advancement opportunities whatsoever. They use outside hires for all upper management positions, at 18 years old, I reached the highest position possible,"
good,"i enjoyed working for them, however, in the last few months the managment has made the job difficult, all the property mangers are not happy and looking for other postions elsewhere. personally i think that they are not looking out for the employees welfare when it comes to benefits and salary, i an happy that they did hire me back at a time when i needed help , so that im grateful."
good,"I take from 100-150 calls a day. The calls on the public side is appreciated about 50%. The hardest part of the job is laying out the policy that the tenant is to abide by and having to let them know there are really no exceptions. "
good,"I have always enjoyed working here, i like working independently and as a team. I like the fact that they offer the apt because it is a benifit. I only wish they gave regular raises"
good,I liked the ability to manage my own time and not have a supervisor looming over me. They do NOT promote store workers. If you are looking for promotions you have to start at District Manger level or higher.
good,"All depends on who you work for. Some district managers are great, others not so much. Job itself is great and fast paced but if the district manager is hard to work with, it makes the job difficult."
good,Good place to work. Wonderful people working with! Learning experience was very good. Hardest part of the job was the pay and the requirment for you not having a permanent post. You are required to move around from property to propery on a reqular scheduled shift. Not as in an emergency where an employee called out. The most enjoyable part for me was finding the right affordable unit that worked best for the customer!
good,This job is perfect for anyone looking to start a career in management. You get a great knowledge of how to run a property and Handel payments and deliquency.
good,"PS has been a decent enough place to work. As a Resident Property Manager, they pay rent, water, sewage, garbage and electricity. As well as pay you a salary. The medical benefits are decent enough, expensive though. They have no bonus structure anymore. They don't like to repair issues on the properties until they become a major issue or a necessity. All in all I have enjoyed my time with Public Storage, but it is time for me to move on."
good,"They recruit from outside instead of promoting from within so essentially this is a dead end job. If not for that fact, this would be a nice enough career choice. I did learn a whole lot about sales from this company"
good,"Lot of responsibilities & challenges on my shoulder, but I enjoy my work. Understand clients concerns to find best fit solutions for their needs."
good,"the customer yelling at you is the hardest part of the day when it is their mess. My co worker were fun and helpful,meet alot different people and problems"
good,"No time off seven day work weeks, if you do not have a family then this is perfect for you. expectations for newly promoted are set high and they are not afraid to tell you they are going to fire you if you drop the ball..."
good,Acted as resource person to support property managers in building 760 tenants leasing unit for both temporal and long term leasing.
good,"Office/property maintenance, rental/vacates ,collections, costumer service, Auctions ,"
good,"I took this job to get out of a call center, the job was easy, my district manager was one of the nicest guys I have ever worked for and he would bend over backwards to help out his team. However the pay is only $9.50 an hour and about six months til you can bonus."
good,"I worked there for 5 years, my overall experience is that you need really good customer service. You will make a lot of collections calls for late payments throughout the month. I didn't expect this job to be as emotional as it was, people rent storage units for many reasons, some are happy and there are the sad reasons."
good,I did enjoy for 12 years 9 months working for with Public Storage. Enjoyed helping customers with their storage needs. The only con was the number of employee was cut in half with the same work load.
good,"Public storage was a great stepping stone for me to learn the basics of storage.  I learned the sales, customer service, collections, and legal parts of storage.  If you are lucky enough to get a good trainer.. then you can learn a lot.  It was a great place to get exposure and learn.  The pay wasn‚Äôt not enough for the work done.  There was a lot of travel to different locations and depending on the location.. u could have some confrontational customers.  Over all, I liked working there.. if the pay was better and advancement was available.. I‚Äôd still be there.  I had to go where the money was and where I could make more decisions."
good,Short staffing and new management caused a lot of my issues with the company. Prior to that a job is a job. Definitelyhas a glass ceiling and limited advancement.
good,Flexibility as far as work duties.  You get to move around instead of staying in one spot.  Nice people come in to rent storages or moving trucks.  Opportunities for advancement
good,"The main interest i had working for this company was that I was next on the list to live in one of the apartments on site, for a decrease in pay. I had an automobile accident and ending up relocating for something closer to home and more money due to Public Storage not promoting within the company."
good,Public storage was was a fun place to work. No one micro manged you. And they always promoted with in the company. Cons were you had to work every week end. Not much time off.
good,this job was easy cleaning a few things around property working on office things very relaxed if you like working alone all the time.they provide a place to live once you move up with company.
good,"Dealing with all types of people, Most people that call for storage are going thru a unpleasant time. It's my job to help ease the stress to get them the right location, fit & price."
good,The job it self is great. The pay and everything you are expected to take care of by yourself is a whole different ball game. Being as you will be in a store by yourself running it and when it gets busy you need to learn how to juggle customers wanting to pay rent and the ones that actually want to rent a storage unit and try not to get it all confused .
good,"Before the new change --- we had fun on who can sell the most of products and who can get the most tenants to pay on rent. "
good,"Public Storage relies heavily on scripts, there isn't much there isn't a script for. Public Storage identifies themselves as a sales position, as in if you don't make your sales quota you won't keep your position. Being that everything is scripted, it is a good way to find out if sales is right for you. It is structured and easy, everything is explained to you through an online course you complete in the store and training is paid. Meetings are also paid and they never want you to be working off the clock. They do try to be professional, although professionalism cannot be expected when there is barely any experience or educational background required. I have witnessed many people lie cheat and steal in order to keep there sales high, and from other employees I have learned that integrity issues are not really abnormal in that environment."
good,Working at public storage is a pretty decent job with pretty good pay and the option for benefits downside though would be that if you are not the designated property manager for a certain property then you usually have to travel to others which can put a little wear and tear on your car
good,Working for public storage has should me and taught me many things. Every month we had District meetings and everyone learned something one from each other and the mangers as well.
good,"A typical day at Public Storage can change week to week. The beginning of the month is payments and the rest is trying to get payments, renting units, making sure property has curb appeal, general maintenance, answering phone and just giving the best customer service"
good,it was a pleasure working for this company. i learned a lot. staff and management is amazing. if it wasn't for me relocating i would love to still be working for this company.
good,"Short breaks,  hard to advance , managers Care more about production then the employees,  job itself isn't hard unless customer leave belongings which you are responsible for getting rid of"
good,Hours make juggling work and home life very easy. Co-works care and are welcoming. Only downside is some locations are much harder to work than others and you do jump around a lot when you start off.
good,"most stores are closing"
good,"You typically work by yourself, so you must be self motivated."
good,Great part time job to have. Worked around my school schedule and also had a pretty good discount. It is retail so the hours do vary.
good,"I went to work everyday happy to be there. I took pride in the property as if it were my own. I would start the day by counting the float and filling in the log. Returning phone calls, and opening the office for business. If I was going to be working alone I would go do the banking before opening the office for the day. I would also do a lock check before opening the office as well."
good,Great company with room for advancement with great management and benefits. Many opportunities for extra hours. Fast-paced work environment
good,"pretty cool job, very easy, nothing is complicated. Days go by pretty fast if your at a busy location. We get to interact with our coworkers at different locations, very close knit"
good,Learned a lot about independently managing a property. Enjoyed interacting with the customers.
good,for the most part job is really easy from time to time it does get a little hectic
good,this company is a fun place to work in. Most of the employees are team workers and very nice. if you ever have a question or concern there is always someone around to help you.
good,Public Storage was a laid back company I loved working with my coworkers they were very helpful
good,"A typical day at the job consisted of opening office, count petty cash, print out vacant list, make bank deposits, clean property, make collection calls,take calls, help tenants, take payments, make rentals and reservations, count end of day money, prepare it for next morning bank deposit and put away on safe, and close office. "
good,"Its a Great company to work for, It has its Challenges which I need. My DM is one of the Best Ive ever had."
good,Must enjoy interaction with people on a daily basis. no advancement for field employees but it is a fortune 500 company with locations everywhere
good,I love the people and management I work with. I just need to find some where where I can go with the company. People have been sales agents for over 15 years.
good,"A typical day for this day involves a being on the phone making calls customers. Working here gives you clerical skills that you may not have going in. The management is a little inconsistent in applying policies. You work mostly by yourself, which can make your days long and depending on the time of month; you will be overwhelmed with spaces to clean. The best part of the job are the hours of operation 9:30AM - 6:00PM M - F or 9:30AM - 5:00PM S - S."
good,"‚Ä¢Provide outstanding customer service by helping customers understand their needs, recommend storage solutions and help them acquire the needed product solutions"
good,"good place to work, but no advancement. I left public Storage for wells fargo"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of reviewing customer contracts, collection calls and customer service. What I learned is that everything needs to be in writing. The management and coworkers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was the auctions of the customers property.The most enjoyable part was the teamwork from all employees."
good,"I would run the office, taking payments and leasing to new rentals. I would make sure the property looked good and do any cleaning that needed to be done. I would check the new leases of the other managers for accuracy and file. I would ready files for the auction of units, making sure that all steps were properly taken. I would take the deposit to the bank and runt the end of day and ready deposit slip for the next deposit."
good,I loved being able to work at other tasks besides sitting behind the computer all day. Meeting all the potential customers was one of the best parts of the job. Satisfying current tenants was another.
good,Public storage is a place to work if you have a big personality. you are able to work with limited supervision and a self starter.
good,We wear too many hats & are expected to do much more than advertised during hiring. The job is good but the staff is short because people quit due to higher management.
good,"Can be a very busy chaotic day or a very low key quiet day offering an opportunity to catch up on work. "
good,Good job to start build a bond and help grow into a position to take charge and run a store. Your never there all day always flexible and you have back to back days off..
good,Provided  outstanding customer service. I took great care of he appearance of the property . answered high volume calls for customers. noted on customer accounts. sell merchandise for storage needs provided safety for all  public storage customers.
good,Public Storage was a very focused and structured work environment. Procedures were very standardized with measurable matrix's that were used to evaluate performance.
good,"I managed a store in Vallejo, however, you are required to work at other stores within a 30 mile range about once or twice a month."
good,"Easy job, mostly sit in an office doing paperwork all day. Clean the empty storage units as necessary. Worst part is having to up-sell the customers to buy over-priced boxes. Best part is set schedules and working alone."
good,My time at public storage had its ups and downs. I enjoyed most parts of working there. Most days were relatively uneventful. We mostly rented storage units to students for the summer.
good,"This company is huge, but it was run like a mom and pop store front storage company. They didn't do there research before they started a pick up and delivery service and it didn't work out for them. Too many unprofessional guys loading furniture and didn't know what they were doing, so people filed claims against them. Too many claims so the pick up and delivery was discontinued."
good,"I enjoyed working at Public Storage under Henry Obst and gained several life experiences from working there for two years. I was very satisfied with my time as a District Manager. "
good,Job is fantastic when it comes to being trusted to run and office all by yourself so that you can be your own boss. Good hours for those juggling their personal life with work.
good,"Great people,both workers and guest. Not enough opportunity  for growth. Loved Taking care of guest and taking care of properties. Did not like the constant manipulation of schedule on a daily basis, Staff members were great and a good team to work with."
good,"Positions were programmed by the company so that procedures would be the same if one was working in Oregon or Florida.  The day started with counting and recording the amount of petty cash on hand from previous day.  The next step was to check and answer all phone messages received from previous days closing to 9:30 AM opening.  The bank deposit from previous day had to be made by 12:00 PM.  Sometime before that, lock checks were preformed to insure that all units were locked and that the property was clean and secure. The majority of the day was spent dealing with customers; taking payments, showing units, verifying information and preparing lease agreements.  Also, any units that were vacated that day had to be swept and made ready for rental.  The end of day consisted of proving cash, check and credit card payments and preparing the deposit for the next day, counting and verifying petty cash, checking to insure all voice messages were answered and doing a final lock check"
good,"My typical day at work would be doing bank runs, clean vacate units, doing calls to customer that need to pay there rent, rent units, help customer and collect payments. I learned to listen to customer to the fullest. The management is not the best and what I mean is that they don't listen to the employees about anything. My co-works was the best. The hardest part of the job was when the customer didn't pay there bills and PS would sell there things. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people."
good,Assisted many clients with picking the correct storage unit to fit all their important household items.
good,"While employed, the company made several changes to their business style that seemed to convey that they had lost sight of their employees value."
good,"It was a nice place to work, you met new people daily, it was an easy job to do."
good,-A typical day at work was that there was always something to learn & meeting new people.
good,Working with Public Storage was great for building confidence. As a relief manager you have most of the same responsibilities as a property manager. which taught me new skills.
good,My co workers were amazing but the customers were not always pleasant. I do not recommend this place if you do not plan on cleaning nasty bathrooms. The customers would come in and sometimes destroy the bathrooms. You have to constantly clean everything.
good,Definitely need more pay for what we do management is great. But need more money and better day‚Äôs off. Sometimes it‚Äôs really hard to get days off if it‚Äôs needed
good,The Manager plays favoritism. She dont appreciate the hard work her worker do because she do not do the job. Loved the job pay is great just horrible management!
good,Public storage is an enjoyable place to work especially if you enjoy working alone. Most of your time is spent working alone. The hardest part of the job is having to occasionally work outside in the elements. The most enjoyable part of the job was training new employees.
good,"Salary is not the most competitive but job is fun, I enjoy my position and would recommend someone who is looking for a stress free position . You must have people skills and a bit of patience"
good,Working for Public Storage has been good experience. The work/life balance is good. Benefits are great. Training was okay and  needs some work for those who are not versed in the storage industry.
good,"$11 per hour will either be easy money or not enough for the work you're doing on any given day.  One day it is possible to spend the whole 8 hours cleaning units or waiting in the office for calls or reservations, and the next you can be working constantly throughout the day and dealing with problems both maintenance and tenant-related.  Management is hands-on but manages a number of locations, so on occasion you will need to exercise your judgement.  The job is fairly solitary- the vast amount of time you will be the only Public Storage employee on-site."
good,"Public storage can you give you potential to make some great money. Management is horrible. Sales supervisors are so money hungry that they stress you out. Its great to make a lot of money, but don't tell me how to sell my product.. to the point where they would listen on a call with you , and rudely interrupt and talk over you. "
good,"it has good and bad days, the company is competitive and you have to know your knowledge but the upper management will always work with you. the pay does not amount to the work you do"
good,"Public storageis a great place to work if you can survive on minimum wage. The management is great, co-workers were rat, blue cross benefits. I would recommend it if you are young!"
good,I worked for the company for 8 years. I was an onsite property manager. With the exception of 1 bad district manager they have great management. The schedule is excellent and has a great work life balance. Benefits are pretty good and even better when you get to live on site for free rent and free utilities and still earn a decent hourly wage. There is no room for advancement once you are a property manager.
good,There are not many negatives I can say about Public Storage but the biggest problems is that there is little room for advancement or raises. The management is fun and the team is fun. Of course with any business there are rude customers and customer you love. They give an option for onsite living and you have benefits.
good,The management is great and they work with you with any problems you have. The money is very small and there no opportunity to advance in anyway.Independent work
good,"Working at Public Storage is pretty good, but if you don't like working by yourself then this is not a job for you. The job is fairly easy but does require multitasking."
good,Ok place to work just was not for me maybe for someone else. Great environment but a few things could be better. I will not speak bad about them just need a few changes.
good,"I deal with a variety of customers at my job. I am known for exemplary customer service. A typical day at work can be collection calls, lock checks to make sure every customer's unit is secure, money handling, sales, audits, report handling, basically knowing your business and handling your business to be the best in the district and propel your district to be the best in the country."
good,This position taught me to set goals and about time management. I learned a lot about managing an office at this position. The hardest part of the job was having to tell a customer their storage unit was going to go to auction and I could not help them save it. I enjoyed being able to help the customers with their storage needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the freedom of setting my own workday schedule and what I needed to accomplish that day.
good,"Establishing new customer accounts, managing reservations, courtesy and collection calls, light maintenance and cleaning of property while providing excellent customer service."
good,Helping customer and dealing with collection calls. Working with public storage was good because it gave me stronger customer service skills.
good,Began as a Storage Manager and later transferred to Relief Manager. Duties included renting and maintenance of storage units. Data entry and management of client information through a network interface.
good,"A typical day at PS varies depending on the time of the season , during busy season it can be fun meeting a lot of awesome people, but also on the flip side it can get a lil crazy and stressful. Everyone at Ps are managers at the stores but we are micromanaged by DM's whch my recent particular DM was cool. The hardest part of the job can be the labor with the daily cleaning of the facilities. The most enjoyable part of the job at one time was the monthly and the quarterly bonuses we got !?"
good,Checking inventory and making sure space was available. Selling different products and resolving issues.
good,"Maintaining the property, security, billing, and office management."
good,"My personal view of public storage, they keep you on your toes, every month the companies proccedures change there is something new to do or learn. I loved it we had distric meetings, and i personally love learning. They kept your mind alert to new ideas and contract change. The only thing that bothered me was the company doesnt believe and individual rais only company raise. For any one to get a raise the entire United States Public Storage has to get it, only company raises. Every one is up for a review once per year which entiles you to a raise on your performance. I was denied my review the entire time i was there. Which i should have had 5 individual raises, along with the company raises. Other than that it is very hard work, you are learning constanly, I loved it."
good,"Great place to work, opens up a lot of opertunities and doors in management."
good,"They want you to feel like an entrepreneur and this is your property.  It's a pretty basic job. Show units, rent units, clean empty units. They dont tell you about crime, break ins, rats, roaches, dark hallways, hotter than heck buildings, moving large furniture left behind to the trash without assistance.  You have sales goals for boxes at $3 small box that they can get home Depot for 99cents. Pay isnt enough."
good,"It's just a pretty simple job, as long as you pay attention in training. The Sales part of the job is the hardest part, and even that isn't too terrible."
good,I loved working for PS. It was like having another family. My district manager and general manager both were great. The DM really cared about her employees.
good,"A typical day at work was auditing the building "
good,"Good place to work, good training, fast pace, scripted, easy to convert calls, good end of year parties. Great managers. They do shift bids which was great."
good,"Gteat working atmosphere. Stores and storage units kept vrry clean. Always kept busy. Did not have to be micro managed"
good,"Management is constantly changing and, you never quite know who's coming or going. Unrealistic delinquency goals, and unreal expectations with sales. Great benefits and awesome people to work with."
good,"I learned a lot working for public storage, such as time management and property management, as well as customer service. My coworkers were easy to get along with and corporate tries their best to make you feel apprecited."
good,"clock in you start with daily lock checks, look at the day before reports, show cutsomers around property, make bank run around noon, clean property, do walk throughs, check for cleaniess, count resgister and clock out"
good,"Daily tasks include opening 930am, following up with customers on reservations, report print outs and bank deposit. Throughout the day you have customers coming in to make payments, asking for information on units ,  rentals and customers purchasing merchandise. We have a  set schedule for delinquent calls that must be followed as well as the property walk through to ensure every unit is properly secured and all is well and maintaining the property office and bathroom clean. At the end of the day we count the money for the deposit the next day, and print out the end of day reports, clock out and secure office."
good,"Take time to learn the business aspect while keeping an open mind. The only two downsides to this is that some of the employees like to create nonsense and foolishness within the workplace. In addition, to the pay that this company provides is not reasonable because of the coat of living."
good,"This is a great job if you are looking for something that is guaranteed full time, with the option to work overtime if you want to. There are several different benefits packages to choose from as well upon employment. "
good,"My day typically consisted in the assisting of people who were in need of a storage facility as well as assisting them in doing so at a price which would meet their needs as often they were in dire situations personally of financially. I was afforded numerous learning opportunities during my time at Public Storage. These learning experiences ranged from working with low income and at risk situations, renting to outside businesses in need of storage services,  as well as other long and short storage needs. I am also responsible for minor property repairs and maintaining the appropriate aesthetic appearance of numerous company sites. My duties included the training of new staff, interfacing with multiple sites across multiple districts, as well as the daily collection, accounting, documentation, and deposit of currency. The most rewarding duty of my job was the assistance of tenants in unfavorable situations to take the first steps in rebuilding their life."
good,Love my District Manager and the environment I just wish there was more room for advancement in the company. Unfortunately if you start as a Relief Manager the highest you can go is Key Training Professional or Property Manager. They don't promote for higher positions from within.
good,"You constantly have something to be working on, it is partly because we do not have enough staffing to cover our larger stores well. You will learn a lot about renting storage spaces, and your customers as you are helping them with a big change in their life. Moving is very rarely fun and can be very stressful for your customers. District management is typically very good. They are strangled by upper management and corporate policy. Most of the people you work with are decent people but there only to collect a paycheck. Dealing with the constant stream of upset customers due to rent raises. You'll meet some great people along the way."
good,"I would get to work and start by clocking in and getting rite to work. Start by checking everything, getting your section ready, making sure your station is stocked. ect."
good,"while working at public storage, I was responsible for my own time. i had to make sure customers were helped, and get the paperwork done. Most co-workers were helpful with answer questions you would have, but sometimes other co-workers would bring their personal problems into work, and have an attitude towards the job and the customers."
good,A typical days work is prep for walk in customers keeping up with daily goals keeping property clean handling customers needs
good,"Great job but there is no room for advancement. The company doesn't promote to higher levels within the company. Other than this, it's a great job."
good,Rent Storage Units and collect payments for unit already rented.  Answer questions about facility
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is the fact that you get to meet different types of people from different area's and walks of life, it is very laid back an you have minimum supervison to run your property"
good,Work/life balance A+.
good,"My boss and co workers are fantastic to be around, lots of team players. The hardest part of the job is maybe cleaning out unit in horrible weather. The most enjoyable part of my job would be my customers."
good,"A typical day at work would be making customer calls ,renting space,cleaning vacant units.I have learn listing to customers and solving the problems on there account.Management is supportive,Co-workers easy going enjoy each others company,respect.The hardess part of the job is auction .The most enjoyable part of the jobs was getting to meet different people all walks of life"
good,"scheduled pick-ups, set reservations, dispatch trucks on the road. worked as a well oiled machine because everyone shared in commission. hardest part collections"
good,"This is a very structured company. The work/life balance is great! The staff is very friendly and helpful. "
good,meet a lot of people no room for advancement within the company and no real raises nor bonuses. If you live on property it is a plus but your pay goes down to $8.50 an hour
good,Nice place to work no regret  ..I like the people and the work ethics.i Will surely recommend PS to Family and friends that are ready to do their job in a positive way

good,Great place to work. Work/life balance. Great IT management. Overall had great experience during my tenure at the company. I will recommend the company.
good,Was a keep you busy type job 50% office 50% out side. management needs improvement best part was most times you worked independently but at the same time could be more difficult
good,"Recruited, hired, coached, and retained an engaged team of 23 employees through demonstrating initiative and leading by example. Ensured team members demonstrate sales-focused and customer-centric behaviors driven by data and sales metrics. Managed payroll, repair and maintenance, expense budgets and P&L statements. Conducted regular property audits to ensure properties are safe and meet all company operation standards."
good,"Working for P.S. was a pleasure. There were always competitive sales and friendly games to allow Property Managers and Assistant Property Managers to rise up the ladders and show their performance skills, weekly and monthly."
good,I loved working for PS. Had great customers and loved how you always had something to do. Great bonus if your property ranked good. Always on your feet walking.
good,"Good entry lelvel position for full time management workers. Friendly atmosphere. Competitive culture, Sales focused. Flexible with hours. Outstanding benefits."
good,"Every day  was structured which I like. I loved working with the public and helping people find what they need; making it as easy as possible in what was usually a stressful situation. Got to do different jobs daily, lots of phone calls for reservation confirmation then collection calls. A bit micro managed with scripts for every time you dealt with customers. I enjoyed seeing and talking to several of my tenants and I tried to keep note of what was going on in their life so when we did talk I'd try to incorporate some familiar talk about them so they are comfortable and tend to keep their word with me on payments."
good,This is an idea job for a seasoned employee looking to be employed but not intense work. You have the opportunity to work at your own pace and autonomously.
good,"Things were great there. Everyone was doing a great job which made things flow better. Even tips were given by the clients to movers for doing an excellent, quick paced, and neat job."
good,"Your day consists of general office work and property upkeep.  You are in complete control.

good,"customer service, managing staff and running and cleaning the property. The customers and making sure the property runs smoothly and maintaining the units"
good,"Like going into work opening your our business, providing excellent customer service. Since I before working here I realize how big of demand it is for storage spaces. I am part of the management teams and myself and co works all support one another. The hardest part is just getting use to the payday, which can fall on different days. the best part is you are the manager and you do not have anyone over your should all the time."
good,"Great opportunity to learn a new way to manage, lots of coaching, training, and one on one time with employees. Great work / life balance, with a fair opportunity for advancement and competition. You never have to worry about running out of things to do, which is fantastic, and the work day goes by quickly."
good,made sure that the customers renting the units at my facility were all safe and that no one could break in and steal their items. also made bank drops from previous days on account of what was sold. sold merchandise to the customers such as boxes tape etc. managed the whole property by myself. i liked that due to the fact that i had minimal supervision.
good,"As a property manager with my own property to maintain,a typical day at work includes paperwork, courtesy calls, cleaning and management of building, executing many leases, viewing and showing spaces to new customers. Confirming appointments. Working here i've learned the goal of urgency, the importance of a company's numbers and statistics, and how to sell. I have very few co-workers, only two. Both are extremely professional and I am their supervisor, so the manager of the property, I delegate tasks amongst all three of us. The hardest part of my job is doing auctions every month for delinquent customers. The most enjoyable part is that it is a professional but also laid back environment and I am allotted the trust to run my property as I see fit."
good,"I worked with a team of professional leaders whose goal was to help us all succeed. I enjoyed my co-workers and managers immensely, and I learned so much from them. I left that job because I had to move back to WV to care for my elderly grandmother full-time."

good,"It was a awesome nice fun, productive, great opportunities and benefits employer to work for. People friendly happy and fun employer. Very detailed and organized employer."
good,"Public Storage is a good place to work with the option of moving into a bigger role. The job requires some independent work, while work life balance is great. If you want to learn about customer service while working in a sales goal environment, this is the place for you."
good,I liked the job. Easy going and easy to do. Some clients were not nice. Selling an unpaid unit was the hardest thing that I ever had to do. But it comes with the territory. I had a good nice manager.

good,Enjoyed training new managers also given the opportunity to be the reservation captain within our district. I was also given housing. I would recommend anyone to apply

good,"a good starter job that grants you sales skills and administrative skills, its slow during the winter but fast during the summer months which makes the days go by faster."

good,I learned a lot about the storage business. Employees were friendly and helpful. The best part about the job is helping the customers. The company has good benefits and great working hours.
good,Public Storage is a great place to work to gain the knowledge to become a strong leader and to be able to handle working under pressure with a long list of objectives to handle alone.
good,"Good company well balanced, just was not right for me at my age. I wished I had stayed they are a great company. Pay was well balanced and they gave us the ability to manage our own district"
good,"I was responsible for all day to day activities. Opening and closing store, bank runs, hiring firing and training employees. Also customer satisfaction and complaints"
good,"On a basic day a public storage is renting out storage unit, taking payments make reservation on units cleaning out units closing out the day by counting the money and putting it in the safe"
good,Typical day includes cleaning of the properties and renting storage units. Its the consistent micromanaging and numerous policy changes that make the job stressful. Overall keeping up with what they want you to do means rarely seeing the District manager for training.

good,"The management I had was amazing all companies should have this type of management very helpful willing to work with you. It's a call center so you don't really get to choose what days you have off that was the only downside the money could be a little bit better, overall nothing bad to say about the company. I really miss working there and the people were amazing and I miss cooking for everyone."
good,Each day created new experiences. Having wore three different hats in my career with them each position had its own unique challenges that required communication with peers to achieve expected company results.
good,"a typical day in the office is monitoring storage unit reservations for storage units making daily bank deposits having storage unit appts to sell units and upsell products light cleaning in the office and around the property and making storage delinquency calls. sometimes you will be in the office with the property manager sometimes your not and you have to manage the odfice alone , but that gave me independence. very easy job would do it again"

good,"Challenging position at times. Climate issues in and our doors can create a small amount of stress. However, overall the experience was rewarding. I was able to oversee, and manage 328 unit all, but 12 were vacant, so that was less work on the outside that needed to be done. Cold calling for collections can sometimes feel like a hassle. However, once you build a bond with your customers it is easier to handle all that you face."
good,"I assisted customers purchasing storage spaces for their personal belongings.  The typical day consist of customer service, collections, and supervising employees."
good,I worked here after school and on the weekends. The other employees were very nice and the customers were absolutely amazing.
good,"Starting to work for Public Storage I started as a associate and after two weeks my District Manager promoted me to a Property Manager of my own property. As a manager I over see that the property stayed clean, inventory of customers vacating, maintaining delinquent accounts, exceeding sales with locks, couch covers, boxes, etc., managing my assistant to make sure agreements get filed, accounts paid and units rented, also I would engage in auctions for units that went 30 days delinquent on a monthly basis.  Overall, I loved working here and staying busy."
good,I worked at  a lot of the store it was hard work and it was a dirty job
good,Good company to work for with plenty of independence. Fixed hours and simple corporate structure. Good benefits.
good,"I really enjoyed helping customers determine what their storage needs were. I would walk them through the entire process, listening and going out of my way to help, Moving is very stressful and i wanted to lend a kind ear and make it as easy as possible. I would order merchandise, make collection calls, do light cleaning ( keep the place looking nice) , Follow up on customers who were once interested, run reports etc."
good,"Public Storage is a great job company to work for the management team is highly pro-active and easy to work for and with. A typical day at Public Storage starts at 9:30 am and ends at 6pm which is great for a retail position. You are expected to work no more no less than 40 hours a week and you have the option of having 2 days of consecutive of scattered. I have learned how to perfect my listening skills and my communicational skills due to the fact I am in constant contact with customers higher management and vendors. You will work in teams of two or more depending upon how big the facility is, Public Storage is a wonderful job to work at to explore independence and accountability because the job is not a micromanaged job."
good,I liked this job because I was provided with an apartment above my office so i had no commute to work. I enjoyed seeing the teneants on a daily basis and meeting new people evey day also.
good,"Some days are slow due to the winter season, but since we have had a pretty decent winter, a typical work day at Public Storage can be very busy. I deal with customers face to face and by telephone, which includes solving problems that customers may have, answering questions, and showing storage units as well. My co-workers are very easy to get along with and we always try are best to help one another. The hardest part of this job I would have to say is to contact customer to get them to pay their balance. The reason I say this is because most of my customers have been storing with Public Storage for some time and now want to start paying at the end of the month instead of the 1st when payments are due. My job is to get customer to avoid late fees by getting them to pay on time. I have some customer that do and some that do not.The most enjoyable part of the job is be able to manage your time to get your work done."
good,"Working at Public Storage has been very Interesting. There is always a variety of things to do. Every day there is office work to do, customers to interact with, and outside things to do. There really is never a dull moment. At no time have I been ""twiddling my thumbs"" as there are always things that need to be done. I have had 6 different District Managers within my 10 years. It has been interesting working with many different co-workers at several different properties. The hardest part may be in dealing with an irate customer. The most enjoyable part is the pleasant customers and the gorgeous weather we often have here."
good,"Enjoyed the over all job, wasn't impressed with corporate pressure for sales"
good,"I have really enjoyed working for public storage so far, I feel I do my job well because I am constantly being recognized by upper management. They really promote a team environment, and I can really appreciate that. The hours of operation cannot be beat, and scheduling is really flexible."
good,"manager of storage units,customer service,bank deposit, maintence of storage. Sellling of box's,locks,ect. auctions."
good,Hours are all the same. Consistent management style. Supportive. Tasks involve a lot of outside maintenance. Not for someone who can't handle aggressive people or being alone a lot. Need muscles for most of the property doors.
good,Public Storage was ultimately a great place to work. I worked there for a little over a year but unfortunately had to move forward to a position which better suited my leadership qualities.
good,It's a nice company to work for. I wish they would pay us more. I feel like we do so much and get paid very little. It's nice that they have apartments on site and done charge us to live there. But no pets. Dont fix things that need to be fix or if they do they take months. We dont get raises anymore. They took that away from us.
good,"I enjoyed the hours, the opportunity to help customers with their storage needs , as in right price for the correct size of space.The challenge of meeting monthly goals with ease. The hardest part was eviction from lack of payment. The most enjoyable was the success stories of transitions through relocation moves."
good,Public storage was a fun place to work with great people. I learned to really grow my customer service experience. The management was super easy to get along with.
good,Assist customer rent right space for the right price while helping them protect their goods while in storage with the correct packing supplies and Insurance. Clean and maintain propety as well.
good,"Public Storage is a great company to work for. With the same hours you know what you're working. As a RM you travel to 3 different locations a week to give the PM their days off. My only complaint is a lack of schedule consistency. EVERY morning I get a text telling me I'm working somewhere other than where I am scheduled. It is quite frustrating. The pay is fair considering you honestly don't really do much. When it comes to abandoned goods on property we the managers are held responsible to clean it up, Not very often, but often enough it is an absurd amount of work to do and they expect you to do 15 minutes inside the office and 15 minutes outside the office. How can you expect to get things done with a requirement as such! Management is GREAT. My district manager in the south austin district is AMAZING. He will work with you no matter the situation in most cases. I cannot stress enough how helpful and good he is to his employees."
good,"The job was great for entry level candidates, they train for 2 weeks before allowing you manage a store by yourself. They offer great benefits, pay you for driving while clocked in, and you get to meet and interact with amazing customers."
good,Loved meeting new people and taking them on a tour of the property. Enjoyed explaining the rental regulations of storage units. Enjoyed making customers happy. It was a great place to work if you didn't mind the amount of pay received for the work you completed.
good,A fairly consistent amount of foot traffic year round. A great job to build personal relationships with customers and to get an understanding for how to reach your specific personal goals. Direct management was great and they have a personal relationship with each employee to help them be their best. The hardest part of the job has to be balancing managerial task's on the busiest of day. The most enjoyable part is see your interactions with customers pay off through google and yelp reviews.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of, providing customer service, booking reservations for storage units."
good,"Slow work environment with little interaction with customers.  Very structured.  Expected to read from scripts, quite often.  Expected to calm customers down, if they seem a bit upset over rate or other issues that my occur.  Hundreds of phone calls will be made monthly, in the attempt to secure money owed."
good,Good company to work for. This is a customer based company and very fun to work for. The managers are very helpful to help you succeed in your career.
good,this company is a great place to work for. you have alot of freedom and must of the time you work alone.
good,Great place to work ith a god group of people. the saff was always treated great bonuses were handed out based on performance
good,"Hours of operation: 9:30am- 6pm"
good,"Working at Public Storage is almost a dream job. You work typical bank hours, you have a thirty minute lunch, you're almost always sitting at a desk and you never work evenings. You learn specific skill sets at the job but to self motivate is the greatest skill you can learn. What you won't like is the lack of that same self motivation. Management does a fair job in motivation but most times it falls on deaf ears. If you're the type to self motivate then by all means. If you thrive on the aura of your coworkers then this is a very hit-or-miss job. Plus you can only go so far in the company advancement wise. If you want to make it where management is you must leave the company and apply, they won't hire within their lower ranks."
good,Good career starting point
good,"Public storage was a great company,I learned alot about working at a call center."
good,Public Storage is a great place to work if like to clean alot and make a lot of phone calls to remind and collect payment
good,My is Onesmo Anderson i have 30 years and my character is polite man and hard work  and applied the job of public assistance which are quilifield to .
good,"Good place to work. Very dependable. I liked the job and enjoyed meeting a diverse client base. The position also allowed me to live on-site and secure the property around the clock. My day begin by scooting around in the golf cart or walking the property to for a safety check, progressing with merchandising, renting units and maintaining the property. Ending with securing the property, ensuring the spaces were locked and codes were in working order for the customer."
good,"Being a Relief Manager, relocates to different properties. Property Manager, makes sure property is clean at all times. Both Relief and Property Manager rents units for customers, collects rent and deals with complex situation."
good,"A pleasant place to work. Pay is competitive with some, but not all call centers. Mgmt is very well educated with company policies and are usually move up from sales agent positions."
good,"A typical day at work would be providing very good  customer service with every customer and making sure there experience with us is a memorable one. I learned how to interact with different personalities as well as fulfilling my duties that were expected of us from our management. I have also learned how to carefully manage keeping the office as well as the property in good standing. It has taught me time management skills as well as always putting our customers and their needs first. But also keeping up with our numbers and paperwork simultaneously."
good,"I would start at 6:30 AM because I worked with the East coast, and than is when the calls would start coming in. The number of calls varied from day to day, but there was always plenty to do. I was on call 24/7 because we had more than 2000 properties across the country with live-in Property Managers, and new claims could pop up at any time. "
good,"Nice place to work for a typical day at work would be very fast pace moving containers,loading containers on to the trucks for the days delivery.Help out customers with there containers great them at the door help them out . What I learned from the job was how to talk to the public on a dayli bases.The best part of the job was helping people with there containers got to meet lots of differnt people on a dayli bases."
good,"It was nice working here , good hours , great location , nouveau people to work with , and a easy job , customer can be a hand full but as long as you just listen to there problem acknowledge it things can go smoothly"
good,Public storage was good to me when i needed stability most. Ps gave me job security and great customer service knowledge and steven pfhole was/is the most fair District Manager i have ever worked for. I will always remember the great culture and training ps gave me the many years i was employed there.
good,"public storage is a nice place to work because you dont have to be trapped inside all day, half the day is outside and half the day is inside. so if it is nice out you get to be outside and enjoy it. The manager was very down to earth and very nice., the staff was very helpful and you were trained in every aspect of the job. They fully trained you and were very nice about it. When working at public storage you are not at the same location every week you get to travel between 2 stores."
good,"I do not like working at Public storage, only for the fact that I am a helper and I don't feel like I help people at this job a lot. Its sad when people call and say they can't pay there bill and its up for auction.  There's nothing I could do about it. Now There are good times when I can help a customer by telling them if the down size and transfer before the month is up, the credit they have on the lager unit will transfer as well.. I like how this job is fast pace. time go very fast. I've learn a lot working here.  One is organizing my time. task that I have to do through out the day and take care of customers. Also take care of unexpected situations. Dealing with difficult customers and staying polite with a smile on my face. Best of all they leave with a smile as well. The work environment is ok. The staff is very friendly and encouraging. As I said before I'm a helper I like to help others."
good,"You basically run your own business. Rent units, confirmation calls, collection calls, collect rent, clean property and report maintenance needs. "
good,a typical day at work would be a great day. i learned how to manage my employees and customers hardest part of the job would be having to auction off the customers items who didn't pay on their unit. seeing them lose all there things would be saddening. Most enjoyable part would be meeting different people.
good,"This job included a full work load each day which is very helpful as far as developing  in a career. The best thing to learn is how to deal with everyday people and construct with the workload for the day. It was a great experience with the veteran employees whom would help you to  become molded with the job, available to be called with any question being from the Senior manager to another Property manager."
good,"This job is pretty simple if you are a hard worker. It requires a few daily tasks for security purposes, and it's a great office job that does require some outside work. A typical day includes cleaning vacated spaces, renting storage units, taking payments, performing lock checks, making lease packets, and making calls to customers who haven't paid their rent."
good,"I loved working at Public Storage. My co-workers were great, we always had a good time and worked hard.  My manager was very hard working and always showed us great work ethics. If I ever had any questions she was the one I could go to for clarification and advice. I really enjoyed working in an office but having the opportunity to be outside with customers. "
good,Highly motivated employees and a great incentive structure makes it easy for managers to reward the top performers.
good,"renting units, selling moving supplies and cleaning units"
good,"I have been here 6 years and it's very easy. You work 5 days of the week. Also 2 days off. Paid holiday, also you have to work weekend but just 9 am to 5 pm"
good,"So basically you show units to people 25% of the time. The other 75% is spent making reservation calls, collection calls, or cleaning. I hate collection calls because people can be rude. My main gripe is how they bounce you around within a district. You can be at a store and half way through the day they can call you and make you go to a different store."
good,"organization skills: filing, basic office skills taking and relaying messages in timely manners, copies, stocking and cleaning, self starter "
good,"felt unsafe working with no cameras , and only person , very cold in winter"

good,Great company to work for. Had amazing benefits. I learned a lot from this job. Corporate is great. Smooth running company. Pay is fair for the task. .
good,"Public Storage is a great company with District managers that actually care about their employees. A typical day at work consists of the relief manager or property manager opening the office and making any reservation calls that need to be done. Calls include collection calls, courtesy calls to remind customer's of their rent due, initial reservation calls to make appointments for the customers to come look at units. There is a bit of light cleaning that is also expected. "

good,"typical day was rentals, dealing with property vendors, and overall customer service, I learned how to run a property management, and how to work well with different situations, I was a property manager for 4 years and I ran 2 different properties, my coworkers where very nice and helpful, hardest part of my job was, to agree with some of the polices that pertained in customers losing there items to auctions, and I enjoyed helping customers not lose there items."
good,It was a fun place to work. I really liked the people I worked with. The customers were great. The job was enjoyable. The work was easy and you got to be inside and outside.
good,Strong focus on task lists/audit functions. Emphasis on leadership skills and fundamentals. Loss prevention background required.  Public auction knowledge helpful.  Extremely physical environment.  Required to use power drills and saws to remove approx. 100-200 unit locks each month.
good,I was responsible for overseeing the rental of the storage spaces.
good,"This was a great company to work for. Until they harass you and treat you like a you are a child. they do not pay very well and want you to bend over and over work yourself. I ran a store that had over 750 units and over 650 tenants. Daily calls and collections, sales associate"

good,"helping customers, renting storages, selling materials that are need for rentals"
good,"Good place to work. Given a good amount of time to train and always have people there if you need help. There‚Äôs a lot of down time which can be nice, but it does make the day go a little bit slow. Depending on the location, you will be working with one other person, or alone."
good,"Management is okay, there's not much for advancement. If you go from relief to property manager you don't get an increase in pay.. pay isn't the best it could me either if you have a family. The benefits are good, a little pricy but worth it."
good,Thoroughly enjoy the work. I just need to advance. I've reached the highest position I can with them. There is nothing past property manager
good,"A typical day at work is conducting checks, renting units to customers and making sure that the customer is happy. I usually learn a better way to sell items and how to work as a team. I love most of the management especially my boss. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with friends."
good,I really loved this job the only problem was there was no room for growth. A typical day at public storage I would clock in by calling the mean office leaving a message with the store number and my name. Once that was done I would have to check the units which would be count time for the units. During this time would be to make sure no units were broking into the night before. If a unit was broken into the night before I would have to call the customer that owned the unit and have them call the polices and make a claim. What I have learned for this job would be no matter how hard you try to keep personal items safe its hard. I really loved this job because I was able to meet new people all the time.
good,I really liked my time at Public Storage.  The only thing I had issue with was the pay was lower than what I needed.  There was no job advancement in my position.
good,A typical day of work included counting the register as soon as you arrive. Opening the store and getting it ready for customers. Reading the lease and making the customer understand his or her rights. Showed the customers the units and rented it out. The hardest part of the job would of been the auction! People who unfortunately cant afford to pay their monthly fee will have there belongings auctioned off and people would come in very irate!!! But the best feeling of the job was getting the customers a good deal at a reasonable price!!
good,As a relief manage you will have to travel to different locations. Very independent job. You will be in charge of keeping the place clean and provide a positive experience to every move in.
good,A good place to help others who are down on their luck. Great place to store your belongings. If security was added to properties it would be great. Great place to learn.
good,"A typical day at work involves handling daily duties, assisting customers with their storage needs, and cleaning around the property. The position taught me to be more independent and figure out solutions on my own. The hardest part of the job is selling locks or insurance to customers. What I enjoyed most about the job is that the managers allow you to do your job without being overbearing."
good,Public storage give you the opportunity to interact with customers on a daily base. Its a great work place to help people. Fun place to work  and obtain new knowledge
good,Fun job had the change to hear lots of stories some sad and some good
good,Zero micro management!!! Best part! Able to work independently and DM easy to reach if needed. Public storage is a great addition to a manager resume as you are a key holder open/close etc
good,Place was very good to work. Co-workers are friendly and supportive. Some of the best bosses I've ever worked for. Small opportunity to advance. Unrealistic goals.
good,For being number one the lack of customer service skills showed in most employees. Strict rules and scripts on how to talk to each customer made employees seem robotic. District manager never praised employees but down graded employees efforts to do the right thing in the job. Hard work and lack of support from upper management was aweful. The Company was well run in the Corporate office with an Excellent CEO and Human Resource team. The employees were under values and under appreciated often. The management position I had was a revolving door always spinning round and round. In 6.5 years I was there 31 managers were let go or just quit. I might have stayed if the District manager of my next company had not lied to me and promised me things I did not receive when hired on. I learned a hard lesson and regret it.
good,"Public Storage, while I no longer work there was a good place to work with a lot of caring people. They do what they can to assist their employees to the extent of their abilities."
good,"Before getting into the office I do a quick perimeter walk around the property. I then go in print out my morning documents and call my neighboring property. I then prepare the bank deposits and make sure cash on hand is documented correctly, then off to check property fully. I like doing this because I often run into tenants and have short conversation. Hearing life stories and different opinions always leaves me open minded. I continue my day with other ""to do's"" and usually end with a evening property walk assuring tenants I am there to provide as much assistants Im capable of"
good,Great co workers and good managers amd maintenence staff. Large chain of facilities that all flowed smoothly as a district. Had a great training program and good district managers.
good,"A typical day would entail  first checking phone messages and reservations sent in after work day was over. Calling to set up appointments or confirming appointments made for that day. Writing a goal of what units to clean, what task to complete within the day, and how many sales we wanted to obtain that day. I would go over goal with the employee in my office and let them know I was there to help in any way. The day would continue I would go to the bank to drop off yesterday's deposit. The hardest part of the day was when customers vacated and we had to go clean the units, we were never sure of how customers would leave their storage units for us.  The fun part of the day was interacting with all the customers and building good rapport with them. At the end of the day we would look back at our goal sheet and see if we  succeeded and always talked about new ways we could do better."
good,"At the end of the month and the begging of the month you are overwhelmed but, the rest of the month it is easier.  Worked in my own office alone.  Opened up in the morning and closed in the evening all by myself.  Had an assistant part time and we got alone just fine.  Learned to manage my time with all the work that had to be done each day.  Learned to organized all the files, and the inventory. Hardest part of this place was when I had to leave.  Best part was the holidays and other things like the company picnic.  The meetings once a month, was able to meet other co-workers in the state."
good,"Peaceful and fun at the same time. Always something to do, never really a dull moment. I learned alot about managing properties. The property managers and district managers were always helpful and willing to provide more training for employees to advance in the company. My co-workers were fun and we always helped one another. The hardest part was getting customers to pay their pastdue bills. The easiest part was getting new customers to rent units. i enjoyed selling merchandise and getting people to rent out units."
good,My Typical day at work was good we had daily duties we did first thing in the morning afternoon and evening .I learned how to deal with upset customers and how to work with them .
good,Great place to work horrible pay if the pay was better I would still be there unfortunately I was not able to get a Apt and that was a deal breaker as well
good,"I would recommend working at Public Storage to gain management experience.  Worked here for 1 year. DM was always understanding and lovely. There were fast paced days, but mostly slow paced depending on the season. Lots of down time, which is great if you attend school. Great benefits. Set schedule, do not have to worry about hours being cut."
good,Management need to be nice and appreciate there employees. Especially the property managers. Starting of the month and end of the month is tough cuze people are moving out and new people are coming to rent the space it‚Äôs very tough cuze you have to work alone at the same time you have to clean do the bank runs.
good,I loved working here but after awhile it's like running on a hamster wheel. They don't advance from within but I love having the freedom to run my own store and get to know my customers and residents.
good,"I have worked for PS for over 12 years. "
good,"Public Storage is a great place to work, if you are serious about being there everyday, as I was. It is a family atmosphere and the floor is full of cheer leaders willing to mentor or advise in guidance to a better reservation rate. Key word is keeping a 70% res rate and a 30% production rate. The company is fair and generous. I will miss my second family."
good,"your days are pretty much the same making delinquecy calls, making sure the property is clean and rent/visit ready, you must be able to multi task and finish task within a set time frame. By being Key training professional had to opportunity to train 14 plus employees to prepare the for the field in storage through vidoes and handson training"
good,"My day to day routine very seldom changed. I managed and worked at the property 90% of the time by myself. I had plenty of time to coordinate my day and time wisely. The hardest part of the job was finding enough things to do to keep me busy throughout the day because I like to say I ran a very tight ship. The most enjoyable part of my day was satisfying each and every customer that came into my property, because that is what is most important in any retail/customer service position."
good,Public storage is a great company to work for. I have learned a lot of how to deal with stressful circumstances. You learn how to run a business if you plan on own your own someday.
good,I learned a lot from my time at this company. It allowed the employee to get involved with most of its business aspects and the process of its business.
good,"The company could pay better . "
good,"great place to work, great employees and management. Very helpful through it all. My only down is the hours. I like early 6am start to 4pm. 9:30-6pm is rough on me only because i have 3 kids. By time i get home and around its time for them to go to bed. "
good,"Work life balance is great"
good,"typically when I open up a customer is already waiting for me, then ill do a walk around the property to make sure nothing is out of order and clean up a little. do some calls on past-due tenants. once I've finished doing lock check and some light cleaning on the property ill typically clean around the office and bathrooms. All the while helping customers either rent a storage or take payments."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. you don't have someone watching over you . you work by yourself most of the time so when you don't have calls to do and you are done with the rest of your work you have time to relax and play a game on your phome until you get another customer
good,"In addition to normal duties, I was able to do extra maintenance work for the company.  Also assisted with auctions.  I enjoyed working at a number of different sites and appreciated the professional culture of the company."
good,"Take this company seriously and you'll be fine. They have a lot of room for growth, take advantage of your time there. They are always looking for good people."
good,Publicstorage is a good.job for college students. Balanced atmosphere. Not a lot of room for growth. It was a great stepping stone and good on your Resume' being a Manager
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at public storage. Everyone was kind and the work environment was wonderful. My position was challenging, but that's what made it enjoyable. The reason why I left was because I went into labor early and had complications. Due to him being that early, I was unable to return to work for some time, due to unpaid maternity leave, because I wasn't with the company for a year. I wasn't bitter about it, because I understood, but due to that reason, I was unable to afford childcare. Other than that, I loved my job."
good,"Assigned as Resident Property Manager in less than two months after being hired, ahead of more senior personnel."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Public Storage very much. I loved the people I worked with including all of the upper management. Public Storage is great for self starters, I took great pride in the properties I worked at. I   treated them as my own property. It feels great when your bosses recognize the hard work and achievements you've accomplished. I also really enjoyed the goals being set every month...it gave us property managers something to work towards each month besides offering the best customer service. The hardest part would be dealing with maintenance issues that the property managers weren't able to take care of."
good,"Public Storage great place to work at. Typical work can be steady during off season and peak season on the weekend can get really get overwhelming. I would say it gave me great experience of managing multiti million dollar storage company. Only that I can say hard about the job is nothing, real laid back steady flowing job. Also would like to say I enjoyed working at your own pace."
good,"Public Storage is a company that is surrounded by the customers. As a intern under my mother, I learned to balance the petty cash, take payments via cash, check and credit card. I also had hands on experience with customers. From renting spaces to making delinquent calls. Hardest part was not being able to provide an appropriate price for a customer. The most enjoyable was beating the quota due after every month."
good,"Had a great district manager.  Worked 8 different stores,  sometimes with only a few mins heads up that I would be working at a different store,  than the one I was already headed to. Great company.  Awful insurance though,  the insurance company will TRAP you into their company- and you can't get back out until you are covered elsewhere... that was the worst part about this job."
good,This job is very simple and for those who like to work alone. Training is extremely easy and quick. Typical day consists of making phone calls and just making sure the property is clean.
good,"I enjoyed my work with public storge, I left due to a shoulder injury and could no longer lift the doors or do any cleaning. I work week was set, which helped me plan events."
good,"easy job, you always stay busy. you spend 50% in office and 50% out of office. dealing with customers would probably be the best part of the job but could also be the hardest"
good,Public Storage was good to me i really don't complaint much. The challenge is the opportunity to growth is limited. I wish they had training to become a DM because it hurt I had to leave the the company to get a and opportunity to grow after 13 years with the company. Through the years I was able to meet great people. I would recommended to a young person looking to put there foot in a very stable company.
good,Working here was great. A day in the life always felt very productive and successful. The Management and Employees here were always friendly and great to work with. Special Events and Team Building Events allowed us to interact departmentally where we wouldn't otherwise get the opportunity. Great benefits and PTO. Small downside sometimes required to work weekends.
good,"It can be busy at times, several work opportunities to get completed throughout the day/week. Work hours are flexible to meet the 40+ hours needed. Shifts are fair between all employees."
good,"I loved working for PS. hours were 9:30am-6pm (weekdays) and 9:30-5:00pm (weekends). You are staffed alone or with another person and running a rental facility. It is very hands on, lots of indoor  office work, collection calling, executing rental agreements, and cleaning rental units outside. My particular District Manager was amazing. I cannot speak for other DM's in the other Charlotte divisions. You accumulate PTO every day you work and the benefits are pretty good as well. There is really no room for advancement after becoming a Property Manager. You come hired as a relief manager and become a property manager as needed. Becoming a PM is not guaranteed. However, the job security is amazing. I love this job. Pretty good pay, raises every 6 months. No complaints here. On a busy day or during ""move in season"" it can get very overwhelming if you're working a property alone. You also have to be a great upseller."
good,"Such an amazing place to work. I enjoyed meeting and speaking with people from all walks of life. Management and Co-workers worked well to create the perfect team, encouraging and helping each other."
good,"Used to have sessions on other platforms mostly on Investment banking, lot of training sessions on stress relief, A  typical day used to be busy on the shop floor."
good,"I loved working here. The hours were great and the pay was okay but you are unable to move up in the company. Once you go from relief to property manager that's it, but it's still a good job if you don't mind not being able to move up."
good,"Managing over 300 accounts for tenants renting real estate.  Keeping delinquency down by keeping in touch with tenants to work out payment arrangements.  Selling products.  Maintaining property to be sure property is clean as well as overseeing everything is in working order.   "
good,"I would open my office by counting money . going outside and tidy up my property. I would get my golf cart out and do a detailed property check insure my customers spaces are locked secure or to see if I had any vacancies. then I would go to the bank. during the day ,it was always different. Renting spaces, making collection calls, and generally helping customers with any issues.I learned to listen to peoples problems and have answers to make their move smooth and easy as possible. I worked with some of the nicest people. we all worked at different properties but at any time you need a question answered they were a call away. the only hard part may have been trying to take care of all customers when it became very busy and giving each customer your 100% .The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and the feeling that I helped them in a time of stress and need. it was very fullfilling"
good,"worked at 9 different locations cleaned facilities, sales in moving supplies in month to month rentals in storage spaces, some administration duties but customer service issues"
good,"Come into work and check phone for messages and return calls. Count cash drawer making sure there's 100.00 to start with. Customer come in to make payment post the payment in the computer, print and give customer receipt. Customers come in to rent storage space, Ask them what their storing to get them the right size at the best price. Type their lease up and give them gate code to access property from 6am to 9pm. Customer comes in and states their finished storing, You go out and make sure unit is empty and vacate them out of computer system thus removing their gate code to get onto property. Drive gold cart to the unit they vacated out of and sweep unit out, check light make sure it works, put mouse packet in corner of unit close the door and put lock on unit. Sell merchandise from boxes to tape to bundle of boxes. End of day print report that shows amount of money and check and credit cards taken in daily and write out deposit slip for next day of going to the bank. Put daily deposit in safe and lock front door and go home."

good,"If you're into clerical work but get bored at time and need something that's more in demand? Working at Public Storage give you that. There's clerical work to be done as well as manual but not hard work. Driving the cart checking each unit to make sure that the unit or secure, to sweeping trash that customer leave behind and cleaning each vacated unit after a tenant moves out."
good,"Public Storage LLC, is my first time working for storage industry, this company has teach me a lot what storage is all about and also helped me understanding when customer have question for what they need stored there storage needs."
good,"PS has a great comprehensive training program to get you up to speed with their system. The management was great and very caring of their employees (Eden Prairie, MN). A day would start with opening the store, checking reservations, and doing a ""lock check"" in which one would walk and/or drive the golf cart and check the locks on the rental units. The day would continue with showing and renting units to customers. Then, an afternoon inventory/lock check before closing the store."
good,Typical day at work will always be busy and will make the time go faster. Always leaning new things in the job. Management is always friendly and will work with you. The workers in the company are very professional. Being able to keep the job fun by keeping the customers happy.
good,This company gave me my first management experience and I learned so much from the owner and learned the basics of how to run a successful company.

good,"Public Storage has one of the best training programs for employees.  I adore and admire most of my Co-workers ( Unfortunately, there are a couple of coworkers that I DON'T enjoy working with) aside from those two individuals I don't like working with, I love my job.  Our District Managers and KTPs are very knowledgeable and easy to work with.  Whenever I have a question.... I can call one of our more experienced RFs or PMs and they are always willing to help me with whatever problem I have.  We have monthly meetings that we have to attend if we are scheduled to work......we usually go over new programs, discuss issues and enjoy each others company.  After the meeting is over with, there is always something to eat and drink.  Again....I love my jobüòä"
good,Easy going and you deal with a lot of different people everyday. I love the job but feel like the pay is ok. Can't really complain except the pay should be better for the amount of work that is done.
good,A typical day at work would have been to come in and open the property and print out all the reports. Start the day off by planning what needs to be done and doing a lock check. I learned a lot about Florida state statues when renting a unit with a company. Management was very knowledgeable. Co workers were very helpful and just a phone call away. Hardest part of the job was being alone at a property when multiple rentals occurred. The most enjoyable part was being able to work at your own pace and having a typical work schedule.
good,"I absolutely love my job. I am a current employee and have been with the company for 6 months now. Coworkers are very helpful. Upper management like my District Manager are awesome. "

I had previous time management skills before this but this job definitely taught me many more time management skills. I worked with several different co-workers since in my district there were nine different properties.
