rating,review
bad,"Great Experience, Horrible Leadership, no regard for family and very political,  I learned a lot but the executive team was very narasitic and driven completly be revenue and don't care about humans"
bad,"Young , lady layed off , by phone"
bad,"need  i say more than that, as long as your face fits, do as your told in a school like manner regardless of what you can bring to the table especially when you just want to do a good job."
bad,It’s a dictatorship and management is very unprofessional. It’s like high school. I don’t recommend this company to anyone. Most of the employees who work there are very unhappy.
bad,"I was brought on to Mckesson through a temp agency that gave a to of false information about what the job was going to be like and what the future with the company would be like. When I got to Mckesson on the first day I realized that this was a mass hiring which they call the ""blizzard"" for the beginning of the year when insurance benefits restart in order for us to call insurance companies for patients. We were set up in rooms with cheap foldable tables and chairs, with 3 computers to each table and barely enough room between everyone to move. We were treated like cattle throughout the entire time I was there. The temp agency told me that after the first 3 months of being there we would be able to be hired on at a full time employee through McKesson, however I was told something much different once I started there. It was rare for people to actually get hired on as a full time employee and even when you did, it still wasn't a good company to work for. The managers throughout the ""blizzard"" only liked the people who sucked up to them rather then the people who were good at their jobs. People would be there one day and gone the next because the temp agency would tell them not to come back just because a manager didn't like them. I am a very hard worker and had no issues with my manager, however I realized that there was no way that I would want to continue on with this company even if I was offered an opportunity. When we completed the ""blizzard"" work, there was nothing else for us to do as employees, however they would still just have us sit around and stare at our computers"
bad,McKesson is not a great company.  There is a lot of bullying and inappropriate behavior from senior management.  This behavior was tolerated and rewarded.
bad,"The material handler position at Salt Lake City, Utah for McKesson is for those who aren't advancing their lives in terms of career, academics or athletics. It is for those whose lives are sustained by still living at home, or still in their mid-twenties. The job is ideally for people who have decided to buy automobiles that will take ten-plus years to pay off (read: they can't really afford the vehicle and all the associated costs of wear, tear, maintenance and insurance). Why buy a luxury or high-performance automobile if all you're doing is driving it to work, with a small commute (or in rush hour) and if you work nights? I digress; this job is for masochists who suffer from the 'Classic American' syndrome that pain and suffering (and ignoring your body's way of telling you something is wrong), constitutes hard work. It is the epitome of 'work hard' (and don't work smart). Energy drinks and cigarettes -- do I need to say anything else about this job that says there is no work-life balance? "
bad,"I worked 14 hours each day, I was always exhausted. Management worked you like dogs and never seemed to care or help when you needed it. The whole company is nothing but a joke. They expect to work you to the bone for little money with no bonuses or no room to move up into the company. I would never recommend anyone working for the company."
bad,"When I was hired as a case manager I was told I would not be taking inbound calls.  That was not true and when I was continually harassed by a member and management told me to suck it up, $21 or not you do not pay for me to verbally abused.  In the end, I ended up in intensive care fighting for my life.  No job is worth my life."
bad,Upper management is horrible. They don't care about you as a person or the fact the you may have a life away from work. Supervisors and managers are to worried about people liking them to do their jobs correctly
bad,They expected us to do our job with little to minimal training.   Play favorites.  Manager was a big bully with many emails sent cutting us down.  Advancement hard to achieve.
bad,Leaving the PSL location was the best decision of my life.  The people there are only worried about the companies profit off of you. Nothing more. I would never recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"constantly in danger of getting fired. they fired and rehire entire shifts every 4 months and only contract work. No help from management, fire you on Sundays."
bad,The work environment was horrible place to work like slaves low salaries no culture no education a lot preference in the job performance they cut you hours no even work 40 a week they push you to finish the job and then send you home early
bad,My manager is a classic example of incompetent leadership. She was promoted to the top when she should have been fired long ago. She has no ability to communicate effectively with her employees. Here management style is management by fear. You're never commended for the 1000 things you did right but you're chastised for the one thing you did wrong. The environment is awful.
bad,Short staffed over worked and half the staff don't pull their finger out no support from management 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
bad,"Terible place to work, was written up to be fired due to their attendance policy turns out that they had the number of points that I had wrong.  Employee threatened to fight me because I took his parking spot.  I was written up for not being efficient even though I picked more than anyone on the shift!  HR executive didnt turn in our union paperwork.  Sad place to work from top to bottom."
bad,"My duties were to serve at the counter and counsel patients on over the counter medications.Then after a while I  started dispeng which is a process that requires to pick the right medication(in terms of quantity,strength,active ingredient,brand).On top of that, I was part of the care home staff of the pharmacy which supplies local care homes with their monthly medications.The best part of the job was being able to help people while the downsides were staff(there is a serious bullying culture),the complete disorganisation (we were without a line manager for  months),the total lack of training and the fact that the pharmacy was constantly busy."
bad,Company services & panders to multiple pharmaceutical vendors.  Programs are not well thought out or staffed. They hire a mass of temporary employment with promises of permanent jobs but realistically taking on about 5% or less. McKesson & Temporary service (Remx) work together to hire and end contracts at whim hiding under state labor laws. Warning most jobs last 6mos or less.
bad,dont work here not a good company to work for bad pay bad hours bad managment bad location stay well clear treat there staff really bad dont pay wages on time
bad,"La supervisora y las leads tienen preferencia con los empleados ,yo me tuve que ir de la compañía por que una lead,la supervisora y una compañera me hostigaban y ya no pude soportar más, nos tienen esclavizados hasta horas de la madrugada y es obligatorio quedarse ,no hay vida ,al menos yo tengo vida fuera de esa empresa ,estoy feliz de haber dejado ése ambiente tóxico  por culpa de ésas 3 personas estuve muy enferma."
bad,"So I started working for Mckesson as a temp through the agency remx. Biggest mistake of my life. They use these temp agencies to do their dirty work, they use employees holding a permanent position over their heads and pull the rug out from them and fire them at the last second."
bad,"Lack of professional characteristics being shown in office. "
bad,"McKesson, especially Scottsdale office, is a toxic environment and I encourage anyone considering to run for the hills, I promise you won't regret it. "
bad,"Dishonest management."
bad,"McKesson leads are all white with the exception of 1, who is extremely passive. They assign sweeping the floor, cleaning freezer bags, pulling apart foam and bubble wraps, taping boxes to people of color. I brought this to management attention, and I was told I will do what I'm told and if they want to assign me the job everyday they can. They have made the employees work with no running water, or toilet facilities for hours, the system crash and they made the employees stay for 6 hours with no work, but they made people of color sweep the floor, and build boxes while everyone else stood around talking.  I was under the radar because  I questioned why haven't white people been assigned these jobs once? After that, I was let go."
bad,"Horrible experience save yourself the time and headache I wouldn't recommend this horrendous unorganized favoritism and belittling to anyone."
bad,When they hire you they hire you as a temporary employee. It sucks cause they can determine when you become a full time employee. Which I find favoritism.
bad,Management all somehow connected awful experience can’t even go into words a lot expected of you for nothing back no empathy for colleges and very unprofessional
bad,"Working at McKesson was like working in a sweat shop. You go in, work your job until it’s done, then go to other departments until they are done.  Never worked less than 12 in one given day. I would never recommend this job to anyone"
bad,The management is very unfair here they work you to death and you better not even look at them the wrong way or they'll replace you one of the members of management was an X human trafficker
bad,"Very unprofessional work environment.  Dress code was a joke, people wore flip-flops & ripped jeans, even upper management. Promotions are scarce, the pay is a joke, & no one seems to know what they REALLY do but yet they know everything. The person assigned to train me was a rude know it all."
bad,"Director at this CBO, bad mouthed everyone. Always walks around with a negative attitude, cursing, talks negatively about CFO, CEO. Turnover is very poor, due to her, the way she treats employees, makes threats."
bad,No communication...horrible atmosphere... you are just a number to the company... training is laughable... favoritism is very obvious...would not recommend this employer.
bad,"The staffing agency hires you in to do medical enrollment for McKesson with the promise that you have to dress professional every day and be on time and do the work properly and they will hire you at the end of the project.  This is a big FAT LIE.  They never hire you and they have some people that have worked through an agency for over 5 years and are never hired on permanently.  Plus if you need to use the restrooms, they make you sign out and sign back in.  A bunch of cheapskates making opioids drugs and delivering 1000's of opioids to pharmacies in extremely small towns."
bad,"It sucked and would never work there again, They allow people with little experience to be put in managerial positions. And they don't care that you have experience  being a manager. It is all about who you know. They treat people unfair"
bad,"This company say that they have room for growth, but unless you are liked  they will not let you move forward. They hold you back if in the material handling department. Instead of giving you options to grow."
bad,Horrible experience and I didn’t receive my check several times. The management are liars and manipulative people. Just was a horrible experience for me
bad,They hire to many people at one time then let everyone go. I thought this was one of the best company but I found out they wasn't. They run out of work and they will fire you. The people in charge don't know how to manage the work flow. Don't work at this company.
bad,Got to snitch on someone just to move up.   DON'T NOT APPLY KEEP SCROLLING  This Job is not healthy at all. Spend more time at the job than you do at home
bad,Management doesn't care about the workers if you are African American please don't apply you are treated different from white people. When I started it was 3 African American all on morning shift all 3 was a target of the manager
bad,"Upper Management is dishonest with employees, training is extremely poor and staff is treated disrespectfully by upper management. Employees are not given correct information and set-up to fail."
bad,"Untrustworthy & ineffectual management, preferential treatment, sub-standard on the job training & unqualified training staff, inadequate compensation with exponentially increasing workload, unbalanced workload distribution among teams, ineffective human resources department. Dead-end job, avoid at all cost."
bad,Would never recommend anyone work here. The management is horrible. They treat everyone like prisoners. They’re rude and controlling. I would rather scrape donkey xxxx out of barns than work here.
bad,"I worked here for 4 months and all I received from this place was no life, terrible benefits offered (only health savings plan options), hostile work environment, lies from management, intimidation tactics from leadership, favoritism throughout the facility, bodily pain (blisters, swelling, runners toe and lost 2 toe nails) no talking while working or you will be yelled at by the leaders on shift. No room for advancement and no pay raises. Must be able to SPEED walk 20 miles a night. Only two 20 minute breaks for a 10 plus hour shift and you will be working from midnight to 4 or past 4am with no breaks. I bought a fit bit just to see what I was really doing to my body and the human body is not made for the work they require of you. I have worked 3 different picker jobs in warehouse and this place is the only place I ever wanted to slit my wrists from. If interviewed beware, they will lie to test to see your availability and claim you cant take off for up to 6 months which is a lie. They want you to recommend people for jobs to turn around and lie to them. They lost opportunities for good honest employees over this. Aggressive employees and fighting, solutions they have for this even with cameras to see it is to separate them into different areas rather then terminating the aggressors and preventing it from happening it to others if conflict arises again. Please know your self worth and look elsewhere unless you are completely desperate for a job."
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for pay is always wrong and took me 4 months to claim money back that my manager robbed me off me and put it onto my earnings
bad,"McKesson is not a great place to work. Management hinders promotions, need new management. no outside training opportunities. compensation for role is on the low end"
bad,Worked for this company for 10 years in the past year ive been off twice with depression and anxiety regarding the manager blinkered he is wont listen only to himself no point going to line managers no support nothing gets done would advise anyone applying to this company not to run the other way enough said .
bad,"Company has a great idea of what management should be, but the execution as expected, is poor, I won't name the specific member of management over a specific proprietary software, but they have clear specifications in their hiring process which are less than ethical, and clear cut obvious signs of favoritism, the company should listen to hard working, intelligent employees, over someone who gets a job from seniority, not skill."
bad,"Most important elements we look for in a company aside from, salary, benefits and recognition is culture, engagement and most importantly good managers."
bad,"not a good job for work life balance, no room for growth, management did not care for their employees at all. I would never refer someone to this company. All this company cares about is working their employees to death like slaves so they can make a dollar."
bad,"Just like most call centers, it's centered around productivity; little time or effort is shown to entry-level employees-- especially those hired by staffing... just a low-paying.  boring, un-engaging environment."
bad,"Unless you are into clicks like high school and suck up to people in charge you will never be promoted.  If you are good at your job you will never get promoted or a pay raise. Company doesn't care if you are sick or have family problems,  this is a right to work state and you can be fired for any reason or no reason at all. The people you work with are not your friends and are looking for a reason to take the job."
bad,"This place allows hard workers to perform more than one task daily, the slackers sit back and watch you work all while making the same pay. Management is poor, and it's plenty of favoritism."
bad,"No, do yourself a favor and never work at this company because they are completely unfair and the management has been terribly here since the day that I had started"
bad,"I was dedicated to my job I enjoy helping patients, I learned that no matter how much you did your best your best was not enough for the company. Hardest part of the Job was accepting the favoritism and the racism that went on."
bad,"McKesson is a company in a constant state of turnover and in a perpetual state of reorging their management to hide areas of weakness. Management has no strategy for the future, fudges numbers to mask lost revenue. All employees are micro managed by some of the most unprofessional and unfriendly managers I've ever worked for or heard about. The company offers little directive, training, bonuses, incentive or appreciation for their employees."
bad,I never though a job would cause my depression to spiral downhill so fast. I lost all my happiness and self worth working here. Being tossed around liked the rest with zero regard to us needing stable work and to be valued. You are used up and treated like garbage... Human toilet paper with no benefits.
bad,"At this job there is no real support from the management. Speaking of management, there are a handful of managers and none of them seem to know who you report to. The workplace culture is toxic, there is a lot of bad things being said among the employees, there is backstabbing going on, there is favoritism going on, when you bring up a suggestion they totally ignore you etc. Management works you so hard to almost your breaking point; it is as if they want you to quit. It would be nice if the management would focus on the employees well being. If that was the case then the turnover rate wouldn't be so high."
bad,"The supervisors always have something rude to say and are negative. No one knows how to do thier job they push it off to the next person/department. If you don't mind being told your ideas are not welcome and to shut up sit down and do your job this is the place for you. I am a positive, patient, compassionate person but working at Mckesson it sucked the soul out of me I became mean, irritated and frustrated. They don't train you with the correct information to do the job  if you get training at all that is.... I had 3 days of general company information training then was thrown into my position where I learned the program and systems on my own to be the ""department subject matter expert"" which is sad because there are people that have been in that same line of business since it launched 4 years ago! They never provided coaching or even constructive criticism. A I got was scolding and public shaming (in chats, in leadership meetings ect) they have a culture of whomever sucks up the most gets ahead and if you actually have skills they get worried you will raise the bar and look for a way to either get rid of you or stifle you in some way. All this company did for me is make me re evaluate what is important to me and working for people who have no leadership skills and only care about where they benefit without any regards to who they have to step on is definitely not the environment I want to be in."
bad,This place is misleading to say the least.  A bunch of pipe dreams and sorry management.  There is no room for advancement or professional growth.  Please stay away!
bad,I was working for staffing agency. On Friday evening I got call from agency saying that don't come for work on Monday as your assignment ended. Yours was a short term project. I guess they didn't came to know about assignment on Friday morning. They should inform employee about project is getting over atleast week in advance so employee can try to find another work. No actual reason given to me for lay off.
bad,"Easy work"
bad,There is no work/life balance and lack of structure within McKesson Corp.  There are many different areas within the organization and pray they are not like Corp office.
bad,"Horrible place to work. "
bad,"Favouritism and poor working conditions. Management had favorites and treat women unfairly."
bad,I hated this place all the favortism my boss was a hound that liked a certian type of woman and I was a hard worker and he kept a chick he use to date. He tried to be everybodies friend the training sucked and I was not informed I was supposed to correct what scottsdale messed up and then I get the call they are down sizing. B.S I hate mckesson dont work for them its unorganized and u will be confused.
bad,It was not the most pleasant job or environment I have worked in. The place could use a lot of improvements with the director and managers. I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,Worked there for a year poor work energy everyone hates the job.Management doesn’t know how to do simple tasks like their own jobs.The bosses say it’s not a career it’s just a job.
bad,Just another company of the many more of my time why do I have to write a whole review about every single company right work for that has no matter all these corporations are the same there for profit and they do not care about the employee notary family
bad,This was a temporary position. It was a call center environment that was fun at times but for the most part very quiet. it was hard to verify ins as a 3rd party and most calls were 30 to 45 min of hold time.
bad,"Managers need to be replaced, all of them. They lie to you, don't communicate, don't care, treat the employees poorly, make assumptions, then fire you based on non-sense in their minds. This is ""that"" company."
bad,"Please DON'T BOTHER! They rope you in with their smiles and desirable pay but this has been THE MOST uncomfortable, hostile, unprofessional work environment. I shouldn't feel like crying every morning while getting ready for work. The management in the Scottsdale Merck Department make you feel so uncomfortable and once your on they're radar, they'll target you until either you leave or they fire you. It's not worth the pay. Just look somewhere else!!!"
bad,"McKesson does not care about their employees, they treat them with no respect and they'll discriminate against you. All they care about is making their millions of dollars."
bad,The management sucks they tell lies you don’t know what time you getting off I don’t recommend no one to work there period. At all the bosses have their favorites
bad,"We were promised by our managers that our support jobs would not move to India; and this is the message that we were told to tell our customers.  However that didn't last and now within a year of our acquisition from McKesson 70% of support jobs have been moved to India."
bad,"For a company that says ICARE, they really have not proved that, very disappointed I wasted my time working here. When all was said and done I was left homeless and carless with my 3 children, evil corporation showed no remorse for ruining my life."
bad,Its get the work done at all cost. Nothing Matters but the job. The pay is low for the employees. The industry is charged with over pricing medications but the employees who supply the medications aren't compensated unless you are upper management. The worse medical plans offered.
bad,"Rx Crossroads is basically a 3PL for pharma. Ugly PAP & CPAP business that nobody wants. Systems are lacking, high turnover and difficult to recruit for. Long hours, low pay, terrible healthcare costs."
bad,Worst place i have Ever worked. Managers don’t care about the wellbeing of their employees. Working 16+ hour days everyday. And not being paid enough? I’ll pass wouldn’t recommend it to my enemy
bad,"The discounts you get with other companies like Verizon, Sprint, etc are nice, however the work environment is beyond stressful. You have to do your job plus correct other people’s errors & you are still expected to smile & suck up to management. Team leaders & Managers throw stupid rules out of nowhere at you & if you need time off they require 48 business hours notice. I had a doctor’s appointment come up for lab work & my PTO request was denied because it wasn’t done “in time”. Definitely looking for another job. 20% off of my phone bill is not worth the stress."
bad,"Nothing good to say about Mckesson,  don't work there. The management was horrible, no advancement opportunity . Management played favorites, pay was not up to par with living costs"
bad,"there is no room for advancement, its not about your work ethic or how good you are at your job it was about who you know, the people that get promoted are related to someone higher up or are simply ""yes men"". Horrible to work there i would rather die then ever work there again."
bad,Working for McKesson was literally horrible. There is absolutely no room for advancement. There are individuals who have been working for the company as a temp for 2+ years and are still contracted employee (temp). Supervisors are rude and unprofessional.
bad,"As a contracted employee, they can cut your position at any time for any reason with no recourse. There is no job stability here. The hiring manager was wonderful, but the subsequent manager provided no support or guidance and as previously stated, if a manager does not like you for any reason, you're gone."
bad,Do not work there. mass lay off of facility they kept the new employees that were low paying. The severance package was good! The management is why the place went down hill.
bad,"If you have any type of values do not work at mckesson in fort worth, especially the tech support departments...Management is very poor and the culture is cut throat!!!!!!"
bad,The attitude of management and the attitude of callers  were hard to deal with.  The more you did the worse it got.  Never want to work like this again
bad,"Cut throat,  fast paced not worth the hours.  always overtime. very very rare to get out at 8 hours . to many favorites. Qould be good hob for college students"
bad,Mckesson in Scottsdale AZ is NOT recommended . the reasons are 1) they gave a 1.5% pay raise very low for a company that makes alot. 2) medical benefits are Poor. Mckesson gives the lowest coverage to employees . mckesson is all about keeping profits and money . they make alot of money and yet last year without any communicaton they Stopped giving a 50 gift card for christmas to employees. MGMT is NOT good . they dont care about employees and morale got worse and worse. Also they are so cheap they hire temp agency employees to save money and make they wait up to 2 years. Honestly this company gets an F grade. I would NOT recommend this place at all . its also a 3rd party employer. Yes its THAT BAD. ..its all true and correct every word. DO NOT WORK THERE.
bad,Very poor company to work for. Employees harass other employees with no consequences. they do not require employees to take a drug test even if they get into an accident at work. Would not recommend working here for anyone.
bad,The management team here is not great leaders.  They have unrealistic expectations and do not engage with you and blunt favoritism.  The management takes to much time to micromanage.
bad,"Over the past 11 years, I have come to realize more and more that this company does not care about their employees. The management is all about the bottom line and will throw anyone under the bus they need to in order to meet that bottom line. For the largest medical company in the world, their health benefits are not great and their pay is even worse. Most people use this company as a training ground for a better job. I am looking for a company that cares about it's employees and I've come to realize that this is not McKesson (now Change Healthcare)."
bad,This is the most unprofessional place I’ve ever worked.  Training is poor.   Management is poor and unknowlegable and does nothing but micromanage employees.  The pay is poor for the volume of work.  Extremely high stress and the amount of multitasking is off the charts.  Unrealistic expectations.
bad,This place in not the orginal part of mckesson... It is located in maine... Never work here -- I was not happy and the are not the ral mckesson out of california
bad,Just kept my head down and worked management was not willing to work with your outside schedule and there were no advancement opportunity for anybody.
bad,I was not with the company to long so I don’t know much about it. It was another company before it was McKesson. So I can’t really say not to work there or not
bad,"Bad  management,  Hostile environment.,"
bad,Mckesson still has old time policies with little to no advancement. The company's manager would prefer you brown nose. Not only that there is no team spirit or morale.
bad,Do not become comfortable working for the company. Quick to let someone go as they get accustom to working for the company. I wish you the best of luck.
bad,the pay is decent and the work is simple.... The employees at the La Vergne TN location are very jealous like and the management does not listen or give a care about you.
bad,no room for growth. no manager or team leaders are held accountable for their mistakes. its all on employees. management and team leads have their favorites. be aware..
bad,"I hated the place...was treated like a slave, could not leave the place till the job was done...had a very bad atmosphere every one thought that they were your boss"
bad,There is demand for excessive overtime and the pay was not commensurate. Management selected were not qualified nor experienced enough to make impactful decisions.
bad,off shoring everything so people lost their jobs and they didn;t tell them till last minute tings changing everytime you walked into the door poor management
bad,When McKesson sold us we as a group was unsure what direction the new leadership team would respond. When the company was now a new company we as a group had our doubts.  Business stayed the same and positive new horizons developed.
bad,"Not a place I would recommend."
bad,"management is horrible   it's bad to work here most times no one knows what they are doing, workload is awful  I think that is enough"
bad,"Cut Throat, Under Paid, Lack of Benefits, Insane Overtime, No work life balance.Unsafe work Environment for both employees and product in warehouse, terrible management staff"
bad,"Mckesson is a terrible company to work for, they use you and abuse you until they get what they want, than they just drop you like a bomb. Mckesson is a very discriminating company."
bad,the management was unorganized and unprepared. they were not friendly and did not take the trining process seriously. they expected too much of trainees
bad,"In all of my life in a work environment i never had seen a company that did not care about there own employees, They give you no credit or acknowledgement on hard work, they would put  employees to set for failure !! would not recommend this company for anyone"
bad,"Deceitful practices. There are other employers out there that show at least some compassion for their employees. This is not that place! ."
bad,"Since its acquisition of McKesson EIS, I can't say the experience has been a good one. The uncertainty and downgrades to management caused some self-serving vicious actions."
bad,"Had to ask everyday what they wanted me to do for the day. No structure. Was given no direction, spent more time sitting watching videos and town hall meetings than working."
bad,McKesson has a history of allowing management to mistreat their employees. Working for them was the most stressful job because of management. Harassment levels high and no in house recourse. They don't protect or care much for their employees. The abuse I endured there was horrible. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
bad,No career advancement is available. There is a mass exodus of skilled talent out of the organization. Employee moral is very low. Management is incompetent.
bad,"none, it was terrible.  everyone out for themselves, favoritism, managers have no experience. I would not recommend working for them, it is temp to hire and very few people get hired permanately"
bad,"McKesson was a great place to work when I first started. They build you up as this being a positive, fun working environment. After being here a few months, the truth comes out. They play favorites and if you have any disagreement with management, they treat you different and you get passed over for promotions, even when you're the most qualified. The drama is worse than high school. The need to work on their management skills and how to talk to people. If you like drama, like being talked down to, don't want to advance and like constantly being told you're wrong (when you're 100% right) then this is the job for you."
bad,I would like to be able to write something positve about this company and i think it would be that they have A/C. I have never worked in a company that EVERY single day you wondered if you would be let go because of a misstep or mistake.
bad,Is the Walmart version of the health care field. With all the funds it has coming in the employees don't see any of that. They don't have good benefits at all. And they wont hire most of the employees keep most of them at Temp status
bad,"McKesson does not allow room for advancement. along with this, when applying for other departments, it is common to be held back by your own manager. being micromanaged by a manager in another state also does not help with the job."
bad,"Constantly getting rid of good people, poor leadership. A lot of work with not enough people assisting the customers. No work life balance what soever"
bad,"Not a good company to work with at all. Terrible leadership,  communication, organization, just terrible. Wrose place I've ever worked. ........."
bad,"If you have any medical condition they try their best NOT to accommodate you and make up so many issues to push you to quit. No lunch break, two 20 minute breaks. Never know when you will get off, favoritism, NOT a team environment. Nothing is kept confidential. Managers make you uncomfortable. Worst location to work for. Revolving door."
bad,I really do not want to say anything about mckesson. I was not fulfilled as an employee left to better suit me. It was a harsh management system and if you were not a strong personality you may find it hard to deal with.
bad,Worked through a temp agency for over a year with promise that would be hired on permanently. Each person never made it on permanently....they'd find some excuse as to why they couldn't be hired. They give you a small file cabinet type stool with a cushion to sit on for 8 hours a day and you have zero privacy.
bad,"We worked in a building that had asbestos and was a morgue before we moved in. The management was ever changing and so the culture was always changing. This job would have been a great place for someone to grow if given the chance but there is so much tensions between the staff and management who would want to stay. The place may have gotten better, but I doubt it. "
bad,The management is ratchet. They are very unorganized in the Norcross location only. They do a lot of talking behind each others back and I am speaking of management. They are just overall unprofessional.
bad,"low pay, no leadership, so many people missing work weekly sick?"
bad,Working for McKesson was absolutely the WORST job I've EVER had in my life. Management is garbage...they are messy and VERY unprofessional. I moved here to work for them and it's been the 2nd biggest mistake of my life.
bad,this company was very mismanaged and very unorganized and unprofessional. Job security is horrible. Arizona is not a good place for job security. Do not apply with this company.
bad,"Always worried about other employees not being trained on equipment properly. Overall hostile work environment. Employees gossip regularly, and management tries their best to never be reported to corporate by TAKING DOWN the anonymous tip line phone number! That must be illegal."
bad,This employer embellishes their benefit package to lure new hires but will not pay up when the time comes.  They focus on temporary hires and often times will lose contracts when they are not completing the jobs as contracted which then results in nurses being let go.  No stability here for the general population.
bad,"plant manager sucks,in&out bound managers sucks,too many chiefs not enough indians, a warehouse full of SNITCHES,employees are like robots,prostitutio"
bad,this company is easy to get into as long as you can pass a back ground check how ever they are very unorganized they have sevral different medications they work for and you get moved around all the time
bad,"No work life balance, lots of work and not enough people to do the work. On call rotation with no pay. Poor management team, Office is located in an area with lots of traffic."
bad,"Ok place to work."
bad,This place is a joke. Wasted time going to in person interview after a phone screening. They tell you your shift is over when the work is done. They can't tell you how much pay rate you will be at after years of service because every associate is rated differently. Alot of BS. Stay away from this job.
bad,This is the worst company I have ever worked for in my entire life.  You are not allowed to speak to anyone.  They monitor you every time you leave your desk and write down how long you were gone.  You are not allowed to ask any work questions of co-workers if you need help.  Management tells you one thing and then does another.  They refuse to communicate with you at all.  They only want robots to work for them.  Benefits were a complete joke.  Cost over $600 a month for insurance for me and just my husband.  Deductibles were $3200.00 before they paid anything.
bad,"I applied online for material handler in Clear Brook VA, was contacted by email by a nice fellow in Knoxville I believe, he asked me some questions to ensure I'd be a good ""fit"" for the job, he said I was and explained they had many positions available and booked me for an interview for the following Friday. Well Wednesday came & he emailed & said they had filled all the positions, Thanked me for applying and they would keep my information for future openings. First time in my 30+yrs working I've seen a company overbook job interviews. He claimed they were scheduling interviews Monday thru Friday, they filled up Wednesday, so apparently they just canceled everyone that was booked for Thursday & Friday? Bad business practice in my opinion, and if that's any indication of how they treat people, I'm glad I never got in there and I will stay away. Now I see why they had the openings in the first place."
bad,The organization is a fast pace environment and continuous growth. I've worked in several department since I've been employed with McKesson. I have meet a lot of co-workers and made a lot of friends. I can actually say I've learned a lot about the organization mission and goal.
bad,"As a consultant, there was no learning curve nor patient with the client to learn and make minor mistakes.  I would not recommend anyone to work as a contract there.  "
bad,I am an optimist but in this situation where I joined with a Staffing Agency RemX to begin Mckesson. It was a stressful and frustrating experience. I did not feel I learned the knowledge I should have to begin my job duties efficiently.
bad,Worst bunch of a**holes ever. I was desperate so I took a job here. everyone from my immediate supervisor to h.r. to upper mgt treated me like dirt. the only people that are friendly are the janitors. Steer clear of this company. It will crush your soul. I'm not kidding. The day I quit was the happiest day of my life.
bad,"Great Place to work. Great Benefits. Support Education, Healthy Environment  Hard work is appreciated. Best Benefits package of any company that I have ever worked for........."
bad,"Terrible management and work environment- no training is given.You are just expected to know the job, training is minimal. Rude and unfriendly people."
bad,"Would not recommend working here."
bad,What an awful and unorganized company to work for. They don't respect people in remote areas and are the most misleading and unethical people to work for. Good luck!
bad,"Mgmt consists of employees who have been there a long time. One of the supervisor doesn't know her head from a hole in the ground and is very demeaning to you in front of others. "
bad,"A Typical day at work consist of multiple phone calls from patients that are currently patients of NYU Langone Medical Centers or looking to schedule an appointment with a doctor affiliated with NYU Langone. I Registered, updated patient information in Electronic records including verifying insurance information. Management was always around to help if needed. The hardest part of the job would be not able to resolve an issue for the patient. The most enjoyable is knowing I was able to help schedule or refer patients to the right areas."
bad,"Worked there for 1 month never got paid, no one has answers. No training you just have to figure it out, no leadership, long hrs, you cant leave til all work is done, no help. Pick orders all night, warehouse is not safe, hazards everywhere and its very dirty for having medical supplies. Management makes the job sound all nice and stable but its all lies, that was the worst month of my life, stay away from this company."
bad,One of the worst position i have ever had. The environment is one of confinement with a void in any input of independent thought.
bad,"This is a fast paced, call after call job. The customers are pleasant, but management is all about numbers and they say ""Icare"". But they don't mean it. "
bad,"They pigeon hole you into a part time position, make full time positions scarce, or give them to full time night shift employees."
bad,"I wasn't at Mckesson a day and realized it was a mistake,half a day oriontation then put on the floor to work and basically figure it out yourself.coworkers complaining on long hours,most not getting a raise ,some been there 2 yrs,and only at $12 an hour,there open door policy is them sitting in a locked office and you having to go to your supervisor for an appointment.after a month I didn't go back,they care about no one.....and some leads have bad attitudes which no one seems to wants to address,no set schedule,when it comes to your benefits,you on your own,no H R in the building,and they tell you they can't help you,"
bad,"Micro manged not trained thoroughly.  Supervisors are not around when you need help.  Temp assignment would not recommend this job or company to anyone, no work and life balance."
bad,"worst company to work for"
bad,"Training was a joke. Scheduling always changing. You will enjoy seeing people running inside. Management must be twiddling their thumbs. Short staff, high call volume. Never told you did a good job."
bad,This position was difficult to get to work for.  Transportation was very limited in that area of the city which made overnight shifts very difficult.  Also I never met their expectations of 180 ppm.  I was only able to reach 210 ppm I believe once.
bad,"work hours to long, no breaks after 8 hours of work. So if we worked a 13 hour day no breaks after that. Management was HORRIBLE. No work or home life remorse. WORK WORK WORK WORK is all that this company is worried about no concern's for workers at all."
bad,"Working in the Newbury park office has been a wonderful experience.  Management is not on you all the time - your given a job and you do it.  No micromanaging - which I appreciate, but then I am hard worker and don't require that type of environment."
bad,"Successful company - benefits OK, Pay competitive- Tend to develop and put out new products quickly. Need to slow down on releasing so many and focus on making sure company can support products they are currently selling."
bad,Filled and packed orders to be shipped out. The management was terrible!! Would never work for this company again. They have no morals at this place of business.
bad,"Pay starts at $14.35/hr for driver one positions, lots of miscommunication within management, supervisors, and employees. Management does not have your back, they only look out for themselves and even try to set you up to get fired! Training is very poor and inadequate. You have to watch your own back and be prepared, no teamwork, lots of hypocrites working there. Be careful of females trying to hit on you, definitely don't want to go there. Co-workers have too many personal problems. If you get three accidents within two years even IF YOUR NOT AT FAULT, you get terminated automatically. If you get five negative complaints against you by motorists or customers calling the ""1-800 number saying how's my driving? compliment or concern?"" they terminate you like swatting a fly. They track your movements by GPS on their vehicles. Lots of haters working at McKesson. Very strict rules and regulations and McKesson is not a union. Would not recommend applying for this fragile risk taking job."
bad,"i dont even know where to begin"
bad,"There is not much in terms of compensation.  Not much incentive to advance, no increase in pay.  The job is very monotonous and boring, not much opportunity to learn new things."
bad,Though I was a part timer I had to fill the roles of many missing full timers. Filling orders and fixing errors. Had a hard time trying to get in full time.
bad,"Company is terrible and pay is low as can be, too many young supervisors who have their picks and can stand and talk all day while others on writes ups for production . Raises and incentives no good , terrible company"
bad,"Everything is wrong with this company. You will not move up in the company unless you're friends and kiss butt to VP of operations. The Jacksonville location has lost a lot of good employees because of her. Until they get rid of her nothing WILL ever change.  Most of management could care a less about you. Pay SUCKS, they will put more and more work on you. BEWARE, stay away."
bad,"Terrible place to work in Calgary.  Unprofessional team.  Many problems with how things are done.  They talk about team but it is a team that everyone gangs up.  Can't trust people there and management is all hypocrites as they bring people down.  Pay is terrible and they want you to be happy that you got less than a 1% raise.  Benefits keep changing for the worse. No security in the job as company is losing money and they have fired people and not stopping. They want you to work more or harder as they think that will fix all the problems that they have, to many problems that do not get fixed."
bad,"This facility was not a friendly environment for employees. This healthcare facility did not offer employee training or assistance."
bad,Compensation is horrible.  High turnover. Inexperienced and untrained supervisors.
bad,"McKesson provided me with great opportunities for growth. Fast paced job, exciting, challenging, and invigorating."
bad,"The manager that hired me was amazing, very professional easygoing and just a joy to be around. Unfortunately she left to start her own company and was replace by a self-centered, unprofessional uptight idiot. This person didn't know what he was doing and had no idea how to run the department, after a week working for him and dealing with all the incorrect files and him barking orders at us like we were fifth graders I finally asked him about the SAP report that he was in-charge of and because of how messed up it had become what should I do about it since my email inbox was blowing up with the head of management asking questions. That's it, a very simple question. He got me fired a day later over it."
bad,"Worse Management Ever!"
bad,"really disliked my time there, management is a little less than horrible. no discipline."
bad,I hated this job. It was a daily struggle to get work done because they were a failing company. It all boils down to poor management.
bad,"I enjoyed working here to begin with and I had a great first couple of days but then my line manager ruined everything for me he was a perfectionist if it wasn't for him it would've been great working there I realised quickly that he was mean and just decided he didn't deserve my passion and commitment because they were expecting so much dedication for a 6 hr shift and made every effort to get out of there asap! I am not going to get committed to a measly 6 hrs shift."
bad,"Where do I start, under appreciation, they look for multiple reasons not to give pay increase. Multiple employees are quitting weekly, for the last few months they lost atleast 10 people. Reason more work same pay and poor training. Managers do not respect the employees, and do not request a day off weeks in advance, it will not be approved. Short and to the point"
bad,"Originally, I believed the biggest challenge would stem from a lack of systems documentation. However, I quickly realized that inflated egos, office politics and administrative incompetence would prove to be bigger obstacles. These dynamics are not conducive to innovation and productivity."
bad,"You pick medical supplies for Pharm. Home,and hosptials. The hardest part of the job is long days. The first of the month they bring in lunch"
bad,No  Procedure  and  processes in place .Pay  is  not  compatible  o medical  center
bad,"The worst job I have ever had......hands down. Every thing and all the management SUCKED!!!!!!!!! "
bad,"the mckesson office in tigard, oregon is probably the worst place you could ever imagine working...the office manager is rude, offensive, doesnt appreciate a single thing you do and is very full of herself...she makes people cry on a daily basis and is heartless.. i would not suggest working here if you would like to be happy...especially since their pay scale is horrible, and they give no more than 10 cent raises a year."
bad,love the work building amored vehicles for the military.  i was cell leader of final cell
bad,"Poor training, poor management, unhappy atmosphere, low wages"
bad,Pay is BELOW national average compared to what other pharmaceutical distributors and healthcare informatics companies are offering.
bad,this is the most worst company i have work. If you are not from medical background doing admin job you will feel not worth it.
bad,Bad management and poor benefits. Dont care about employees and the have a very poor management
bad,"This is a low paying job with very aggressive management and team leads. Low employee moral. My 1st day on the job I noticed it. The management show favoritism and think they run your life. When you are scheduled to work certain hours and management needs you, its common for them to approach you the last 30 minute of your schedule and threaten you to stay for a couple more hours. Operations manager yells at anyone he has a problem with. Very high turnover ratio. They're always hiring on every job board in Orlando, because no one works in that environment long."
bad,The office in Greentree is the worst place to work and really I found no reason for this company to deny me my annual raise 3x while I was already making 10.25... tell me about struggling.
bad,You get hired to code within your specialty and they disregard that and try to make you do something you are unfamilar with.Then when you can't do it you get fired! Stay away!!! Plus the pay is below the national average.
bad,"The most important to know about McKesson is that there are locations that are the ""real"" McKesson, and other locations that are McKesson subsidiaries. For example, the office in Green Tree, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh) is a subsidiary. The two other Pittsburgh locations (Moon and Cranberry) are McKesson."
bad,"If you hate your family and love working for a 1940's military dictator style manager. This is the place for you. Low pay, the worst raises I've ever had. You will have five bosses so If you make a mistake you will have five people tell you seperately. It's like office space for real."
bad,HORRIBLE WORK ENVIRONMENT. IF YOU ARE NOT A REDNECK WOMAN you will not survive. You are much better off getting a job at McDonalds across the street. The employees are monitored for every minute of their workday. Prison would be more enjoyable.
bad,This was the worst work environment that I have ever experienced. The management is extremely unprofessional and unorganized which creates a tense and awkward work environment. There are constantly layoffs at this company.
bad,"-No interesting, challenging, or changing work."
bad,"Poor job security. Redundancy threat hanging over you constantly. Little room for progression. Little leadership as line manager changes often, with the individual not always being fully knowledgeable of the role."
bad,"Had a great interview with a wonderful person til they were fired. Management changes are atrocious, very unstable and "
bad,I honestly think this company is a waste of your time an energy . Worked here for 5 years an the rises are trash . Other company’s pay more starting an every year you’ll get more then just 50 cents lol. And the  People here are Annoying an sure love to Gossip and make up their on story about other people . The Managers & Supervisors are full of it too don’t get me start on them lol but Try it your self an see for your self.
bad,"The night shift manager is not fair with all employees especially if you're African or black American. we was two black in the Company and I did get fire on the 11/08/2019 after one year because of taking some rest of the food after a lunch at work , things that everyone is doing. I was one of the best employees my quality was always good , I was always on time , I have no absences but like I said on the top my skin color was the cause of my unemployment."
bad,"Mckesson on 20710 Hempstead Rd in Houston is the worse place to work. Managers, supervisors and some leads suck. To much favoritism. No fairness. The supervisors being messy out in the warehouse and writting you up for personal reasons. After one week of working there you will regret it. Be warned find another jobBewarned"
bad,"I felt used and thrown away. I was constantly skipping lunches and breaks to meet expectations. Even with the extra work load I still fell short of the vague, mystical requirements for not only higher compensation but also upward mobility."
bad,"It’s really not worth your time. Most people stick it out because they don’t want to show that they jumped from a job so soon. It’s stressful X 10. Everybody was desperate to find another job and since I left, I’ve had multiple people call me to ask me to bring them along to my new company. Don’t be fooled by their size. The only structure this company had was to keep you down"
bad,"Clicks, office gossip and undermining, poor adherence to office policies and procedures, benefits pkg below avg, communication is nil, and highly stressful"
bad,"They don’t look after the people working to keep The pharmacy going even if the manager is not doing what he is paid to do private phones and sitting in consultation rooms should be out of bounds unless it’s for a customer he’s never on the premises always Making personal phone calls"
bad,The workplace is not a advancement friendly environment. The director picks and chooses who she wants in what positions regardless of requirements. Would not recommend
bad,"If you are placed by RemX as a contractor with Mckesson. DON'T DO IT. They will keep acting like you will be converted to a full time employee, and right before they will let you go to keep from having to give you any benefits."
bad,"Management tells you one thing, then does another. Supervisors have no experience in the field so they make idiotic decisions. There is a rat community among co-workers so you better watch your back."
bad,Supervisor of the department was very unfair and had a lot of favoritism toward other employees.  The department is no longer in business at the company.
bad,"Left because of the terrible work environment & coworkers. As a PA I was packaging & shipping meds, putting away supplies basically working as a labourer. I did nothing pharmacy related & was treated like a slave."
bad,"Hires employees for contract positions through REMX, work schedule 12 hours a day for 4 months at the beginning of the year, then let everyone go when the contract is over, very poor management.  No advancement opportunities, they over promise and under deliver.  Employees feel used, when the job is finished, they let you go."
bad,serious issues with this company let the employee beware there is a lack of sincere care for patients and employees.  It's all about the bottom line.  .
bad,"This have got to be the worst company that I have EVER worked for!  The managers are rude, and do not communicate well with you.  They like to say that their company is diverse..........NOT SO MUCH"
bad,Worst place that I've ever worked.  So glad I quit 2 years ago.  Already Making a lot more per hour and I don't hate going to work every day.  Fitting that Mckesson spun that part of the business off into a separate entity called Change Healthcare because it was awful.
bad,Great company to work for until national rehab came in and destroyed it..they have no clue how to talk to people let alone know about insurances.  They have the worse attitudes  the stress was unbearable. The moral was low. They do nothing to show their appreciation of you unless your in the moon twp division . Glad I was laid off . Horrible experience
bad,"I would never recommend them to anybody, when they good supervisors went to days that's when it really went downhill!! Nobody ever gets the proper training unless you are flirting with the trainer, they set you up for failer!! One of the main things with McKesson is you wouldn't think they were a billion dollar corporation with they way they take all the good benefits away from you when they started paying the employees livable wages!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND APPLYING WITH THIS COMPANY!!"
bad,This corporation required a lot for the job title. Much was required for little pay. The work load is extensive and much pressure is applied to accounts receivable specialists. Management has favorites and delegate much of their work to the employees on the floor and when the quota isn’t met you are fired.
bad,I noticed new people stayed long enough to get certain training and to say they were employed by this company just to quickly leave. I would totally suggest doing the same.
bad,"Terrible workplace culture."
bad,"Perform daily routines to keep upper mgmnt abreast of financial status. Supports and trains other modules within the dept, always available for any questions that new staff may have. Corrects/changes made from inexperienced staff making poor decisions  Biggest frustration is expecting more advanced results as upper mgmnt expects from other remedial staff that are barely surviving their own job function.  Adds more work to me on the back end for me.  I am struggling  to survive in a new management environment who has not bothered to grasp historical processes that delivered amazing accurate results to our clients in the past."
bad,"Fair Pay and Excellent Benefits,  very fast pace environment with extreme micro management, The culture is diverse,which is the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,This place!! It is ok to work here but not for for long  but management is not the best here but they try there but  they are ok but you can try and work here
bad,"A very toxic place to work... unless you are a male in the 'good old boys' club. "
bad,Mckesson has no job security and they don't care about their employees. Mckesson has no job growth and does not teach anything new to help aid in job growth.
bad,it was stressful everyday that i went to work managers shows favoritism to all white employees it was no incentive pay no 401k matches corporate office works with the managers an its no union
bad,"If you want to just put in the hours and get paid this job is for you. If you want to make friends or have a good time or enjoy your job this is not for you. the union is your best friend, make sure to have them on speed dial."
bad,"its ok if you want to advance a great company to do so with, the office in Florida is like a slave driver you have to ask for restroom breaks the managers are very caddy."
bad,"Did not enjoy my time working for Lloyds Pharmacy, there are very little incentives and it is clear the company does not take much care of its staff unfortunately"
bad,"If you like kissing up, stepping on toes for positions,lying, planting errors on people to save your friends, etc. I never worked at a place where management work so hard to get you fired. They come off as caring, helping , and making sure you succeed but it's all bs....if you are not a favorite you can forget advancement. If you thrive off drama than this place is for you."
bad,"This company let go employees with 10-20 years experience in their position. The manager who hit three employees is still working there though. Human resources ignored complaints. The only way they get people in the door is with good benefits,but absolutely not worth it"
bad,"Day to day was spent supporting the hospital users, night were utilized to upgrade the terrible McKesson Paragon application. Management does not care about the employees."
bad,Horrible place to work I would not recommend this job to anyone only offer part time no room for growth an does not like to work around your schedule at all
bad,"Basically if you weren't in with management; meaning a favorite then your working day was miserable no matter how well of a job you did. Reviews were never in a timely order and often the manager ""lost"" your work and then when raises came time you were given a poor one because nothing was on file. I would never work there again or recommend anyone else there for that matter"
bad,"I have been with this company for 2 years and in my time here with the same group, I have learned that favoritism from supervisors is a huge issue. I have learned that in this work place it is ok for supervisors to talk down to their employees, talk about their personal business with others in the group, openly complain and bad mouth other coworkers. I also learned that upper management and HR do nothing to resolve these complaints made by multiple staff members. "
bad,"This company has no diversity,management is not diverse and will not consider being more inclusive. They have no ideal on the value of a diverse workforce."
bad,"ok place to work at. Balance of work life and home is ok, major issue with management or lack of management. Employee benefits are ok but the employer does not back employees"
bad,It was an okay job to work. I would have stayed there but I became disabled at that time of employment. I don't want to disclose any further information.
bad,"If you are hired through a temp agency for any of the ""REMS"" programs, do not waste your time. The management will treat you like garbage. I was let go after 11 months without a reason why. McKesson heavily depends on temp agencies and promises a full-time position, but fails to fulfill its promise. The turn-over rate is so bad that they constantly have new training classes coming in every month. Please do your research and do not depend on a temporary job through McKesson."
bad,"Jobs are constantly outsourced. I switched positions five times in three years due to this. Constant turmoil and drama. Worst Upper Management of a company (at least in the Winston-Salem, NC area) that I've ever witnessed. Would never recommend this company."
bad,I am a contracted employee and I feel as if I am walking on eggshells all the time.  We did not get proper training.  Helping patients is the most enjoyable.
bad,"I have seen my fair share of development shops, from the good to the bad. Typically, in my experience, there is always some level of dysfunction with missed opportunities. Never before, however, have I seen such a degree of disorder. I believe it stems from the top, in this case. The Director is not the type to investigate problems on his own but instead relies on his immediate managers who have their own agendas and brush things over as ""no big deal"" in order to save face. There are some good people here, however, so there is hope. The culture, however, is very reluctant to change, or for new ideas."
bad,"terrible company to work for, poorly managed and employees not able to advance career. would not recommend someone to work here as it is a bad work environment to be in. I would stay away from this company as it has no regard for the people working for it."
bad,"They tell you that you have a guaranteed permanent position, and fire you like you are just some number. Very sad place to work for."
bad,"This place is only positive if you are looking to retire somewhere with a minimum wage job with great benefits.  You only receive up to 3% raises which equal to about .25 cents.  Management is typically taking extended breaks and lunches and aren't very productive.  You do receive three weeks PTO which is great but you have difficulty getting any days approved.  Promotions are strictly based on seniority and not performance.  If you stay with the company +5 years you're eligible for the .50 cent promotion.  Also, overtime is only available during holiday pay so you don't actually earn overtime, just more hours at regular pay.  You definitely get guilt tripped to stay late and deadlines are impossible to reach because intense variety of workload.  A lot of women at the location are bitter about ever getting in trouble so they will tell on you for petty stuff in hopes to get the blame shoved off them.  There is no incentive bonuses that employees receive and issues don't get addressed if you have problems with anything.  If you keep to yourself things will be great, but interacting with other people is a bad idea because most women up there try to find a reason to create drama to liven up their dull life.  They do not offer assistance programs at this office for family assist ace, tuition reimbursement, etc that the other offices do.  Overall, greenville office is not recommended."
bad,"Started as a temp and was hired full time. The amazing things was my pay went DOWN by .50 per hour. If you are the ""pet"" of management or threaten to call an attorney, you will do fine. Management has no backbone and the good people are run over and mistreated."
bad,In this company you have to be on-time an at your desk 5 mins before you start. This company goes off of points. Everything that you do gets points taken off. If your late by 1min its 1/2 point that comes off. Some companies give you at lest 5mins to get to your desk. If you did not take your breaks on-time its another point that comes off. You have to take 50-100 calls a day! The hardest part of this jobs was being watched all the time by your team lead and Management. Everything is watched very closely. The most enjoyable part is leaving at the end of the day.
bad,They pay the lowest wages and ask you to do a lot of work plus updates. Rude customers and no protection from the company. They do not pay you fully and keep money for vouchers and bonuses you have never seen.
bad,"Terrible mis management from Bristol Area Manager  No respect for new staff. Did not train for the job I was employed to do. Constantly told I was doing an amazing job working on the retail side. Then out of the blue just before my probation period was up, was told an experienced dispenser was to be employed at the branch. I didn’t even get a chance. I was heartbroken"
bad,"This place was the worst job I have ever had; almost daily vulgar and crude comments from male management. I eventually spoke up about it and then was constantly disciplined for anything and everything they could. This company retaliates horribly it ended up costing me my job because of the ""good ole boy system"" I have worked several places that have been mostly male workforce but this by far was the worse. I know how to shrug things off but these were beyond shrugging off."
bad,"Dont waste your skills or time. Just not a good place to work. Unfair treatment,  poor pay. There are some better places to work. Really dont waste your time."
bad,"I liked the job role, but did not get any training at all.....despite the fact that completing the qualification within 12 months was in my contract. I resigned after 12 months because there was no management support and no prospect of ever completing my training."
bad,"Mckesson has good health benefits, thats about all the good i can say about mckesson. I worked at mckesson for about 9 years. Never was able to advance on my job title, but i was able to move around in the warehouse, i drove the machines, worked in the shipping department, worked with controled drugs, all for the same pay as everyone. Managment doesn't care about employees."
bad,"Constant upper management changes, hiring unqualified people that make changes flying by the seat of their pants.  A lot of internal issues as far as data and analytics go.  Everyone points fingers and nobody takes blame."
bad,Very judgemental they don't like to for you to get ahead as long as you suck up to the bosses in the leads I guess you'll do fine. Very quick to fire you they talk about you behind your back like you're nobody 2 leads and supervisors think they're just so above everyone else
bad,This place is the pits hard work on your feet all night mandatory 4 hours overtime anytime they want to I would not recommend this place for anyone will never be able to go home without being tired if you're looking for a career don't go here
bad,They don't care about their employees. No proper training or written procedures. Management knows who they want for positions and put people in them whether they are qualified or not
bad,"The management team at this location was very unprofessional. It was an overall terrible place to work. McKesson took over from a company called Med3000, and quickly removed themselves from that branch. It is no longer a McKesson company."
bad,"bad culture, old technology, and the manager won`t learn new tech. Especially, managers are not friendly and not professional. Horrible place to work."
bad,"the staff is nice and helpful but they are all sad due to they never know when they will be off for the day and the manager does not tell them until about one hour before the 'SCHEDULED"" time to leave. they are NOT forthcoming with this information during interview."
bad,An insane place to work with no direction and little confidence amongst peers. Technology lags behind and management is directionless and vindictive. The wrong hires get made and the wrong people get let go.
bad,Because this particular building was shutting down the treatment of the employees was down right mean and it was unnecessary. ...........................
bad,"Row! Row!"
bad,"Not Professional, Unwilling to represent the Contractor, takes the side of the Client in all situations. Not a good Staffing service to work for. The on boarding process was terrible."
bad,"this position was offered as a sales position but it was nothing but a less than glorified boiler room culture where you were treated and compensated based on what they thought they had to pay you to keep churning out calls to customers, it was a miserable place which only bright spot was benefits and stock options, management was bottom of the barret"
bad,"Unethical place to work because I was released within 2 mnths after a previous employee also a Case Manager was unethically gone in less than 2 mnths,"
bad,"I had heard it described as a ""sweatshop"" now I know why they said this. Very disappointing in almost every way possible. Management does not communicate at all unless you are a relative of someone there."
bad,My experience at McKesson was deplorable. Management was atrocious and treated diversity highly unprofessionally. Tools are ancient and there is no guidance or on the job training or direction.
bad,They have no room for advancement and poor healthcare. Turnover  is high and I would not recommend working here. CEO only cares about himself and not employees.
bad,"I do not like to be micromanaged.  They watch your every move, have favorites and if you are not one of them consider yourself to be replaced quickly.  They say they will hire you on permanently but like I said, unless you know someone or you become their favorite, you do not have a chance.  Parking was 3 blocks away for temporary people which was very inconvenient . I would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"They only want people in professional roles that look like themselves. "
bad,Been a long time since I worked there - pay was decent and benefits.  Training was poor.  They expected you to know everything without getting training in-house.
bad,"Aside from whom I met at the company, I did not enjoy working there. Management made promises that were not kept. A lot of two-faced people working in the call-center environment. Issues in the workplace, but nothing done about it. Everything, even bathroom breaks, were timed. Employees written up for practically everything and treated like bad children."
bad,"its union, so that's great. Management has an unreal view on how things could be more efficient. Also the pension is great. Overall I like the union better than the actual place of employment. Oh and a handful of coworkers.. Be aware that there are favorites by management."
bad,"Generally, this company gives the illusion through its ICARE/ ILEAD concepts to be a great place to work however I have experienced these to be only punch lines in Memphis.  The senior leadership is only out to save their own hides as opposed to legitimately developing their subordinates.  Supervisors/ Managers are viewed as expendable commodities.  Unethical terminations are plentiful."
bad,"No job security, does not value their employees, advance New employees before seniority. Very stressful environment. Leadership is non existent. Deny raises for invalid reasons."
bad,"If you landed on this job, keep looking you will be happier somewhere else. Management make up the stuff as they go. If you are in the need to know group you will be ok, kiss but group. No work life balance."
bad,"Lack of advancement opportunities on the REMS side if you are on the re-reimbursement you are treated better, and the compensation is far better than the same type of job on the REMS side."
bad,"Management is useless. Lots to do, with little to NO training.  Pay does not equal what the job entails. "
bad,"Overworked, no leadership, training is left up to your coworkers. Worker suggestions and ideas never taken into consideration. You are expected to run from the time you walk in the door till you leave 12-15 hrs later. There is no work homelife balance"
bad,Worked for a great company PSS. Was bought by McKesson. Things went down hill. Management argued all the time. Where trying to push out all the employees that they got from PSS. They made it know that they had no problem firing you at anytime. Employees talked all the time about quitting. Management will make errors and will blame it on employees that they do not like.
bad,"This location will regularly demand long shifts, 11-12 hours, 5 days a week, back to back. They have poor turnover and don't acquire new people quickly or efficiently, ensuring that they are always understaffed and that their employees are overworked. New employees don't stay because they are demanding 12 hour days from an overworked, inexperienced crew. Management does a poor job of assisting employees who ask for advice or help in dealing with the demand, and will tell you they are there to help while ignoring your requests. Nearly every employee there intends to quit as soon as they can because of the demands and the treatment from management, creating a very sour workplace culture, while the managers themselves pretend everything is fine."
bad,"McKesson is ok to work for but for room for advancement is a lo lower than normal & they pay is under than what people in my position are doing in NC, VA & GA."
bad,Forced into retirement after 9 yrs because they wanted me to work in freezer and I had medical accommodation to not be exposed to cold. Never are you good enough for their demands
bad,Elimating postions & giving them to India. The morale was low with many people seeking & leaving the company for othet positions. I love what I do but not working for this company
bad,Training is poor! You are not introduced to your reporting manager. They throw you on the floor and expect you to just casually catch on. Just a horrible place to work.
bad,"An Account Manager here can expect to be measured against a system set up to enrich a few Reps who are then set as some type of validation of potential, time and again a few have braved providing documented and irrefutable proof of this fraudulent arrangement, they end up losing, leaving the company - in other words if you dont mind never feeling like you are doing well, this is a great place for you. Its a strange environment in a company that has such a huge market presence, it doesnt matter to try any real fixes and thinks talking about an issue is solving the issue, you wont win here"
bad,Very unprofessional enviroment...Worked there for a year...Cannot talk to managers.It is very clicky like highschool.People there are very unhappy...Cannot just come in a do your job. No promotions or growth...DO NOT RECOMMEND...Not an adult job...
bad,Run. Pensacola office is awful. pay well. but it is combat pay.  sit in a cubicle 10+ hrs day. You will be expected to work all kinds of overtime without prior or very short notice. And do not expect any gratitude for that. all movements are monitored. Cameras monitor your every move. Do not care about quality work. Only want ridiculous number of cases completed per day. Very poor training program. Make unrealistic promises to their clients that you are expected to keep. None of the employees are happy. No one ever smiles there. Management is hostile and berating and constantly contradicting themselves on what they expect. Will not offer any assistance or respond to you request for clarifications or assistance. Constantly threatening to fire everyone if productivity numbers don't increase. and will not give you any advice on how to achieve that. Plan on gaining weight. They constantly have potlucks and someone is always bringing in something to share which is nice but the when siting 10 hrs day or more and lots of comfort eating to sooth misery has a side effect.
bad,"Loved learning the work, struggled for years to get into this place when they say no experience necessary. And never NEVER work there as a temp... you get treated poorly! The  management says you will get hired on but it's never the date they say always some line of b.s. if your a snake you would get pretty far.  Management is very hypocritical and very clique-ish love to play people on the same team against one another.... In other words it's like a romper room.... Such a shame! And don't have a family, they don't like that definitely don't have any emergencies.... You'll be canned quicker than you can bat an eye lash!!!"
bad,Treats their employees very poorly.  Very long and unknown hours.  Motto was...what is the difference between prison and McKesson.  At least in prison you know when you are getting out.
bad,"Heavy lifting/picking, pushed to get orders done, forced overtime. Unionized company, which means a handful of good hard working dedicated employees, carry the workload for the majority of lazy people, who try to do as little as possible, but still receive the same paycheck."
bad,"The primary objective of most, if not all, management is to get to corporate headquarters in Alpharetta.  It's not what you know but who you know...if you like to drink, smoke cigars, and chase women it's the job for you..."
bad,"Shift bids every 6 months "
bad,Morale is very low. Pay isn't competitive to other companies and raises are not good. No perks here. Currently seeking other employment.
bad,McKesson uk will screw you over without a thought for the person you are and the hard work you have given for the company. Don't work there.
bad,"Do not apply. Low pay, poor quality of managers. No room for advancement."
bad,"Can't wait to leave, considering lowering my already low salary and go for a low job just to leave the company."
bad,"I experienced poor salary, bullying and stress at work. Would never ever recommend, Worked at Lloyds Pharmacy. Extremely unpleasant experience. Staff are treated like animals"
bad,One of the worst job I have ever had. I hate it there. The people rude in you never know what time you coming or going. The pay is not enough for all the work they want done.
bad,This has very poor management in every level. They layoff people near every year and eventually layoff all people in all departments except the sales this year.
bad,"The company's upper management does not value knowledge, in fact they are threatened by someone who may have more knowledge than themselves and view them as potential competition. Everyone is dispensable."
bad,"At first it was great, then a deadline was not met by my supervisor she blamed me, and I was blamed.I really enjoyed my job, and I was good at it. I could have made a career out of this position."
bad,"You will be lied to from the first interaction with this company. Hours worked for full time ant part time employees are already wrong. You basically are on a treadmill for 8 hours trying to score “positive numbers” that nobody has a clue how these numbers are calculated. Once cold and flu season starts the hours go up to over 10 hours a day.  Benefits are some of the poorest I’ve ever seen, management has no clue how to be effective leaders, if you are not a fast learner you might as well not even apply because training is by far the worst I’ve ever seen. Turnover is over 70%. If you can make it past the probationary period they do offer 7% base raises after 6,12, and 18 month periods. After that a base 3% raise every calendar year. It’s not worth the effort you put into it. The incentives you might hear about are so small you won’t even know you received one. Do yourself a favor and pass this company up."
bad,"No work life balance."
bad,They have an unrealistic view of work life balance and the work load that is assigned to the the supervisors. There is no consistency with directions from the management team and it changes frequently.
bad,"Minimum wage. No backup, no support. Made to feel useless. No consideration towards staff welfare. Just bled you dry. When you plead for help you expect it. This never happened."
bad,"Long  days. No work/ family.Balance. Poor poor no compassion or even care of employee  situation. A pregnant employee was denied time off for any maternal/ pregnancy well check appointments at the busy time of their  ""day""!! Do not apply!!"
bad,McKesson was only interested in me working as a full-time employee. They were only interested in covering their illegal methods of discrimination that I experienced 2011 and 2012.
bad,"No concern for those on the ground. They squeeze everything out of you until you make yourself ill. They take advantage of the fact you will never let patients down, so cut staff until sometimes it's just the pharmacist in the shop. Such a shame; used to have a great ethos but now they don't care about their staff."
bad,There were too many changes in upper management to keep any continuity.   Management didn't care about your personal work/life and expected you to be on support calls that had absolutely nothing to do with your department.
bad,7 managers per shift who contradict each other and themselves. If these contradictions are addressed managers will write you up for insubordination. Lead supervisors will make you do their work for them plus your own. Very cliquey employees like being back in middle school. You're expected to be as efficient as a robot. No room for human error.
bad,"Don't believe anything they say about your job security, you don't have any here. One week they'll be telling you you have highly desired skills that are valued, the next week your badge doesn't work. Security even warns people not to get too comfortable because they have a revolving door and people are terminated even quicker than they're hired."
bad,"Management sucks and blatantly doesn’t care about employees or value their time. When nothing is going wrong, management goes out of its way to find issues just to make their employees angry. No respect is shown, treated like you aren’t even human."
bad,This was the worst job I ever had. The pay is poverty level. Management is incompetent and there is rampant favoritism. Building is toxic and bathrooms are disgusting.
bad,"At McKesson the culture is horrible. I got harassed by my old supervisor and me and a few other people including one of my newer team supervisors and we went to HR because he witnessed the harrassment. Nothing was ever done, there was never any consequences for this supervisor because they where to lazy to train someone else. THERE IS RACISM AND ALL."
bad,"If you like to get paid , they do pay you. Otherwise you may wanna look somewhere else because mckesson probably isn’t the best place to work and be happy. There programs are terribly run by managers who really don’t care to do anything but sit in meetings and create reports."
bad,"Manager was a micro manager, enjoyed the freedom when going out into the field. Some doctors are hard to deal with. Had a good IT Support Team. Good hours."
bad,"Left at time clock on my first day. Very Inadequate training. Most (not all) co -workers rude and territorial of their area. Very hard to train and be productive when their is little work and/ or co-workers do not want you in their area. Management are not helpful. Spent majority of my time there trying to figure out who my supervisor was. If you have an issue or problem, good luck getting it resolved. You need to make an appointment to speak to upper management or HR. Hostile work environment, poor morale, and favoritism. There weren't enough free lunches to make up for the horrible way you are treated there."
bad,"I was hired through their temp agency, which I was told that the position I applied for was temp to hire. I get to the orientation and there are over a hundred employees! There, then we were told that it was a seasonal job that may lead to a possible temp to hire position. They led us on saying they would keep about 16 out of 100 employees to go to the Scottsdale location and the rest will have other opportunities within the company. They treated us like numbers instead of people. There was favoritism from the start of training until the end of the assignment. They lacked communication & don’t appreciate their employees."
bad,"Worst company I have worked at, and after talking to many people who have worked there, they have a pattern, if they want you out they will do everything to make you leave and you will feel miserable and like something is wrong with you as HR will back them up."
bad,"I had a bad experience at McKesson, mostly due to a toxic leadership situation.  However, my peers in other Distribution Centers in other parts of the country also had bad experiences and most of them left before two years in the company."
bad,"Poor management,  all they care about are the ones they like and numbers numbers numbers! The entire place needs to be replaced,  building as well as each person!!! #rockhilldc"
bad,"This company does not know what they're doing. They fire people that are good workers because they have problems with managers. If you report to their HR department, no investigation is completed regarding the manager in question. Instead they just fire you and tell you that you missed time from 3 months ago and you pointed out. They do not appreciate their workers at all."
bad,Start times vary. Unfair favor to certain employees. It is like a high school. So many rumors. Management doesn't listen. It is an easy job but very repetitive.
bad,Did not listen to customer service reps. Terrible training - we were not prepared to take phone calls. No flexibility in scheduling. Poor management. Low morale. Would never recommend.
bad,manager never had a heart when it came to family life and was not good at communication
bad,No one is held accountable for anything done wrong or right at this company. Very negative environment. Most people are just there to collect a paycheck & could care less about the work flow.
bad,given to many jobs to do and not enough time. they treat you like children when talking to you. Do not give good reasonable raises. they expect you to do a lot of work for little pay!
bad,"Workplace drama. Stress from Micro management, from coworkers, never know when you're going to get off of work. Good pay, but terrible benefits. can run you up $500+ or more alone."
bad,Favoritism is in your face. No balance in skilll recognition. Fair skin wins! People lie about degrees and get promoted without verification. Open door policy is a joke. HR shares all private conversations . EOE is dead.
bad,Constantly doing manager/supervisors work.  No one appreciates your efforts.  Work load always grew without compensation. You are 100% better off elsewhere.
bad,"Supervisor was great, fast paced job, enjoyed the employees, all the employees that were there lost there jobs, which is what happened to them when they were bought out they had to reapply.  very unfair treatment."
bad,"I worked approximately 110+ hours in a 2 week time frame on average because of the amount of work that was on our desks. Management was terrible as they thought they could reduce the amount of people in the department instead of increasing the staff to cut costs!  They don't listen to the employees and then when it comes time for the Employee Opinion Survey, the get all upset when they don't have great results yet things never change each year.  The benefits are great but even those are getting more expensive for the employees so it's a matter of time before even those will slowly get taken down to minimum.  When I came to work here, it was a good company and I was going to retire here.  Not anymore, they have become very greedy and only care about the bonuses that the people at the top get and that's it!"
bad,"I am writing this review not just out of frustration with the way McKesson works as a whole but also to try to shed some light on serious issues this company has in their Scottsdale location. As a point of context I have worked at Mckesson for about 4 years, 1 as a contractor for their temp agency Remx and the last 3 as a full-time employee.  As a temp employee, one thing that is immediately apparent is that McKesson sort of works like a meat factory, every winter they higher hundreds of temp workers from November to about February their ""blizzard"" season. Once this period is over much of that workforce get a laid off at Mckesson discretion and in this process is where the major issue with McKesson starts the process is extremely arbitrary. McKesson is a high school for grown-ups, that is how I would describe the working environment there. Promotions at McKesson with obvious exceptions are not based on merit but popularity, it mostly has to do with whether your supervisor and manager like you in the entire literal sense of the word. If your supervisor or manager is not ""fond"" of you the amount of work you do for this company matters not. It's also like high school in the sense that those people in these higher positions gossip about their subordinates in a very unprofessional manner all of the time, this is not based on here say but on literal meetings, I had been in. McKesson is also not a company that likes to promote within, I'm sure anyone familiar with this company will, unfortunately, know exactly what I mean by this. People will come in as temps in November, be put in"
bad,"McKesson is under bad management and needs improvement and working area are not good and needs a lot of change in this place in order to be the best place to work,"
bad,"this is not a opinion, this is the truth, I do not lie & never will. I care about patients & getting the orders out correctly so we could get paid  for the items & the patients would not get bills, I do not want to work for a company that hides things.   I want to be able to do the right things for the company & the patients & say I can stand behind the company & love what I do, when they made us into 1, McKesson , I waited it out till they laid us off because we knew it was coming..."
bad,Ever changing hours. Long hours. Low moral. Poor equipment. No advancement. Supervisors constantly changing. Management appears to be more into their bonuses than with advancing their employees moral.
bad,"It's probably best if you just didnt waste the time. More of a stepping stone, but lots of political stuff to deal with. Old decor, no sense of culture."
bad,Horrible management. They are disrespectful and treat their employees like trash. They change company policy almost every month. They discipline the whole staff over one persons mistake. They are not consistent with what they say. They favor certain people over others. You wont have life with that job. Only good thing I could say is that the benefits and pay is good. Other than that it feels like your back in high school the whole warehouse gossips.
bad,I do not recommend this position. There is no opportunity for advancement and its has been incredibly difficult to work with management at this location.
bad,Don't work here; it is a dead end.  Management attempts to degrade anyone with a functioning brain; they are very defensive.  Most of these characters have spent their entire careers in this one place and have made no progress in their professional skillset.
bad,"Machines get stuck every hour, long hours, poor management. scolded for things you're not taught. hard to make your numbers with the machine getting stuck."
bad,manager through Director made it quite clear they were out for themselves.  They could not be bothered to even say good morning to staff. I witnessed and was instructed to lie told to clients on multiple occasions..
bad,"Terribly managed business, too many chiefs not enough indians, the pay is not worth how much time your there, which is basically YOUR LIFE!"
bad,I would recommend that if you are at McKesson that you not stay there too long. They have unfriendly policies. The managers are told to hammer the employees when ever or where ever they can. I know a lot of people who had bad experiences there so beware.
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked at, really poor management that you can't rely on for anything. If you have a problem with something nothing ever gets solved. And they have there priorities backwards, plus the MMS system is bogus."
bad,"I am a top performer in my Dept. but performance does not matter."
bad,"The pay is lousy, the once a year pay increases are based upon everyone for themselves, meaning mossy people are out to make you fail so they can get a extra 5 cent a year. If your not a informant you will not make it.  If you like unions you will be targeted for termination.  If you are not a friend or family member of someone with power you will not be promoted.  It's people who been there for 15 years still doing the same thing with medical problems. You have no lunch break.  Insurance is to high. Managers are amateur at best.  Company is so focused on paying the workers little as possible while the ceo, takes in over 40 million a year.  Nick Brannigan is a informant, Ugly Anne is an informant."
bad,"This company does not promote minorities, management team is extremely poor, very unorganized, shows no remorse for employees."
bad,"Absolutely no room for growth. Management treats you like you are a peasant in their big world. I am starting to dread going into work everyday! I work in an environment where I am expected to meet certain obligations (which is great!), but without the resources needed to do so!"
bad,Worst job I ever had. Pittsburgh office has ALOT of turnovers.
bad,"Great place to go in and get the experience you need so that you can go some place else that pays more. Management is a joke, the bosses you hear horror stories about however the people who work there are great. In summary doesn't pay enough for all the nonsense you end up dealing with, and the benefits stink! (Plus they no longer offer flex time, so really not worth the pay)"
bad,"Employed for three months then ""let go"" after joining from a compnay i had worked for for 15 years.."
bad,Management at Baptist Hospital's Information Services is not an example of meritocracy.
bad,I worked for McKesson for almost a year went from customer service to ECOMM rep. The company is extremely discriminatory and you can't succeed unless you kiss up to management. I was terminated from the company after complaining to management about unfair practices performed.
bad,The management in the area I worked was horrible. They treat people like they are NOTHING. They discourage instead of encourage. They talk down to people.
bad,While McKesson as whole is a great company they treat their employees like a number. The whole call center environment is a circus with a bunch of adults who act like children. Management lives for drama. The pay may be good but they need some much work on their work ethics and culture.
bad,I hated working at Mckesson. Only thing that was cool was the free soda and xbox and ps4. The management was terrible. They expect you to learn everything on your own.
bad,nothing is organized. management absolutely sucks. they take advantage of their workers. over all a horrible company to work for. very prejudice to their workers as well.
bad,"horrible upper management, no guidance provided and when things go south they just want someone else to blame, so be ready for a quick turnaround and turnover rate."
bad,Treated like a number!  Don't care for employees! Walking around on eggshells.  Everybody wants out.....  no appreciation.  They only see the minor errors made instead of the 110% you put in.
bad,"highly motivated environment, faced paced self motivated. learned time management must be able to multitask. awesome management willing to help the employees."
bad,"Very unfamily like atmosphere.  If you happen to fall ill do to strokes, Heart attack, or cancer they will let you go in a heart beat. Leadership is very weak and are always are scared if you know more than them."
bad,"In four years, I held out hope that with the ever changing corporations that merged with Rxcrossroads, the culture would change. It never did.  Promotions are about who you know or are related to, not about performance."
bad,"Mckesson hires through RemX staffing agency, they lead me to believe that I had a chance at long term permanent employment if I was on time, never absent and a good worker. This was a lie, first off training sucked, they hired 400 plus workers at once and then after their ""blitz"" season was over they rounded us up in a huddle and ""released us"" no warning. Dirty business...only thing they offered was good pay."
bad,"Favoritism is ridiculous. Management will stop at nothing to make sure a person hey don't like is fired. "
bad,"What I learned on a typical day in the Aesthetics Sales department of McKesson, was all of the team was not on the same page. "
bad,The supervisors are cool with one that snitches all day and believe everything she says. The director is the worst!! Don't work at it if u need a job that cares
bad,"Wouldnt recommend,very stressful work environment .manager takes you for granted. Management has favoritism against others.. isnt equal and fair all around"
bad,"Its unfortunate but at the time that I worked there if you were not sleeping with management you were at a huge disadvantage. The quality of work does not matter to the management. The manager I had at the time was stopped working for the company, and the manager that took his place was a well known racist. Your job is always hanging over your head and you NEVER know when you will be back on the job market. Its a very hostile environment and strongly recommend you look for a job at another company that actually gives you opportunity for advancement."
bad,Advancement was based on favoritism not work ethic. Management would throw you under the bus. Management would grill you about issues that were not work related. Had to relocate back to my home town. Management did not want me to leave. Asked if I would rather stay in a shelter.
bad,"In a constant money saving mode, whole groups are fired every six months or less. Management is clueless. No job security or advancement. Employee Opinion surveys are never acted on."
bad,"A constant state of short staffed and mismanaged! Managers are pressured by upper management and large clients, employees are mistreated and work life balance is completely out of whack! very little chance for advancement!"
bad,"the morale is horrible"
bad,Answered phone and filled out checks for employees that wanted money out of their account.  It was a very easy job.  Credit Union Manager was an enjoyable person to work for.
bad,Stressful Hostile Workplace No Training Rude Management Very Hard to change positions They Play Favorites The only good thing about working here is the benefits
bad,"they will not help you on errors at work and if you don't fit in, you wont last there. poor management. I never knew I was making mistakes and they never corrected me and just let me go. very poor team work. apparently I didn't fit in there."
bad,"They were poorly ran. Had people in positions that they had no idea what they were doing. Had to ask us, No experience in the area they were in. They had different managers every couple months. Not a good place to work."
bad,Nice atmosphere just short notice on when you are going to be let go. It was like they knew a week in advance and told you after the fact. Not enough communication between staff.
bad,"Not a fun place to work at all.  Manager has no back bone to stand up to intimidating employees, total lack of respect when voicing concerns.  Other employees were not allowed to help each other."
bad,"Worst company in the world... The pay is awesome but three times a year they want to layoff people especially at the Alpharetta, Ga office... The company is to top heavy and have bad habits of worst money in other things when people need to be secure at their jobs..."
bad,"Managers micromanage, you spend more time on goals and objectives so that you don't have to time to satisfactorily perform the job you were hired to do.  Work life balance could use improvement.  If you like a very fast paced environment with demanding deadlines and don't need much time for your personal life - McKesson may be the place for you.  Not all bad but too much micromanagement."
bad,This company talk a good game. They sent jobs to China so they say. It was just to get rid of who the manager and supervisor didn't like. The company have no structure.
bad,"day at work handling product and totes "
bad,"Management is hostile to employees.  There is no work life balance.  Management is eliminating regular full time employees and hiring contractors.  Management is eliminating the STAR and Horizon Product line.  "
bad,"dispensing prescriptions and advising people what product is best for them. "
bad,its ok but I wouldn't recommend it here if you have an emergency situation they really don't care
bad,"I am a quick learner and cross trained well. The so call lead department employees were messy, jealous and very un professional."
bad,It was the kind of employment assignment that made you want to never work again...
bad,"Staff constantly arguing infront of customers, high pressure environment, staffing concerns not dealt with. A formal grievance about bullying to my regional manager in writing not dealt with. Bullied out of the company by other store colleagues and management don't act upon anything. also filthy staff areas (staff kitchen)"
bad,Though i am very hard working I found even working at 100% was not enough to clear all the work everyday. Staff were cut and stores were closed. More pressure was put on us to hit targets and we didn't have support from higher up the chain.
bad,"I was THE top performer in my team, even while being the newest member. I had an illness that left my bedridden for a little over a week, and had multiple notes from doctors and specialists I was seeing to excuse the absences, which they were."
bad,"The job is easy, but you have to deal with poor management and culture. If you want to do your job correctly, management makes it really hard. You are trained by coworkers with bad information and everyone in management will give you a different answer to questions that should just have one. You're pretty safe if all you want to do is put products into bags or boxes, but even then you have to watch who you get your information from. Many people that work there are lazy, selfish, petty and/or vindictive. If you're good at keeping to yourself then you can easily work there without TOO many problems."
bad,"No direct hire. Temps are made to feel sub class. 1 year contracts. No stability. Very cut throat. Management plays favorites. No recognition for higher production. Self serving environment. Paid and medical benefits are good. Free gym, nice cafeteria, newer building and work stations."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anybody I know to work there there a biased nature on management there and they are very racist and very unfair towards certain employees. Poor working environment toxic.
bad,"My Sr Director (whom I report to) was professional, considerate and flexible. Not all managers are like her. The sales reps require your time intermittently and juggling between planning for projects and doing demonstrations is challenging, but job security because you are busy throughout the day."
bad,Working at McKesson you come to work and you don’t know when your going home 12+hr days are normal. Management shows favoritism to employees. Cost of living and insurance goes up each year but the raises given do not cover the increase.
bad,Company always wants to have the upper hand at all times. I feel like the company is out for themselves and does not care of your well being or your family.
bad,Slave bootcamp company. You work like a robot. Like a slave with a chain on your feet basically you do because of the Lms program they controls your every moves and you have to have certain points between 80 to 100 every month. If you cant  meet that requirement your fired pretty much it ain't no joke cut throat of the bat.
bad,"This would be a great job for someone who is single, a workaholic or money oriented. The pay is good but you give up a lot for it. On 3rd shift you start in the evenings and work through the night. Forget 8 hour days. Very rare. Most of the time you're there for 9-12. Sundays are a nightmare. Always 11-12 hours, mondays are always 10+ you're shot by Tuesday. Tons of walking and your ""standard"" is the name of the game. Speed matters most. Everything is tracked and management won't come out and tell you to run your butt off all night but it's what they want. "
bad,"McKesson was a temp job for me. Felt like my metrics were good enough to advance in the company but management felt otherwise. Try hiring on quicker, a lot of talented work quits bc they do not feel wanted."
bad,"On a typical day i would arrive around 8:30 am and not leave until midnight, with only 2 hour hour breaks and one 15 minute break. Management is all over the place in terms of things changing every other day not giving time for things to pan out. If you're not in with management then you don't move up. Those who are in with management can take breaks for over an hour at a time and just hang out while sitting on the floor in the offices to hide from others. Overtime is mandatory and you never know exactly when you're leaving. Not a place i'd recommend."
bad,Not a great atmosphere in my branch itself.  not happy to work there. I have been there over a year and a half and the past couple of months have been awful. the team is falling apart and it just is not the same workplace anymore.
bad,"Very bad management, all of them are hungry for power and money; most of them will step on dead bodies to get what they want;"
bad,"Do not work here unless you like working mandatory 50-60 hour work weeks and having no life. They try to sugar coat it when you first start with all these special perks (not to mention they don't say a word about all the ridiculous amount of OT) , but after a week you're just another slave. HIGH turnover rate of employees. You work your butt off all day for 10-12 hours with 3 short breaks until the job is done, no exceptions. WAY overworked and underpaid."
bad,"This is the most hostile environment I have ever witnessed.   So much favoritism between management and certain workers. Unless you are one of the workers who's lips are glued to managements butt all day every day, you are not going anywhere and your life is made miserable. Bullying is definitely allowed and ff you even try to stick up for yourself you are treated even worse, including from management.  HR is useless, they are there for the company only, not the employee.  The people in Lewiston have absolutely no idea how to be a manager. It is either with complete bullying and intimidation or being way to passive with certain individuals."
bad,I enjoyed the 2 years I worked at McKesson as a consultant.  I was shocked that there was a policy going into affect that any consultant employed there over 18 months was to be terminated which went into effect 1/30/15.  I was even more shocked to find out that managers are unable to give any recommendation to past consultants.  There seems to be a separation of culture between middle management and corporate which is extremely disadvantageous for consultants.  Don't get comfortable there.  Explore your options!
bad,"McKesson is a fortune 500 company. Depending on the state of employment it can be a fun place to work and grow. There are opportunities for growth in this company, you have to know what it is you want to do and where you want to go."
bad,Management / Supervisors say they care but they don't. As long as it doesn't affect them directly they really don't want to know nor do they care. The Supervisors are supposed to be out an about and be visible but they hide in their office or in the front office were they can not be tracked down if there's a problem. They say if you are having problems maintaining a positive number they will work with you. But that not the case. They know what people are having a hard time maintaining a positive number but they don't do anything about it unless you go to them and ask for help. If you don't know that your doing poorly and not making a positive number your going to get written up and if you get written up enough times you'll be suspended or fired. Some cases you can have an empty file with no write ups and still get fired for trying to get the work done quicker so the customers can get their orders on time. This company cant even follow their own write up procedures but they expect you to follow everything by the book
bad,"Was recruited to work at McKesson, after 5 months had the rug pulled out from under me. My boss let me go without any reason, they paid me so that I couldn't go after them but there was no notice, no reason, no willingness to help me get better at the job I was recruited to do. Not a ""thank you"", no ""good luck""... HR team works hard to implement their polices of ICARE and to create a good working dynamic in every department but their own. I was deeply hurt by their lack of concern or passion, just out the door and I was easily replaced. Very cold people."
bad,"Management wants their butts to be kissed by regular employees. they want you to randomnly change your schedule when lots of work comes in with out thinking you have a family to tend to. Goes against you in your yearly review for yearly raise if you dont come in on days off, work late all the time and have complaints about work environment. low yearly 20 cent raises."
bad,"I worked as a support analyst in the Charlotte office. The level of incompetency is incredible. The software is very unstable, and managment will not acknowledge that fact. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. Everyone did what they could to assist each other, to help the customers."
bad,They promote who they want and not everyone is given a fair chance to grow. The culture is very very bad and people are allowed to do what they want if they know the right people.
bad,"Everyday the order volume is growing.  They are not ready for the increase.  "
bad,"Mckesson is a great place to work if you’re a white man. As a woman, especially a woman of color there were few others who looked like me, and I was deemed as being “too aggressive” which I have never been told at any point in my 10 year career. All of the black women (2) that were in positions of authority were also deemed with similar characteristics. Very few woman and very few men of color held leadership positions and it became apparent, quickly  that the organization did not value diversity."
bad,"Pay good"
bad,"Worked there in Everett for almost 25 years until they shut down the warehouse and built a non union warehouse in Puyallup 60 miles away."
bad,The management team has quarterly luncheons to connect with their teams and they play games have potlucks all throughout the quarters. They celebrate birthdays with every employee and if someone leaves or retires they celebrate that as well.
bad,"deceptive business plan."
bad,"Don't waste your time!"
bad,"Management Lied to me every day . i was told that my productivity was excellent ,  told that i would be moved to the Breast Pump Dept. I had to prove myself.  trained me, made me believe that i would be transferred to Breast Pumps,  never had a chance to prove myself.   i received a call on a Saturday morning not to return Monday morning."
bad,"We were promised secured jobs until February 2019, more than 150 people were laid off due to transparency, on sort notice. We were also promised to know if we were being let go, we would know 2 weeks in-advance, everyone was let go the day of being laid off. Every pay check they took out over 80 for insurance, they did not tell you when insurance was activated. They are down right a dirty company, to ever get involved with, they will use you for every single thing they need to succeed."
bad,"All they care about at this location is their numbers and not the employee. Everyone is in a hurry trying to get their orders done while driving on equipment, Huge safety Hazard. The system they have in place is a bunch of bull. The leads do not care about their employees  and do not respect them. I took a pay cut and a job closer to home than to deal with this mess of a place."
bad,"Not sure this is meaningful anymore since I heard they were sold and the management fired.  Typical cronyism and 'you-kiss-my-butt-the-best-and-I-will-reward-you' culture.  They ran the business on emotions and the executive's whims, not principles.  If a standard or principle got in the way of a manager's desire, it got put to the side.  They were a software development shop and yet they rejected all of the major and proven software development methods and experts.  Instead, it was 'gee, we like Joe cuz Joe has the favor of executive so-and-so, so Joe, what should we do'.  Virtually no useful training.  No actual enforcement of the few policies that were in place.  McKesson corporate pushing their 'diversity' beliefs with the concurrent hypocrisy against those who did not tow the line.  It is amazing that companies like that survive, but in this case, it didn't!"
bad,"McKesson is a very stressful place to work. Upper Management do not see the life work balance, all they care about is the money. No advancement at all."
bad,"There is no growth within the company. "
bad,"Says they are a family company, but in reality its a lie. Its a business and all that matters is money. Does not care if an immediate family member just passed."
bad,"good people excellent environment, good benefits, good management, employees have the opportunity to learn and improved their skills, completely happy with my team."
bad,A typical work day would involved waiting on assignments to be handed out. Once assignments were handed out employees were able to work. I learned more cpt and hcpcs.
bad,"They usually choose people that they know personally.Like neighbors, family ect.Honestly they use the others as scapegoats.Concord's McKesson Packaging is a joke!!"
bad,"The manager fires agents constantly and never gives a reason.  Just blaming it on her boss by saying she has no control which is not the truth.  She has let go over 30 agents this year.   The manager seems to stay in her office and does not blend with staff.   The trainer quit after the manager would not let him do his job and upper management would not listen to him when he stood up for us.   He was the only reason why I stayed as long as I did.   The director in Florida doesn't care about the high turnover and hostile work environment here and never addresses anyone when she is here.  Agents have been known to be fired for going over the supervisor's head or file a complaint with the hr department.  The supervisor and director never tell the truth and will stand up for the wrong and target the ones that are right. This place has the worst morale issue I have ever experienced. The previous operations manager was pulled out and sent back to Florida because of all the issues she created while she was here but yet she still has a job."
bad,RDC SOUTH Jax. fun room nice clean warehouse great management  great team work has it's up and downs and alway moving in at fast pace
bad,I enjoy being apart of a time and learning new insurance guidelines daily
bad,no support from management - questions were ignored.  got no guidance and training - had to figure everything out myself.  teams do not work with each other.
bad,I learned no matter how heavy a piece of equipment is Mckesson wants you to do it on your own by yourself regardless of how your health is after as long as it gets done
bad,Be careful is all I can say. If I had to do it over again and had a choice I wouldn't have done it. The right hand never knew what the left hand was doing.
bad,Unrealistic goals and objectives. Huge corporation. Horrible work life balance. Work expectations were 12 to 16 hour days at least 6 days per week. terrible training. The company does not set up employees for success. There is no catching up on work load. No support or teams to assist you. DO NOT recommend.
bad,"Using an RF computer unit, print outs would come across computer from hospitals and doctors asking for supplies, go to the shelf scan the quantity and item, put in box, then print out a slip for it to be shipped out."
bad,"Worked on-call (and received many calls) nights and weekends and required to be in the office regular work hours as well. "
bad,"If you have any plans on advancing in this career don't plan on it unless you suck up. "
bad,"Looking for good benefits it's the place to be..Too much going on, not professional, alot of work for little money.  Supervisors and leads don't encourage employees or reward on a good job..they tear u down and expect you to be fully committed and work hard."
bad,Training absolutely SUCKS!!!  Trainer quit after only 2 yrs of employment.  Company is unorganized.  Lack of loyalty!!  Very high turnover!  Beware you can get fired easily!!!
bad,"McKesson is the ""Walmart"" of the medical world, the walkie riders and cherry pickers suck and so do most of the people certified to drive them...All they care about is the customer, the employee is a non factor...work/life balance...big time JOKE!!! Don't make the mistake of working for McKesson in Glendale Heights, Illinois!!!"
bad,This company only cares about itself and not the associate. Management is not very professional and plays favorite to some associates. This company wants people to work overtime instead of hiring the correct amount of people.
bad,"On an typical work day I would watch as several FTE/Direct hires would regularly engage in job avoidance while also producing mediocre and unethical case processing work. That was how it was revealed that work quality and performance metrics were in place to hide low quality (pushing cases through as ""Approved"" or stalling cases just so they'd have something to work on the next day or at a later time), these unethical work practices go un-policed in favor of  high production numbers. I still know people that work there and they to admit that they know that based off of their low quality high case count work practices, ""quality expectations"" are a veiled method of deceiving the client that Mckesson is contracted to into believing Mckesson is meeting the clients (SLA) Service Level Agreements. While I was staffed there the client suposedly became so ""concerned"" about the Quality problem that a quality pilot team had been assembled to determine out how to raise quality. Then again, for all I know the client's ""quality pilot "" team could very well have been some shell game tactic employed by the client to meet legal penalties  imposed by the government for one the their repeat False Claims Act Liability for Kickbacks offenses."
bad,"If you hate talking on the phone and dealing with rude customers, do not work here. It is nice for a few months but not the best place to work. I enjoy my teammates but hate this place alot."
bad,"If you enjoy being over worked, under paid, drama, favoritism, picked on (by management team members) this place is for you, I've never worked for a company that thrives really hard to get you fired. You have NO work life balance and if you DARE to speak on issues YOU WILL BE PERSECUTED !!!!!"
bad,"Was able to learn new skills however the micromanagement was too much to handle.   No matter how hard you worked the management was more interested in quantity rather than quality.  Very stressful environment as you worried about meeting the quota, which did not take into consideration all of the missing information you had to obtain in order to do the work. You cannot go to management with any concerns as they would dismiss you and label you ""drama queen""."
bad,We very rarely worked less than 10 hours a day. And if you need off for anything even a doctor's appointment good luck. The only way people got off was for court and they still tried to tell them that had to be in by a certain time. They were constantly reminded of labor laws and ignored them. People got hurt a lot. LMS system made things worse. And there workmans comp does everything they can to not pay out. Had a coworker get hurt and have to have surgery and he was always calling and fighting them for his pay and for them to pay the bill for his surgery.  Don't work for this company.
bad,"They don't tell you when the assignment is ending so be prepared to have a job lined up in case you aren't transferred to another project, its okay if it is just a supplement but dont expect it to be permanent unless you are the best"
bad,"McKesson just brought us & we were formally CVS, so technically our new company is ok but we are still considered RX CrossRoads which is the problem.  The turn over rate is super high because of management.....  fair warning!!!!"
bad,Poor management
bad,"In the first few weeks of employment I was issued a company credit card to make company related purchases.  Shortly after the card was issued I had to sign off on credit card policy which involved several training modules about acceptable purchases.  While in the training process I felt like a coworker was testing me as he wanted me to make purchases, seemed odd being there wasn't a need for any company related purchases at the time so he insisted that I use it to purchase something for myself.  I refused explaining how I knew a guy that done something similar and got charged with a felony.  I became aware as time went on that the hiring manager and a few of the employees had been making personal purchases for their projects at home, I tried to ignore and just focus on the job but at one point I was told they didn't feel they could trust me unless I was on board with them.  The real issue was that this location was handling all sorts of potentially harmful chemicals and had no real MSDS plan in effect.  A lot of the chemicals would become airborne and get circulated in the AC system, it was so bad the it would clog some of the machinery on site.  I tried to address from the stand point of the impact it was having on production and not as a health issue but got nothing but resistance.  The management functioned as a club, if you where in the club you received special treatment, not agreeing to the credit card charges I was never part of that club.  I the time I had worked there I had developed a respiratory infection that would improve on my days off but return almost the moment"
bad,McKesson is a great company to work for. It has great pay and great benefits. Working as a temporary employee isn't the best at McKesson. They make you feel like you aren't part of the team and there is a lot of favoritism that is Shown there. I wouldn't recommend this place as a temporary employee. If it isn't direct hire then don't take the chance.
bad,They have like 10 managers and they need to look in the managers book to see what to say in meetings you work 12 hours one day next day 5 hours also teamsters waste of money
bad,"An OK place to work, not a lot of room to move or change positions. The hiring process needs to be improved to make it go more quickly and smoothly. More positivity would be helpful."
bad,"I was not happy working at McKesson. However, I may have been working in a position I was ill-suited for--I spent much of my time doing tasks that I did not enjoy and felt that there was significantly more emphasis on producing content, not necessarily on the quality. That said, the company itself had very positive traits in terms of appreciating diversity and opportunities to learn about and appreciate other cultures."
bad,Communicated inbound and outbound phone calls with doctor's office in pharmacies. We found out which medications were denied or approved and if so why they were denied. We will then relay the messages back to the doctor's office to have incorrect his notes so that the medications will be covered.
bad,"If you looking to work for this company and if you got a family please do not go. "
bad,"Temporary assignment, very unorganized,  mangers were not very helpful as they to were on temporary assignment. I would not recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"McKesson was not promoting innovative thinking but rather an attitude of ""why fix it if it's not broken"". I knew after 3 months that I would want to find other employment."
bad,"Career advancement is given on favoritism, no job security, culture is very unprofessional, this is a call center which the calls are constantly without the proper training. Management is very unprofessional, gossips, and creates their own rules."
bad,It uses third party contractors to assist with employment  opportunity. It does need review the training process due to the amount of temp hires the way training was conducted made it difficult for quotation's to be answered
bad,"when come in you never know what time you are leaving good people have quit this job because poor management.  They put people in higher positions who do not deserve to be there,  The good hard working people have been overlooked including myself i have trained people that come in and i have been overlooked."
bad,"i loved the job because i love to walk at a fast pace and i was good at it, the management was the problem.  They were disrespectful and didn't seem to care about most of the employees."
bad,Not interesed in useing my time on this. Im not a fan of being worked like a slave and NOT being appreciated over 20 people just on nightshift came and left in the 18 mos that i waas there.
bad,"A typical day, you are left to do your job but help is available. Management is always looking to teach more and advance you as fast as they feel you can manage it."
bad,this place is stressful. when is first started the line was terrible/ long hours and overtime. no time with family. sometimes work on weekends to make up more overtime
bad,"Lots of drama and disagreements between staff members that dont get resolved because managment doesnt care, they arent the best employer learned alot from oter employees tho"
bad,"Good place to work and very good Work/Life balance"
bad,I did not feel like this was a good position and the position and expectations were not clearly identified
bad,"The management meanders around all day, expects knowledge of computer systems to be learned immediately whether complicated or not. Makes empty promises to the contracted companies they are working for. Hires too many employees for overhead, and gets rid of people for bogus reasons. The hardest part of the job was to remain positive in such a negative environment. I did enjoy helping patients getting their medications."
bad,"I liked this part time temp job ;wished it was permanent."
bad,•Responsible for handling effective and efficiently customer’s transactions in real time
bad,"Micro managers, Little guidance or support from management."
bad,Don't waste your time In Aurora Il They lay me off and They don't want to pay unemployment. They don't give you 40 hours off work and You have to pay for union !!! waste off money
bad,Management is horrible
bad,"The level of incompetency is incredible. The software and reporting tools are very unstable, and management will not acknowledge that fact and not provide resources to report to the major clients the correct data. In the end the bottom dollar is what matters and the patients suffer because of it. The only enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
bad,Underpaid for the work You hve to do. Other major Delivery company’s make at least $2.00 more per hr. With cost of living in Illinois Going Up to $15 bucks a hr. Definitely UNDERPAID!!
bad,I found that communication between project team members and management was very lacking and because of that the development process was hindered.
bad,"Would be good except for poor management. You would think a part-time position would be ok, but NOT. Constantly have to worry about "
bad,"A typical day at the McKesson Call Center would basically be clocking in then pull up all excels and any material needed to handle the call properly, calls would vary from entering in lab information for patients to simply guiding a prescriber or pharmacists through the Clozapine website a Drug for Patients with schizophrenia."
bad,Poor managerial skills. On own trains new hires to use the beer code scanner. I was not trained at least. Had to constantly get help from co-works. Was not given adequate training
bad,very laid back but messy you dont have no one standing under you at all times. breaks are not long enough and the staff didnt care about employess too much. it was all about getting their work done which im not mad at all but very long hours with short breaks
bad,No opportunity for advancement. They give you more work but don’t compensate. Managers do not have a clue. They let people without a degree be in a leadership position.
bad,"2 people have had strokes working in such a toxic place"
bad,Wasn't the best place to work. Money was ok but the rest was a joke in so many ways. I heard it was a great company to work for but it wasn't for me!!
bad,Very fast paced work environment. You have to move quick to reach qoutas. 8-12 hour shifts. Work until finished. Must have little to no errors to qualify.
bad,McKesson was the legacy system that was being replaced by EPIC. If you were an employee and did not get selected to be on the EPIC project you were relegate to support the legacy system.
bad,The workplace and culture were both tolerable although it could've been better. There was too much favoritism which made it a difficult place to work. The co workers under the same supervision than myself was the most enjoyable part of of the job.
bad,"I was hired to be a Bill Poster but placed in Clerical until the position came open.  Unfortunately, I was there for six months when the position finally became available and a co-working threw a fit because she was employed there longer than I and wanted the position.  Management reluctantly placed her in the position and promised me the next position.  A year later, she was terminated.  They didn't fill the position immediately with promises to me that it will be mine and allowed me to go over and train awhile until fiscally, it was available.  Two years pass as an employee and still not put in that position, but are allowing me to do the job without the proper compensation for that job title.  I was being paid as a Clerical person doing a Poster's responsibilities.  When I addressed my concerns with my supervisor, I was informed that they are not filling that position and that I am ""office support"" as well so they can have me fill in any department with Clerical pay.  I stuck it out for a few more months and finally gave my resignation to focus on my studies to become an RN."
bad,"My experience was very negative, they refused to pay me and others a salary that was agreed upon with an legal HR ""welcome letter"", they had you take anywhere from 4-6 tests to be placed at a higher pay grade and level guess what--you got all the extra work and denied the pay."
bad,Having worked for the company for just short of 10 years I can honestly say I have enjoyed my time here. I have met all kinds of people from all walks of life and had the please of being part of a various fantastic teams.
bad,The company was made redundant and it was also a very difficult place to work I did right enough manage to learn a vast range of payroll knowledge in my time with the business.
bad,McKesson has a very insecure culture. Management looks only at what you do wrong don't look for employee appreciation here. Most horrible stressful back stabbing culture I've ever experienced in a workplace. Save yourself you won't be there long.
bad,"This company doesn’t like innovation or risk "
bad,This company hires racist managers..This company hires managers that don’t want to help you .. The managers like to micro manage their employees they will insult you until you quit .. You work long hours 10-11 hours a day then question you when you are ready to leave to be with your family..
bad,Manager was unaware of what I did on a daily basis and when Review Time came around he did not speak with other people I supported. Made his decision based on personal opinion and not on work performance. You must be very nice to everybody at this place no matter if they are a dishonest and rude manager.
bad,Worked for patient care solutions in 2017 to 2018 was laid of on July 20th 2018. The management staff of this division was horrible. Total disgrace to Mckesson dont understand why they would want any part of that company.
bad,"Management was not very professional. There seemed to be a great deal of favoritism."
bad,"Some areas of McKesson were fine, but Corp Finance was a very difficult area from which to be promoted, specially given that I had 15 years of experience as a Finance Manager and was working as a Senior Analyst.  The company has since been purchased by Change  Healthcare and I hear the management has changed."
bad,"Roulette wheel of management changes, with little quality involved. The quality of management is marginal at best. Typical day at work is simply bone grinding grunt work."
bad,"I worked for the iPLEDGE program which is one of the many programs that are offered by McKesson. From the start, the workplace seemed amazing. You’re constantly told that you could go from a contract employee to a full-time worker so long as you did your work and showed up on time. But that’s far from the truth. There are way too many people working for management to notice your efforts but no doubt they will notice when you go one minute over your 15-minute break. They focus on you and make you feel welcome during training but once that’s over you’re forgotten about and not even acknowledged. Management is rude. Specifically talking about supervisors. My supervisor was horrible. She never let me speak my concerns and was constantly interrupting and belittling me. Even when I asked to switch supervisors nothing was done. They have a very HIGH turnover rate. They won’t ever speak to you to correct anything. While working there I’ve witnessed at LEAST 20 people being told that “their assignment at McKesson has ended” and are not given any reason why. Everyone is disposable and they are constantly bringing new classes of people in each month so it doesn’t bother them to cut people off. The work is repetitive and boring. You will get tired of it. I know it seems great and the new building is amazing but trust me it is not worth it. The only good thing I can say is that you get paid weekly. That’s the only thing that kept me there for as long as I stayed. Please save your sanity and find a different job."
bad,"Very difficult to become a full-time employee. Always reminding that you can be replaced if production is not met."
bad,"You have a set start time, but no end time. Management is so hot and cold with what they expect you to accomplish. Only 2 working shifts, the third is an overnight restocking team."
bad,"This company has let go employees that had 20 years with the company! Outsourcing many jobs, while the few people that remain are pushed to the limit,no matter how well or how much they do it is never considered good enough. Another company that let's ppl go just because they don't like the person. Heard that they are now called ""change healthcare"". Which is ironic since alot needs to change with that organization! They get many people in the door by offering pto and health insurance from day one,but not much else positive to say about them"
bad,"Although this was a very busy job that I enjoyed and like to be kept busy, the training was lacking, always felt on edge and misleading. The pay and hours were great if you were just looking for a paycheck and nothing more."
bad,Great name of company very well known.  The challenge was low pay and uncertain of a strategy.  Turnover was very high.  Leadership was not always on one page but many pages and did not play well.
bad,"A typical day at work would include daily meetings that were used to berate employees."
bad,"Calling patient's to ensure insurance will be the same or need to be updated. The goal is to make sure there are no interruptions with therapy,."
bad,"Great brand name on healthcare but seriously worst company i ever work for first of all mandatory overtime past 12 hours so there for where is ""work-life balance"" as they always preach about it one comment from my wife about a month ago ""honey you should find another job we hardly see each other plus next January the minimum wage will be $10 p/h which is only $3 dollars difference from what you make that will make out for the gas because i have to commute 52 miles daily to work "" and yeah to get a rise you have to actually be perfect because  we get rated from one to three and to get a one is actually impossible  and to get a two well is most common but from twenty points that we get rated 80% are twos so it is really hard to get a good rise mostly cents not even close to a dollar and reviews are annually supervisors are more towards people that do favors to them or invites to lunch or diner faulty equipment accidents unreported safety issues all over the warehouse unnoticible they will write you for any little thing even for an ""accident""  they wear you out so bad that everybody is cranky due to lack of rest and sleep 13 hrs of overtime accumutated  in just three days people quit or fire and they don't replace them they merge with another company and of course more work less workers but they still make mandatory overtime pass the 12th hour really really tired but hard to look for work got to bear with it till find something new"
bad,"I like this job because it is very fast paced and you have twelve things you have to do at once and the job is never boring and the day always seems to go by quickly. "
bad,"If you work here don,t stay more than 3 years."
bad,"No chance for growth and no training program in place so that you can confidently know the job that you are doing. They are starting people off at $9.00 to do work that most companies are starting people off at $12 or better, the management has no idea of the potential within the company because they only listen to each other instead of the people that work in the ""trenches"" everyday to help to company grow."
bad,"It’s very frustrating not knowing when you’ll become a full time employee. They work you extremely hard and don’t give you paid days off or Holiday pay. However, they will provide you with sick time."
bad,There needs to be  communication to the reps from management and a create a step by step building a learning material. Increase in pay rate with consideration for previous work history
bad,"There was a lot of promises, however, few fulfullments. It's a shame that a Fortune 5 company is so disorganized, and so top heavy in management, that little actual work gets done."
bad,The management did not know how to manage and they did not know how to train and they had their favorite people all the time They need better management and better training
bad,Operations in Specialty Health has Huge lack of professional training that should be provided by experienced individuals. Zero team connections/vibes.
bad,"They hire you for one position and then bait and switch you with no option to change or grow within your career. They promote their company, but their internal use of expertise is non- exsistant"
bad,It was bad management held people back there was little reprieve. Lots of work low pay little rest. Pig headed company atmosphere and aggressive characters
bad,"I didn't see a future in McKesson, My manager was always out of the office. One time the wanted us to write off deductibles which is insurance fraud at that moment I knew it was time to relocate."
bad,I learned that people are not team players.  Great learning experience and taught me more about my specialty in the healthcare field that I received my degree in.
bad,Too much work had to be finished before the shift was able to end i spent 20 hours one day pulling order got off was late the following day by 2 hrs and was written up. only to have done 15 hrs that day. not my favorite place.
bad,"McKesson was not open to new ideas, McKesson did not reward good performance and rewarded poor performance.  They kept folks that did the job very slowly."
bad,"A place to acquire experience only short term, they speak of room for advancement but that is only for those who are close to the director . Management display favoritism . They say they have an open door policy but lack compassion for employees and only care about the work getting done . You do not receive credit for the work you do . The do not live up to their values and a lot of office politics as well as gossip. The culture sucks."
bad,"Very poorly managed distribution center. The maintenance is lacking on every piece of equipment and has been for a long time. Every gearbox and motor in the place has never had maintenance done on them and are all leaking oil.the ""LEAD"" maintanence mechanic is very one aided and only sees things his way with no regard for another mechanics expertise. He believes in using harbor freight tools which causes more problems and makes every job difficult. No care for a work/life balance and mediocre pay. Post the job title as a day job with occasional overtime but in reality it's a second shift job with nightly multiple hour overtime requirements. Very poor place to work and I would not recommend to anyone."
bad,"Not much room for advancement. Management is not so friendly. Definitely not an open door policy like they claim. Hours are ridiculous, lots and lots of favoritism"
bad,If you want to work here you must have personal and family issues. You can't wear nice clothing or drive a nice vehicle because mgmt will be jealous and tell lies to get you fired. Make sure you keep copies of important things because they make up stuff on you if they don't like you (talking about mgmt and their clicks).They harass you sexually and nothing is done. Be aware of this place.
bad,"DC 11 Orlando, FL is not a healthy place to work in. Very bad management all around, you are forced to work overtime,  you are forced to pick up the slack of the lazy employees,  hour employee feedback is not taken into consideration at meetings, borderline hostile environment, mentally, phisically and sexually, certain female employees are borderline sexually harassed by coworkers and certain members of management and if you complain you are targeted and retaliated against,   "
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, lied to and promised this and that. Company does not appreciate their employees....no advancement no raises...etc. Lie after lie...sounds good until u see all the things that goes on behind the scene."
bad,Going through major restructuring; employment is uncertain. Too many in management with tenure that are not open to innovative ideas or process improvements.  Resistant to innovative technological solutions.
bad,Not the ideal place to work if raising a family. Warehouse employees are treated like slaves and management talk down on the employees
bad,"-Taking inbound calls for orders, credits, complaints, returns, shipping issues, website support etc. "
bad,"So if your looking for a ok paycheck you will get enough overtime to last you. If you are a family person forget it because there is no work life balance if your kids or you do extracurricular activities forget it because you never know what time you will get off work. Lies after lies, management could give a craps less about you and a very poor running plant. Seriously this job is hard enough for a single person let alone a family person. Favoritism it's all in who you know some get treated great orthers like dirt if you bust your butt they will lie to you about advancement to keep you in that position.   If you want a work life balance and better pay look elsewhere."
bad,"A typical day would involve logging onto the phones to receive incoming calls and trying to resolve the issues within 3 minutes (this was our SLA) however if we knew how to fix the issue but could not do so within 3 minutes, we were told to bounce the call to 2nd line. The call would then sit in the queue for days until someone could get around to looking at it, even though it could have been resolved on the first call."
bad,"Production quota on accounts touched per day."
bad,"Supervisors are not grade A... They are never on the floor, always in their office, show favoritism, some smell like alcohol at the start of the shift when he is there), and never followup up you. There is NO work life balance, no floor presence from managers and show favorites with their supervisors. JOKE...."
bad,Decent place to work - decent benefits - poor leadership - poor direction - great co-workers - low pay
bad,"The company itself is not bad at all, its just mainly management they have no direction nor do they have a firm grasp of the workload. Complex denials are not overturned by working 45 accounts a day and documenting the enternal system correctly.RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH especially on dirty accounts that been have touched by several other in experienced workers.."
bad,"Most of the time its the employees that make the work place a difficult and undesirable place to be, but quite the opposite at this place. A large percentage of the people I have worked with are hard and diligent workers, we work long hours everyday and it seems to never be appreciated or acknowledged by management. Instead we get ""you guys need to step it up a lil bit more and by the way here are more rule and regulations you must follow"". You get more responsibility but don't get the pay to match it, your given the run around on pretty much everything you ask about I.E your raises, questions about safety, pay and regulations. Management seems to never have a direct answer and are clueless at times and I've never worked for a company where HR seems to always be doing you a favor by even helping you.The HR Rep. is always super busy, and lags on all paperwork that is time sensitive. It seems no matter how hard you work you don't get moved up, they say they value their employees but your paycheck says different....."
bad,Management not in touch with employees. There is no support from upper management. Middle level manage run a muck and control people through fear tactics.
bad,"poor management style with high management turnover."
bad,"Micro-management, unprofessionalism, low moral, an extremely high turnover. "
bad,I worked here for 3 months and have never left a job besides this one. The manager is a total control freak. She is the only manager on the 4th floor. Takes credit for others work. Says something and the next day denies it. Run from the 4th floor. Should have been a flag when coworkers would ask if I was returning everyday.
bad,"Wasn't a good experience for me, I was with the company for over two years. Started on the weekend shift and then forced onto the overnight shift, working 10 hours +, the rule was when you clocked in you couldn't leave until work was done which would be 10 to 13 a day with no room for growth and advancement."
bad,"Manager did not have a clue on logistics "
bad,Worked for the company for over 10 years without any issues.  Over the last few years a steady downward trend has taken place.  I hate to use the word “discrimination” but unless you are a minority you will not be promoted...at least in the team that I work with.  One hundred percent of the white managers and leads have been moved to non manager positions and minorities have been given their jobs.
bad,"Phones were busy which was expected in call center. "
bad,16 to 18 hour days are expected. No such thing as vacation or sick-time. You are expected to be working. Some leadership shake up is necessary to develop a new 21st century approach.
bad,Mckesson is a strenuous stress ful micromanaged Job./mckesson used to be a great company enjoyable to work for but not now. To get a promotion or get to the top you have to sleep with management
bad,"The only great thing about McKesson is the flex schedule. "
bad,Overall McKesson was okay company to work for however its a lot of unfair things that go on there amongst employees & supervisors. A guy supervisor there who walks around touching on all the female employees and a female supervisor who shows favoritism and if you don't become part of her clique she gets you fired. There's no one to be the voice for those who are temporary employees.
bad,"Not great to work here but a job is a job sometimes. The pay is garbage, they pay the absolute minimum and every so often the CEO will tell us how well the stocks did... that's great but you said no raises because the company was struggling? Ok..."
bad,"Management here are the most incompetent DOLTS!! They couldn't run a lemonade stand much less a warehouse. Instead of fair and decent staffing they randomly bring in shifts during the day from anywhere to 8 to 12+ hours and never tell them when they are going to leave!! They worship inaccurate/doctored production numbers over actual employee safety and performance. You can advance in the company depending on who you are friends with or sleep with so that's a plus?  Instead of Blue Cross Blue Shield they offer Cigna, which is terrible they pay for nothing, are barely in any care providers ""network"" but they do offer a glorified savings account so that's a plus. "
bad,"All I have to say is BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY. Only pay $13.00 an hour to it's van drivers. Do the math, 10 or more hours a day 5 days a week THAT'S $130 x 4 = $520 / overtime $19.50 x 10 = $195. Total = $715 Bi weekly = $1430.00 Gross pay. Ohoooo, Don't forget to subtract all your deductions {Taxes, insurance, child support and others}. LOL.........You got to laugh to keep from crying. Your lucky to have a $800 check. Think about it, your van has 150 to 200 or more packages fully loaded from front to the rear door each day. <<<<The company makes over a $100,000 a day and only gave you a $130.00 of it >>>>>>> WOW!!!!! Where's ROBIN HOOD when you need him. I felt like a rock working for that company. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. YOUR GOING TO NEED IT."
bad,"As a college graduate, working as a customer service representative at the RxCrossroads building was a nice entry level job into the workplace. However, if you have a college degree, I would not apply for that position. The workload is overwhelming, fast paced, and tideous with low pay and it's hard to get time off to enjoy your PTO. The supervisors that work on the patient assistance programs play favoritism, and they are constantly yelling at you to pick up phone calls."
bad,"Management doesn’t understand what’s going on, there is drama like your in high school, your expected to do more then should be, under staffed, no properly trained. Negative inviorment"
bad,"No one knew what was happening. Upper management was not aware of what was happening at functionals side of IT Services. There was a Certification Team but application always failed at the production side of the environment,"
bad,"I took over a shipping department and was managing 8 people, and didn't receive a single raise.  They also wanted me to compete for my job with some one with less experience when I was already filling in on an interim basis for three months."
bad,"Constant overload from management all the way down to clerks. Positions are constantly being moved to offshore partners and there is constant pressure to meet unrealistic deadlines. Even when the staff advises that a certain amount of time is needed, management refuses to listen and gets nasty when you don’t reach their unrealistic goal. Management is not held to the same standard as those they manage. They constantly tell you that they don’t read their emails and that you have to find them and speak to them but then you get in trouble for being away from your desk and not being productive."
bad,"This place would be alright if managment would just let the employees perform their daily task without interupting. The ops manager needs things  done his way and his way only! There is very little room for growth at this location. If you are not a part of the club of people that likes to run and tell, you will not have a fair chacne!"
bad,At the specific branch that I was at when I got hired on we were already considerably short-staffed. It seems like it took forever to get anybody hired and for every four people that they hired one maybe stayed a week. So we were going through long periods of every bit of working every bit of 50 to 60 hours in 5 days. With overtime pay it was okay but when you look at the scale of things it was one of the lowest paying facilities in the area. We were work at your pace then work till completion and they brought the LMS team in. Once the LMS Steam showed up and started setting standard all  chaos broke loose. The staff that we did have was pretty much told they were doing everything wrong and completely slow so let's change things. Everybody was open to the change but there was no time to fully understand what was changing and why it was changing how it was changing. We had 6 weeks to go from what we knew is normal to be able to hit what they considered standard if not above it. They had also took our incentive pay away and then reinstated depending on how you're performing compared to standard. You had to be over a 102 percent for two straight weeks to even be considered for incentive. Towards the end of my working experience there we were picking 2400 lines a day with a total of 6 people in the air throughout the day everybody averaging about 40 lines an hour and nobody was over 100%. People were literally killing themselves having Strokes on the floor and refusing to go to the hospital because they didn't want it to affect their numbers or they didn't want it to take that point
bad,Most managers don’t want to be bothered with employees with the exception of those that are on the floor. This company needs to hire individuals with people skills that genuinely get involved with the team. The managers that have offices would just rather closed the door and choose not to ingage in the chaos that’s really going on.
bad,Everyone is ver smug. Especially the managers! The place feels like a prison. Security harassment on faculty. And terrible leadership. If you keep you head down you can make it work!
bad,"Great big company, but extremely political. You need to have some really nice connections in order to grow. Benefits are good, salary is average. It's one of the oldest and biggest companies in the US."
bad,"Its alright, but the pay is way too low. no time to look for another job. 2.) You never know what time your workday will end. 3.) Standing on feet all day 4.) Low pay"
bad,Always in fear of losing job. Extended time off with sick child unexceptionable. Doesn’t care if you have proper documentation they don’t except it . The pay was good but not enough for the stress and the tasks that kept getting added to job b description
bad,"you are expected to work really hard and fast. hard to be fired if a BAD  employee. but yet the hard workers are not advanced or given growth opportunity. most managers come from other DCs or companies. rarely see hard workers promoted. only way to be promoted at a good rate of time is to relocate to other DCs. the pay increases don't matter how hard you work or not. non union employees increases are below average and they have no perks for knowing they don't give good raises at all. the insurance is beyond expensive for a deductible. it is good if you never use insurance but if you do be expected that have the lowest deductible 5000 a year. max deductible 7000.ten years at the company and i seen a lot of changes but to them no matter how hard you work they will look at you to be replaced. even when working as a robot doing everything right to the book as they want, they will not reward you fairly for it. and throw the excuse it not in their budget this year every time."
bad,Not allowed to share details about the company.  You should not make this a required field.  I am attempting to locate a part-time job to supplement my income.
bad,Good place to work for just be on time and don't miss work and you wil be successful must be a team player interactions with others at a high rate
bad,"For a company in the medical industry they pay terrible and expect you to work odd and long hours. There is room for advancement if circumstances are right, and if you last long enough."
bad,"McKesson Med-Surg has good benefits, but not much else going for it."
bad,I don't remember much about working a McKesson its been over 12 years. It would not be fair for me to rate them now because I am sure everything has change in this many years.
bad,"I truly enjoyed my employment at McKesson. I felt that the management was lacking in several areas and needed severe improvement, but overall it is a well respected and well operated corporation."
bad,"9-10 hour work days during business hours makes doing anything besides work nearly impossible. "
bad,"This was a horrible, low moral company. The only employees that actually enjoy being there is upper management. Benefits aren't horrible. The company as a whole rates high, but this specific locations rates very low.  I wouldn't want my worse enemy to work there."
bad,The great thing about working at McKesson is that food was always available which is something I love to walk into. A cafe full of free food to keep me going through out the day.
bad,Go to work load my van go delivery everything come back unload the empty totes and that would be my day. Very simple job but you can get a pay raise ever. You use your own gas which they dont pay for. Use you own vehicle which they dont pay for repairs.
bad,Management was unavailable and uninterested in helping you advance and concerns were never address. It was a tense workplace and the hours were horrible for the lack of appreciation we got.
bad,I've gained alot of pharmaceutical knowledge.  A typical day consists of taking at least 50 incoming calls
bad,I go to work and do my job I keep to my self  there are a lot of 2 face people there.
bad,"If you have done an order selection position before, and you know you have done well at that job, DO NOT work here.  The company has great benefits, but is unorganized, and lazy.  This particular location has a 60% accuracy standing, meaning the customer will get what they ordered 60% of the time.  Corporate does not want you to work overtime, this location will make sure you come close to that.  You have 1600 pc orders that take 8 hours or more to ship, mind you this is a pharmaceutical industry.  Anyone who works shipping generally knows that 1600 pcs is cake to load.  I have loaded more in less than 8 hours.   Your starting pay $14.52, is at the highest end of the tax bracket, be prepared to bring home less than if you were making $10.00/hr."
bad,Long hours and no commission like all the other sales man received even when I sold product.
bad,Inbound and outbound calls regarding customer service. Data entry and assisting medical billers and coders with processing of invoices.
bad,"Nicely located in downtown SF, but the culture does not foster team work. Low salaries y not so good benefits compared to other companies in pharma distribution."
bad,Great culture for a young start up whom desires immediate beginning to intermediate learning skills in the specialty pharma space.
bad,After transferring from another division of McKession - I had a horrible awakening. I count the management in the top 10 percent of companies I would never recommend to someone looking for work unless the manager were to have been replaced while I worked there.
bad,"I haven’t worked there in a long time but when I did it was a mess. Management was very insensitive.  The only thing that mattered was not letting customers hold. It didn’t matter what was going on with you personally, just do your work. They were understaffed, the employees underpaid, and management did not show any empathy for any situation. Everyone I knew left."
bad,Hated taking patient phone calls. Did learn ERA & balancing daily deposits. Hated the fact they felt they didn't/wouldn't pay a decent wage   Top management were hateful.
bad,"Not a difficult job to work but very draining experience, Management wasn't always truthful nobody on the same page of growth and opportunity, always forced to do overtime."
bad,"Really not a nice place to work no job advancement unless you are in with the in-crowd. It's one of the company with the friends and family plan regardless to experience, skills that an employee offers."
bad,This is not a company you want to work for if you are looking for fairness and respect. The management is not trained or educated on their job and they absolutely do not care about the customers.
bad,"It's not about what you know and how knowledgeable you are, but who you know and who you're closest to within the company.  Many ideas that sounded amazing were mentioned, but  the company, never followed through."
bad,"It was an great place to work, with a great culture, that cared about the well being of patients/consumers in the market.  Unfortunately It's Pfizer all over again.  Slowly taking out Canadian resources one at a time as part of a Globalization effort and repatriating them in the US.  Canadian CIO was let go, President is retiring in Dec 2019, and CEO retiring in July 2020."
bad,"Working close to 5 years; right out of highschool to the point where I decided what career path I wanted to pursue. I feel as though I can give a sound opinion opinion on McKesson Canada, more so McKesson Canada's Trenton DC. "
bad,"There was absolutely NO work life balance and management was not concerned with making changes.  Once, I worked 13 days in a row.  Not 1 single day off.  I left a company that I was at for 15.5 years to go to McKesson.  13 months after I started with them, they did layoffs and I lost my job.There is no job security!"
bad,poor and unprofessional management. No real support from team members and constant gossip. The staff do not follow ILEAD and ICARE as they portray.....
bad,"My fellow quality assurance analysts and I have been terminated without a notice because our contract expired. The management  did not find necessary to request a contract renewal to RemX (the staffing agency on site) even though we were in the middle of handling programs and agents (who are confused and undergoing massive cutoffs as well) and were promised a conversion to full-time employees last week."
bad,You have to fit in to the culture.  It’s said to be team oriented. But you train on your own to learn how to make your numbers.  And it’s not team oriented.  Leads pick favorites.
bad,stressful place to work. if you are not a yes man  dont work here. management don't know what they are doing  and than you get blame for there mistake. i like the company but management no good.
bad,"A typical day can be quite demanding."
bad,Terrible accounting department. Terrible management. Insurance is okay. Workplace accommodations for employees with disabilities is very poor. This is the reason I left the company
bad,"When your director dumps your hiring process and all work on others and you don't even meet your director who is one office away, until after 3 months on the job, you know there's something wrong. And when the person who hired you doesn't want you to leave but can't recommend a department where you would find the better management you seek, you know you're in trouble. Then there's the software rollout project that's been postponed three times already and has had no project manager on the job for months, so you know any deadlines are fictitious and the activities to support the rollout are already stale or out-of-date after a year of no-action. When IT staff lies to you about what's happening and what you need to do, and there are no repercussions, you know you are in the wrong place. They're making money hand over fist, no doubt, but their poor management hasn't caught up with them yet. Employees keep their heads down, brown-nose or leave, resulting in high turnover. There's, no on-site HR assistance, no cooperation between siloed groups, an un-integrated merger and cultures and they make no attempt to retain smart, valuable people."
bad,"Very good values with ICARE.  So much potential but, hard to innovate being such a big company.  In many areas the leaders rotated frequently which was disruptive."
bad,"Contractors get nothing. Little pay, no benefits. Excluded from Corporate events. No communication on contract extensions. No contact from PM. People moved around to much."
bad,"McKesson has a sterile work culture in their Scottsdale location.  The company works in silo type environment.  You have people managing and grading your performance who don't even know the how the business applications work.  There is little communication from one department to another,  and there is little employee empowerment to make suggestions for quality improvement with customer interface.  McKesson is a third party vendor in this scenario,  reaching out to customers on medication adherence programs, but in the end it's all about optics and not customer driven.   They hire some quality people, but they don't stay long because the work is very narrow in scope."
bad,The management staff was not prepared for this work load. The Supervisors left almost every week. We had to work long hours.Fright was limited to and 11:00am cut off. But trucks were allowed to continue to drop of frieght.25.00
bad,"Going from a very professional and organized health insurance company to McKessan was hard to adjust to. McKessan has some of the most unprofessional people working for them. And there is no structure or organization. Everyone has a different answer, and not even the supervisors know the right answer. The worst part was listening to CSRs cus out patients on the phone. Worst ever!"
bad,"Was at the Clear Brook location. They are slave drivers, with long hours, never know when you can be ""allowed"" to go home, incompetent managers, overall bad experience. Sure... lets put the individual with two degrees and working on his masters degree counting pieces of toilet paper and q-tips for accuracy while the incompetent lazy leads and managers feel threatened by you and don't communicate with the team very much. 2/10 terrible experience."
bad,"This was one of the worst experiences I had."
bad,task would differ from day to day I wasnt able to really use all of my skills and experience which was disappointing the pay was on the very low end of what it should be management could use a over haul
bad,A job is an endeavor where one uses one's creativity and intellect to create solutions to some human need.  McKesson was more like a money cult where client satisfaction was secondary.
bad,"Nice place to work but the training was a bit lacking. All training was PC based and left little room for ""real life"" type situations.  Had the training been more up to par I believe the experience would have been much better."
bad,"have a team meeting. told something on how the job was performed changes go back to our desks and that , that we just were told was changes with out notice. Not made aware until you apply what you were told gets back to management . then told it was changed. "
bad,"As mentioned in the summary, there's no incentive to keep working for them. I really don't enjoy the company as a whole. They need to work on how professional they are towards their employees."
bad,"Poor Management, horrible work life balance, forced overtime with limited notice usually an hour, management tends to play favorites, and if you are not one you will not move up."
bad,high school mentality. management has no clue how to manage their work force. very little planning for the work day. there is no team effort involved. the pay does no compensate the work done.
bad,Extreme micromangement on the part of the supervisors. Very unprofessional business culture. Management is poorly trained and at times misleading and disrespectful.
bad,"On average really not a bad place to work. "
bad,"Company just works you to death, no room for advancement and managers will throw you under a bus at the drop of a hat. One particular supervisor was a demonstrated racist and it showed in how she treated people of a different ethnicity.  They always stress diversity but would never promote from within."
bad,"Absolutely horrible. They randomly came through and ""laid people off"" but one month later when they needed to fill some job positions, they decided to hire new people instead of bringing back workers! Absolutely dreadful"
bad,"Management openings is giving to those that don't have the qualifications. Change healthcare needs to make sure the managers, supervisors, and auditing has knowledge of the coding they supervise. "
bad,"This place is the worst ""well known company"" to work for! They treat you like prisoners/inmates. They watch your every move and will email you and approach you about anything they heard you did. If you spray perfume on yourself in the bathroom they know about it. The employees are very sneaky and tend to tell on each other. All your calls are monitored. Everything you do is monitored. This company does not care about employees or their customers."
bad,"My current job is great. I have learned a lot."
bad,"you have no time if you have a family,,, micro management, the management not good,,,,the benifets arent good,, if you want tons of overtime and no life this is the place for you,,,sweat shop! you also dont get a lunch if you work nite shift."
bad,"While a good company, there are many management issues in the Anchorage district. The issues brought on by the management made the environment edgy and miserable."
bad,"Queensbury office is a horrible place to work. The pay is not good. The managers and high up's are unprofessional and rude to the employees. From the supervisor level down, it's not too bad but any higher, forget it. They have no compassion nor do they care about their employees. My opinion for the Queensbury office is that they get rid of all the managers and start over. I bet this place would be 100% better to work for."
bad,"if you just need a job or to get experience then go for it. Otherwise I would not recommend this company to any one.  Best thing about the company is the benefits. Not the best I've had but not the worst. You get bounced around from client to client each with their own coding nuances.  Once you think you have one client down you get moved around. Some of the managers and supervisors I just wonder how???! But there a few good ones, but unfortunately you may not stay with those for long.  I have had 4 managers and I have lost count on supervisors.  At one point I wasn't sure who my supervisor was. Very irritating to say the least."
bad,A mixture of an ongoing Union dispute and poor management makes this a terrible environment to work in and I would not recommend anyone to work in this facility
bad,"why? there is nothing to say, it is a job, just like any other job out there. they use you and throw you out when they are done with you.  the coworkers are the best though"
bad,"I work in one place and never get moved around so I don't learn anything new, management and the co-workers are unpleasant the hardest part of the job is trying to like it."
bad,"Worked here in the IT Department side for a number of years.They allowed a failing product line management team to come in and take over a quickly growing product.  The result was they brought their corporate culture and quickly destroyed the customer relationships previously built. These relationships were the foundation of Paragon growth. The result...The quick growing product is now on the way to being sunset."
bad,"McKesson is a large cooperation and as such making contact with full time managers is a nightmare. I was a FTE managed by contingent staffing. I found the work culture amongst vendors tiring and a limiting on my Product Support role.The team gave selective internal support and training. The relevant  level of education among my peers questionable."
bad,"Easy job, decent pay, long hours (10-14 hrs per night), a lot of walking (approx 15-17 miles per night), poor upper and lower level management, no work/life balance, high turnover rate, slave labor, can't leave until everything is done, union employee, union contracts not followed by company (they find loop holes), full benefits, 401k, management stands around and talks but quick to bark orders, too many leaders not enough workers, won't hire new workers, high work load. Overall save yourself the hassle and find something else."
bad,"There is approximately six week training before actually working on the ""floor"", which is nice.  However, I would not recommend working at this particular McKesson located on Horizon Dr., because management was horrible. I personally have never experienced such unprofessional and inept management as I have with this particular company.  There is potential to make a descent wage, but not worth it."
bad,There's tons of overtime opportunity.  There's a break every 2-2 1/2 hours.  Competitive pay.  Healthcare is top class and one of the best i've had.
bad,"The lack of professionalism is top on my list. Management is poor, I noticed some of the employees got special treatment. "
bad,"I was contracted through Remx, they informed me the position would be for at least 6 months. Once our team finished the tasks at hand, all of their ""blizzard"" work. We were all promptly let go."
bad,"The work is rewarding however employees are over worked. Management is not professional nor knowledgeable, there is a unrealistic dependence on employees to do the work of management while they play.  The employees themselves are hard working and good people, this organization cannot retain good employees. The employee turn around is pathetic."
bad,"I have been at McKesson almost a year. Great PTO and benefits, but management is sad. This place is backwards in policies, those who need to be held accountable are not. Things get swept under the rug. Management encourages petty childish behavior."
bad,"misled in many ways during hiring process. "
bad,"A typical day starts at 7pm (night shift) and ends whenever the work is done, Sundays are the worst, sometimes we finish at 7 am even at 9am !!!"
bad,"Worked for Macro Helix Support. They use contractors frequently. There is not always someone who is knowledgeable to help. The resources they have are not always accurate. But you are held accountable if you give out wrong information. The quality assurance form is ridiculous and few meet it. They hold back there best people from advancing because there are not enough tenured reps to handle the case load.Management does not follow through on what they say the will do. They overload you with case work and say you don't do your job but they do not help you with how to solve the cases.  I was a contractor there for 12 weeks and saw 15 people get fired, quit or not come back. Overall I would not work here again. Look else where for employment."
bad,"The HARDEST part of my job is enduring the lack of communication while trying to facilitate. The management does things the same way they always have, yet they expect different results."
bad,The job was mentally and physically straining.  My only job was going through huge boxes to locate certain medical files.  The boxes weighed around 60 lbs and they would be in stacks.  So I would have to move those boxes around all day looking for one paper.
bad,"It was ok. The benefits are great, however the opportunity of for advancement for minority is at 1%. I dont know what else to tell you. I work for the company for 7 years and got laid off in November of 2014."
bad,A typical day at work consisted of very very long hours.  What I learned was time management.  My co-workers had nice personalities.
bad,Elitist attitude; directors and VP's in a cloud. Top heavy and it's going to flip soon. Business model no longer working.
bad,At start of day sort the previous days prescriptions out to specific doctors surgeries answering any phone calls from customers requesting a delivery of medicine's also serving customers that walk in the shop buying medicine or bringing in a prescription. I learned about the importance of confidentiality. The hardest part of the job is that you are stood all day and you get your dinner when you can. he most enjoyable part of the job is that you meet a lot of people and get to chat with them while they are waiting for their prescriptions to be made up.
bad,"Mangement favors their friends. One mangers best friend makes comments to both genders. If you report the isuue they target you. Supervisors favor miniorites over whiter people. If you are older be ready to get fired. White middle age women in charge has replaced her orginal mgmt. staff. All about her goals ands has no values. Told a mexician worker he would be nothing more then a fork lift driver. Also asked him in a rude tone what do your people do for christmas."
bad,I have been mandated to work every single day I work.  I never know what time I am going to be off of work.
bad,co-workers were basically the ones who helped me to understand the basics of their spreadsheets due to lack of management-enjoyed my work once I had some guidance. What I enjoyed the most was I had to think outside the box and try to figure numbers and information given to me out and identify errors and fix them
bad,"Inexperienced managers undervalued my training, skills and experience."
bad,managers don't know what they are doing too much overtime ots of expectations that slow your day.
bad,"Shocking how poorly managed this place was, just a revolving door.  Some attempt to promote the ICare program but values aren't being displayed by adopted by certain departments such as HR.  I've never experienced such a 'circus' environment before with such a work/life inbalance. Very shocking."
bad,"Do what you're told & document verbal instructions every time, since the protocol will change at managements' discretion; don't ask why, or question conflicting directions; keep up with production quotas. Leave your ethics at the timeclock and leave this reference off of your resume'"
bad,"Business Leadership has no vision and are completely reactive to the healthcare drug companies they support. This translates to a horrible work environment that requires long hours, little recognition and pointing fingers when things do not go well. Would not recommend this buisness unit within McKesson at this time until the executive leadership has changed."
bad,"Working with coding in the Jacksonville office, I found micro management and unprofessionalism. It was not a nice atmosphere to work. Very stressful and with the lack of good pay, was not a good place to be."
bad,"Working,working, working,nice peoples, most enjoyable part of job just knowing you have a job to go to ."
bad,"Would not recommend this company to friends or family  as there is awful work culture and too much work for any reasonable person. The job itself is fine and there are good, nice people but the amount of stress is too much"
bad,"If you enjoy long hours for menial pay, and don't have much to aspire to in the future, then this is the job for you. I've never worked in a warehouse that works a small amount of full-timers far beyond what's necessary. For god sakes, if it's saving money on wages you're worried about, then hire more part time employees, and make things flow smoother. The turnover is insanely high."
bad,just no they didn't treat me good at the end it was nice at the start then they just started hiring the wrong people for the wrong jobs and the employees were class act people
bad,Just all around joke of night shift managment and night operations manager they have no clue what's goes on with the material handlers there they let them run a muck and do what they want
bad,A good place to work as your first job or as a last resort. It’s boring and the days drag on. Managers play favorites and you will likely be fired if you’re through a temp agency. It’ll pay the bills though.
bad,Mckesson is a clean environment to work at but can be tight with the managers. You can not be late more than a minute or toy will be sucked from your time
bad,"This was not the best place to work at the time, but as far as the company goes, I cannot speak too bad about them.  There were a lot of great people that worked therew when I did, but at that time they were going through miltiple layoffs and at times we had no managers.  The department was run down to the bone and with trying to manage family and work life, i had to choose my family."
bad,"There is a lot of work, skill and expectations for the pay provided. Management is a non existing support, and raises are given about 30 cents per year, doesn’t even keep up with minimum wage. I worked here 2 years and finally had enough. Benefits are the major selling point as they are amazing and affordable, however pay stopped making even that worth it."
bad,Good place to gain valuable experience but management has low self esteem. Most managers are not able to handle employees that don't need or want hand holding.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend. They have a very strict attendance policy on being late and taking time off. They micromanage their staff. Itheir attendance policy works on a point system.
bad,"Good company but poor management, treat their employees as numbers not people and part of their team.Some managers don’t have good manners to solve issues with the workers.Everything they see are numbers..."
bad,I was there for years. They were good to me until we had new management. I worked 4 different departments. I was doing 4 jobs but was only getting paid to do one. Not fair at all.
bad,You stay of on a contract of undetermined length an d once that's over you can be terminated without cause at the end of any workday regardless of performance.
bad,"My first day on the floor the Management Looked me square in the eye and said ""Texas is an 'AT WILL"" state. I can for you for the color of your eyes if I want to!""  THAT should have been an indication to me at that moment, but i was just getting back to work after 5 years of battling cancer and I felt i had no choice.. Then I discovered I DID have a choice and moved on."
bad,Oversaw the operation of the Jacksonville distribution center.Had 60 associates and 4 supervisors working a 24 hour operation. Interacted with 2 sales representatives and regional sales manager.
bad,"I was offered much advancement during my initial interview with travel, laptops, and told how they would advance my career but once hired in 6 weeks to onboard. NO ADVANCEMENTS whatsoever. Good benefits. Management is less than desired and does not listen or hear their employees. Treated like a call center or factory in a hospital setting."
bad,"This is a temp to hire position, I was not told that until after training also I'm not a call center kind of person. It's a very loud environment to be a call center. A typical day is sitting at a computer taking inbound phone calls from patients,doctors & nurses asking about the status of applications for very expensive medications. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what you're doing due to lack of training not to mention it is very unorganized.The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get off from work."
bad,"McKesson is a great company that does good for their patients but currently due to there contractor who hires their majority of employees management, pay, and now employee morale has gone downhill. Its all sweet talk about how they need us and how we have our jobs secured, but they give no prior notice before letting you know your contract has ended. They give no notice when they switch you to a different program and give you a pay cut as well as a different position to the one you where hired on. It's either you take it or leave it, you don't have a choice. I'm grateful to actually have a job but if they were more up front and communicative I'd have stuck around longer. To become full time its about 1-2 years wait as is, So patience is key to hold on while you get something more secure but if you don't mind all of what I said above, go for it. Currently Looking for Something better myself."
bad,This company  bought us over. Ever since then it has gone down hill. I would never recommend anyone to work there! The management sucks. They don’t care. They make false promises. It’s beyond a hectic and stressful place to work at.
bad,"It is very much a ""This isn't my job"" type company.  The more incompetent you are, the further up the chain you go.  I watched good people be released and watched people who were completely useless get promoted."
bad,No room for advancement and no concern of employees not getting there 40 hours. Not open truly to employees opinions.  Management  is very one sided and rules only apply to whom they pick and choose.
bad,"Highly political environment"
bad,"There was no advancement at the company, and we were always worried about the next day. The best thing about the company was the severance package! The management did not listen when we talked, and when others yelled across cubicles. It was a job."
bad,"McKesson's culture has changed tremendously in the last 3-4 years. Management does not care for the employees  only for the shareholders."
bad,"This company makes no investment in the time, resources, or equipment needed to provide employees to allow them to function to the best of their abilities. Leadership is something that is completely lacking at any level."
bad,"I work my scheduled time and leave. My immediate supervisor is very supportive. I key in orders, all day, every day. I like my teammates very much. good guys"
bad,"It's a great place to work."
bad,This is a company that you could learn a lot from. It really depends on the team that you were on. It also depends on who you have for your supervisor.
bad,"Après 4 ans de service dans plusieurs départent de l’entrepôt,  je n'ai jamais eu l'impression d'être féliciter ou remarqué sur mes bon coups. Les seuls temps que tu vas les entendre te parler c'est pour te chicaner ou pour te faire faire de l'overtime OBLIGATOIR qui peut aller jusqu’à 4h obligatoire. Travail très routinier de soir et qui prend 0 en compte les besoins des employer (besoins familial, besoins médical etc). Bref, ils veulent juste que tu ferme ta geule et que tu travail (avec un rendement quand même élevé et sévert) sans rien demander."
bad,"McKesson was very lax on training new employees.  Most companies have evaluations to determine strengths and weaknesses. My first review wasn’t until 9 months.  "
bad,"I worked for this company for over 14 years. When i started was wonderful for the first 4 years, then management changed. This was no longer the company that was caring and supportive but a company that made employees feel like they were worthless. I loved my job and my customers which is why i stayed so long. The management runs good people off."
bad,You work for a call center answering calls trying to get others signed up  for medical discount cards they may of received from various locations including their Dr.
bad,"Pretty stressful work environment.  Good people.  Work life balance is always an issue.  Very hard to balance regulations, customer demands, and the demands of the business."
bad,"Have to work until everything is done, so expect to stay beyond 8 hours. Not guaranteed an end time. Workload is unpredictable from day to day. The company will have activities during the holidays."
bad,"Not something I'd want to endure again."
bad,Culture prohibits family/work balance as resources are cut but workflow increased.   Company off-shores and eliminates US jobs continuously and accepts mediocre output from offshore vendors.
bad,"We seem to have the same discussions every few months/years with little to no action. Talks a good game but doesn't follow through. We talk about improvements and change but doesn't seem to be true support to take the actions to actually make the change."
bad,"Not a lot to say.  Juvenile working environment. Too many nosy people, some managers treat staff as if they were children.  Compensation not competitive. Although, some have the ability to manage their time with a flex schedule."
bad,"worked in upper management, got tired of the pressure to preform or be fired. Was told many times employees can be replace very easily if they don't like something. Upper management is only worried about themselves and their bonuses.  I learned not to work for a company like this., management stinks, but they do pay good salaries and benefits."
bad,Management was not trained well enough to answer questions due to this was a very short assignment that covered Medicare part D enrollment which starts in October and ends in December.
bad,A good starter job but would be a lot better if it had more advancement managers don't really have a set plan. Pay is good though and the co-workers make it enjoyable.
bad,"Positives:   "
bad,I decline to provide information about this employer. I dont want to tell you anything about this company because there is no reason why I should If you want to...
bad,"Work life balance is pretty good, with opportunities to work from home. Benefits are good as well. IWCS was just sold to Change Healthcare, so the purchase of McKesson shares is discontinued."
bad,"Each day is met with new challenges trying to help patients with billing issues.While staying on top of all the constant changes in the health insurance industry."
bad,There was never enough workers so there for u never get out on time! Very stressful with not enough help! There needs to be more than 1 microwave in break area! No air conditioning!!!!!!
bad,didn't work their long enough to know much about the benefits but wasn't a great fit for temp emplacement had layoffs in different depts. different managers
bad,"My wife has worked for this company for years, as far as I'm concerned the company does not reward their employees for their experience and dedication. My point is if the company would recognize the hard working employees by rewarding them fairly and quit hiring inexperienced people which hurts the companies production, so the employees that are dedicated to this company would enjoy there place of employment. The managers need to customize the needs of the department they lead and recognize the employees hard work and appreciate the dedication from their team."
bad,This is a culture of short cutting projects and not caring about the business system users.  The leadership is not held accountable and does not work as a team.  This is very much a negative culture and many people will say that they cannot help you and don't know where to get help.  My Director went as far as not providing office supplies and refusing to order any.
bad,"McKesson was a productive growing company in utilization management. A company that aim to please their customers daily. McKesson has a wide spread field of companies that operate in many different areas of the medical field. Referrals, case management, Utilization management department, and call center."
bad,"This place is pathetic! When you first get hired on they make it seem like a great job and it's ok to work but once the honeymoon is over than you are just another number. HR and management don't know anything and they just give you a 800 number to call for pretty much everything. They are very lazy. When it comes to benefits, setting up direct deposit and etc, they give you literally 3 different websites that you have to do on your OWN and good luck trying to sign on or find anything. They will not help you at all. There is also waaaay too much overtime. The job is work til finish but you might as well kiss your weekdays goodbye(especially if you have a family). Even without a family you still wont want to work as many hours that they give you. You never know when you are getting off so expect to work an average of 11 hours everyday. They don't care about their employees at all. They made billions of dollars last quarter and gave everyone a 10 cents raise. There was even an employee who was homeless and asked to transfer to an out of state facility and they told him no he has to be there a minimum of six months and he was already there for four months. Do not work here unless you want to make some quick pay with overtime to pay bills. You have been warned"
bad,"Management lacks ""cultural competency"" and the ability to manage diverse employees fairly. No additional comments allowed as per a signed non-disclosure agreement."
bad,This software was good. I had a chance to use it for my Home Health position and then the company switched.
bad,"Long hours of mandatory overtime so you never know what time you will get to leave. You get to leave when they say so. Warehouse is dirty for dealing with medical supplies. Management will lie to you. HR is hard to reach. If you have a problem corporate has to deal with, they drag their feet to deal with it and lie to you about it being taken care of. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,McKesson Specialty Health  has very abrasive Management that does not promote a Job Work/Life Balance.  They want people at their desk and count on out of the country contract employees to maintain their aggressive work life.
bad,Paragon management changes every 6-9 months and they wonder why the product no longer has traction.  Am on my 6th manager and 5th director in five years.  Processes are a joke and communication is a bombardment of 100+ emails a day. Off-shore resources are sucking the productivity out of the on-shore employees.  Morale is in the toilet in Charlotte.......but nobody cares.  Its all about the stock and the stockholders.
bad,"A very colorful place. Looks great sells the company. "
bad,"Not a fun place to work at. Besides good contract package, I dont think I would ever want to go back. It wasnt challenging, so my career was on line to grow myself"
bad,"McKesson Corporation was a great place to work. I received wonderful experiences. However, it was a very stressful working environment."
bad,The company closed... we were working with outdated equipment. Still processing EOB manually.... Radiology billing company of a local hospital in Memphis.
bad,This place is very unorganized and has a high turn over rate making too much work for each individual. Management does not support employees.
bad,"Very wide spread territory with a turnover every year or so.  Long hours every day.  Could have had more support from Manager."
bad,Leadership in Sales was misdirected and not engaged. Training was outdated and out of alignment with sales process. No real sales training.
bad,"I worked to prepare medications for imprisoned patients. It was like a conveyor belt, you could not talk, you had to concentrate on your counting and dispensing."
bad,stay busy all the time at least the pickers do I learned how to use the RF gun management ok long hours will be the hardest part of the job getting off is the most enjoyable
bad,"A typical work day is demanding. To do and get what is a 10 hour day or longer job finished in 8 hours. We are constantly demanded to get our deliveries correct, inventory our packages we deliver, use a software that is time consuming and make sure all drops whether they are wrong or right due to warehouse packing or our own mistakes delivered on time. We also have to deal with traffic, short to long drives between each stop. Unruly drivers, weather and pick-ups or returns by the customers. Each day is a challenge from the time we walk in to the time we clock out. "
bad,"While some people enjoy the factory surroundings, I am not one of them. I was never happy at this company. It's very hard work and I don't feel the employees are paid for what they do. You are expected to meet a rate, which is understandable, but sometimes just not possible. They also seem like they favor people, making it hard for others that deserve  promotion, unable to do so."
bad,"RelayHealth a division of McKesson is run based on the good old boy system.  Promotion and hiring is down on a basis of who can tap dance the best and not on ability."
bad,"McKesson bought out Perse, this is the same company.  My typical day for Perse is the same as for McKesson."
bad,don't expect to get a good raise. the company overall ranks everyone a 3 no higher than a 2 if your lucky. need more employees multi tasking is high priorty there.
bad,They have gotten rid of a lot of very good employees.  The lack of experience will come back to hurt them in the long run.
bad,"To large a turn around of employee's. Needs training for all employee's. None given. People are expected to learn as they go.  With such a large and well know company this is surprising. Software being used is needs to be updated.  Was built for McKesson 30 years ago and deal for new software feel through, so we are using the band aid method. This does not work."
bad,There some communication issues. Answers for the same question varies.
bad,"Far too much favoritism in that office! If you're not kissing butt, you will not get ahead. Raises are a joke and so far underpaid as appose to other companies doing the same thing. I have been there almost three years an got two raises and still did not equal $1! They are really slave drivers."
bad,A good place to work if you are willing to learn on the job. Offers good holidays and training.
bad,"When I first started working there the management was pretty good, the direction of the company was good and the focus was good.  Over time the focus has changed away from the customer and they want quantity instead of quality.  The employees are great people who all work hard and we have a great time together telling jokes and playing pranks on each other from time to time.  "
bad,"Lots of work for what you get paid, Managenment has no idea what they are doing. If you happen to get a manager or supervisor position - long hours and lots of work."
bad,Enjoyed working with this company on tight deadline assignments and need to put too much effort to complete projects in short duration.
bad,A typical work day begins with sorting reports and fielding customer communication. Pulling patient cases into my individual work queue and begin processing. Provide daily status updates to Key Account Managers and Area Business Directors.
bad,Get your experience and move on. There's no fast-track or ladder.
bad,start work by pulling orders avg about 15 to 20 miles of walking
bad,"Depending upon the division of McKesson you work for, the experience can be a negative one. I worked for them for almost two years and was appalled by the lack of teamwork, respect and overall emphathy given to employees in my department. There is little room for advancement and management is overworked, so they have little time for team building. I do not recommend McKesson."
bad,"Decent benefits, High turnover due to unbalanced work/life even though its stated they want you to have one, Management on the floor could be better, bring up an issue and 7/10 times it will get forgotten about."
bad,"When the VP that hired me left the new one disagrees with many prior decision; one being allowing me to work for our offices near Dallas.  Unable to re-locate to San Francisco for  family reasons, I was dismissed. "
bad,After 10 years with this company I was passed for many promotions I was highly qualified for. This happens due to managers and supervisors picking favorites to fill those positions. Supervisors and management dont follow dress code. Lots of flirting and not working. Supervisors pulled from outside the company with little or no training on the programs the employess support.
bad,"This company did not like the ""team work"" mindset for the employees."
bad,"Shady company. Bad routing on handhelds which you are expected to follow. Management are in another state so very little help from them if any. Pay mediocre, not worth the headache form the companies incompetence to do their job so you can do yours. They laid off all their loyal employees for no reason. So why wouldn’t they lay you off for no reason."
bad,"Management and HR seem to be extremely unconcerned with the conduct of their employees. I have had a representative of their company routinely harass me, physically threaten me, and repeatedly call me racial slurs. "
bad,They start you off at 13.16 and offers bonus if you exceed production but if you're new you're stuck using old equipment that's slow and breaks down a lot so it's hard to exceed production so you dont get the bonus.
bad,McKesson is extremely big and can be internally all over the map.  In general they preach positive things but they are not implemented in each division.  Mckesson is more structured toward Pharma.
bad,I'm glad I had the chance to work at McKesson.  I learned a lot while there and grew some too.  The time frame I was there was kind of a tough one and I think others would agree.
bad,i enjoy the job but the pay and distance to olathe has caused strain on my outside life and vehicles. Manager and employees are great people to work with however the distance makes it very difficult to make it on time with traffic and construction. an hour there and an hour home makes for really long days
bad,Allscripts was very difficult to work for.  They kept changing processes and making harder and harder to do our jobs.  They ultimately sent all the support analyst positions overseas to India.  I would not recommend this company to anyone seeking employment.
bad,"Nightshift part time is probably the best. Part timers will get benefits such as vitality, school reimbursement. So if you're in school and looking for a part time gig that pays well this is the place. However, nightshift full time is pretty bad. You have to work until the job is done, so usually you'll get up to an hour, hour and half ot each night which will be to about 5, 530 am. If you are a parent of small children stay away. The management team keeps trying to do projects to make the workflow better but it seems to not be working because what seems to be a 8 hour shift, we get out in 10 hours bad. Employees that barely do anything will get most the attention while the ones working hard are overlooked unless you are buddy buddy with management members. 2 20 min breaks, which management doesn't monitor, because some will go late or stay over. Managements communication is poor, they will brush you off or sound irritated when asking for information. It seems that confrontation is something that they tend to avoid until it cannot be avoided anymore. Management never takes accountability and tends to find a scapegoat for blame if the shift doesn't perform well. The company recently switched to a different healthcare provider called anthem and it seems to be worse than the old one. Also, once you have been labeled that's how the company will see you."
bad,"Worked as a temp and they do not value their workers or the temps. I worked under more that one supervisor and each experience was terible for different reasons, Supervisors do not received proper training and lack professionalism."
bad,"Work days were very stressful"
bad,"First time working at such a big company. It felt like managers were having to measure themselves against each other as to how ""AGILE"" they were, and wound up micromanaging things to death."
bad,After working for a huge company I would love to advance in position and pay grade. It seems like it is difficult when your only allowed 3 errors per month and productivity has to be at 85 or better. I picked 6000 lines per month and had 13 errors and got written up and now on final. I love what I do but i dont like the pickyness and politics and favoritism in that company knowing that its 10 to 1 more females then males in the management and employees.
bad,"All about the bottom line. They treat their employees bad and their contractors even worse. If you have a similar opportunity comparable to McKesson, take the other opportunity."
bad,The benefits and pay do not outweigh the stress and discomfort of work environment. Micromanagement and employees often feel blamed for lack of performance instead of working to empower and uplift employees to work together for a solution.
bad,They sent me to management training in FL but the ever changing direct management roles and constantly updating processes and unsure future caused me to leave.
bad,"Old style company in healthcare technology space with reluctance to change The company has a good old boy network that is difficult to penetrate. There are a lot of time wasting processes. As a technology company in Healthcare, they are well behind the times."
bad,It was a very poorly handled transition from McKesson to Change Healthcare.  Included where constant layoffs and poor implementation of tools and resources.
bad,"lack of training, Compensation does not match for the amount of work you do. Some supervisors don't have enough knowledge of what they do, you ask a questions and most of the time the response would be ""I don't know"". Mostly 'Micro' managing but lack of recognition."
bad,McKesson's wage was so low that one could not afford to have benefits and still bring home enough to live on.  No room for advancement whatsoever. Very little time off
bad,Loaded supplies in the AM and delivered them to accounts Mon-Fri.I initially was working for PSS which was bought by McKesson. Mckesson drivers were paid more $$ but the PSS drivers were never paid equally as the McKesson drivers were. Mckesson did put the PSS drivers on their quarterly bonus plan which was less lucrative than the PSS quarterly plan. They coud adjust that but not the hour wage because it would cost them more.
bad,"The work life, the job itself, the day-to-day is just fine, no worse than any other call center. The people I work for and the folks they report to are either totally incompetent or were put into positions they could not handle. If you ask any three members of ""Leadership"" a question, you are guaranteed to get three different answers, maybe four..."
bad,We were old the position was temp to hire until March. They let us come to work all day then called us after we were home to let us go. Unless it was a guaranteed permanent job I would never work for them again. The money is good but that is just about all
bad,"Worked as a medical biller within the organization.  Worked medicaid"
bad,Everyone was afraid of losing their job. Can I keep up with their averages. No advancement at all. If you were not fast pace you lose your job. If you didn’t have everything correct you lose your job. Not a good job to have.
bad,"You work hard for the money,  but if they purchase someone that will be in your territory be prepared for ""restructuring"" in which the left hand has no clue what the right hand is doing,  They set the guidelines for new territories and then disregard them when sales go thru.  If you are the ""new"" guy in an acquisition, as happens in many places...be prepared to unemployed soon."
bad,"people were very clicky here. work was ok, but the training was awful. tthere were advancments so that was nice. It was a good sit down job and you were appreciated for your work"
bad,"Worked for a small division relative to the size of McKesson.  The company is mostly preoccupied with meeting government/industry compliance and internal politics.  Managers are almost entirely concerned with how something will appear to upper management, and not what's best for the customer.  The company as a whole is just too big, and displays all the symptoms of an organization suffering from a lack of vision. The division I worked for was sold recently after losing a large portion of their customers to aggressive and well-organized competitors.  I was let go as a part of a Reduction-In-Force, but these were rampant for the last 3 years, making the culture nearly unbearable.  I realize I did not give the company a high rating based on what I experienced, but if you make the decision to work here, please be ready to experience a politically charged and somewhat stoic company."
bad,"Very large and financially successful company however, my experience was not positive. I had a manager that put me on plan three different times and I hit plan each time and was still let go. We had too many reps in a smaller market and they just wanted to get rid of me."
bad,i like my job and i like the people i worked with a nice place to work if you need a temporary job while working there for 15 months i was never late or had any time off. I have had 100 percent on my quality scores but i was still let go with no reason given
bad,"The work is extremely redundant and brainless. The pay is really good considering the work is nothing actually difficult, but it's nothing to support a family/higher tastes with.  Second shift does not leave until the work is done, so you could be there til 9:30pm or 1:30am.  IT management is EXTREMELY incompetent, so if things break, expect a lot of mandatory overtime.  Lots of incompetent employees and temps that stay much longer than they should.  Direct supervisors have a sense of compassion, but overall, you are just a number.  Higher ups and pharmacists are treated like royalty while material handlers are peasants.  Work life balance is non existent.  Okay for a part time job to get you through college, not for a full time career."
bad,Great people to work with and a caring environment.  Process driven culture with large number of locations and separate business units.  Many layers of management.
bad,"Unfortunately I was misled by the job description. The job was advertised as WFH and instead it was based 200 miles away from home and hotel stays every week. "
bad,"As a contractor you're days are numbered there. They are very unfair with how they handle situations. The management I had was very unprofessional. Walking around every two minutes micromanaging and asking are you doing you're work... I was apparently let go for a mistake I made and had apparently rectified so i thought? Was told I made this ""mistake"" on Friday and was told just be careful and you're good you're not going anywhere and then Tues there is the recruiting agent asking you to collect you're things and follow her out? So so unprofessional. Management were complete cowards and wouldn't even pull me into a professional meeting to tell me you are being let go bc they have no back bone. I would be very Leary of working for this company and using Apex as a recruiter. None of the management I worked with had professional attitudes and made the whole work lifestyle very hostile. Very disappointed to have had this experience with this top rated company. Just get hired on full time. Don't get as as a contractor bc they don't keep them after 45 days and they use lies as a reason to cut the contract short!"
bad,"Drastic measures are being taken to sell off the EIS business unit.  Indiscriminate, massive, across the board layoffs occurring impacting business sustainability."
bad,They hire you on to a team that they know they are going to move within a year. Within the time I was there I had three different supervisor/ mangers. One manger they hired on only lasted two weeks before she quite and went to another company. The AR team worked on a old DOS program. MDIV which they explain why update if it is working but it is not up to speed to do accurate work. The compensation is good for the region around there. The job culture they do a lot of monthly or bi monthly employee appreciation.
bad,"The culture was very much top down, and the management/leadership treated us like commodity resources. The job was not enjoyable due to the poor relationship with leadership, and unrealistic expectations. Ultimately, my business unit was entirely laid off and operations were moved to Canada."
bad,Reasonable pay and benefits. Horrible management. Very little chance of advancement. Many petty rules that treat the employees like kids.  Working hard will get you nowhere here. Everything is negative in this location
bad,"A day consists of inventory control related projects which can challenging however interesting. I have learned that although you have many years experience with company, more favorable people within management will have better chance to advance."
bad,Co-workers are great. The management is VERY poor. The pay keeps decreasing. Very micro-managed. I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy.
bad,"They have good benefits"
bad,"After 2 years at McKesson I have found that this company is living in the stone age when it comes to corporate culture, if you can even say that it has a culture.  This could be good or bad depending on which generation you are.  There is a huge generational gap here between the younger crowd and the older crowd.  About half the people here have been working here for 15-30 years.  That's great for job security, but not great if you are looking for an upbeat modern day corporate experience.  If you like to sit in your cube, stare at your computer screen from 8 to 5, maybe water your plant, and enjoy cat posters and other 1970's office humor, this is the place for you.  If you want to learn new skills, value good leadership, advance in your career field, or have any type of social experience at work then this is NOT the place for you."
bad,"Stressful"
bad,absolutely love my coworkers. Coding interesting cases on varied levels from Acute Hospital to Cancer Centers.  Disagree with management's unrealistic output expectations. Have personally heard non-coder manager refer to coders as slackers.  Reported to Human Resources but with no apparent recourse. Have respectfully submitted work plans and options without resolution. No confidence in current management.
bad,"Stable union job, long hours, management was decent. decent pay plus lots of chances for overtime. Job has college reimbursement but it is hard to go to school and work at the same time (nightshift hours)."
bad,Constantly pushed to take well over 100 calls in 8 hour shift. Multi-tasking to organize all disputes and issues while taking all the calls. No room for advancement. A lot of favoritism by management. Pay is decent and benefits are great but quite costly. Most all the employees were great to work with. Would not recommend
bad,"The Hardest Part of the job was dealing with management,everyday you go in its something new. you never get out of work at a decent time.standing/driving power equipment on hard concrete floors with  pot holes, just poor conditions to work in every summer the ac would break 2-3xs during the hot summer months roof would leak when it rains or a bunch of snow is on the roof. real dusty environment. @ the end of every shift blow your nose and guaranteed a bunch of black stuff would come out."
bad,The pay was very low. They would also treat us like we were children in school whenever you said something to a co-worker. They would literally shush you and you pretty much weren't allowed to do anything but stare at your computer and be quiet for 8 hours. They were horrible micro-managers. It was not the best environment to work in. You were stuck in one position and there was no way to really move up in the company. I felt like a robot while working at this company.
bad,Perform benefits and insurance verification. Insuring accurate benefits.
bad,"Once the CEO left McKesson Automation to go to another division, it was a revolving door of executives. Also a revolving door of employees. This might be a good place to work right out of college, but after a few years, it's time to start the job search."
bad,Typical bureacracy...don't ask what I think just do what you're told. Poor communications from upper managment to all levels below.
bad,work mostly on your own with small help from the department. co-workers were alright and the management wasn't that great. not that much room for advancement. definitely some areas of improvement.
bad,"Validated daily price discrepancy report, made pricing corrections. Loaded contract pricing and eligibility and responded to customer issues."
bad,Entered patient information to bill out in an accurate and timely manor.
bad,"I was employed as a coder and was not trained properly. Mckesson bought this company( used to be Persae) and the old employees rule the roost, they are clickish, dishonest and set up anyone who is professional and interested in doing a good job. I really hated the enviorenment but stuck it out. The local community college advises their graduated to stay away from this Pgh,Pa Greentree location."
bad,"I worked in PSL office for 3 months, the manager is INSANE.Took credit for everyone's work, total control freak, talked about her current divorce 24/7, discussed other employee's personal bussiness with other employee's. She is the only manager on floor so there is no support. No IT on site so if your computer crashes you have to wait for someone in another state to fix it.Can not do payroll ontime or correct. Would not be surprised if the whole staff walked out one day. I passed on 2 other jobs to take this and kick myself everyday. This is a shame, this company is a fortune 500 company and is ruined because of this manager. I was at my previous job for 3 years. Should have been a red flag when interviewed by her and all she talked about was her soon to be ex-husband and how she is a devoted Christian."
bad,"Work culture is political and uncomfortable. HR is not reliable for multiple reasons, I was missing a paycheck over 100 days. Senior leadership is not personable or interested in employee wellness or culture."
bad,AZ operations has tremendous potential.  There are in a thriving industry with clients that can afford to pay them handsomely.  But lack of direction has left them spinning their wheels and accomplishing little.
bad,I would never recommend any one to work at McKesson Medical Surgical because the managers don't know what they're doing and if you are not liked by them they'll try to do things to make you quit. They do not follow federal laws or guidelines.They are all about violating employees rights for example. They will changed your schedule based on performance scores which is unethical to do so because when you except a job they asked what shift would you like
bad,"Easy job management is not that great , they advance the wrong people , you will be taken advantage of if your a hard worker. A lot of lazy people and management never holds them accountable"
bad,"Management performed all required sensitivity training and boasted zero-tolerance for harassment, but ignored complaints regarding supervisor offences.  It made for a volatile work environment which led to the dismissal of several employees that made a stand against a tyrant."
bad,Lack of leadership and communication makes it difficult to work for this company. The leadership can also use lessons in Integrity. The position can be very demanding so one should plan on being married to there job with no incentives.
bad,"Though myself and many of my coworkers initially enjoyed the job, flaws emerge over time.  Negative criticism is common from management, who seem intent on assigning blame to even the most productive of workers.  By extension, hard work and skill go unrewarded and unrecognized, as favoritism runs rampant and promotions are assigned to yes-men and ""diverse hires"" rather than in consideration of ability or experience.  For example, no one over 30 is ever promoted out of a warehouse position, so older hires are often stuck where they are.  Overtime is also a constant problem; despite years of promises, it is never corrected, and the majority of employees eventually leave because of general exhaustion.  Management pretends to listen to their staff, but once someone catches on to the false sincerity, this eventually becomes more insulting than comforting."
bad,"The job required too much responsibility for each individual on the phone. The job was stressful enough having to search for proper coupons for medicines in addition to informing whether or not someone has been granted or denied benefits. "
bad,"Every day at McKesson starts with a brief team meeting and stretch. This works well because it gives the employees a general idea of what their day is going to look like. Most shifts are a 9-11 hours. Overall, there is not a lot of time for socializing with coworkers as you are being timed based on your performance."
bad,The company does not show appreciation for the hard work in which you put in to make the company successful. Would not recommend if you are looking for an equal employment opportunity unfortunately.
bad,"Company is very focused on two corporate goals: Profitability and order fulfillment.  There is lots that goes on behind the scenes to control products and limit availability to focus on customers who pay a premium, some of which borders on compliance with contractual obligations.  As aresult there is a lot of secrecy built in to the culture (emailing inboxes instead of individuals, off-the-record agreements between account mangement and order fulfillment teams, etc.).  If you can handle not knowing what's going on around you and reacting to the latest tactic to squeeze profitability, then it's not a terrible place to work."
bad,"As a Manager at McKesson, plan on spending 80% of your day in meetings.  you will work long hours to complete your work due to the amount of time spent in meetings."
bad,"For the most part management is bad.  They are clueless and incompetent and do not support their employees or the customers.  What matters most to them is what their numbers look like.  Employees are over worked and underappreciated.  "
bad,"Senior management has little insight (or desire to have insight) into lower level information.  Driving to goals without the follow-through to ensure that individual teams understand the overarching goal.  Very siloed environment.  "
bad,I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job is being a part of a team and having to interact with other people in order to get the work done. Its a very fast paced environment but being able to interact with others makes it much better.
bad,"This place has mandatory overtime every day and seems to take over your life. The work is constant and fast paced and it's a good job to have for someone that is working their way through college, but not for a long period of time as it will begin to wear you down."
bad,There is a lack of communication to the employees. They also under-compensate. This job is fine to get a couple years of experience but not a great place to have a career. The company has good benefits but lack in compensation.
bad,Very poor pay and to much high school drama. They have poor management that does not back up their staff. But they are stable from what it appears anyway
bad,Routed sales visited customers daily to replenish first aid items & clean first aid box. Also upsold new products informed customer about new products. I did demonstrations on new products.
bad,"I have enhanced my skill levels greatly whilst at McKesson, however, the environment was not conducive to a proper balance.  It is a good company to start out with but no room for proper growth."
bad,"Working for a software development company is demanding, but usually it's also invigorating.  Working for this company is demanding but the management culture is stifling. They measure based on opinion rather than metrics. They innovate only through the hierarchy. They don't reward creativity."
bad,"A large company that is slow moving with new technologies, even with smaller business units they are slow to adopt cost saving technologies and adapt to new security threats."
bad,McKesson isn't competitive on their pay and with people staying at McKesson for years and years there isn't a lot of room for career growth because people are blocking key positions.
bad,"Have been there over 10 years now and have seen the company reduce staff to a bare minimum so much so that we have so much theft in the shop. Workload for dispensers too great and expected to look after the shop, serve customers, dispense, perform health checks whilst documenting everything along the way with a pay barely above minimum and still barely above minimum after 10+ years service. Don’t see the cluster manager anymore as they have areas with more than 80 shops to look after. We used to have local managers who would come and roll their sleeves up and help us out for the day. Thinking of leaving."
bad,"Overall, the people and organization at McKesson are very professional and a pleasure to work with.  The compensation and benefits are competitive."
bad,Not a good company for people of color to move up in Conroe tx...but the pay is great and the work is okay but the women work harder then most of the guys
bad,I would rather not comment. This place is not a bad place to work. But I do believe that it could be managed better at the supervisor level. The people you work with are fun and funny! To be honest that what helps get the daily task done without losing your mind!
bad,"As contract employees they get no real job commitment for over a year. Also, there is no real trust in a contract employee even as a supervisor. The hard work gets done by the contract employee but they don't get the same respect as FTE's"
bad,"I enjoy working at McKesson, once I got put on another program, I feel more like an outsider. It's a nice place to work, but I'm contract, so, no benefits. Everyone keeps telling me it'll take about a year and a half to get hired on. I've been with them for about 7 months now."
bad,"Mckesson is about maintaining a Fortune 500 company status, its about revenue.  Employees are all stressed, pushed to the limit.  Pay is good but you earn every penny."
bad,Great place to work for mckesson not through any hiring agencys! other than that everything is great do not recommend remex to hire you through contract
bad,"Poor leadership, management did not communicate. As a contractor, I sat at my cubicle for hours at a time with no work except at the end of the month (4 days). Very strange environment, poor work ethic by most employees."
bad,I decided to leave McKesson after many changes were made with management and the job was becoming more stressful and lack of tools to do our job. (paper etc) Management was trying to cut down on cost but it was making it difficult to do our job.
bad,You are expected to stay at your desk and wait for Team Leads to come around to answer questions. Team Leads rarely came around so you were stuck in charts for long periods of time for which they held against you if you didn't meet your daily quota.
bad,"I learned a lot but with the poor management and cut-throat environment, the politics become too painful to stay long.  There is significant favoritism to the detriment of all."
bad,"Been here one year,  I always remembered  a good time McKesson. I was learning, enjoying, positive, respectful, at McKesson.  Amazing very friendly and very comfortable to work with and stress free. They do like to reward you for your hard work, so never think they are not watching your working skills because they are."
bad,"McKesson has the potential to be a career landing spot. It took a couple of years to receive 16-17$ an hour. McKesson has the ability to compensate employees way more competitively. Hours were fair, more overtime chances would help. My manager was great, but overall, the company lacked leadership.."
bad,"A lot of people with major egos from executives to management and team members.No chance for advancement if you're not part of a clique... no matter how devoted, skilled, and professional you may be."
bad,"This was once a great company, many missteps have made it a challenge to work for.  Culture is horrible, they micromanage every aspect of their employee's day.  Management are all ""Yes"" people, there is no creative thinking or innovation.  Morale has tanked in the past 5 years as there are constant lay-offs and no one feels valued.  This is so sad, as it was once the place to work, and people were fighting to get in."
bad,"First time I worked at a company that wanted to go out of business..."
bad,"McKesson Specialty turned out to be an exhausting, stressful, and uncollaborative place to work.  Most of the management was inexperienced, under-qualified, and/or unfair."
bad,I have started with the company a short time ago so I don't think a review by me would have much merit. But I can say McKesson does have many long term employees who love the company they work for and enjoy the culture
bad,I was working here through a temp agency. I was not full-time so I really cant rate the job because I was dealing directly with my temp agency. The place was well kept and organized.
bad,"Enjoyed the work, people are helpful and friendly. To be able to assist a client in securing a place on a medical trial is great feeling. Friendly management."
bad,"Where to start?  It's a job based on piece work,  numbers game, speed, error, favoritism. If the higher ups don't care for you or you, then expect to not have a job past 6 months.. "
bad,"MPCS is transitioning from a Mom and Pop shop to being owned by McKesson.  This transition brings many changes to customer service, customer focus, and customer care."
bad,"Answered patients questions to the best of my ability, updated patient's insurance information, entered insurance information if it was missing, faxed documents, did extra work that was required if there was nothing else to do."
bad,"A typical day at Lloyds would be to serve customers, stock shelves, date check medicines and GSL products.  Dispense and prepare medicines, keep the pharmacy clean and tidy.   I would also deliver medication to the customers. "
bad,It would not be a bad place to work if you knew what time you were going home every night. Don't get much time off to enjoy the holidays.
bad,A typical day at work can be stressful. I have learned from my personal experience why it is important to have great management. The management was very distant and did not build god rapport with its' staff. Co-workers were good people some tend to be filled with gossip. The hardest part was actually going to work. The most enjoyable part was leaving work and flexing during the week to get off early on fridays. 
bad,"This was a great company because it was flexible, pay was good, work from home, activities. Since outsourcing and so many lay offs/fire nothing has been the same. They only want people with degrees but those people never last more than a year and leave the company when they realize what the company is about. You have to know someone and its not what you know to move up. Tons of favoritism! HR says they are here for us but its all bull and funny when you stand up for yourself your the next target and out the door. Management doesn't have a clue with what anyone does. Everyone is so rude. I hate going to work everyday!"
bad,"Working at McKesson is a fast paced position with many changes. I manage the Accounts Receivable for 8 clients and 14 employees. Their positions are from charge entry, payment posting to Accounts Receivable. A typical day of work is many items to accomplish and not enough hours in the day to complete. This is my first experience working for a Billing Service; learning the nuances of each client and their specialty's has been the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of the job has been working with my staff. It's been a pleasure working with them; helping them to understand and grow into their positions ."
bad,"hard to move anywhere, unless you are in the ""old boys club""."
bad,"start at 9:00 pull truck orders then a skid of v.a. orders pull and confirm more truck orders alot of the employees are team orientated, management is ok but could use better forsight sometimes, not getting 40 hrs every week and not knowing what time you get off everyday and they want no overtime, getting everything completed correctly"
bad,good enviorment fast paced good training supportive bosses
bad,"The job itself isn't that bad. Pretty simple pick, pack, and ship, good benefits, and most of the employees are good people. However Management is inconsistent, immature, and unprofessional. If that were to improve this would actually be a real good job."
bad,My opinion of McK is skewed because I worked for PSS for 15 years prior to McK acquisition.  It was a culture shock to say the least and I didn't feel valued as a former PSS EE.  The position I had was taken from me and I was handed 'marching orders' in a totally different field with which I had zero experience.  The program I was expected to 'fix' was a mess and I didn't feel I received the support needed to be successful.
bad,"Learned new software programs, office politics and favoritism is the theme of the company. Promotion is almost non existent. The most favorable part of the job is being a supervisor"
bad,I was at McKesson for a year as a csr for the breastpump department. It was very unorganized but I understood my department was an expansion project. So I understood the confusion. I was just recently laid off and it was handled very unprofessional. It’s been over a week and I still haven’t even received the email regarding severance.
bad,"not so bad, it was a long drive towards concord daily from rock hill, almost an hour drive daily, just not enough pay to use all that gas daily.no so bad."
bad,"a typical day at work would be stress free, place culture is nice management need a little improvement the hardest part of the job must likely would be getting the proper tool to perform your job@ the most enjoyable part would be getting off."
bad,Very stressful place to work. Very few places for advancement and salary is low with even lower raises. The harder you work the more projects you will have to do.
bad,"I worked at McKesson for 6 years and loved what I did.  However, upper management did not lookout for employees and was more concerned with client attitude than with company employee well being.  If you didn't agree with Upper Management and voiced your opinion you were written up as being insubordinate.   They wanted ""yes men"".   I couldn't work and lead a team with the double standard."
bad,"The benefits at McKesson are quite good, and include generous vacation and high salaries; however the company has very regular lay-offs, making job security non-existent."
bad,"No room for advancement and very school yard like environment . Over worked, new hires were making more then vets. The only helpful management was my NYU team leader and supivisor. Poor training and I had to train all new hires to properly bill Medicaid."
bad,"For such a huge company, their ability to continually grow and change so quickly is truly impressive. They can engineer shifts from top to bottom with minimal issue. We're talking about thousands of employees who change gears when very few people like change. Great opportunities for advancement but upper management is pretty inbred."
bad,Coordinating product and vendors and transport at least cost in conjunction with optimal production.  Meeting the needs and ensuring requirements are met from the 140 employees on the lines to pack and load product to vendors in a timely fashion.
bad,Overall review of McKesson MediMart is that the environment is similar to a call center.  Never ending revolving door for employment.  Management originally was lacking.  Look over your shoulder until past experienced management was brought in to save the day.  By this time the announcement to close the division was made.  Too late to save the division.
bad,Good Company but bad management. Could be much better but know one is held responsible for there actions. They preach work life balance but there is truly no balance. no one wants to work 14-16 hour shifts.
bad,"Did not stay in NY a long time to really get a feel for the work environment. Enjoyed the work and people the time I did spend there.  Abusive new marriage, left after 6 months."
bad,Managed Care division has horrific management.  No consistency or accountability of management.  Continuous turnover of more than 50%.  Fortunately they sold this division off to an investment firm
bad,"A typical day starts with restock, then picking, receiving or the putaway of stock until the cutoff time for orders. Then we pack up the orders until the job is done. I've learned the importance of leadership and time management to the extreme upmost. Management is virtually not there and if so, turns a blind eye to the requests of key workers. A small percentage of co-workers help get the job done in a timely manner, while the hardest part of the job is working with co-workers who are content with being there all night. The most enjoyable part of the job is our ability to work with smiles on our faces despite the obstacles we come across."
bad,This place is riddled with unfair practices and people who move up based on who they know and what they have on each other.
bad,"Things are not very organized from a project level.  Salary scale is pretty low compared to peers in the highest percentile otherwise performance bonuses are pretty good if you manage to score a certain percentage on your review."
bad,"My typical day at McKesson is being tossed 100 files that need to be done with little pay. I've learned how to bill the insurance, correct claims, call the insurance and take incoming calls. The management is bad. No one is on the same page. The peopple I work with are great and they all talk about how bad the pay and they are stressed. The hardest part of my job is getting put on incoming calls so i cant get any of my files done. Nothing is enjoyable about this job. You cant say good morning to someone without getting talked to"
bad,Bad management and good employees. Not much room to advance.
bad,Initiatives are rarely driven from the top of the organization. Projects are tasked with no backing from upper management therefore many projects fall through cracks and cause frustration.
bad,"Leadership is neglectful of most supporting business practices and some key business practices Will not get too specific. For an organization that is constantly changing, the culture should be better geared toward excellence and mindfulness of resource engagement and best practices."
bad,"Benefits and rewards programs can be a plus, but low pay all around for the amount of work required. The 500 employee location is sectioned off into ""teams"", so if you get on the right time it feels like a family and it's nice the company regularly sets up team lunches around holidays and pto"
bad,If you cant keep above the set rate for your department then you wont be there long. And there are a hand full of leads and supervisors that are wonderful and willing to help you.
bad,"You start out hopeful filled with promise of progression, courses to enrol into progress, this never happens and are left in the same role for years without a pay rise or prospect of career progression. "
bad,"Lloyds is not a good company to work for, They do not support their staff. Just left to deal with anything that occurs, without managerial support."
bad,"I get to work. Start work and process patients paperwork. Then the company managers over the dept. that I was working for would gossip and say bad things and nothing good to the managers. Didn't appreciate my multiple managers at McKesson that are over 30-40 yrs old act like high school girls. One big reason why I left is the catty women and how they treat unfairly other women there."
bad,"is been long time and i did not have the chance to stay longer tome to put a summary or rate the company, so at this time i am not able to rate the company"
bad,I was hired in a 6 month contract position and  it took them over 2 months for them to give me access and training for the programs I needed to do my job. Ridiculous! Poor business management!
bad,"Too many moving parts, not necessarily in sync with one another. Although you'll be held accountable for the inaction of others. Great starting point, once you have enough experience to qualify it is time to move on."
bad,"the compensation at mckesson  is competitive however the leadership, short notice, relocation at the position I had made it unbearable. Their mindset was ""we pay you well so we can abuse you all we want"" and that kinda didn't fly with me. I enjoyed the compensation, don't get me wrong, but everything was just so chaotic."
bad,The manager at the data center in Nashville where I worked was ruthless and pushed you so hard to make her look good.  It wasn't a pleasant place to work and the operator's schedules were the most stupid I've ever seen.  Very unrewarding.
bad,Its ok. they are outsourcing to India now. They let go of the whole collections team and are about to let go of more. Gave them a notice until Mar/May of next year.
bad,"The one benefit of McKesson Corp. is that they offer good benefits, but pay is extremely low. Workplace culture was very similar to a high school, lots of catiness between employees."
bad,"Good place to work for, benefits and all. They have events that they hold at splashtown, family day, Halloween for the kids, McKesson Christmas Party. Always awards and thank you letters for your contributions"
bad,A typical day at work is busy. Training is not thorough and management at the head office is lacking. Workplace culture suffers because there is little to no support. The Most enjoyable part of the day was getting to leave the office.
bad,this was several years ago and I'm sure they have made several changes. open the building at 4am for receiving and the employees never knew when they were able to go home. there was no balance between home and work.
bad,Responsible for receiving and shipping product to customer located throughout the southern New England area. When needed I drove a box truck for them to deliver the product through their markets footprint.
bad,"Great place to work, but mostly contract very few full time opportunities. many different departments from customer service to registered nurse. growing company and very profitable company."
bad,"If you are interested in software, McKesson is probably not for you.  They are selling off their software operations. Within a year, your job will probably be gone."
bad,Like a call center.  Fast pace.  Training was fair.  Experience was good.  Not enough permanent placement for the temporary help.  The hardest part of the job was feeling like you were not an equal.  The most enjoyable part of the job was what I learned.
bad,I was a contractor and worked hard to get nowhere. A typical day would be showing up to hundreds of emails and loading the information into a database. And responding to emails as needed.
bad,They were a good company starting out with 12.25. but when its time to give raises there were to about it. They didn't treat everyone the same. some people got away with more than others.
bad,corporate job with good people and good benefits but low pay even for those with good performance and years of experience. Biggest disadvantage is salary
bad,"Off-shore team is growing. FTE not being replaced in USA, but on off shore team."
bad,This companies patient services team would excel if the companies accounts receivable team would perform job duties in a timely manner.
bad,Cut in hours no OT allowed. Barely able to make 40hrs a week. Job can be stressful at times. Benefits is not worth the lack in pay.
bad,"My job was promising as far as the people we assisted. I worked over the phone with prescribers, delegates, pharmacies, and patients. I educated the reason the medications was registered by the FDA, and why it is crucial to abide by the ipledge guidelines for the safety of all patients utilizing the medication."
bad,It's a typical day at work with little chance for advancement.
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful, lack of communication and management is very unprofessional. I learned more about the back end of billing insurance carriers. The hardest part is trying to keep up with their high expectations and to keep a professional attitude with their lack of. Most of the co-workers are nice, helpful and pleasant to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting nice people and the perks you can take advantage of for cheaper insurance."
bad,"MED3000 was being purchased by McKesson at the time that I left there, so to say McKesson lacked integrity would be unfair. MED3000 lacked integrity. The reason I left was because I was treated inappropriately by a female manager. She was dishonest and manipulative. She was trying to get me to help her fire my supervisor by bullying and manipulation. I was promised a position of supervisor and a large pay increase in order to participate. I could not go along with this behavior. It was very stressful and went against everything that I believe in. I brought to the attention of Human Resources but the manager was not reprimanded. I could not work under those conditions, so I resigned."
bad,". My typical day at work is slow, the receiver got to scan every box one by one with its scanner and put a label on it and place it on a pallet afterwards."
bad,This job was supporting a large sales team nationwide. I enjoyed working with my peers but will never support a sales team again.
bad,"I work at a call center in Port Saint Lucie. The Training for my position was completely unorganized. Everyday I get on the phones I am lost and just guessing at how to do my job. My manager says she is ""OPEN"" to new ideas, but she just casts them out before you can even complete your idea. Overall... The company is good. But my specific location and position is horrible. I am completely unprepared, and underpaid. I feel like I am wasting my time there every single day. I really just need to find a job in my career......"
bad,Horrible place to work. No support for contractors. Managers micro-manage every little detail.
bad,A typical day at work is constantly being relocated to a different work
bad,"Well........was not there long enough to form an opinion, got on well with the customers. Taught myself."
bad,"When you work for a company that you enjoy; getting up for work is not a hard task. I want to be able to go to a fun environment, but one that keeps me busy from the beginning of my day to the end. McKesson is not one of them... I can remember working on a service level report with one of my team mates, it was the most enjoyable moments in my position in product management. The amount of detail and research it took was hard but the final results made us proud."
bad,"Start time is 8:00 am. Each day is a different task and this part of the job keeps my from being bored, from posting correspondence to researching missing payments I have learned more about insurances and how to adapt to patients needs and concerns than I thought was possble and believe I have only hit the tip of the iceberg."
bad,"McKesson would be a great place to work, however the engineered time standards are not for everyone. Understandably, the customers are very important and the pharma products need to be shipped and delivered on time."
bad,"Depending on the department you work for, depends on how flexible your time is.  Overall, it's a good company.  Can be demanding & stressful.  Low compensation for required responsibilities."
bad,"Metrics, work from home,  process improvement and accomplishment, my department  supervisor micro manages.Great insurance, and incentives to enable employees reduce their insurance payment"
bad,I didn't work there for very long because they were in the process of being purchased (small company at the time) and the work was running out so I left.
bad,"Luffeys provided stability and foundation for me to start the beginning of my medical driving career.  At the time, this company provided for my family."
bad,be prepared to be picked on may be good money but the hours were horrible and dont expect to rely on the transit system
bad,"Great atmosphere but since its so big and there is so many employees which means more supervisors, you kind of get the short end of the stick when it comes to communication."
bad,"Management is incredible on my team. They are very leniant with time off as long as you work 40 hours a week, they are also very open to letting you make up time when issues arise, but the pay is not enough. State min. wage is 12 an hour, I have been with this company for almost 5 years barely make that. You don't get the opportunity to move up in the company as often as you should or deserve."
bad,This company gets A list performance from C list employees. The culture is quick and hard charging. You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.
bad,McKesson is a very fast paced place to work. They do not pay the greatest but the benifits are beyond belief. You start earning vacation on day 1 of employment. They also do lots of activies involing the entire family.
bad,like I said is a great place to make money but too much roles and one of the supervisor is acting very strike a lot of people quit because of him being too much
bad,"Departments do not work well together, although necessary. Hindered efficiency. fdsfdsfnsdsdfk shfskfnskfsfkjehfnesjkfsnkfsfnskf sekfesfsnfjskefnesjkfnskfjsn"
bad,Great introduction to accounting and ability to advance higher. Able to take courses to further study of new computer program installed. Work was very face paced and quotas and deadlines were expected to be met. Researches and charge offs needed proper authorization. Very fast paced environment with lots of perks.
good,"working there was fun an good experience"
good,It was good while I was a young man but someone who has a family and got stuff going on in your life it might not be the place for u. time does not mean nothing to them and they don't stand by there principles
good,This place started off as a really awesome place to work. Management changed and things got shady and the place was miserable to show up to each day.
good,"•	Verify patients pharmacy eligibility for a specialty medication"
good,"Worked in temp position, management was all over the place. They were also Temps. Here today, gone tomorrow. Had over 200 people competing for 5 permanent positions."
good,"Checking on overdue PO's update my vendor's data base regarding back order items.    "
good,"It was good while it lasted. Just like any call center, you get in and do what you can do, make that money and move on. Definitely not a place you want to get stuck at. Not sure if they changed the rules but they would actually try to keep you at your desk/at work pass your scheduled shift to compensate they calls still coming through and even have people telling you that you can't leave."
good,Depending on the work load each day could work between 8 to 14 hours a day.The communication level was not there and management was unprofessional
good,"Co is not modern"
good,"A typical day at work was receiving and making outbound calls to people who owed the company money. I learned how to read an itemized bill and the codes for medical labs. The management was not involved, the peers were helpful."
good,Wish there was more room for growth within the company. i enjoyed my coworkers. I did alot of data entry.
good,"working for a corporation. I was part of a small division each time I was with them. they did not care about the small person, a typical fortune 7 company....they wanted to make money for the elite."
good,High Turnover due to No real job security. Also lacks innovation seeing as how there were others who were let go overnight for suggestions that would benefit the employees and patients but looked at as a threat from upper management
good,"Great opportunity but management played favorites and were also racists. The higher ups weren't very professional and weren't willing to help when necessary. A plus in this job, they served good food although it was expensive. & had a fun time when ever we weren't working."
good,"My day would be spent reviewing accounts as to whether they need to be called, what they account balance was."
good,"It has good standards and all targets are achievable, all is good, but constant shortage of staff gives more pressure on other workers, work atmosphere is very tense and stressful."
good,"18 year employee, retired because management is still wet behind the ears. Good old boy promotions, not based on experience or knowledge. Male managers talk about women as objects especially their breast or bottoms. Not diverse, no asians, no hispanics, maybe 2 african americans."
good,"The management were not helpful  and provided a stressful working environment. The management were only invested in other management employees the ""little people"" were overworked and treated unfairly."
good,I have learned a lot about billing and coding that I never knew as a private citizen. I have made and lost friends and miss them. I have worked with some good people .
good,"Upper management lack of training creates confusion and uncertainty and a somewhat hostile work environment."
good,"I was laid off from McKesson due to poor management and protocol. Our department had been closed. We handled sending out supplies for residents in nursing homes, other types of facilities and at home. Unfortunately we didn't get paid on everything due to mistakes made for many months."
good,I processed payments for clients using their Quick Books Software. I prepared invoices to be mailed to the clients. I deleted certain accounts into the computer and filed invoices and cheques according to the client's information.
good,"I worked as a patient care coordinator, the pharmacy is very poorly run. You don’t get trained properly and they are constantly understaffed. Work gets repetitive and boring. They are very strict and on staff."
good,"Good place to work, good benefits and life-work balance for a company of this size. Good coworkers but poor middle management and lack of communications within the organization."
good,"We were always short staffed and we always had to do mandatory over time . So it got very stressful. But there goal was to always finish the job and have a orders out on time , which talks good about the company overall. They just needed more employees."
good,"The best word for this work culture is passive-agressive.  Painful lack of communication- lots of meetings where you leave and ask yourself,”Huh? What is this new change mean in terms of who is responsible and when and what do we do now?”"
good,Like drinking from a firehose.  Non stop demands without consideration of work/life balance.  Management is stressed out and doesn't get the support needed for success.
good,I enjoyed the flexibility to work remotely and the ability to work with many different teams across the country in all time zones and not just stuck in one office somewhere.
good,"Not going to say to much. Just that management doesn't treat you fairly & you are just another number to them. Benefits are good, but also seem to need to use them more then most jobs."
good,This place is crazy the management is poorly ran. I learned a lot working there. Hardly no workplace culture. The workers there are amazing people just need a better management team
good,"Corporate office is located in San Francisco near BART.  McKesson is a leader drug distribution and commited to excellence.  Beautiful building and office on Post Street. Too much work for low wages, however, an excellant experience if one desires to be exposed to cutting edge health care law."
good,They need  to take more time to train their new employees and the management  really need to step out and help out their employees and stop showing favoritism in their employees.
good,I enjoyed working for PSA before all the Merges that have taken place.  I have been with the company 5 years and they have switched management four times.  There is no structured organization for work duties and they are not rehiring when employees leave the company.  This is adding additional duties that are not feasible for one individual.  I would also like a job that sticks to the work hours given.  I don't mind changing times when needed but staying til 9 and 11 at night with no security is unsafe.
good,No room for career advancement.  The employees are great - there is a lot of camaraderie between depts.  Most people are very friendly & willing to help.
good,It was an okay job. The pay was good and I loved the people I worked with. Not a very good work/life balance. It was very laid back but started getting more stressful due to change in management.
good,My experience with McKesson was overall good. This position revealed how to master the skill level in order to properly help with rejected claims and building patients.  I appreciate the time i was given at McKesson and look forward to the future.
good,"Lots of pressure to produce results and meet goals that seemed to have been pulled out of thin air. Some of the managers had absolutely no idea how to do my job, much less be helpful when I ran into an issue. The people who got promoted were usually tall, thin and good-looking. The people who did the best work were rewarded with much more work.  It was a relief when I left the company."
good,"Company is behind on the curve possibly due to acquisitions and adoption of parent company values and culture."
good,"Some of the company sponsored charity activities are self gratifying,ie 4k walks around a reservoir in Boston to raise money for cancer research and making get well boxes for cancer patients."
good,"I was thinking that working for a company that has been in business since the 1800's I figure I was going to have a great learning experience. I found out that there is not enough staff, those who leave are people that have been here for years, Supervisors are over stressed out and this is how they stress their employees out too...its crazy one hand does not know where the other is."
good,"night time shift "
good,"I have worked for Lloyds Pharmacy for a number of years now, the company itself does not give you any support if you need it. When you have a problem with staff (grievance) Area managers will not help you. Pay is shockingly bad. "
good,"McKesson security department was filled with like minded employees. "
good,"They will tell you that you are going to be there a certain amount of time, make it sound like you are guaranteed a full time job for contractors, to not worry, and at the end of the day they will fire you with no warning."
good,This project involved me working independently from home and sending in my designs via email. The people at McKesson were very friendly and positive and were always available and ready to help with any queries I had.
good,I was a temp here for almost a year. I had no idea that they kept temps so long so if you are one don't expect to go permanent any time soon. They laid me off and laid off a lot of other temps as well. Even my manager was a temp. It is just sad and they treat the temps way different than the permanent employees and I worked in e doc department and they treat you like slaves and all of the permanent employees are snitches bc they dont want to lose their job. My only advice is to get hired on here direct or don't work here at all. There are many older people and there is not that many attractive folks who work there so don't look for that either. Kind of weird. Management in my dept. really could care less about you. They moved me from something i was excelling in to do something I had never done and they laid me off. Set me up for failure. I had no choice in the matter.
good,Lack of quality communication with management and poor employee moral.
good,They will pile on responsibilities until you can not manage to see the light of day.
good,"Can get lost in the shuffle. Depends on your manager, most do not care."
good,A typical day includes coming in to people talking for hours and not being productive.
good,"McKesson has been steadily outsourcing is various IT functions for the past 5 years. Taking any type of IT job means long hours, no recognition and eventually losing your job to someone in Mexico ( T-Systems ) Puerto Rico (HP ) or the Philipines"
good,"This local Distribution Center branch has major issues spanning multiple areas such as management, staffing, consistency, and downright favoritism. Enjoy working well over 40 hours a week at times, while working nights, therefore sacrificing any semblance of home life."
good,"if you the type of person that stands up for themselves, you will not go far in this company, they love yes men.  The work standards are set a little high so they usualy get rid of good employees and keep ""friends""."
good,"ok job when your in a pinch.  no career.  people were great, fast high volume work.  weird hours, never know when your going to leave.  good amount of training for the position.  nothing bad to say."
good,"Management at this job pretty much sucks. Its probably 2 managers out of all management that's shouldn't be a part of of my opinion of management. This is a buddy, buddy management team thats probably the main reason that management here is no good. Employees know more than management."
good,"A typical day at work, management was not good, no pace for advancement. Very laid back company. Nothing hard about the job. Good lunch with cafeteria. Good location"
good,"The weekly goals are very unrealistic and the Managers bird dogged every movement. The stress level is extremely high leaving every Rep in fear of their job. There was no room for a bad day ... If the weather was bad, you were still expected to meet your goal for the day. One the positive side, one learned very quickly how to maneuver numbers and  save certain sales for those “bad” days."
good,work at mckesson was good but it was just an temporary job. it was nice but stressful attend old patients and if we cant provide them card  they started crying and some suicidal calls.
good,management lets certain ppl get away with murder. If you have a problem with employee they want do anything to stop the cause of the problem. Management nosey and want to now all your business. Talk about their employees to other employees
good,"Long hours working on a loading, and even longer hours be hide the wheel driving all over king, Snohomish and Skagit counties. Work culture is nonexistent, every man for himself."
good,I like my job at McKesson. The management is poor and if you are someone who wants to waste potential this is the job for you. You make the company a lot of money but the compensation is not well.
good,This sounded like a decent place to work in the beginning.  Things went down hill fast.  Rampant favoritism and tons of people that should have been fired long ago.  Work ethic means nothing and there is little to no effort on work performance measurement--so the slacker next to you is likely going to get the same meager raise as you that has been busting their butt.  Normal water cooler talk is about who do you think will be leaving next.  I think the adage about people not leaving the job but leaving bad managers was written about here.
good,Very unorganized company and very misleading. You are informed of one job description that you will be doing but really only use you for a customer service position.
good,"They Luer You in, like a carrot at the end of the stick and  sell you on a large company that is inapt in supervision. They put too much emphasis on their team leads to run operations ."
good,it was a great company to work till 2007. I would not recommend to work here But I must say it was abpleasure to work with the ladies that I did work with.
good,"Mckesson is a call center that is very faced paced, stressful and revolving door. Management had their favorites, gossip, clicks, and a revolving door."
good,"Ive worked here for about 3 years and as all jobs they start off great and then the longer you stay, the more you see management has no clue how to conduct the business."
good,Worked from 6am to 4pm. Worked in groups and did out bound calls.  Management was inconsistent with work flow and did not respond well to inquires.  Was always told to check with other people that did not know what to say.
good,"The job was pretty good, The managers suck and they don't have much knowledge of the system. The head supervisor is always in his office and doesn't interact much."
good,The final nail in the coffin for me staying at the company was the policy to change Paid Time Off to a a policy that time off had to be pre-approved.  The consensus was that time off was not going to be approved for more than one person.  There would no longer be 2 weeks of vacation.  There would be approval of vacations longer than 5 days.  We decided to start calling it Conditional Time Off.
good,"More than half of the workforce are long term contractors. McKesson employees have great healthcare and PTO benefits. Contractors do not and the subject of being brought on as a full time McKesson employee is avoided by management.  There is the option to advance into other positions, but still remain a contrated employee."
good,"RemX which is the agency that hires is horrible, management also has a lot of things to work on as far as “Hiring within” they’d rather go out & train someone who isn’t familiar with the program, rather then promoting someone within the company. This issue was isolated in a new program I might add"
good,no work life balance.  Compensation is less than required for the amount of work and availability required. management totally refuses to hear employees.
good,I worked there twice once being hired on as a customer service rep in a incoming call center position no room for advanement in this dept. The second time I was not provided a great expierence at all almost a year
good,"workers are controlled by an automated system that takes out the human factor! "
good,"No day was typical"
good,"great job, kind of have to be a quick learner in order to keep up with the previous workers. benefits I hear are great if you have any children. Life balance isn't quite there since I worked for 2 1/2 years. I resign due to poor lead skills. Upper management was great and reasonable to listen. Great for a first time job to gain knowledge for other warehouse's. long hours and overtime. I like my job and the work place, but I could not tolerate a lead irrational behavior and work ethics."
good,"Fast paced , good benefits and family orientated . Job requires you to be on your toes majority of the time , just never know what each day may hold ."
good,"Overall a great company to work for, healthcare is changing rapidly and McKesson has a strong influence with when it comes to government regulations."
good,"I enjoyed working with my colleagues and having fun working together."
good,Very interesting work and good training received in dispensing and counter service explaining drugs and help to patients. Unfortunately the company is not the best for staff conditions. Mostly short staffed and very hectic working conditions without any breaks. The hardest part of the job is  not being able to think as every minute is taken up with swapping jobs to serve customers without any support. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of helping patient find a suitable solution to their problems and being able to gain knowledge of medical service.
good,"I worked with chemicals, in a controlled laboratory. My co-workers were very nice and worked well under pressure. The environment although busy was very well tempered. The hardest part of the job was leaving due to not being hired full time."
good,"Your typical week consist of the follow:"
good,"Open and see what my practices have sent to me to work. Start my 360 excel spread sheet, and review open accounts, that need payment. Help manager with old system, and review accounts for refunds, and or balancing accounts. Review coding on all that have come back not paid, and call on accounts. Post and adjust accounts."
good,Always work to be done and overtime is required. You will learn to operate all types of lifts. Co-workers are great.
good,"My current position entails me to call patients on a daily basis to give them information on their upcoming appointments. Also, I enter in post infusion feedback reports in the database after each patient is infused. I have learned to prioritize my workload and to do it even at the most stressful times. I've learned to be patient and calm with patients who are ill and to do as much as I can to make them feel comfortable at our clinic. The hardest part of the job is to keep it interesting, as it does get repetitive - especially when there isn't any growth. The enjoyable part of this job is my co-workers, they're down to earth, friendly and outgoing which makes the job easier."
good,Typical day at work = Professional and busy
good,Mckesson is a very fast pace environment that requires alot of phyiscal movements throughout the entire shift. I have learn to pace as I work and focus on the customer and product not just the numbers.
good,Towards the end as they were gearing up to move to a new state of the art facility they were taking on so much work for us that could easily of been handled at the new facility but had us working up to 20 hrs a day. I also personally had alot of problems with some of the ethical choices a few of the managers seemed to not have a problem with.
good,"No room for advancement, racist management, nosey co-workers."
good,"I loved my job when I was working there. But it became very clear ""favoritism"" was bad but worse was they would rather have someone fast than accurate. Being a medical warehouse their priorities are messed up completely. Turn over rate is terrible staff willingly admit that they don't really warm up to new people because they don't last."
good,The average manage needs to move 5 times to become a leader in a distribution center.  This leads to good people that do not want to move being stuck in jobs that do not fulfill their full potential.
good,The company has exceptional health benefits and HSA. When I was employed there they had a benefit for good health trends. You could earn points and they started with $1500 in HSA bucket.
good,"McKesson, as a whole, is relatively successful; however, this particular division is not employee-oriented, which has resulted in many employees leaving as early as completion of training period.  Salary compensation is considerably low, compared to comparable companies in the area; although, benefits are competitive."
good,"95% of employees in Scottsdale are contractors including the supervisors. They promise to make employees permanent but after a year its a rare event, even though they have you assist new hire training classes for someone who is likely to be your replacement."
good,"Falsification of work progress numbers."
good,"If I had any advice for anyone joining or still at McKesson is the company is going through a lot of changes make sure you are on time. If you do that you will be a happy employee, also be prepared to deal with the lack of leadership from supervisors, but the people such as colleagues are great as long as your a team player."
good,I was temporarily employed through a temp service and the overall environment was positive and productive. The opportunity for growth and permanent employments is possible
good,"I have heard that mckesson is wonderful place to work.  I felt this way for over a year, until we received a new management team that is not for the patients.  I have 28 years experience in health care, patients ALWAYS came first, I feel my management team at mckesson does not follow in my beleifs."
good,"Management was unqualified. Supervisors were unprofessional, making inappropriate advances toward women in the work place. Favoritism from management. Great pay and benefits. Run of the mill factory, everyone was laid off in January."
good,"The training was unorganized and the internet and their internal programs were always having issues."
good,"The most recent manger in the warehouse has limited experience with both supervising people and warehouse work. The hours vary so you can never make week day plans. If you need to miss a day, using PTO, for a prearranged appointment, management gives you the cold shoulder. Skills are required, but training is not given."
good,"Upper management never quite got the product I worked on. It was a conglomeration of different modules they bought up from different companies and McKesson never put the effort into fully integrating the modules to work well together. This was business decision as such integration would be considered overhead and could not be tied to revenue. Ultimately, the product lost ground in the marketplace and McKesson abandoned it."
good,"a bunch of political gibberish masquerading as a call center."
good,This is a good place for some people. You can move up in the company if you know the right people.  You can get stuck in the same position for 20 years if you don't.
good,"It’s an okay place to work. Management never gets better. Benefits are probably make the stressful and complicated work environment, worth it. There are a ton of management changes and process changes happen entirely too much."
good,My experience at McKesson was a double edge sword. The company was great but management was a nightmare. Extreme micromanagement and department politics- too much to bear.
good,"good work experience if you like the field of work, or trying to staying the field pharmacy or shipping and receiving. Job security was not secure and they only gave good positions to whom the liked."
good,"I love what I do. I am helping save someone's life with each medication that is picked and shipped out. so I absolutely love that but the hours are ridiculous. Start time is at 12noon and you never know what time you're getting off due to the work volume. Its hard to plan anything when you NEVER know what time you're getting off work. But other than that, I LOVE WHAT I DO. Oh and the management sucks. Putting someone as young as the manager there and they get a big head about running a company when in reality they know nothing about what they are doing and have to ask other employees what to do that's not a good thing."
good,McKesson is a very busy atmosphere to work in.  Upper Management is typical in that they can only see the big picture and don't realize that it is collection of pictures that make up that whole.  As a result unnecessary cutbacks in the wrong places and personnel layoffs.
good,"As a whole the company is good, but they could be great.  Amazing wealth is generated that doesn't trickle down to the hardest workers delivering results.  Fast paced environment with good training.  You manager can make or break you here, many Cliques. Culture has pride in the healthcare an wellness they are delivering, Hardest part of the job is advancement. Many careers are stagnant."
good,"Very stressful job, and management does not appreciate the hard work that is put in by employees who go above and beyond their from what is required of them."
good,The turn around is to often . I would not choose to go back and work their . can't discuss much more. I need a job that can hire full time instead of contract
good,"Fast paced, stressful . Cooperation not always there. When a group of us were let go, I felt blindsided, and treated almost like a criminal. The company seems more interested in profits and their bottom line than their employees."
good,"Why am I forced to answer these questions."
good,It's a good company but bad management. Work schedule is unbearable 12 hours or more daily. Unprofessional management lack leadership skills. Need more than 1 shift.
good,"Layoffs coming soon in 2018 "
good,"good place to learn the basics of the entire revenue cycle"
good,No matter how hard you try you never get the recognition you need from management. people are often promised advancement but then are overlooked. work hard and keep your head down.
good,"I worked for McKesson in Maine and in Oregon. The Maine office had 400+ people where as the Oregon office had 8 or so people. Very strict, little to no advancement. No incentives."
good,"I worked with a business unit  that followed none of the protocols of the corporation.  The current management structure could benefit from additional listening and interaction with front line workers. The mid level managers and the front line workers are striving to make a difference.  This makes a stratified company, with people working to improve with no synthesis of goals."
good,Great pay but be ready to sacrifice time away from family. Basically got tired of traveling to 3 states. Need to make sure you have reliable van or truck. Heavy lifting required and flights of stairs a must. Be ready to use your own gas money for daily trips.
good,"Petty management "
good,"Difficult to disrupt the status quo or act as change agent due to ingrained bureaucracy."
good,"This job was very much sit in your seat from 7 to 3. There was not cross training and room to advance was almost non-existent. In the seven years that I worked for this company I found myself canceling weekend plans to get jobs completed in a timeframe set forth by management. The medical billing, cash processing was time sensitive, but it was really more of a last minute time crunch. Better planning could have made this a more productive place to work."
good,"McKesson sold off company and then APH was ""formed"" and is now an independent Nurse Advice Line. Management has many issues to get in line.  It's a great job from a nurse point of view, but very unstable from a business point of view. Mandatory overtime has been required in the past."
good,"The culture of the company has changed with evolving management styles that no longer focus on client and employee satisfaction, but instead on vaguely defined KPI's and goals."
good,I assisted patients with all of their insurance and insurance card needs. also provided access to onsite nurses available to patients with certain illnesses.
good,well McKesson could have been a lot better if they had good management but sadly at the time I was there they was going through a lot of changes.. but I hear they are much better
good,personally didn't feel secure not that I was a bad worker just always felt stressed. I believe that was due to management. started doing activities to kind of get employee more interactive here and there maybe monthly bases 1 activity.
good,"Duties includes Implementation calls for on boarding new client from pre-go-live stage to go-live.  Once thing for sure that's constant is change. Patience and thinking outside the box is critical. The hardest part of the job was maintain holding people accountable. The most enjoyable part of the job is the learning from some of the best IT associates in within the organization,"
good,"McKesson was a great place to work, things changed with all of the layoffs, work became very heavy and at sometimes overwhelming, management leaves something to be desired, with the new supervisors and management being hired, they can be a little bit power hungry. Certain department have little room for growth, and discouraging, but if you want steady employment with out worry of promotion, McKesson can be a great employment opportunity."
good,"Training OK, feeback poor, compliance impossible.  Instruction differ from supervisor to supervisor so it's hard to know how to deal with policies.  New phone program made it hard to complete customer service."
good,"Learned more about the medical field and insurance policies."
good,This was the most horrible job i ever worked. There is no work life balance. Start at 8:30 AM and not off until 9- 1030 PM. Its very hard to get a day off. Management dont care you or your family. All the want to do is work you work you and work you. They have the worse attitude ever and they love to talk down to you. The leads dont help there team to get finished. They sit around all day talking on the phone. Management likes to sweep serious issues under the rug. Lots of harrasment and racial issues being swept under rug. They create unsafe environment for the employees. Its a very under paid job. They make billions of dollars in a quarter and pay there employees $11.40 a hour. They only thing good about McKesson is the benefits. The turn over rate is worse than McDonald's. They are very inefficient. Very high stress environment. No breaks after 8 hours. And very unsafe warehouse.
good,"My trainer was very nice and detailed in training. It was easy going and it consisted of stocking, rotating, inventory, pricing  and cut ins"
good,No additional information to provide at this time other than the work like balance is not deemed as important in the scope certain departments.
good,"Daily stress to overcome continual poor software quality and deliverables through customer support representatives.  Management thinks ""they"" are doing a good job, so addressing the root cause of customer angst is not addressed."
good,The company in a whole is huge. The training was horrible they had one training class for over 300 people.  The management was okay but not very helpful. The hardest part of the job was sitting on hold for 2-3 hours and not having any thing to do to multi task. The most enjoyable pert of the job was the hours.
good,large warehouse  lots and lots of walking long hours plenty of overtime witch is mandatory and the people are hard too get along with
good,"not employee friendly, management needs to learn some people skills, the pay is lousy. The workload is above and beyond daily expectations. No fun."
good,McKesson is a great company to work for. Its hard t find them hiring without a temp service involved. Overall its a wonderful company.
good,Worked here for 8 months. You never know when you will be getting out of work. The management is horrible. I once for from 2pm till 5am and they told me I couldn't leave. That was my last day.
good,good company with good intentions but management is horrible.
good,The management in the Overland Park location is very poor. The higher management seems to have it together but do not see what the local management team is doing to employees. 
good,"Typical day at work was to work on reports. Check eligibility on client s new accounts. I learned the responsibility of work  for 2 persons.  The responsibility  of making deposit to the bank and to applied payment to the client accounts. this was an offsite position. Main office was in Fresno and position was in Modesto."
good,This division did not seem to work as well as the other divisions of McKesson. When it comes to paying expenses they are in the stone age. Nobody there is happy and it shows by plenty of attitudes in the office area.
good,"nothing about this company makes you want to be there. The style is from the 1950's, the recognition is minimal. The pay is lousy."
good,Working overnights doesn't provide enough work life balance. No communication between staff and upper management. Management doesn't provide adequate help when necessary.
good,Managers lack respect for people. Very little room for advancement. The company is great to work for but the moral of this place is in bad shape. Would not recommend if trying to advance or grow
good,Years ago this was a great place to work. People cared about you and tried to make a difference. Now all the good is gone and no one cares about anything but themselves. You have to love it when they change management.....
good,"McKesson is the largest drug distribution company N. America. Not many know about this company. It had its headquarters in SF, but due to cost  and space constraints, they recently moved to Dallas. "
good,"Process and schedule deliveries - ensure patient therapy - address all patient requirements"
good,"Not my cup of tea!! Making scripted calls all day was just too boring. The managers are robots and individuality is not acceptable. Working at McKesson was like being in a cult. Group think, group act!"
good,Good Old Boy Network still exist even though they say they embrace diversity and inclusion.  Great ILEAD/ICARE principles if people would just follow them and not just be plaques on the wall.
good,It’s a small company with a high over turn rate .your going to be doing a lot of walking at a pace in a gloomy warehouse and you can’t leave until everything is done so expect long hours .they have a 8 point system for the whole year so try to not have any emergencies .some people are nice others have a attitude because they never can keep anybody .they do have a program called vitality that should help work your health insurance down which is nice . They will tell you anything to try to keep you but I don’t think it’s a good place to grow .
good,"Working at McKesson was great because of my co-workers. However, the hiring and firing area was scary--I did not feel secure. There was not a lot of opportunity for advancement; and the pay did not equate to the duties performed or compared to other companies, etc."
good,"Pros: You have SOME great and hard working people there, the overtime (for the go-getters), the starting pay was fine, training in different areas is available pretty quick, the music selection for most nights kept you moving and grooving, and they feed you on special occasions (and it was pretty good!)"
good,"Glad I quit and went back to school. The typical cubical job that pays $10 an hour and expects the world from you, but when you need time off good luck."
good,"Hardwork only matters if you know someone...wait, let me correct that,  if you knew someone, hardwork didnt matter."
good,"After the move, there were many layoffs and work was passed along to other employees.It was an overall opinion that employees were paying for the new building."
good,This company is extremely busy and very stressful!!  The atmosphere and benefits were decent.  Pay was very low.  Overall I would work there again if the pay was better.
good,"not the most comfortable place to work. managers do not have an open door policy, very stressful, employees do not work together. not much room for advancement. pay is very low"
good,Good part time job if you have the extra time. Lots of travel and not much pay for the travel. Compensation is good if you can do the work in one day and add in mileage.
good,"Sedentary desk job."
good,Job is stressful. No advancement within the company. Management isn't concerned about our well being. When an employees quit no one is every replaced.
good,The security group was where the flaw was for me.  Records were not updated so I struggled to learn the environment and the trainer completely sucked.
good,"Limited opportunities for advancement. Promotions are not based on merit. If you are not on management's short list, you are looked over when advancement opportunities come open."
good,"I enjoyed my time there but when the environment becomes toxic and upper management does nothing and HR does nothing..."
good,its a job.  Terrible management.  Its a fast paced job and that part was great.  The hours are good but the atmosphere is horrible.  Very bad working environment
good,Was a great work place at one time Then they started adding more bussiness to the warehouse and not enough workers and been going down hill since then
good,I worked at Mckesson through a temp agency. the temp agency was not as professional or helpful getting any of the 40 employees i was assigned at Mckesson with in obtaining anything we needed in our positions.
good,"Companies can have great structure, but choose the wrong people to carry out the foundations on which the company was built on.  Managers don't value people. Without reasonably accommodating workers, the overall goal of the organization will not prosper.  Just as the law provides provisions and mandates non-discriminatory practices from disabled and protected class workers, so should all employees be allowed to work in such a way does not cripple the work-home balance.  It's called life!  ""Let em work, let em live"" applies more than just on our highways, but also in our corporate world.  That's all.  Thanks for reading."
good,"the hardest part of this job is getting hire from contract to perm. the workplace culture is great, the training is awesome 3 week Medicare training program."
good,"So much drama and favoritism, terrible management, they have great benefits and pay well but you have no life outside of work, 12 hour days are a normal thing and if you're second shift in the LUM department you work what they tell you to work, 13+ hours a day sometimes and still expected to be there the next day at usal start time."
good,"My time at McKesson was not bad, but the training was a little stressfull. I learned more when at was on the actual floor. My co-workers were great to work with."
good,"No projects in the pipeline and CRO not valued in Research sector."
good,Projects and opportunity for growth lacking for the CRO; SMO focuses on SSU and lack in maintenance.  SMO prioritizes number of studies opened in Network over patient enrollment and data quality.
good,"People are good work expectations are not realistic."
good,"A typical day at McKesson for me was travel expenses reconciliation for six managers.  Accounts Payables, answering phone, filing, calendaring and setting up travel."
good,A typical day at McKesson is good based on what is going on in the DC. Employees can't be properly managed if the managers aren't knowledgeable. The most enjoyable part of the job is the check.
good,"Fast Pace, Warehouse Environment, Constant working, Minimum break influence, Mostly hot inside due to weather outside, not very well management or pay."
good,McKesson has employees who enjoy to cause trouble. I was releived early through my job because of a Manager named Michael who enjoyed to go and massage all younger girls shoulders or backs for them as he flirts. Even though he was a 69 year old married man. He favored woman over men which in any work place their should be no favortism.  I tried speaking upper management and they would do nothing. I wanted to be part of this company but looks like that wouldnt happen.
good,"McKesson is a very progressive company to the point that it fails to reward employee appropriately and fails to keep exceptional employees."
good,Working there was very hard with the 1 hour commute to work day-in and day-out. The night-shift made it even harder to get some sleep. Social life would be executed due to the fact that you had to work the night shift. People that work there are always full of untruthful assumptions. Life is hard as it is. working here made life just a little bit harder.
good,Nice to work on customer centric projects. The timings are very flexible as long as we meet the deliverables. Client project has good architecture that I enjoyed more about.
good,"largely understaffed and underpaid with an ever increasing work load in poor conditions with pathetic rates of pay when considering the long hours , legal responsibilities, difficult customers and methadone patients."
good,"very nice enviroment, very nice people around, only thing is that parking really sucks and you have to park pretty far so you have to arrive atleast 15 mins before scheduled shift."
good,"McKesson is a fairly good company, but the position I was hired for requires to many extra requirements and not being compensated for. For example-you scheduling up to 30 different Doctors offices  in which can have up to 3-30 doctors in which you are required to schedule for and each Doctor requirements are different for scheduling there patients"
good,not the best place to get sleep or a life .co workers were all back stabbers..really nothing else to say about that. company rates you on your productivity
good,"A good job as a stop-gap or if you want to earn a little extra money, but by no means a career.  The pay is typical for the Treasure Coast, which means not much.  However, the benefits are generally pretty good, and managers at the Port St. Lucie office give the illusion of caring. "
good,"hard work, very detailed. overall decent experience. good way to interact with people if you are on the road. decent pay and good benefits."
good,Contracted through the state of IL.  Program did not start and was not ran like it should have been.  It did end up saving the state of IL money but was cut after five years.  In retrospect it probably was a waste of tax payer money.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is customer service.  I enjoy making  sure customers are happy and getting the  results they want. There is no hard part of the job when you enjoy what you are doing. Having over 20+ years in merchandising every situations are different and each one challenges me in positives ways as far as the results that I achieve. I meet and discuss with the customer first to see what  they would like to have done and tell them how I plan to get the results.
good,We are in process of merging with another company. so there was a lot of pressure on our team. There are great mangers that understand people and deadlines she does not. she ran the team like she was a dictator
good,Job security being lost as this company is offshoring many job roles/duties.  It appears as if they do not take pride in the American worker.
good,I had a fun time working for McKesson. The manager in my department was really personable and understanding. I was a temp employee there both times I worked there.
good,The hardest part of my job is not being able to provide helpful information to my customers and the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I helped a small business owner thrive.
good,"Worked there as a contractor. Was promised to get hired directly, however they gave me a one weeks notice that my contract will end. Was jobless and sent away without a reason. Management could use more work."
good,"Disconnect between corporate, business unit and employees."
good,McKesson offered great benefits and compensation benefits.
good,"I enjoyed coming to work everyday and enjoyed keeping the ""flow of the everyday office life."
good,"Okay so if you are going to work for McKesson you should know somethings before you go into it. I have only worked at the Winchester location so speaking just from that experience. This company expects a lot from certain employees and will make sure they get that. They return the favor with great benefits and great time off. You start with 19 vacation days(paid) and all major holidays off(paid). Starting salary for all Material Handler 1 is $11.50 a hour you will make $13 after 18 months there. "
good,On of those jobs that u end up selling your freedom to. Wages are good but poor manegement. Strict guide lines favorable to the company only in many aspects. Many changes that its hard to keep up with policies.
good,"A typical day at work consist of running daily audits, scheduling for my team, creating new documentation, and training customers on new technology. I learned how to effectively us Micro Soft office products, level 2 certified on Excel. I also learned how to run proper audits on my team, schedule and run my own training's for large groups."
good,A typical day at work. overall good company if you get into the right business unit.
good,Good part time job good hours for a part time job. Flexable hours 
good,Worked early mornings answered inbound calls from individuals asking questions about the Amgen patient assistance program
good,"I received lots of education in the medical field, the co workers i have was awesome. the hardest part of the job is knowing that the company can lose their contract at any time. The pay wasnt good."
good,"I received and calculated deposits from insurance companies and patients, then posted the payments to its individual account."
good,"I've herd the Anchorage DC is very different from other around the country so i can only speak for Alaska.This is a great job to have! the pay is good, the boss take alot of time to know and understand each of his workers,they wrk with you if you have family issues."
good,"Office atmosphere run like an assembly line, high turnover, learned the entire process of medical billing. My co-workers were friendly but there wasn't much interaction. The hardest part of my job was having to act like I was in every position when other people weren't."
good,The division in which I worked consisted of mandatory overtime (up to 13 hrs per day) with no regard to an employees personal life or needs.
good,"Flavor of the week management style, but quickly pulls together during times of crisis (also called management by crisis). Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you are having a lifesaving impact by getting pharmaceuticals to people in need. Lots of opportunity if you are willing to relocate."
good,Small office with nice people . Communte is sometimes 1 hour with heavy traffic. Management too busy to interact or know of individual contributions. Compensation needs to be reviewed.
good,"Worked a dailey work list vaired from day to day. I learned how to multi task and priortize. The co workers were friendlyl, understanding and willing to help. The hardest part of the job were the changes that were made and adapting to them. Thephone calls made to the insurance companies to retrieve money."
good,"Received English and Spanish calls with patients concerned about dr bill, I learned alot about medicare and medicaid and all other insurances, my co-workers and I were a team and worked as one, the most enjoyable part of the day was when I went above and beyond for a patient"
good,"Mckesson is a great company to work for if a person wants to get down into the ""trenches"" to help patients or customers recieve their products,accurately and in a timely manner. There are many oppotunities to learn to operate power equipment,work in different departments, and to work a variety of shifts."
good,"The job was easy, and fun. Fellow co workers were very friendly and helpful. I guess because management wasn't so much. My only problem was when I asked for information from them it was no sense of urgency."
good,Originally worked for US Oncology and was bought out by McKesson. Rough transition and was told we would all remain with the company and were laid off shortly thereafter.
good,Job was challenging to learn as there was no training provided for my position.  Lack of help with taking care of customer issue with a mentality of take your time and it is ok if you dont know how to do anything after working there for several years.  Unfair management treatment as associates who don't come to work or don't work or sleep while at work is never dealt with and the workload is shifted to the ones that do work.  Pay is not great for the stress and job you do and there is lack of management communication.
good,"This is not a great place for growth. There is favoritism, the employee morale is low and the turnover rate is horrible. The skills that are learned for this job is not transferrable if looking to move to another department or job position."
good,"My day starts with fridge temp printing off eps sorting out what dossettes that need doing first "
good,"Over the 15+ years I have seen them make some bad decisions from computer programs to deciding to come in a get rid of entire teams at a moment's notice.  There was also a problem with them not disseminating important information in a timely manner.  However, in general, they were a good company to work for."
good,"So I work in the Specialty Pharmacy of McKesson in Irving, TX.  I sit in front of a desk and type.  When I first came on there was overtime, but now there's not.  And management doesn't communicate with it's employees at all.  No advancement opportunities, especially for contract workers. Not to mention I've been on contract for 8 months with no outlook on getting hired."
good,"It was a consistent route, with the ability to open accounts to bonus. There were spiffs on various products which was great incentive. the hardest part of the job was other reps selling in your territory and  manager availability to receive approval for quotes to make deals was a problem."
good,Gathering and reviewing patient billing and medical information to determine if the patient’s diagnosis qualifies and products required are covered. Gaining authorization for services. Handling coordination of benefits to ensure claims are reimbursable. Operating according to the guidelines of the Federal Health Care Program. Working with carriers to ensure coverage of medication on behalf of the patient.
good,Very good benefice but in term of money taking home it's not the best . One need to work super fast to earn a decent pay but it come with a lot of issues
good,Lots of bad software designed by nurses and other clinicians with no software development experience.  The clinicians get the majority of the promotions and good projects
good,Pay good advancement poor job promised to bosses friends rude sick request got points if call or mgnt denied.out of work association got good jobs work hard shut up
good,"McK has a long history and much to be proud of.  That said, it wasn't fun to work for a company that people only knew about because of the opiod epidemic."
good,"McKesson is a great company from a products and solutions perspective. A lot of very smart, talented people work there. But the company has frequent reorganizations that increase anxiety and greatly reduce job stability."
good,It was a hard job but rewarding. The pay and benefits were good. I worked in a union warehouse and I believe the benefits we received were thanks to a good contract
good,"When I first started at McKesson I loved everything about it and tried to refer many of friends. Then the longer I was there I realized they will not accept anybody you refer because they don't want to pay you the referral bonus or just because they don't like you enough as a person. There is no chance for advancement in the Middletown location unless you are a person who constantly tells on people all day long, that is the only way you would even have a chance to become a lead. Management is horrible, every Warehouse I've ever worked at the DC manager would try to show his face whenever possible even if it was just to come out walk around and say hi or pack a box and have a conversation with the line workers. At McKesson you don't get that the manager sits in his office all day long the only time you see him is when he's threatening your job eating the free food in the break room or smoking a cigarette out in his car. Employees have asked him several times to start showing his face more and showing he cares what we have to say, every time he would say he was going to cut his work down so he would have a chance to step out of his office and see us and then another couple months will go by, getting nowhere. Their equipment is some of the crappiest equipment I've ever had the privilege of driving on they spend more money on the mechanics that come in and fix it every day than what it would actually cost to get a new or gently-used machine. In 2018 we were the number one DC of the year. Do you know what we were rewarded? Hot dogs and a t-shirt. Yeah this really makes me want to"
good,Looking for more of a work/life balance.  I’m hoping for a position that doesn’t require 80 plus hours per week.  I’m also receptive to a company open to creative technological solutions that makes sense for the business needs of clients as well as the call center itself.
good,"I enjoyed the flex-schedule, but I wasn't with the position long enough to truly give my 100% opinion of the company.  I relocated 4 months after accepting the job offer, as my husband was transferred.  I do know that compensation was far lower than local billing practices, and  scheduled on-board training was not completed as initially offered.  I was thrown on the floor, instead, to shadow with multiple teammates.  None of which completed a process the same, and SOPs were seldom followed."
good,i liked the people that i was working with but in the end it was starting to take a toll on me emotionally. People had their favorites and if you were not in with them it seemed like you were not valued.
good,"too much work with very little pay, unorganized work plan, no appreciation or recognition for the good qualities even there are  difficulties involved in the work"
good,Mckesson hires leadership who does not know the program that they are to be leading. Expecting team members to train the leadership instead of hiring the qualified current team members.
good,"ROI is prominent. Communication among various departments falls thru the cracks. Acquisitions run smoothly. Executives and lead physicians are receptive to new ideas, management is not."
good,"This is a good company to get some experience and they offer benefits with overtime pay.  But, career advancement is hard to come by and people are promoted who may not be the best in their position."
good,Great camaraderie with the co-workers. Not good management and non-existent work life balance.Could have been a great company except terrible management.
good,"While it may not be true in every office building, the particular building I worked at was extremely toxic. No one was happy and thus, it made it hard to be happy with my own work. Management was severely lacking as well, with no real direction and just a lax attitude about everything, including the material we worked on. Numerous times, the managers even went as far as to tell patients who were calling in about bills that they were being ridiculous and scolding them for not knowing absolutely every detail of their insurance coverage or how billing is supposed to work."
good,"Med300/McKesson had great benefits, However the pay was not satisfactory at all for the degree of work that was expected. The management was questionable."
good,"I was with McKesson for over 30 years and got laid off in 2016.  This in itself should speak for the lack of job security.  Other employees were very nice.  Most management came about because of the ""it's all in who you know""."
good,they micromanage you and set you up for failure! I wouldn't recommend anyone to apply to Mckesson! There isn't free lunch. They work you to death. They expect you to compete against one another since its all about ratings.
good,"I have gained a lot of knowledge of how to process medical claims, resolved patients issues and complaints resolving them quickly. The hardest part of the job there is none, resolving a patience concern is a pleasure. The most enjoyable part of the is knowing the patient was well token care of from beginning to end."
good,"Management wanted to have staff work with very little training."
good,Fly by the seat of your pants methodology.  I prefer a more structured approach and so this does not work well with me.  Friendly people for the most part.
good,It was a good place when I first started but due to poor management we (EIS) were later sold. The buddy system was in place with the management so when they failed at their job instead of letting them go they just moved them around to a new position. This ruined the company.
good,Management makes the environment feel like you are working at a car sales lot. Very results based. The permanent employees like to remind you that you are a temp.
good,"The company is focused in production, this means a lot of work, they pay is little and there are not many opportunities for promotions."
good,"Recently, McKesson has made some drastic changes, and started staffing almost exclusively from their Scottsdale, AZ office. Congratulations for them for having the talent pool there, but dont step on the Atlanta folks on your way out."
good,working for this company is a joke the hours are longer than scheduled everyday and the managers didnt know what they were doing to moral of the employees .
good,"it was stressful, and if you are a contractor it sucks because you won't be notified when you're assignment will be done one day you'll have a job the next day you can show up to work and not be let in the doors because your badge was inactivated only to be told you don't have a job anymore"
good,"Most of the work has been sent overseas, and the people left that know their jobs are overworked.  This is not very stable work environment for the employees."
good,"review aging for multiple fire/ems clients, resolving outstanding balances and file appeals. I learned a great deal about different insurance payers and rules per state. There is not a very good communication between supervisors and regular employees. Working with other regular employees is fine. The hardest part of the job is being micromanaged. The most rewarding part is knowing I made a difference for the fire and ems clients."
good,Completing basic administrative tasks as per assigned. Was not given difficult tasks to be completed so there was not much to be learned in the position.
good,"Depending on where in the office you work you'll either love or hate it. The employees are wonderful, management could do better. Sometimes they do nice things for the staff which is obviously a bonus. Its a good filler job, long-term isn't so bright. You always learn new things and its fast paced. PTO is great."
good,"The employees are generally unhappy, there were never enough amenities to keep the morale high. Basic items such as coffee, water and platers were not provided. Breaks are over monitored and if one has pending bathroom issues I ow;d not recommend this job. Bad communication from top to bottom as well leaves employees ""hung out to dry"" in stressful situations"
good,Long hours sometimes 14 hour shift. Overtime is great but your life just consist of work. That being said I came at a time with poor management which makes my opinion a very bias opinion
good,Unfortunately they do 90% of the hiring with a staffing agency and your contract can be up to 18 months. So no PTO or benefits for that time. The hours are anywhere from 5 am to 5 pm and you must be flexible
good,If you like no work life balance than this is the place for you. Poor management poor hours im not sure how much more i can say about this place but poor!
good,"Although it has great benefits, your life belongs to the company. Its a 13 to 14 hours out your day. I hardly see my family, no upward mobility although highly desired."
good,McKesson is a great place to get a start and grow your career.  Advancement can be difficult as job titles and organizational structure are very rigid.
good,went to splashtown the other weekend for a company function. a lot of overtime. work life balance is non existing. you never know when you will get off.
good,Fast paced and steady work. Not for everyone. Management not always where you need it. Employee's not always friendly. Pay to low for the amount of work performed.
good,"Was hired to AR but was more like Inbound Customer Service.  Had to take inbound calls all day.  There was little training, just put you on the phone to take payments over the phone"
good,Good Place to work but too many re-orgs and changes. Career growth has slowed down/ is stagnant. Depends greatly on what Project you are on or your Manager.
good,"since working for the company, ive learned how to manifest, double check, pick and pack. they are very open to teaching you new things. there is only one thing that I have to learn now and that is how to drive the forklift."
good,"Most everyone gave their best to keep this division alive, yet with insurance and medicare reimbursement reduction, it was near hopeless.  Therefore, doors closed end of 2015."
good,"On a daily bases I was in contact with the person, the insurance co., workers comp., auto claims."
good,"Great Company and Management in Analytic Department. Major Layoffs though, so its great if you stay... longevity is a 50/50"
good,"DM only takes care of non Union people."
good,McKesson is a good company if  you are looking to receive school reimbursements. McKesson does a lot of event for the employees
good,Unloading and loading trucks and picking orders fast paced enviroment heavy lifting Shipping and Recieving and Quality control
good,Good company to work at but the turnover was vast due to pay rate for the jib that had to be performed. A typical day would involve an influx of customer calls that needed to be resolved in timely fashion. The explanation of services provided would need to be provided and billings forwarded. There were times when this became tedious and very overwhelming.
good,"Company really does not care about people, despite what they say.  The management in SF looks at you as nothing more than a cog in the wheel while they take outrageous bonuses while laying off thousands."
good,My assistant supervisor was the backbone of the entire department. She knew her job and was always willing to help. Upper management like her boss always took credit for what she didn't do. Long hours and pay was less than $10.00 per hour. What a joke. Who can survive on that income. Benefits were great and affordable.
good,"Often very hard to get a decision from Senior Management on projects, process changes, etc. Goals often not clearly communicated."
good,The long hours not a set schedule to know when you were actually going to go home you could work well into 12:00 a.m. It was a nice job but not for me.
good,"There are many positive reviews for this company and, don't get me wrong, this is a great company with a very impressive portfolio of services to the healthcare industry from pharmaceutical product logistics to advanced information systems. However, if your career ambitions rest on advancement in the profession of Accounting keep looking. "
good,Mckesson is very diverse and has continual training. It is a nice place to work. Mckesson has a lot to offer if you are interested in working as a customer service representative.
good,shift work nights mostly all about the numbers .you get two twenty minute breaks regardless of how many hours .I left do to the stress created by first level management
good,Management kept changing not enough hours and pay was low as well. Never was a work friendly environment and conditions were fairly low.
good,"Constantly churning executives.  Have to keep finding new positions to keep job safe.  Have to keep proving yourself to new executives, making it difficult for advancement."
good,"They love to Temp-to-hire. A great environment with great people. However, dealing with Temps and HELPING them grow, isn't a strong hand."
good,"Decent work environment, casual clothing is allowed which is a nice perk.  All the caffeine you can handle.  Some very smart people working there to learn from."
good,Pushing a product that is not ready for market. Management change not appropriate. Upper management not in touch with on site tasks. Employee relations strained and pro management. I am the third person to leave in 6 months in our group. Could be a good company with a little care.
good,Recieced the position wheb i felt everything was going wrong for me then i informed my supervisor that i was expexting was expecting and was told the very next morning through email that I was being let go. This was at the Mississauga office.
good,"Long Hours"
good,"It has good hourly wage and benefits package, but there is no room for advancement unless you want to move out of state."
good,"Nothing special, just a warehouse job. You did your job, went home, came in the next day and did it again."
good,"Good company to work for, but I need a better work-life balance"
good,There was not much work. Was there for lotus notes migration to outlook
good,"Instead of being rewarded for creating ideas to improve work flow within the team, you would be accused of time wasting and told to get on with it. This would continue until a month or two later when the team leader would come up with the same idea themselves and be hailed a genius for their amazing insight. Very hard to feel good about heading to work there."
good,"The company as a whole is mediocre. "
good,"Large company"
good,"Shoddy management decisions often unnecessarily led to strenuous, stressful work environment."
good,"I learn something new every day at work as i deal with different types of poeple and types of drugs/medicines. I learn how to deal with various situations and how to handle them well. My co-workers are lovely which makes me enjoy working. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers when you cant help them, eg, out of stock of something."
good,Good company to work for team work employees. Relsove patients problems. Work well with coworkers. Hardest part of job tell patients we can not resolve issue will have to call them back with answer to problem.
good,"There is no typical day at work, some days are slow and we only work 7-9 hours while others are slammed and we work 12-16 hours. I have learned a great deal about the workings of a large warehouse and also a lot about how one should not be run."
good,"Great place to work if you didn't have to work with a inebriate Facilities Manager.Moody,Moody,Moody,hung over."
good,sometime work overload was an issue. Seems as though there was never enough time in the day to accomplish what needed to be done. You had to stay on your toes cause you never know what would happen during the day that would create a project that needed to be done by the end of the day with only an hour to go before the day ended.....
good,The shift is hectic for the first two hours in order to get all orders completed and to the shipping wing for the trucks departure. Then the rest of the night isn't as hectic but still on a tight schedule to get all orders completed for the night. Management is great when it comes to get everyone where they need to be for business needs but need to work on helping out the individuals who want to advance within the company. The hardest part of the job is working 10-12 hours five times a week and the most enjoyable part is working side by side with some very interesting people.
good,"The pay was good at this job, but the employee are not good in the department I was in. It was very unorganized and dis-functional."
good,"~Typical work night includes managing production of work area, while keeping up with other areas to maintain a balanced workflow. Making sure shelves are stocked for order fill and making sure affected employees have the tools and supplies they need to complete their job."
good,High skill set and pacing made job high stress at times. Co-workers were loving and caring. Job has a positive impact of customers lives. Best higher level management I've ever been in contact with.
good,"Hardest part of the job was the insane amount of hours, being on your feet the whole time, and no time with family."
good,Love  my job and what we do for patients. The downfall is poor performing leaders are left unaddressed. Inappropriate behavior is not always addressed. They are more worried about being sued then they are about addressing poor leadership abilities.
good,"Inclusive – diversity is welcomed and appreciated"
good,"Mckesson had it going on, slowly but surely. It wasn't until Change took over that things well changed,for the worst. Mgmt only cares about their money, which is distributed amongst them only, giving each other thousand dollar bonuses and cent raises to employees. Flexibility is probably the best things here."
good,Lloyds pharmacy Mckesson are a good company to work for. They offer opportunities to do new courses that allow you to develop in your career. This has helped me reach where I have got to today
good,"They will have you running around the place like a chicken with its head cut off. Very place, with very not as much space to acquire all of the new employees they are rushing in."
good,"very difficult world of pharmacy with ever challenging and unrealistic goals, wheel constantly being reinvented . Filed restructures every year did nothing to improve morale or confidence in the senior team"
good,Good culture & teamwork with same level employees. Management is supportive. There are internal opportunities to progress on your career. Job can be stressful sometimes. Lack of new systems and latest technology.
good,"Upper management was continuously changing during the last 4 years I was with McKesson Provider Technology. There was know clear goals and mission communicated to employees.   Company looking for areas to cut expenses. (i.e.. cut, sale, layoff - Departments. Buildings, Employees)"
good,I love working at  Mckesson is a good company it has good benefits but the management is very pool after all I’ve got to learn a lot of new things Met know people that turn into family I love the benefits
good,I wish the training was better the trainer they had left in the middle of the day training us and never came back and McKesson did not know what to do or say to us
good,Does not stick to their word of assistance with finding other employment once the assignment is over.  No response when trying to make contact.  Employee concerns are not taken seriously.   Most concerns were with management whom seems to be protected not the other employees.
good,Just ended up with an a hole supervisor that had something out for me. I didn't do anything wrong but she must've told the company I was working through something because after 6months they called and told me my assignment was over  she didn't even know as much as I did about the job
good,"I worked here as a temp. I really liked it at first. Pros: very nice coworkers to work with, pay, overtime. Too many micro managers and meetings. No good."
good,"The place is okay to work, if you dont have a family other than that its 12's 5 days  week so its taking a toll on my family."
good,the manager runs the place like a dictator he shows favoritism shows lack of respect for others in my opinion is not a good manager at all mediocre how is there 15 years work for this manager for 2 the whole time that I was working there he was trying to get rid of me one of the reasons I was better than he was and I made more money.  McKesson not the company used to be.
good,"Programmed in SAS to output drug utilization statisitcs."
good,"The production was steady and the work environment was very laid back, but the management was very poor. Management showed favoritism and was not accepting of your home life."
good,"McKesson is decent place to work. They pay well at the analyst level, and there is opportunity to move up. The company is going through changes, which is causing a lot of work to be outsourced or relocated to the Irving, Texas office."
good,"Work is repitious constant calls, must adhere to breaks and lunch, metrics sometimed unrealistic, more about clients than employees, stressful, my work schedule ws good, however mandatory overtime"
good,"•Responsible for packaging medical equipment/supplies to ensure that none of the orders would be damaged during exportation."
good,"	Worked with multiple priorities in a fast paced environment in a fast-pace environment."
good,The people were great. I worked for this company back in 1998 for 3 years and back then it was awesome. Things change as the company grew. Then after relocating to Florence from Lake City I went back. I grew bored and really unhappy with sitting in a cubical for 8 hours. I am a people person and need to interact with them.
good,"liked the tool, good cafeteria, management needs help, heavy documentation, too many meetings. need to work together more. kept cutting back on areas of automation"
good,"When my product was sunsetted there was no attempt to place the department within the company, and there were plenty of jobs available."
good,"It opened my eyes to another side of the Medical Field, that I will take with me for years to come. However, I wish that the pay rate compensated for ALL of the hard work, effort, verbal ""restraint"" & diligence required to productively preform these job duties."
good,"The hardest part of the job are long hours,a typical day at work, very busy, walk a lot, Different culture,dont know a what time we can go home every day.."
good,"Many days I was sitting around waiting to get laid off so I could get my severance, but it never happened.  I ended up leaving on my own.  I felt like I was wasting away and being kept around just in case something came up that I was the only one that could fix."
good,"Young, inexperienced managers some of which had mistaken leadership with arrogance. Team members were supportive and approachable. Working as a contractor was stressful not knowing if you would be retained. Earlier notice of retention would have been appreciated."
good,Good place to work. Very competitive. Long hours equals no work life balance. Retention was high as well due ot the competitive job markets around the Memphis area.
good,This position was not my cup of tea. Management is more concerned with profits and the matrix than the patient.  For strong patient advocates this job can lead to morale distress.
good,"The company is suitable for someone who needs office, computer and work experience. Fast paced, management always changes their minds. Policies keep changing and pay is low. No opportunities for advancement. Not recommended."
good,This company needs better management training especially for those in senior executive positions. The manager I had when I resigned micro-managed me to an extent it affected my ability to perform my job. He had very unrealistic expectations. I would never suggest this manager to someone else.
good,I drive there and it's not hard to find parking (even for those who come in at a later time) and supervisors are everywhere on the floor so it's not hard to not know what you're doing at any time so the communication is always easy-going. My shift were always provided with 3 breaks and a lunch so I never got tired until we hit over 12 hours consistently for countless days and I believe that was the hardest part of the job. Everyone tends to get along there and any miscommunication usually comes from other workers not asking the supervisor.
good,Company operates like an older company and doesn't engage too much newer technology.   Company is big on promoting from within.   Most people working there are generally nice and friendly.
good,We work very hard and diligent for the customer but to me there isn't any employee appreciation. They ought to give out bonuses as a appreciation. The CEO gets 300 million plus and we get nothing. Everybody isn't cut out to be a manager. Also there is a huge lack of diversity.
good,McKesson was great job depending upon who became the next warehouse manager. They went through a lot of managers when I worked there. And every manager had a different agenda which caused a lot of confusion the night shift and the day shift activities had to run smoothly in order for all the freight to make it out the door the next day but it didn’t always work out that way
good,"As a supervisor at a distribution center, I was tasked with the complete running of the department. This included hiring, terminations, process improvement, and shift/labor planning. Such actions were not typically required at previous supervisor roles I held. As a result I was able to learn certain functions that an operations manager may do which greatly improved my knowledge of total operations."
good,"The people that work at McKesson are what drives the Distribution Centers.  It is a wonderful place to work, and you can form nice relationships with management. The culture is only getting better, and can move up in the company."
good,"The pay could be much better for the amount of workload honestly. The company stands by awesome values and definitely has potential for growth, however job advancement within the company is not very likely."
good,It is difficult to change as quick as the staegy chages were put in place. Not always communicated well for team to present to customers.  Customers were confuaed with all strategies
good,Great people to work with.  Not a lot of new product development.  Most of the work is supporting and maintaining existing products for existing customer base; not much market share growth.
good,The amount of time you spend at work does not equal out the  amount you are paid. Not all management staff members are on the same page when coming to solutions.
good,There was alot of favoritism from management.  There is no way to move into higher paying positions.  The management was not very supportive and liked to micro manage.
good,"McKesson is a union job that is based on points, Meaning that you only get a certain amount of points in the beginning when you are first hired there, such as 4 points. those points are for those who are on probation for 90 working days. When you start at McKesson you will most likely be part-time so if you want pass your 90 day probation you most work 6 months part-time if you have not been able to switch to full-time. Everything is ran by seniority so if people have been there longer you it will take a while for you either go full-time or get certain vacation days off such as holidays."
good,Overall the work flow was good but the people were hard to work with. Poor management. But on a day to day basis the job itself was fulfilling. I learned new things to advance my success.
good,"As goes most Temp to HIre positions your likely placement is low when there's a massive hire to get a project completed."
good,"This is by the book office.  I am sure McKesson, itself is much better than the Oldsmar office.  The Oldsmar office is by the book.  You meet production, and quality, or you are out the door.  No excuses."
good,I was not happy when my supervisor switched me from a general surgery coder to an E/M coder.  McKesson offered online and one on one training to help me with the learning curve.  I was not as fast as the more seasoned E/M coders and was unable to meet my quota for day.  I then briefly worked for a temp agency coding radiology charts and after a year I was contacted by LSU Pediatrics for a Coding Educator position.  I am now coding E/M charts on a daily basis and teaching my providers how to accurately code and get the most from  their documentation.  Thanks to McKesson's training I have been able to broaden my coding knowledge and career.
good,Knowledgeable folks with a good understanding of their projects and the customer. Could depend upon people to get the job done. Sometimes getting background on a project entailed more effort than in other places.
good,McKesson is great except they don't allow a chance to move up. They seem to give many reasons why you can't go anywhere unless you leave the contract you are in with good standings you may be able to go back later at a better position
good,"at mckesson, i work in the DEA department which is also known as the vault. mckesson offer and provides me jo stability. the pay is excellent and i love the discount program that they have."
good,use to be a good place under PSS Medical until McKesson bought out PSS World Medical  All McKesson is push and change things almost monthly that's why I decided to retire at 67
good,"McKesson is a great place to work if you like high paced, competitiveness, and uncertainty; a very exciting place to work. Salaries are consistent with industry standards. However, it is important to have a plan B and C relevant to job security."
good,Working here you do everything to much work for  little pay. You are doing a 2/3 person job and little to no help from others.  Sr manager is not the best. Will not speak to you doesn't address any of your issues.
good,"this was my externship, through Career Training Academy-Pittsburgh.  I didn't really learn anything. just someone goffer."
good,"Good place to start working to gain experience for future employment opportunities. The Engineered Standard (speed of doing your job) means more than your quality or accuracy. Its better to be fast with an error rate at the higher end of the scale than to be slower with little to no errors. If you can't make the speed, your accuracy and attendance don't mean anything."
good,"the hardest part of the job is the micromanaging"
good,Over the years I survived a yearly layoff until I was finally the victim of outsourcing to India.  Constant layoffs and worry over being laid off.  Employees not valued.  It's not personal it's just business.
good,"Lots of sitting, answering calls and many meetings. They love to train which is always good. Good office parties during and after work hours to show appreciation."
good,"While the people I worked with were wonderful, management left a lot to be desired.  They were always changing policies which made it very confusing.  Not a lot of opportunity for growth."
good,"A Fortune 500 company with some current industry struggles due to changes in the industry/regulation/politics (healthcare reform).  There is a move to the competitors such as EPIC, CERNER"
good,"Good Company with good employees. "
good,"You will always have a job there. Health Care rarely goes out of business. They are more concerned about obtaining smaller competition than they are about their employees. Instead of running 2 or 3 shifts they woud rather work you to the brink of exhaustion and not pay shift differential. They have excellent health benefits. But if you can works somewhere else then go there. If not you'll be looking within 5 months again anyways. The management is a joke. They rely on the people that are in what they call lead positions. If you ask most ""not all""  I'd say 70% any questions they will tell you that they don't know ask a lead.  I don't want to bash the place, just tell the truth. Their life work balance is only for the front office... That about as far as that goes.."
good,"Strong team collaboration among product development, sales, solution architects, project management, post-sales support and management. Great opportunity to rotate into different business unit areas."
good,"enjoyed a position to help influence and remove obstacles for other to strive and grow for their advancement."
good,"I've been at McKesson (now Change Healthcare as of March 1), and while my support group has been fabulous in terms of making the necessary lifestyle changes, it doesn't present much (if at all) in terms of transferring to other departments."
good,Nice work place but too far. The co workers were easy to get along with. the pay was not the best but employees were eligible for a raise every year..
good,Employees are extremely immature and clique-ish.  Overhead is more concerned with points and writing people up for everything than who is actually working and doing their job.
good,"Company offered excellent pay during a seasonal short term production period, but left people very in the dark about the future or if anyone would even have a job tomorrow. We had several time frames of people being cut by the handfuls but no one knew when that would be. I was really disappointed in the fact that my contract was over on a Friday, however, I was not informed that my assignment was over until late afternoon on a Sunday - That could not have been more unprofessional in my POV."
good,"All Senior Technical Help Desk Support Representatives are no longer with the company due to company Relocation and it can be hard to work with customers when you don't have someone to rely on with experience."
good,McKesson has a great culture/environment as a company but each location can vary on how the culture really is within those four walls. The benefits are good and the use of the Vitality program is great.
good,"We bill for Imaging and Radiology reading and interpretation of Xrays. Various levels of work. Data entry, Coding, Accounts Receivable and customer service. No training and low pay."
good,Management is not great. Work life balance is pretty good. The paid time off you receive when you start is 16 days which is really good.Overall the job is okay.
good,To many people begin in supervision. Breaks were to short. Could have been more organized with the steps of production.
good,"There is plenty of work to be done, but with little person there. Company compensates nicely, but there is little work/life balance depending your role. Enjoy doing what I do just not having to do other people job roles for them when there is plenty of work to be done."
good,"I really liked all the different types of work I got to do at McKesson in the +8 years I was there.  However, a corporate change in direction unintentionally drove away half of the customers, and the division I was in (MPT) has no future."
good,"Large company, but very large turnover with employment. From one program to another, very good job training. A very large company but everybody is mostly through temp service and if work more then 14 month then you have to go into a different program."
good,"McKesson overall is a decent place to work. It can be a bit stressful, but overall is ok. Just learn to cope with stress and you will be fine."
good,a typical day consist of answering call and taking payment on car notes that was due or behind. learned a lot of patience.
good,When I first start working here there was no work life balance. 12+ hour shifts were the norm. Eventually things got better but many people were burnt out and unhappy with the pay and lack of opportunity within the company.
good,"For the amount of work you do, the hourly pay is horrible. However that being said, the side benefits are amazing. Great health insurance, that doesn't break the bank, but on the other hand, you don't make a living wage, and you work really hard doing 10 different jobs.  They should pay people the same as they do in Carrollton."
good,"Great place, with great people. I have learned all about medical billing, dealing with insurance's, resolving problems with insurance and or patients in order to get the claims paid. Management is awesome and full of life and encouragement. The hardest part of my job is dealing with insurance to get them to pay claims. They will find the littlest reason in denying the claim and you have to spend 30 minutes or more on the phone on hold to try to resolve the issue at hand. I get a great feeling of accomplishment once I have the problem resolved. I have learned that you can't be sick at McKesson because you have to give a minimum of at least one day preapproved notice to have time off. I have seen many good people loose their position because of illness."
good,Hard to maintain a normal family life. Second and third shift split makes it hard on the body and having a normal life. You walk many miles a night. Very hard on the feet and legs.
good,I enjoy my job for the most part but the hardest part of my job are some challenging phone calls from time to time. The hours work well for me and I like my co workers.
good,"As far as work goes the work is easy and manageable,"
good,"I enjoyed working with the people here- the supervisory skills in the particular department left me feeling wanting, the supervisor wasn't not very aware of the current systems and procedures that were needed to handle the day to day job."
good,"I have learned how to enter patient isnurance information, call insurance , code insurance. Learned that you have to know people to be treated good."
good,"McKesson is full of some very talented individuals, almost all of whom are worried about their job security given the frequency of business unit and division reorganizations, shifts in upper management and regular, recurring layoffs. We have wonderful products, and the best part of the job is talking to actual customers and creating material that depicts our software in the best possible light. The worst part of the job is all the unnecessary layers of difficulty McKesson builds into every process, whether it's another process meeting on the process for the recommended process for making a presentation, or 15 legal & technical accounting reviews of a social media posting. So. Much. Bureaucracy!"
good,The lines were timed so that even if you were the fastest order puller but needed to use the rest room often or more than once a shift {between 12 @ 15 hours} then you were considered slow.
good,"My work day consist of insurance follow up which includes locating missing payments, corrections on accounts, phone calls to both insurance companies, patients, and  data entry."
good,"I enjoyed working for McKesson and learned a great deal about insurance laws, procedures, and workings between insurance companies. The long drive everyday started to effect my work and found myself struggling to keep up. My Manager addressed this with me and we agreed that I would have to get done for the drive on often a six day week was just to much."
good,"The job is great when you first start working, they tell you about the awesome benefits and train you well, most new employees love the job. Once you have worked there for a while though you start to see the broken management and lies about ""advancement""."
good,The company is very tight in schedule.  Does not afford a work/life balance environment.  Management is good although remote as Head office is in Montreal.
good,From time you get there you are always busy. The hardest part of the job is being short staff.
good,"Stressful yet rewarding. "
good,McKesson in general is a great place to work. Flexible hours. I love working in a challenging department and that is what you get in the cash management team.
good,My time at McKesson was a good learning experience for me when it comes to balancing two different programs. It required me to remain very focus all  the time on the task I was performing.
good,"Due to the large majority of senior management having worked their way up in the particular office, it is very hard for an outsider with outside management experience to be respected. While I respect this company as a whole, the Lewiston office provides a somewhat hostile work environment."
good,My reviews were good. A typical day was productive. Its constant work on the feet but good for exercise.
good,"The management didn't watch employees close enough, people were always doing things they knew they shouldn't just because they knew they would get away with it. Which in turn hurt their performance and in the long run hurt client relationships because of poor turnaround. Too much drama within the company and not enough professionalism."
good,productive workplace. friendly co-workers. management seemed to be busy at all time. hardest part of the job was working the graveyard shift. unpredictable hours. i enjoyed the steady work pace allowed day to go by faster
good,"Like coming to work every morning !  Enjoyed all the people around me but lots of change everyday , they cant stick to one process. I am thinking that is why they hired 100 people for only the job for 20.  Please get input on the people that work there."
good,Not an environment for personal growth in the UX department.
good,"Typical day at work is handling escalated customer issues. Management rarely talks to you or assist with concerns you have. Never praised for good work and raises are not much with excuses all the time. More work given to you is not appreciated when you succeed. There is no advancement anymore. "
good,"I was able to work flex time. "
good,Handled over 65 inbound calls a day to assist patients with medication.
good,My day consists of developing strategies and initiatives to align sustainability initiatives to support McKesson's business objectives and customers' needs and commitments.
good,The EC manager doesnt know what hes doing. The building would be better off without him and operation production would increase. He blames you on reviews and puts on a hero supervisor show for his boss. IF HIRED. YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS POST.
good,"I learned how to balance Medicare/Medicaid ERA's. I enjoyed working with my co workers they we're very friendly and helpful, at first management was good, but some things had changed over the years when I worked there. The hardest part of the job was making sure all the money coming in was posted before the dead line which was the last day of each month. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to challenge myself and make sure all money was posted by the last day of each month, which I was able to do."
good,"love location. Great building. Has Cafe and Gym on site. For my job, too many changes weekly."
good,"Everything had a certain way of being done in the pharmacy and I felt like I wasn't part of the team. However, everyone was really nice and I felt I could talk to my manager. The hardest part of my job was completing tasks as I did not know enough about medicine to do this. The most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers."
good,"Everyday I am committed to providing solutions to assist doctors/practices with better patient experiences and care. It is my duty to also help improve operational efficiencies, reduce cost, and expand revenue."
good,"This was a remote coding position. Things I was told during the hiring process never manifested. Mostly, employment was spent completely idle (with pay). It seems I was hired and kept on stand-by; the pay and benefits were good, but, I would have preferred to work. The hardest part of the job was the endless waiting and not getting any feedback."
good,"Mckesson was a good place to begin to learn the medical billing field and what skills were needed to succeed in this career. However, management doesn't follow the values they put forth in their policies."
good,"McKesson Corporation is a billing company for many medical offices in Texas and surrounding states. They train and employ approximately 350 people at their Greenville, Texas location."
good,The work is interesting and exciting but there are no career advancement opportunities. The management team gives false promises and they lead by favoritism instead of actual guidance.
good,Joined as a temp through an agency. The business is open plan. Very less chance of survival unless permanent. Promised temp to perm but very soon a Payroll Specialist was hired and I was made to leave instead of harnessing payroll skills.
good,"The work load and culture varies enormously in Mckesson, attitudes and culture also vary significantly, the one thing in common is no one really takes accountability, restructures are common at least once a year."
good,The management do not seem to know what it is like to work on the shop floor. Chaotic and under staffed. Prescriptions rarely ready on time. Wage is not enough for the stress involved.
good,"Management is well connected with each other, and they protect each other. You can’t help but to go over their head to resolve issues, but that will make you a target."
good,"Pay is decent but for me being stuffed into a windowless warehouse was taxing on the mind. I worked nights so didn't have much of a life. "
good,I don't want to talk about the company was a different experience  not the type of job I like to do but is something that why I stay working there but looking for something that I like
good,"I did not like was the micromanagement and the fact that if you are staffed through remex you are not guaranteed a job even if you do everything you’re supposed to you still might not get the job. Why because they only choose about 10 people out of 90 to move forward. Such a waste of time and disappointing. I saw people who missed days, had terrible QA, calls move on. If you love to kiss butt to move forward this is an awesome place to work!"
good,"Filling out Pharmaceutical orders for hospitals, pharmacies, doctor offices and etc. Making sure each order is right by what is on the order for your section."
good,It was an OK job.  Other team members were happy to assist when asked.  Oncall was about every 3-4 weeks.  Ability to work remote is available.  Only thing is if you ever have any medical issues you will be the first to be laid off when one happens.
good,"I liked working at McKesson. It gave me some great customer service tools in addition to what I already had.  The downside was every few months they moved you to a new project. You were fortunate to stay with a project for a year. By moving so ofter, it didn't give you too much room for advancement because you couldn't establish a foundation. This is a good starter for call center skills."
good,High stress and high pressure environment but sadly staff are not valued by management. High staff turnover with the biggest stumbling block being wages/salary not matching the responsibility and expectation that comes with the job. Always short staffed leaving risk to safeguarding. Always contacted on days off and holidays with work related matters so little chance of break to unwind.
good,"Still tools needs a big update"
good,This is one of the largest companies in the country. McKesson cares about profit and profit only. It has a very poor company culture with weak leadership
good,"Great company culture, smart people, never worked harder at a job, pay is decent, very hard to advance if you're not located at the business unit headquarters."
good,"This is a topic that I do not have comment to add. Since I haven't worked for McKesson in quite some time, and it my understanding the they no the applications I worked on during my employment."
good,"At the site that I worked at, the hours varied due to the timing of the orders coming in throughout the week.  Employees were not allowed to leave until all of the orders were picked, staged, or shipped."
good,"8 hour work day with flexible starting hours, 5-6 hrs/day running reports and processing analytics, 1-1.5 hrs in meetings.  Encouraged to use 2 breaks each day with ½ hr. lunch.  Hardest part of my job -- keeping up with emails.  Most enjoyable part of my job -- the people I work with (onsite and at our distribution centers)."
good,"While I was there, they over work you with minimum break time, even had us working 16-17 hour shifts. Management only listened to mangers and never confront you with issues that they are having."
good,Loved working within the call center atmosphere.  Management needs improvement. Salary satisfactory. Very fast paced. Advancement minimal. PTO was fair.
good,"Over the last year I have lost my drive to work here, my manager has done a poor job of giving me task and direction. And after being here a year I was told they think I'm disengaged and not being the supervisor they wanted me to be. I never had any issues in my last location in Elgin IL. I was always the go to supervisor while I was in Elgin. I feel like my input is not appreciated her and that my real strengths have not been utilized in the location. I also changed my hours a year ago when I transferred to Glendale Heights, and I feel like I'm missing out on my kids growing up and its causing a strain on my marriage and emotional well being."
good,During my tenure with McKesson I had 4 supervisors and they all were great. The problem is that you can be thrown into another program at the drop of a hat. I prefer a stable environment.
good,For some their job function is constantly changing.  Their supervisors are constantly changing. Moral is depressing. Management is not held responsible for their actions.  Staff is not treated with equal respect. The employees are wonderful hard working people but are grossly underpaid. I do enjoy being able to work Monday-Friday.
good,"We could use some help in the management area. The benefits are okay. You can use vitality MEASURES to pay reduced insurance premiums. They could use help in the QA department. They do offer training but it isn't the best. The location is great. There is an onsite gym and cafeteria. It can be stressful and often times employees don't feel as if they have a voice. When you ask for help from management to implement changes that could possibly benefit all...they have been known to ignore you. If you need personal guidance to enhance your skills or quality of work, they respond by reminding you that you are an adult and  to work problems out on your own. The communication between other departments we work closely with, is not good. There's a lot of room for improvement."
good,OK company if you are not wanting to get promoted. Only if you fit their idea of who can or cannot be client facing will you see opportunities. I wouldn't recommend unless you want to stay settled in a role.
good,"Strong company culture with emphasis on community outreach. However, day to day tasks are tedious and repetitive. Management does little to advocate for employee advancement."
good,It was  nice company to work for but it was Corporate driven which you had to to adapt to working for a big corporation You really did not get a chance to interact with the top officials that came in.
good,Office was closed and employees downsized with very few offered opportunities to work remotely.  Made feeble attempt to integrate downsized employees within other organizations.  Promises were made by upper management but not kept.  Upper management wanted all resources to be relocated to central offices.
good,"Place and fill orders at retail operations on a weekly basis, items included stationary, HBC, and specialty food items. Must have use of personal vehicle to preform and maintain store accounts to full an proper levels to increase sale volume."
good,"Growing industry but management team as a whole has been somewhat mediocre (as reflected by earnings, track record of acquisitions and stock price over last four years).  "
good,"Typical day was busy and strenious but i loved the culture and the team i was able to develope, unfortunately i got laid off due to budget cutting for out roanoke site."
good,It was an okay place to work. Management was hectic but it wasn’t stable. Wanted more advancement. Often your stuck with a role without pay increase. Left to train people for roles you could do.
good,Hey it's a job.  All come with their own set of issues.  The work from home was great.  If you luck up and get a great supervisor it is even better.  Some positions even let you work from home all week.
good,"The hardest part of the job is being able to pick at the required pace, being accurate, and most importantly cleaning up after your self, if you can prove to yourself that it can be done, then you will have a good working re-pour with management, and fellow coworkers.."
good,McKesson was a fun place to work. We became family oriented. During my tenor there the work became more challenging and overwhelming. You have to have work life balance or you will be drained.
good,This was a temporary position where I was a data analyst. It was busy work but my supervisor was organized and nice. It only paid $11/hour but it was a lot of work.
good,"Great place to gather skills. Opportunity for growth. Nice facilitie, but open concept is productivity killer. Good pay. Senior management complicit in culture of bullying."
good,Unstable their head count. And poor work and life balance. Strong managing empower.they have some opportunity to transfer their employees to the other department and other town and states if employees want.
good,"It wasn't always like this, but there have been so many changes recently, including the consolidation with our sister company, Skye. My experience with managers is good, except for the last two.  My current manager is in serious need of leadership training.  She micro-manages everything but offers no support.  She ignores issues with other employees.  My guess is because she's scared of confrontation.  In this day and age, leadership skills are critical to build a good team and to motivate them. This is the main reason I need to leave.  I want to go to work, give it an honest day, get along with co-workers, and have a decent manager that actually cares and that respects the overall team."
good,"The teams are isolated, which tend to produce a negative ""non-helping"" atmosphere. Management also tends to allow the company's culture to flourish."
good,"Mckessons has such a great work environment, but if you get hired on there threw Drake Int. you are going to be waiting around a year before Mckessons actually hires you on threw them."
good,"There are alot of moving parts at Mckesson. Departments that work closely together are often in the dark on important changes coming forth that impacts the other department. The upper management will do anything to save a dollar today even if it means having to spend much more in the future and having a fire to put out. The culture on my team is a team that works together to solve a problem and help the customers. Almost everyday i get to work on something new and get to work with people and technology. There is a bit of micro-management at times. One may never know when they are leaving work for the day to provide support coverage but OT is strictly monitored. Management may make promises they cannot keep at times. This job will allow you to work with a lot of different technology and learn a lot about different types of local networks, servers, and windows desktops."
good,"No job is without shortcomings and this one certainly needed new management, but other than that it was a great environment that keeps you busy.  I'd recommend it for a short term position that pays well."
good,McKesson is growing so fast that it is outgrowing itself.  Growing pains are the results of that enormous growth.  There needs to be more thought placed in planning and more trust in the leaders you select to lead you through the change.
good,I have an awesome director report. He's involved in my professional development. My team is the best group I've ever had the pleasure of working with.
good,"Drive and delivery products while meeting customer satisfaction is always a priority.  In addition, the customer relationships as well as staff relationships were positive, and made the job that much more rewarding."
good,"It was almost impossible to schedule a day off.  It was very structured,   The expectations were a little steep due to the fact that we were calling people from all over with thick accents etc."
good,They did not want to hear what we had to say.  They had a tendency of taking our opinions and passing it off as their own.  Upper management listened to the wrong people.
good,The starting pay is better than most places. They don't tell you that you start as a temp and then have to wait until part time openings become available and then try to get a permanent part time job and then have to wait to be full time until you can apply for any full time openings. No real perks or benefits for temp employees. Have now started majorly cutting hours for all temp employees.
good,"Pay rate caps out at under $13.00 per hour, & is below standard pay rate for the work done compared to similar companies. However the environment is somewhat pleasant & the management is decent."
good,The company as a whole is a good company but the work/life balance is not good.  They pride themselves on this however I do not see the balance when an employee has to work beyond their hours often
good,"I wasn't happy there. Not enough pay, some managers were not compassionate about personal issues and work life balance. My position wasn't fulfilling.  The location was fine."
good,Very fast paced and changing environment.  Work/life balance for remote employees is a struggle.  Compensation and benefits are above average.  Be sure you know exactly what you're getting into before you accept a remote position.
good,Company was sold a couple times.  Climate change was the reason I left.  A lot of people were let go after the sale.  Management changed and it became very stressful as it was selling again.
good,"I wish it was full-time job. However, its a only a temporary position. "
good,"The work schedule at McKesson was flexible and work/life balance was solid. Some work could be done remotely, which was a nice break from the congested office space that lacked privacy. "
good,"At times it was a great place to work and there was a bit of favoritism"
good,"The responsibilities were arrive  early in the morning and on time after that all of us had to organize the group of boxes of medicine in our vans, while that we had to check the lists with the quantity and the places where we had to go after that we had to drive and deliver all the medicine in every stop we had to scan the labels and the person who received the medicine had to sign in a list that the manager gave us."
good,McKesson does a fine job of training and creating developmental plans to further your career path.   Overall the benefit package was fair.  Seems like a lot of change at once.
good,pulling items very fast pace and lots of stairs to climb.  Long hours five days week.  very stressful and no time to do things after work for a social life.
good,"As with many large corporations, we're a small company with corporate several states away and who are often put on the back burner. There was no room for advancement due to the corporate office not approving our offices open positions."
good,"The McKesson I was a part of no longer exists.  The company has been restructured with a significant reduction in force.  In addition, the company has most recently had highly visible issues as noted on CBS 60 minutes."
good,"The benefits were great, paid time off was accrued, many holidays off.  The only complaint I have about paid time off is that you cannot carry over any time.  You must use what you accrue within the year.  This does not allow you to save time of any potential storm days or sick days as you must close out your earned time yearly."
good,"working at Mckesson, which is now change healthcare was stressful especially if you struggle with production,  they didn't always provide the proper attention to the hospital documentation, by cleaning up medical records with many duplicate pages which would cause more time in coding a chart, organization was a issue, In order to bring success to the coding department, and the coders production. One of the managers in coding lacked communication,and social skills.   You were never allowed to talk to anyone. Not the easiest place to work."
good,Ok for large company.  Lots of areas to move to. You are promoted when someone  leaves.  Great to have on resume . High margin company.  Marketing was a tertiary priority.
good,"Lack of advancement, Pay structure is is designed horribly to advance to higher roles. You will not be considered for a possible ""bonus eligible"" role due to the pay grade structure. You could quit and apply back in 6 months...that has been done by several people that are working here again."
good,"Typical Work Day - Meetings, one on one, training, dealing with account managers, clients, process management"
good,"i personally would't recommend this company to my worst enemy, poor management, too much work load per day for little employees, its cheaper for them to pay overtime then to get more bodies in the door"
good,The job is simple once you're about to digest all of the information you've been provided. The training classes are large and very short for the amount of data you have to go over But again once you get the hang of it its a complex and great job.
good,"8 hours split between onboarding new customers once requests are received and resolving contracting disputes with supplier eligibility lists"
good,Although my manager was GREAT! The pay is horrible. There is no advancement opportunities and the workload is ridiculously stressful. Not a place to work if you have a small child or children because the workload does not match the pay scale AT ALL!!!
good,"Micro-Management happens there"
good,If you are capable of being a self starter and a hard worker McKesson allows a great work life balance. This is really great for the people who work hard and get their job done. It can sometimes allow the slackers to slack more. Work from home is at the managers discretion.
good,I was on charge of inbound and outbound calls to qualify patients for the different Patient Assistance Programs. They have an excellent quality department but pay was the offside.
good,"The salary and benefits are excellent, work environment can be cutthroat and often unstable.  Management sometimes advance on personality rather than knowledge and skills."
good,I enjoyed the work environment and co-workers.  Management was at times very fluid.  Work tasks were often challenging but were rewarding.  I felt my contributions were appreciated.
good,"My day consist of receiving fax orders and calls from doctors, nursing homes, hospitals and clients. As well as multiple types of calls, of customer requesting item information and tracking of their orders. "
good,"In the last 4 years has been bought 3 times. No longer the same working environment. Has become simply big business. Lot's of changing, has now become a constant."
good,"Project Manger work was typical PM responsibilities. Teams were good with consultants with extensive experience within their SME area. I worked in the technology portion and there were significant layoffs each quarter the last two years I was there due to failed software developments. Parts of the technology sector have since been sold off and I'm unsure how much now remains."
good,"benefits and salary are fair. unfortunately it is a big company and acts that way, change though wanted is really slow to happen and results from a separate division impact job security."
good,Good company and leadership and does not always play well together.  That is changing for the better.  The company is focused on drug distribution now so there will be increased focus.
good,"Worked at Mckesson for 3 years now."
good,Decent job.  Steady work.  Night shift is difficult to get used to.  Management is good.  Work life balance is difficult.  Union Facility so hard work is not rewarded effectively.
good,"Mass hiring event to have a pool of employees promoting and working with a company to promote, get authorized new drug treatments to a limited amount of patients from areas across the country. It was great if you could get insurance company's to cover the very ill patient, heartbreaking to find that again finances regulated if someone could have any kind of quality of life."
good,McKesson is an overall good company to work for if you dont mind a lot of overtime. The typical work day is long and tiring but not too difficult. Good benefits and payed time off. Air conditioned warehouse which is nice. Management is shady and misguided. Pay could be much better as well
good,Typically I start work 6:30 my time each morning and completed every encounter in my que.  Management made the decision to switch me from surgery code to E/M and I really struggled.  I was expected to code as fast as the seasoned E/M coders which  was also the hardest part of my job.  I now teach E/M coding to my providers.
good,"Would be a great company to work for, position was very challenging. I would not like to comment any further regarding this company."
good,"The contract calls for specific need of service level, handle time, and quality for each call. The contracted agents hired must be able to balance business needs 100% of the time so the job is challenging. "
good,"Great work for those who prefer client facing projects. Projects were varied and teams of colleagues varied based on the project. Oftentimes difficult to get thru / around this large company when seeking information. Once you found the ""right"" person or department, you had a friend for life !"
good,"Make outbound calls to payors. verify benefits, data entry, great work place culture. management can be inconsiderate and unwilling to work with the employees."
good,"Flexible hours, Monday - Friday.  My co-worker and Manager was great, but many of our jobs were moving off- shore. Place collection calls and appeal the insurance company about their payments. Along with make correction and collecting patient payments. Verifying that the patient information was correct and reprocess claims. Make many outbound calls to various insurance companies for eligibility and addition insurance.  Inbound customer service rep and received credit card payments."
good,"Worked at mckesson for almost 2 years. The management was not very good. None of the supervisors talked with each other so they didn't know what was going on. They basically sit all day on their computers doing nothing. Pay is nice if you're willing to give up your life. usually start night shift and some nights you are working 11+ hours. Non stop moving, you never get to stop unless its break or lunch. Very hot, rarely any fans (just push around the hot air anyways ). should get paid more for the job thats done. Managers and supervisors need to solve problems better, nothing was ever done. People were bullied and nothing happened."
good,"A typical day was very high paced and challenging. "
good,"The company and what it itself offers I believe is great. The DC that I happened to work at has a ridiculously high turn over rate about 20 or so people every 2 months. There are only 2 20 minute breaks with 2-10 hours of continuous walking of up to 12 miles a night. The hope for advancement is even more out of reach than just trying to cross train.The occasional free food for a job well done is great butt it doesn't make up for the lack of communication, no feed back, and complete disregard to workers contentment. Other than using the job as a way to save money and have some type of work experience I could never see it as a long term goal."
good,"Fast pace, job security long hours, Team work."
good,"I come in every night to ensure patients recieve not only the right order but also in a timely fasion with speed, patients and accuracy. I help problem solve and make sure all of us work together as a team."
good,"Depending on the department and manager, the schedule can be flexible and working from home may be allowed."
good,The job is easy but the people makes the job hard the  only way you can move up in the company is by kissing up to people
good,"It was originally a great place to work.  With transitioning over to sister company.  There were to many uncertain changes that caused me to leave.  Other than that, it was a great experience."
good,"Management work in silos... no clear view of future"
good,"1) I worked day time and always show up at work..  stay positive.  :)"
good,McKesson was a good company to work for salary and benefits were awesome but the number of projects and work hours were tiresome and overburdening at time. The people I worked with were some of the leaders of the industry and were super intelligent and very helpful. Unfortunately due to work force reductions I was layed off after 7 years.
good,"Work load was always fast paced - quick turn around on projects is requested frequently.  On the plus side almost everyone in IT works from home regularly, which improved the work life balance immensely.  Down side was there was always something that required a late night or a spent weekend or two.  Good people, job demands made balancing personal needs difficult at times."
good,"I am very greatful for the opportunity at McKesson.Making calls to insurance companies to verify coverage for patients . This medication  program for the patient  to help improve their quality of life to achieve independence  of self care. As an temporary employee there was support from mangement. Then  being on hold extremely long time. with the insurance companies.We worked hard and yet time did fly by, which was enjoyable."
good,I worked as a night shift material handler for a year and two months. By God's great mercy I made it that long. In the beginning it was a very enjoyable place to work. The work is easy and easily learned. I worked in the DEA department. I began to notice a difference when I was working much harder than several employees around me in my department.  Doing clerical work in the DEA department was easy but not everyone was qualified to do it putting more work on others that were.  Nine out of 10 leads were completely lazy and did not pitch in to do the work load. The incentive program is shady too. They have an engineer come measure the standards that you have to live by. If you do not meet the standards you will be penalized in the training offered is not adequate. Honestly the wage starving was decent but after they tax you it's not even worth all the hours and stress. The supervisors were very unwilling to help in quite often wore white pants to work in a warehouse. The operations manager also did not know many questions that I had in did not seek to get the answers either. It seems like McKesson will promote anyone they feel like the light not someone who is fit for the job. I will never work or sought to work for a company like this again!
good,"I have worked for Med3000/McKesson for almost 3 years now that I have been back in Florida.I have great work hours and I do get paid time off. I enjoy the work I do on a daily basis which is summed up as Proofing Claims for quality and errors before release of payment, training of staff on claim errors made, handling of provider complaints and claim rejections, processes daily reports for claims payment batch run. The work I do on a daily basis the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part of my job is that it seems im not supposed to collaborate with other departments on how to get the work done more efficiently, they say in meetings to me as a Quality Analyst that I am supposed to do this but when I try I get told to not discuss my work with other departments.. so the hardest part of this job is getting clarity on what to discuss and not discuss with co-workers who do the daily work. I have been a medical claims auditor/Quality analyst and Claims processor for over 9 years now and I definitely enjoy the challenges of the job. I like being able to recognize errors and set a plan of motion to correct them and make the work more streamline."
good,"Good work environment with adequate work life balance, I was able to develop a sustainably skill set and I am grateful for my time there"
good,"Mckesson is okay. The people are nice. My daily job was to make sure patient information was completed for submission by the date line. There was a lot of reconstructing, due to ICD 10 change, so a lot people were let go. "
good,Expectation is to learn your job quickly and to work independently but communicate on a team basis.  Push until you break instead of mentor you to grow and learn to become a better stronger worker. A hard place to get into but then when you get in you either love it or hate it. Trust no one and learn to adapt to change without much warning or even any warning.
good,I don't believe in posting reviews about my employee on the internet.  Asking in a conversation setting is more professional.
good,"My day would start opening the computer software applications, making calls to members & documenting on their use of the ED in lieu of utilizing their PCP. We would be monitored via phone & screen shots tthroughout the day. We were able to IM our co-workers as needed and to chat also during the day. I also enjoyed going into the office for that face to face human contact & see the people you are working with assisting you with the members. Any down time due to computer issues on our end were time taken off of  our time. We worked from home so every minute of our day needed to be accounted for. Down time on IT's end were corrected & time was then adjusted. The most difficult part of the job was connecting with the members as the were  the most acute & required the most assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you got through to them & were able  to assist them & felt like you made a difference."
good,"Financial analysis or payments totaling two and a half million dollars a month. Monitored bank accounts of seven bank monitoring trends and payment history to predict future earnings and report and trends in payment fluctuations. I learned accounting principals skills, payment analysis skills, speaking public and supervisor skills. Management allowed challenged me and exposed me to skills that I currently carry as my greatest assets. My coworkers worked in separate cubicles calling and following up on claims processed and denied. The hardest part of my job was the volume that came with the amount of money received. The enjoyable part of my job was the skills I obtained and exposure to the skills obtained."
good,"This company deals with enrolling patients in pharmaceutical assistance programs as well as assisting pharmacies having issues processing the programs in their software.  The good thing was the pay was impressive compared to other similar job positions in the market.  The not so good thing is that they were very strict.  You get docked points for taking time off while sick, having to go to a doctor, or any other important life event you had to take care of during your scheduled shift.  Only scheduled vacations were okay.  Points are what they use to let them know if you're not performing to their standards up to and including termination.  It takes a whole year to earn back 1-2 points.  The mentality was also very uptight.  They kept very close watch of you and didn't allow for any human error.  It's nice to keep a tight ship, but these guys were too tight.  Still the pay was good, and you also had the option to work at home remotely which relieves some of the stress."
good,Fun place to work. Upbeat employees. Constantly changing environment with updates to  procedures and rules. Good management.
good,"Mckesson is an awesome company to gain knowledge in the medical billing industry. I gained an astonishing amount of knowledge in Excel, Word, various billing platforms, etc. The people that work within Mckesson are overall fabulous. As with any corporation with hundreds of employees there are a mixture of personalities. The hardest part of the job is building confidence upon hire. It can be quite discouraging to new employees with minimum to zero experience in medical billing."
good,Company wide communications could be improved.  The benefits provided by this employer are outstanding and the best by far I've seen out of a lot of companies.
good,On a daily basis we were required to interact with customers and meet their daily needs. Regularly I was obliged to deal with customers queries and deal with problem solving if any issues raised. I was working with a great team which helped and supported each other  in distributing day to day job roles. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers who held an argumentative attitude and dealing with them in a positive and calm manner. The best part of this job role was working with a very supportive team who encouraged each other in performing to the best of their abilities.
good,"McKesson is a Good Company overall, however if you're expecting Stability and a Lasting Career, working there can be a gamble, regardless of performance."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced. There is always something to do. I have learned how to use a new computer system that is unique to McKesson. Coworkers are friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job is all the lifting of boxes, some are fairly heavy. Interacting with my coworkers and working as a team."
good,It's main focus is customer needs and priority.  As an employee of a distribution company I have become more aware of the different process and levels to maintain customer satisfaction.
good,Correcting billing for claims that have been denied. Sending in requested information to insurance carriers and doing appeals to get claims paid/reprocessed.
good,a typical day is going through my emails and then bringing up the medical charges and keying them into the system. I enjoy working with the group of people that I do.  they all get along great.
good,"Small team of 3 handling Enterprise IT support to a hospital. Manage  Mcafee Enterprise Protection and Dell Commvault Backup system day to day. Learned a lot about SQL. Hands experience with load balancer, switches, fiber line, HIPS and VLANS. On call 24/7"
good,Outsourcing taking place to Canada and India. Training in new technologies is not a goal for this company.
good,"The job is fairly easy and the the pay is so-so."
good,McKesson is a good place to work. Corporate Leadership supported business units very well and openly.
good,very long hours and extensive work. I like the people withing the company but with it being a new warehouse it just takes a little more paitience than usual to deal with what all goes on there.
good,"for the most part, not a bad place to work. most of the co-worker were great but there were a few that did very little work, but you have that every where. a typical day a work were usually very busy most of the time.  the hardest part of the job was trying to get all the orders pick and loaded on the trucks by a time period. the best part of the job, you were your own boss as long as you pick your orders."
good,Management was a work and progress when i was an employee there people were awesome mng needed much improvement though.
good,"I run the front office, phones, deliveries, problem solving. data entry charges for clients.  problem solving on excel spreadsheet exception errors for 2 large clients. enter patient demo information from Epic, "
good,The company overall supports its employees.  A office environment that is fast paced.  .
good,"Enjoyed my time here, but unfortunately the salary per year is not high enough to match the cost of living of California."
good,"I have learned so much about billing and insurance  at mckesson, I am on the phones all day and I have to  explain to patients about why their insurance did not pay on a claim. I then have to explain what I intend to do to get bills paid.Sometimes the patient becomes very angry. I have to put myself in their places. I must remain calm and sympathetic at all times. There are going to be times, that I have to tell patients they are responsible for a large bill, and that is the hardest part of my job. The best part is when I am told that I helped someone solve their issue, and even made their day."
good,Great company with excellent products however it is key to work under management that actually knows how to manage. Close minded thinking and unproductive nonsense towards employees does not contribute to the overall bottom line as a whole. Great place to work if you don't want to have out of the box thinking.
good,"the worst ever team you can get, non-professionalism and vanity dominate, encouraged at all management levels."
good,"My day consist of filling orders for customers , picking the correct quanity and correct product. This was a team effort and management was available to assist when needed."
good,"As a Medical Biller and General Administrative Clerk responsibilities included; review of superbills using ICD-9 and CPT codes for accuracy and obtain any missing information. Enter patient demographic and insurance information into the computer."
good,McKesson is a great place to work if the right management and supervisor are put into place. Over the years I was there we had many. They constantly changed our hours. I learned a lot in paying attention and asking questions. I enjoyed working with my co workers  With being a machine operator I got great satisfaction in operating a machine and being a lead.
good,"Was a very good place to work until the last few years.. Management does not live by their "" ICARE"" motto"
good,"It was a fast paced call-center, that emphasized on DME sales as well as high level customer service. Handled inbound/outbound calls and order verification"
good,"A smart, driven group of people developing new technologies for the healthcare industry."
good,"You start on night shift, mid shift if you're lucky. You have to have at least five years of seniority to get on days. Nights work Sunday through Thursday and all major holidays (we get the day before off). Start time is set unless of course they want you to come in early, which is always mandatory. You never know what time you're going to leave, could be six hours, could be twelve. The more functions you learn the more you move around or you could be stuck in the same function for three months straight. On the lines you walk 10-15 miles a night. The management is made up of a bunch of people who have no idea what they're doing. None of them have any supervisory experience outside the company. McKesson loves to hire recent college grads as supervisors and they don't have the first clue on how to be effective leaders or personable in the slightest."
good,Alot of busy work. Uncertain future because of older products and new business acquisions.
good,The McKesson IT environment is very frustrating to work within due to the disjointed nature of the the various support and development teams. Slowly but surely all of IT is being outsourced to various companies and accountability is eroding more and more.
good,"I worked at the Fredericksburg office for over a year. I loved the medical billing job I did but the working environment was really bad. The office consists of 97% females, so there is a lot of cattiness, backstabbing, and unnecessary petty drama that goes on. Not only does management not discourage it, but they sometimes partake in it. They have a ""small town"" mentality."
good,Mckesson is the solid start in my medical billing career. They gave me a chance as I was a entry level biller at the time of hire. I've have expanded my horizons in radiology billing and gained much experience.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced, long hours 14-16 hr shifts. The hardest part of the job was going in at @ 5pm on Sundays and not leaving untill 7am the next morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and the free lunches."
good,"Mckesson is a very large company, several different areas they focus on"
good,Immediate supervisor was excellent. The company had problems if you were one minute late from lunch and treated individuals like they were machines and not people.
good,"I love making a first impression when it’s comes to my work. I’m a fast learner, I work well with others and I take pride into my work. I’m hands on I’m a peoples person"
good,A unique culture and management group moving the company forward.  Very large sourcing group defined by categories.  Pay is not on the higher side as management will tell you that those that work there are not the ones that are doing it for the pay.
good,"The culture was relaxed but productive"
good,"The biggest benefit is a lot of time off, they also offer pretty good insurance benefits especially compared to other employers.  Advancement opportunities really depend on your department.  For me, it was pretty low stress and a decent work environment."
good,"Fast paced, demanding, and vibrant work culture. Good pay. The organization provides good benefits. But the facility is still growing, and several issues need to be optimised for seamless functioning."
good,I loved the people I worked with but needed a change and more of a challenge. Great benefits! I was unhappy with the office location and working remote wasn't an option.
good,It is hard to grab opportunities and seek growth. A person is restricted to his/her job role specifically and ends up doing a monotonous work. Month-ends are busy but otherwise relaxed. Team work and collaboration is good.
good,"Fast pace environment and productivity matters a lot.  As long as you show up and do your work, you are left alone until there's a problem.  Great benefits and flexible hours."
good,"Way too many changes, Management is out of touch and they don't consider their employees or needs.  Way too much turnover and a lot of management leaving in droves. Inconsistent managers."
good,"The work environment was good, people are friendly, moving up is depends mostly to who is evaluating you, outsourcing some departments of the company is taking place often and making the job less guaranteed...Most job are going to India..."
good,I was on a 90 day Temp to hire position after my 90 days was complete I was not given the opportunity to get hired on full-time and while production was low my assignment unfortunately was ended.
good,"A typical day required time management and analytical productivity. I learned specialty billing codes, insurance verification, prior authorizations, EOBs, and Provider Network. The company provided incentives for employees. The hardest part of the job was to maintain a high accuracy of productivity while coordinating patient's eligibility for multiple provider offices. The most enjoyable part of my job was maintaining relations with my training team and new team members."
good,The business is fast paste when you need help from head office no one helps and gives you back up. Not eight staffing hours to cover the daily running of the shop.
good,Good company starting pay is very low. Good benefits. Don’t come in under temp agency they will make you stay a temp for 12 to 18 months. Apply directly to company.
good,"Poor Management. The work life balance was very good. You could work two days from home, which was nice. The work environment was relaxed. Job training was poor."
good,Most of the workforce seem to be demoralised. Management seem to be oblivious to the despondency and don't seem to care whether employees stay or leave.
good,"Like I said before the work is pretty simple but it will take up most of your time. On a typical day, we'd have over 45,000 orders that we would have to complete, and if the day started at 8:00pm, then it would end around 5 or 4:30am. The manager seems genuine and the supervisors individually coach new people in their training period which is very helpful especially if they're struggling. The hardest part for some people, as far as I've seen, was attendance. Other people had lives outside of work or a second job and sometimes they couldn't make it. The points you get for calling in sick and/or leaving early stack up if you don't have any sick time and it has lead to termination. Over the span of a season we lost a half of a full staff of around 60 people and most of it was due to getting too many points on attendance."
good,"It was an OK place to work. They did not pay well at all."
good,"Enjoyed the work, but RIF was common in the departments.  Once the items are absorbed completely, the newest procurement team becomes lead, which makes maintenance a little difficult"
good,"I enjoyed working at McKesson it was a great experience. However, the trolly ride at the scottsdale location was a bit inconvenient. Overall the staff was great!"
good,"It was a. temporary job.  It did educate me on Prior authorizations.  Also specialty medication and patient care. "
good,It was a decent place to work.  They tried having team building activities to build a fun place to work.  The employees were hard working and positive.
good,If you have children or are in school I'd stay away this job requires 90% of your time and energy with basically one day off most of your off time will be spent soaking or sleeping. Some really nice good people work there management is OK and fair it's not their fault that the overall it's not a good place
good,"Great company, learned a lot but very stressful. Lots of reorganization and very competitive. Ultimately, despite success our team was laid off. I would love to one day go back."
good,I traveled a lot as a material handler 3. We was called an IMO. Integrated Material operator. We traveled to different warehouses to train employees on how to pick with the new system.
good,"I worked about 10 hours a day, and it was a very nice corporate culture and work environment.  Projects are highly structured and competently managed."
good,"Can build a profitable territory and meet awesome customers. Unfortunately, the company is more interested in saving money than taking care of their employees and customers. No work life balance."
good,Good place to work people work with each other on a daily bass takes forever to get training done take there time to schedule management and leads are in no hurry
good,"Corporate America - healthcare industry, headquartered in San Francisco, CA with some divisions relocating to the Dallas/Fort Worth area beginning in 2018 thru 2020"
good,Since this was a place of business in the medical field of delivering medical supplies. The work load was always in demand and always something to do. I traveled all over Arkansas and it was neat getting to meet different people.
good,Work has been slow and just got to find something to do after they hired alot of people. The leadership will get you where you want if there is a position open.
good,"I feel like if I would've worked outside of maintenance I would've benefited greatly from that company. But with promises of moving up and better pay,  it never came."
good,"Dont bother working for them!! Terrible management,  pressure to hit unrealistic targets. no support with new initiatives then expect you to just get on with it. understaffed and underpaid most of the time."
good,"Good opportunity to understand the pace work in right way , gives you more skills and experience how to be patient with customer and provide them the right supplies."
good,"Great work environment! I used all my communications skill and saw my worth with this company. I was able to focus on the patients with medicine, escalations, shipments errors."
good,Indeed is making me write something here I mean it was alright it's kind of long hours and I got converted from a temp to permanent employee after six months
good,great job with good benefits. long hours and quick paced but if you concentrate in your job duties and assignments then you should have no problems. Always supportive and great teamwork!
good,I liked my shift. Pay was decent and work was steady. The company provides us breakfast every Thursday. The facility was fairly clean. No issues with pay every week
good,"After 14+ years new management came in and decided I was making too much money. They offered a pay reduction or severance. I took the severance on Nov. 1, 2017. McKesson is long gone in the rear view mirror."
good,"It was an ok job to work for. I was working with the rems program. I updated pharmacists info. Updated doctor's credentials."
good,"I loved my supervisor.  But felt the DC. Management were favoring the day shift and never followed up with third shift operations. The employees were so vast, and we're a hit or miss in how the were on a consistent basis.  But for the most part, a pleasant experience working there.  Really just came down to management politics.  Third shift was 5 percent of the overall employees."
good,Elgin Distribution Center is just after the quantity to shipped than quality. Unequal relationship between the manager and supervisor through subordinates
good,"WAS a cool place to work, but the supervisors made it an uncomfortable place to work!!! Their titles meant more to them than you!!! They show A LOT of favoritism!!! Kiss their butts and you’ll be fine."
good,training was short and not very informative. Management was not very approachable. We were in the basement with no daylight. Hours were horrible and they were not willing to work with you.
good,"My experience with McKesson was bittersweet. I loved my direct supervisor. There were two others one of whom I thought was fair and attentive to her staff. The other seemed to always go out of her way to ruin your day. Yes you find that at any job, but combined with physicians and collecting their money your day could be crazy if any of them were having a bad one."
good,Productive and fun workplace that offers good benefits and a great environment. I would recommend anyone apply here who is looking for a diverse workplace.
good,"Unorganized at times... lot's of silos. Not a lot of people that truly understand what is going on cross departmentally."
good,"On phone all day"
good,McKesson over all is a great place to work. The only think I ever complained about was the pay. The culture wasn't as great as it could be but the managers tried. They tried to create a positive working environment. The work itself is challenging in a positive way. You can be micromanaged by some supervisors but there are others who trust you to do the job.
good,"need better training material, better management help with managing the calls help managing the accounts records do not provide accurate info one good thing I can say is learned a lot about the billing."
good,"Lot's of changes happening at MCK here 5/2019, I'd be wary of taking an IT position until next year. It looks like the top is bringing in new management all the way around, so do think twice if you accept a position today."
good,I don't want to really give an opinion about the company.  Let everyone experience for themselves.  All I will say is that the manager was not educated on processing claims as he pretended he was and he always felt threaten by anyone with more knowledge.  He made everything personal and he showed it by the way he treated you.
good,"Change Healthcare is growing but we fail to get in front of the growth and appropriately communicate across the board, plan, staff, and have adequate systems available to do the job.   This makes the work culture highly stressful.  "
good,"I was placed in a corner to be a manager by contract.  The contract was not renewed based on cost of contract to hospital."
good,"At times it could be very difficult to advance in the company. Some days are very laid back others can be stressful due to the high turnover, culture is changing constantly."
good,Starting There Things Were Amazing But As Companies Begin To Grow They Lose Sight Of The Focus That Help Them Get To The Next Level. A Lot Of Changes.
good,"- Competitive salary"
good,"Super fast faced, little to no teamwork with the more experienced people. If you are slow you are in the way, and taking incentive money from the faster people, and they don't like that. The company tries to boost the morale by purchasing activity equipment for the break room, and healthier vending machine options."
good,"Steady culture but not dynamic enough and in danger of becoming another Nokia."
good,"Working is limited no room to move up and be ready for repetitive work but a fun atmosphere"
good,Worked on a pilot program that ended.  Pilot was PaySystems and I audited pharmacy invoices and collections.  I loved this position and was very dissappointed when company phased out the program.
good,I enjoyed working at Moore Medical.  I'm used to fast paced environments.  The work was easy so the training process was more like a shotgun course.  My fellow employees helped with some of the daily task.  We were a team and worked as a team regardless of the different departments we worked in.  I wish the warehouse didn't get shut down.
good,McKesson as a company is excellent to work for. McKesson HVS is another story.  The division of McKesson is not orgainized and they have no documentation. Management always points the finger before they asked the person what happened.
good,lack of Management opportunities. when directors left the company leadership just closed the position and and divided the work among the team leads. even when the leaving director told them to promote leads.
good,"Provides a diverse work experience with the ability to work from home."
good,McKesson aquired PSS in 2012 and the fun times I was promised when hired was GONE... Very little fun while McKesson. I liked WHAT I did but some of the sidebar conversations & small rules were not handled properly for the front lines-the employees
good,"Work life balance could've been better.  Upward management can be more engaging.  Communication between managers and staff can also improve."
good,Typically I'd start the day happy and end the day happy. Coworkers were extremely nice and easy to get along with. Management was very good also. Comfortable environment to work in.
good,"Hard to advance within company if you don't know anyone, not enough team involved ."
good,Was good place to work but cost pressure forced consolidation of business units which lost many jobs and is no longer innovative.  Too much reliance on outside consultants.
good,"Being out on the road working on my own and dealing with customers."
good,"entering data claims for insurances"
good,Mckesson is an overall great company to work for. My only issues were that management wasn't very good and you had to be a favorite for most of the things you wanted. It has light months and heavy months which most warehouses have. The hardest part of my job was keeping up to par on everything they watch you for. The most enjoyable part is that they have teams and have fun events for the associates.
good,They don't care much about the employees just the bottom line. and when they think they found a better way they don' think twice about letting you go with out compensation.
good,McKesson is slow to innovate and risk averse. Leadership governs by consensus and tends to reorganize in 18 month cycles leading to disruption in work and inability to realize benefits of process optimization cycles.
good,"I worked at Mckesson/RelayHealth for full-time (More than 5 years)"
good,It was a good work environment they took care of their employees. but they were too strict on cell phones they thought we would film how we did our job.
good,"Great company over all, management can be very rough around the edges, rewarding career minded opportunity. Not a lot of room for advancement, territories are limited. Unfortunately, the non-compete is hard to get around even in  right to work state, like Texas."
good,It was a good learning experience. Some of the supervisors were helpful. It was very repetitive with no room to grow well they weren't allowing us to move to different positions.
good,"Company has gone through many acquisitions without changing the management team. Therefore, changes in the culture have not occurred and are in desparate need."
good,"Business development of a medical coding/charge capture solution designed to improve hospital revenue cycle for emergency department and observation units. Successfully sold to existing McKesson EMR clients (Horizon & Paragon)."
good,"Never expect guidance, always appreciate it and take your role and run with it.  Don't ever be afraid to make a mistake, you can always learn from it and so can your leader."
good,work a total of an average of 10 hrs a day or until work is complete. workplace is face paced friendly dress is casual Mckesson provides us with orange shirts.
good,"It's been a few years since my employment with this organization, but I recall while there enjoying working within the accounting department. The size of the group was pretty large and I was able to build some good contacts that carried over to subsequent positions."
good,"Great experience, Good People, Great Site, Great Management, Great location, Great Food, Great Product, Great Benefits, Great, Cubicles, Awesome management,"
good,"I have no review on the company at this time due to lay off. A day in the life inboud calls, email and edi order processing. Aweome supervisors and co workers."
good,"Poor decisions and execution lead to demise of a strong product that needed some work.  Instead of putting in some effort to eliminate bugs in the software, the company choose to go another direction (see cheaper windows based product) and 3 years later that section of the company no longer exists."
good,Good place to work but you can't be a lazy person alot of over time can't have a second job some days you don't know when you will get off have to finish all work before you leave even if you have to go over time.
good,"Mckesson sold to a new company Axis Point Health and then management changed and job focus changed from disease management to gaps in care management,"
good,"Mckesson great place to work no direction it was nice when I worked for mckesson but changed companies great benefits but no advance ment, my supervisor is great to work for but they started out sourcing and it went sour after that"
good,Productive work environment. workplace culture was good. learned to draft agreements and amendments.  provided assistance on agreements which provided a learning environment for me.  Learned the different areas of the agreement and how to negotiate various agreements
good,Its a good office position for employing those in a small town that have other income sources in the home that need not depend on it solely. They have good benefits and consistent work flow.
good,it was a hard place to work it seen more there then  seeing your family  i like  the overtime that they were OFFERING  I  WAS GET OVER WHELMED   NEVER HAS SET  SHEDULE
good,There is no full cycle of communication at this company.  They go through many company changes and structure reorganization that doesn't accommodate a stable or peaceful work life.
good,"I got this job going through Remx, which is a temp placement company. McKesson was a decent place to work, the only thing that was a bit weird was the fact that the entire facility was underground in Old Town Scottsdale.  "
good,"Worked there for a year as a part time employee. Worked well with my school scheduling. Pretty easy job, just don't make mistakes. Cut throat to say the least."
good,"Lots of new managers that treat others as a number vs. a human being.  This was not always the case, but over the last few years this is what the largest change has been,"
good,"I did enjoyed working at McKesson and did learn a lot, but it was a very political environment. Most of the billing department was laid off. Not very secure job."
good,"A typical day at work was to log in to the computer, work your but off and go home.  Do it all again on your next scheduled business day.  Time away from the phones, i.e  restroom break, etc. was counted and there was a very unrealistic maximum monthly amount of time you could be logged of of the phones.  It made it difficult for times when there was illness or a females ""time of the month"" which takes a little longer inthe restrooms."
good,"Enjoyed working there, stayed busy quite often. enjoyed working with my coworkers. Learned a great deal as far as scanning and data entry. Very clean work environment. Was involved in some charity work."
good,"Didn't spend much time working here. Didn't get to learn much, lack of leadership and very quite environment. Was interesting to learn that there training counts for credits for college."
good,Lacks structure and there is next to no training on how best to do your job. NO product training at all. They sit you in a chair and tell you to do your best essentially.
good,"It is difficult to work up in this company. Slow to innovation for such a large company. Fair enough pay and work/life balance. "
good,Over all great company. There are always ways to make things better and i feel mckesson does whatever it takes to make sure there customers have the best service possible.
good,Its based off a numbers system. You have to be able to be over 85% in progress. Which is really hard when there is no work. You also get in trouble if you fall under that percentage and can be fired for it. Which doesn't make since when there is no work to be done. No wonder they  have a huge turn over rate. They set you up for failure
good,"In my opinion, McKesson is not a bad company to it's customers, but it's wasn't the right fit for me. Pay was low, management was inadequate and career advancement and growth was very limited. Although those negatives turned positive because it help me decide to go back to school and finish my degree."
good,"Although Mckesson has a strong focus on customer and employee, upward movement is limited and very political.  There are thousands of self study courses available through an online tool.  Overall culture is positive."
good,"My time at McKesson was a great experience. Like most working individuals I feel that the pay should be higher, but it does fall in place for the going pay rate in middle TN. It is one of the better places in the middle TN area to work."
good,Every day there was a challenge to complete but it was manageable. With a somewhat flexible schedule I could make appointments and still have my 40 hrs. in. The limitations that hospitals put on us sometimes made it too difficult to make the goals that needed to be achieved.
good,"management need to spent more time and money on team training, a lot of repeating actions, technology is obsolete and mixed with different platforms, agile methodology applied in wrong way"
good,If you don’t over think it you’re good. You get earned minutes as determined by engineering standards you want to come in under the required amount on a regular basis to be “positive” and can earn incentive pay if done consistently.Culture. Cliques. Not for me .
good,Worked as a contractor during the final days of being sold.  All I know is that they treated their employees with class and dignity. Especially the employees that were ready to retire.
good,"Normal day-to-day routine."
good,Co-worker are great people making teams great.  Supervisors are intensly focused on production but do not really know what the daily demands of employees are in order to meet production goals. It's a call center with heavy inbound call traffic and little time to document all work tasks.
good,"Nice company to work for but management in the location i was at was poor.Very busy fast pace working environment.everything we done there was in a professional manor,because we where shipping medical supplies to patients at there homes,"
good,"I can honestly say the culture and environment at McKesson was a breath of fresh air. The amazing benefits offered without having to wait 90-days to a year to start enjoying, quarterly bonuses, PTO beginning day 1. I worked with a small group of coworkers daily. Our warehouse only had one shift with about 13 employees including drivers and office staff. I can only imagine how larger DC's operate but I liked it here."
good,J'ai appris à devenir très débrouillarde. J'ai aussi appris à m'ouvrir plus aux gens avec qui je travaille
good,"Working here I was excited to come in to do my job. Knowing my research would help my patients made the job very rewarding. Great place to work, Great position."
good,"•	Able to manage time productively, handle multiple projects simultaneously, and perform well under pressure"
good,Recently culture is shifting a lot. Company is switching to SAFe methodology which is a good thing but also caused confusion. Overall a good company and encourage growth.
good,Hard work incredibly fast paced and stressful. You are rated for performance and every mistake you make you will be given is counted electronically and few are allowed before you will get a write up. You literally never stop for sometimes 13 hours and some managers are very antagonistic and constantly negative.
good,I miss my Job and I would do anything to go back! I was very familiar with the work so I know I would of been perfect If I would of went permanent! My brother had passed away and that was the same day they let me go which was wrong but oh well.
good,Great place to work! Besides the stress that comes with the job. Management is not the best but they get the job done. I learned a lot about how the company works and I wish I could have moved up in the business.
good,"They do not appreciate, the hard work and dedication of Employees.  Higher management Over work employs.  Employees are always leaving the job.  They hire you for one position but make you do others."
good,"nice place to work"
good,I recommend it. Great place to work but has its ups and downs at times because mostly people think they know everything. The benefits are great. Sometimes it gets busy around the holidays and it becomes stressful at times. Very spacious
good,"The job is very relaxing and understanding, some times the job can become stressful with speaking with customers. Work hours are very lengthy and long hours."
good,"Learning the position was challenging, however ultimately I learned and loved the job that  was assigned. The Benefit Package after initial 90 days of Service is very generous great place to learn to process Medical Claims."
good,"Little to no organization with this company. There is also extreme favoritism for certain ""clicks"" and if your not a ""member"" of said ""click""...good luck."
good,"Concepts developed in house need better market definition for them to succeed. While technology advancements were identified to create  more ROI, the need for increase margins was not a business pain point."
good,Disappointed That This Company Was Sold .in Trying To Remain Positive and Not Project A Negative  Attitude ..so I Elect not To Project a Condescending attitude
good,"I liked the benefits, pay and vacation time given. The reimbursement for education purposes was given to employees obtaining a BA degree not a MA. The company focused on customer service"
good,"Punch in, start accepting orders. Either walk to bin locations or drive forklift. Each member of the team had two 15 minute breaks and one 30 min lunch/dinner."
good,"Good company on the cutting-edge of technology. I'd probably still be there if I wasn't laid off. I did not care for my manager at the time, but was able to deal with it"
good,Nice place to work if you enjoy customer service and being on phones for the duration of your day. The people were nice and I enjoyed being able to have a schedule that was conducive to my children's schedul
good,"Management here is horrible. Lack of respect for employees. Pay is pretty good but the bonus structure in sales does not make sense and hasn't been changed in years. Hard work is not rewarded with compensation. Overall, you are treated fairly well and if you brown nose you can make it to management."
good,I had a good experience working at Mckesson. However I did not like having to work so long with no benefits. I worked there for a year and half and was let go and not made perm.
good,Had my complaints while employed. Learned it could be a lot worse. Mckesson promotes life outside of work and gives plenty of vacation time for long term employees. At the end of the day you are just s number.
good,"Call center for inbound calls of approximately 100+ per day for eight hours a day Monday thru Friday. I compared the stress to that of working in an emergency room.  However, it provided me with additional customer service skills and experience.  I love to learn new  computer programs and skills.  I believe that is how a person grows."
good,"McKesson Pharmaceuticals is a good place to work. The pay is competitive, and the benefits are as well. There is room for growth, and they look to promote from within."
good,Great  staff and  company. Temp to hire was always making me a paranoid employee but it was overall a fun place to work and the training was well. I appreciated the time here.
good,Traveled with my job and truly enjoyed it.  Great group of co-workers that I continue friendships with.  I learned how to deal with difficult people and not let it get to me.
good,This was a temporary position I do not know the logistics of the company except that they hire all temporary to hire positions. Seems a very small amount of temps are actually hired on with McKesson.
good,"It's okay workplace."
good,Job can be stressful! Opportunity for advancement for top performers.  Learned a great deal about healthcare working here. Decent benefits and PTO is great!
good,"Fast paced , engineered standard measured environment. "
good,Les employés de longue date font en sorte de faire partir les nouveaux employés.
good,"A good place to work. Although with all the M and A activity it may no longer be. I did like my time here, although it does not compare to the government sector."
good,Management not totally respected. Expect change that is not always beneficial to the business. Multiple sites and as a satellite office all the expected support not provided.
good,"Good place to work, immediate management was very good.  Organization went through multiple changes while I was there and ultimately led to a series of downsizing events"
good,"staff are trained."
good,I like to work here.  Just went through merger.  We are still leraning about how the company will be managed.  We have some input on upcoming and proposed changes.
good,You just have to put your head down and do your best.  Ignore all the static around you and the be affirmative and confident in what you do.  Be willing to learn new things and take constructive criticism as well as ideas from others that might streamline your duties.
good,Loved the folks I worked with. Cared deeply about the products and services provided. Direction of the company ultimately close many there positions. I know staff I worked with would give anything to be still working as the collaborative team we had.
good,This was a great company to work for like most companies there are various of areas through out management training etc that can be worked on to improve the experience. Also if they are able to hire temp agents sooner than 90 days that would be a plus on the company will not have a high turn over.
good,"McKesson provides a solid space for employment within the healthcare space.  However, it seems that more opportunities within McKesson are available to employees who work at locations outside of The Woodlands, Texas."
good,"Friendly work environment, accessible management, call center with heavy phone work. Customer service helping patients receive needed medication very rewarding."
good,"McKesson is a big pharma company. Distributes drugs all over the world. There are some internal conflicts, i.e. procurement decisions are made on the golf course rather than the IT division."
good,"I was brought into this QA position by Spherion Staffing. I am grateful for this position because it was my entree into the field of Quality, but the pay was poor, no opportunity for direct hire, and the QA Supervisor was extremely difficult to work for which resulted in a high turnover rate in our department."
good,"Mckesson was/is a great place to work. If you're on 1st shift, 3rd shift sucks!"
good,A good place to work. Start early in the morning to late at night stay focused on task at hand. Every one seams willing to help you learn your job....
good,I had started off in the call center and moved up through the years. I was with McKesson and it changed owners for 12 years. I was a radiation oncology specialist before I left. We would process claims and investigate claims that were denied by the health insurance companies.
good,"Terrible, bad, not good.  Management poor, CEO poor.  Lack of communication.  There is no more for me to tell at this point.  Layoffs happening all over for this company."
good,"I have no comment surrounding the current working conditions while at Change Healthcare, therefore, I should not be required to type in the minimum required word count to accommodate this portion of the registration process...."
good,"Learned a lot about the industry while working there. Co-workers where very helpful and friendly. However, due to management people were stressed and felt unappreciated."
good,Mckesson is a wonderful company to work for with benefits. The company is growing and doing a lot for the community. The attendance policy is very strict.
good,"Overall McKesson is a great company to work for , however with all the changes going on it has became a very stressful environment to be in at this point"
good,"McKesson was such a good and fun place to work in the beginning, but they had gone though so many layoffs and it is no longer a good company to work. The company is recently sold to Allscripts."
good,"My position responsible for managing the IT functions for another Health Systems.  Because of this, it was difficult to feel like you were part of the McKesson community."
good,Poor Management and Inconsistent. The management showed favoritism towards certain individuals. The pay is not enough for the amount of work you are required to do.
good,A typical day at work would be unloading trucks daily and sorting packages to be put on pallets to be stocked. No AC in the warehouse which made it difficult to work some days.
good,"I loved working at Mckesson from the shipping department where I learned a lot about warehousing business to purchasing department where I learned even more about dealing with vendors and sales department. However, there was no more room for advancement in my department, so I left to attend college."
good,McKesson is a large company and twenty years ago they were expanding and buying small companies. McKesson did work to integrate the smaller companies into one corporation.
good,"I was there for about four months.  Once I got basic system in place and documented, the job was over.  I did not particularly like the work atmosphere but that could have just been my work group."
good,They did forget to let me know my time was not approved one week.  Would watch your time. Check online and make sure its approved or you will get not pay check on Friday;
good,"I researched inquires to correspondence on insurance coverage.  Pulled and copied patient billed/charges for requests to EOB's.  Entered comments to claims and updates, insurance information for proper billing and claim files.  Batched and verified charges to CPT codes to be posted.  Keyed and posted payments via credit cards, self-pays, and insurance adjustments.  Balanced batches daily and requested hard copies and statements when requested."
good,Company that provides great benefits and wellness opportunities for those who need it. Very educated company on healthcare initiatives. Hardest part of working at McKesson is trusting the management team to do what they say they are going to do.
good,McKesson is a pretty  nice place to work if your looking for a job just to work but they have savage kind office politics that could drive one mad but that almost anywhere
good,Great place to start off. Not much room for advancement so if you are looking for a place to grow there is not a ton of opportunity here. PTO and benefits are comparable to the market. Pay not great.
good,"Western Ontario deliveries to hospitals and drug stores"
good,"Management was very nice, and very knowledgeable. Very patient and helpful. However, to the fast paced and VERY hot warehouse environment; people would did not stay very long."
good,"Extremely stressful environment.  The only incentives were trying to feed their employees.  The pay is not enough to be considered a ""It related position."""

good,"- strict on start-time of work in the morning"
good,Great benefits but lacking in career advancements. Best department to work for is IT. Growing company but not oriented in advancement within the company.
good,"I 've learned a lot about the field, and I've grown as a person. I enjoy what the job entails. You have so much work the day goes by very quickly.  I would recommend if you liked to be micromanaged and constantly be under pressure."
good,Flexible scheduling. Start as early as 7am up to 9am. Must work full 8 hours. Learned skills applicable to current position. There was NO cross training. Management lacked communication. The hardest part of the job was getting past the micromanaging. Perhaps it was only in that particular department but it often felt like we weren't trusted to do our jobs. The most enjoyable part of the job was payday and clock out time.
good,"I would recommend this to anyone - good to learn new skills here and develop. Staff are great here, too. They sometimes gave you free pizza, too! I got it through an agency."
good,"This company had its pros and cons, the management team wasn't very communicable with its employees, had very little to none, extended training for employees looking to move up within the company."
good,"Very fast paced job, required to learn new programming languages on a short notice and become proficient in less than two weeks. Consultant turnaround was incredibly high (about 3 months)"
good,very stressful job dealing with real time information within a hospital setting. I was told that working 40 hours is not enough for this job. Not to say I was just going to work 40 hours but to have it explained to me that way was a turn off.
good,From what I remember this was a good company to work for.  Could be very political at times but overall I would say it is a good company.  They have always been very competitive in the healthcare industry.
good,"Mckesson is a good place to work, sometimes long hours and hard work but good pay. work to life balance is sometimes not good long hours,but fair pay and sometimes they will buy lunch. overall if you are looking for job security and good pay mckesson is the right place for you. but if your looking not to work hard or slow paced then mckesson isnt for you"
good,"A typical day at McKesson starts early mornings, loading freight onto trailers or box trucks. Preparing and prioritizing orders for customers delivery. Management at McKesson are in touch with their employees, making you feel like your appreciated. The workplace culture Is family oriented and at ease less stressful. The most enjoyable part of my job is the smile we receive from customers, when orders are delivered in a timely manner."
good,"Okay place to work.  Very production driven, client is very particular to work with.  High turnover in all departments. Good place to work is one is satisfied with their job and does not have an interest in moving up in the company"
good,"Recently laid off half the staff, moving a majority of the work we do overseas. No job security, fired people who worked there for 15+ years and worked harder than people who stayed but new people are still there."
good,Management needs to be better benefits are great hours aren't the best but are getting cut down workers are good people paid time off is pretty decent
good,I worked at McKessons Clear brook VA location. The money was good the work wasn't bad. However they don't give you a set time to leave. You could work 8 hours or 15 and asking seemed to be a problem. Over all the money was great and  enjoyed working with my team.
good,They pay most employees well and some departments are monday to friday. Leadership does give a lot of feedback. Unfortunately most departments are contracted by the government so your job is not secure.
good,"I trained a lot of employees on how to bill Medicaid correctly."
good,"Good benefits and profit sharing"
good,"Very specialized and detailed type of work. I learned a lot about pharmaceutical products. Management was a small group of 2 supervisor and 3 Head managers. The hardest part of the job was to multiplicity of products."
good,There is not a lot of variety in daily tasks.The opportunity to take time off is almost nonexistent. The benefits are not great. But at least it is a job.
good,"This is a great fun place to see work. Lots of activities during work, however job security is not very good here. Constantly switching from one contract to another."
good,My position has been terminated and currently looking for new position within the recruiting industry. they have chosen a different type of veteran recruiting.
good,"fast pace scheduling and answering calls approximately 15-20 and hour. scheduling for multiple doctors approximately 100 doctors.  Each doctor has his or her own way of scheduling patients, wanting to distinguishing  what calls are important and what can wait. Sending emails to the perspective office concerning their patients"
good,Large organization still trying to evolve.  Desire to move in different directions compared to its historical business model.  Needs to muster the courage to take some steps that are a departure from its traditional business model.
good,Lines for the bathrooms and only a small limited time for breaks. Very good other than that. I have a fun time in my section holding down the WFM side
good,Good company great management work was not hard AC throw out the warehouse pizza every Friday pay was good in u was off on the weekends hardest part of the job was cleaning up.

good,"It's an okay job, nothing special, pay is competitive, office is nice, but that's about it, people are hit or miss and the policies change with the seasons."
good,I enjoyed working with many smart people where I learned something everyday. The culture allowed me to enhance my project management skill set and meet the corporate objectives at the same time.
good,This job was ok.  You sat at a desk all day and filed insurance claims.  You also researched why insurance claims were not properly filed.
good,"•	Handled all incoming calls  "
good,great company good culture but the corporation did not have a software development culture which is understandable they are in the business of surgical supplies
good,Great job too long to wait to get hired on fulltime. You start off as a contractor with remx staffing. They tell you it will take 4 months to get hired but it can take up to 18 months. McKesson will wait as long as they have to in order to make you perm.
good,Each day presents new challenges to be better than yesterday. Great place to get a variety of experience and grow your career. Long term growth could be hindered by log jam at the top.
good,The people and the atmosphere is great but the company I feel needs to treat there employees as equals. I've been there 8 years and feel I wasn't give the same respect as some others.
good,"Good place to work, sometimes give incentives to push you harder, so a rewarding place to work! Often challenging but plenty of support from staff and management."
good,"day to day included customer assistance within the Medicare Part B program. Ordering Med B products, reconciling any customer issues, billing out customer claims to their insurance and the Med B program."
good,McKesson is always going through multiple layoffs on a yearly basis. Leadership changes like a revolving door. Co-workers were great and the ability to work remote. The hardest part of the job was working with the other division leaders.The most enjoyable was working with my team.
good,Worked with a good group of people and learned a lot.  Spent a lot of time with Microsoft Server and SQL.  Enjoyed my time there.
good,It is a job. You go in and work and get the job done. No bells and whistles. I work at night. I would rather work during the day.
good,"McKesson is a place of constant restructuring.  And your job could be going to India like mine is.  And the upper management has no clue what is going on.  Before I found out my job was being shipped off to India, I did enjoy working there.  The work itself was enjoyable and the people I was around are great."
good,"great benefits, good office environment, hardest part is not being able to replace employees when you loose them. This puts a real strain on the other staff"
good,This job was somewhat stressful at times. I was the supervisor over 25 employees. We did medical billing for nine to ten radiology clients. They outsourced their billing to us and we did everything front to back.
good,"Very big corporation with some pockets of innovation.  Slow and risk averse.  Benefits are OK, not great.  Surprisingly expensive drug coverage considering the business it's in.  Lots of politics and bureaucracy."
good,"Good company Learned all aspects of EMS billing. Co-workers nice almost all women. Hours great. Mid management poor, Most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was dealing with young managers."
good,Early starts.One to two hours of warehouse work. Load my own truck.Make deliveries across the state to medical offices.
good,"Amazing people work here, I loved this job so much. Very easy work. Management needs tons of improvement and to avoid favoritism. Progression pay is good, plenty of overtime and benifts and incentive is good"
good,overtime and short staff wtih such a long commute is not what i want to continue at this point but i have had overall a great expierence with this company i have stayed almost 17 yrs and have had no major concerns that were not addressed when i correlated with mangmt
good,Management very approachable.  Co-workers supportive and very talented.  Fun place to work.  competitive salary. worked remotely.
good,Worked with customers and sale executives face to face on a daily basis. Enjoyed learning about the medical industry which I will continue to invest time to learn.
good,"I enjoyed this company overall.  My experience was limited to a small office in which there was little room for advancement.  The company does reward higher positions well and values hard work; however, at lower levels employees are not regularly considered for advancement, nor does management consider the work employees do as valuable to the overall success of the operation.  If you can get in as a mid-level employee or higher, then this employer is great."
good,"Good pay, good benefits. Treated with respect by fellow employees. Very fast paced which made time fly....great incentives as well."
good,"McKesson is defiantly the go to place to learn Medical Billing. No experience required. All training is done within the building, and there is also great benefits."
good,"very busy and fast paced. You deal with medical supplies and shipping, receiving and stocking items. Management was my only concern but coworkers were good"
good,Good company but too lean so everyone has to work beyond their means.  Co-workers are great but those that aren't are impossible to fire.
good,"Word environment made doing day to day tasks routine, sometimes to the point where it become mundane. The management is fairly friendly; however, some times verifying policy and procedure became more about what you were last told than what you could verify in writing. Upward movement seemed very limited."
good,McKesson is a great place to work. Its a fast paced environment with a very strong team. The hours are long but the job is easy to learn and the pay is good
good,The office can be fun but there isn't any career pathing unless you're willing to relocate to another location. The job is ok but it's definitely just that...a job.
good,XOMA has a policy of matching salaries and benefits to the market. The management care about the well being of employees. Work atmosphere is friendly.
good,The IT department needed an extra hand in writing reports for the users.  I stepped in.  I became familiar with the databases and was able to create the reports the users needed.
good,Everyday was the same unless a co-worker had a new story to share from their personal life. Supervisors use time at company as the gauge for new tasks/responsibilities.
good,"Learnt many new things in this project"
good,Its just like any other job with its peaks and lows in hours. we went from 50-60 hours a week down to 40-42 because the company that made tens of billions of dollars last year in profits wants to be greedy and cut the pay checks of their workers for they can have a bigger profit margin then they already have.
good,"flexible hours and work place"
good,"Different business units with different goals and objectives."
good,"My typical day at work is helping patients with their billing and collections issues. This can range from demographics, insurance corrections and updates. Tasking to AR Reps for insurance claims follow-ups and coding corrections from the practices. "
good,"Great place to work.  Great co-workers. Great clients. When traveling, staff gets to keep loyalty points for personal use."
good,"Company has great reputation in industry"
good,For the most part it is a great company to work for.  I am just interested in looking for other opportunities that I can use my skills in.  My coworkers and managers are a great team to work with.
good,"In a typical day at McKesson, I am responsible for handling many accounts billing issues for multiple clients.  We are primarily responsible for contacting insurance companies to determine the reason for the denial and find resolutions for getting the claims processed for the pathology labs.  Our responsibilities also include complete what we call Account Actions, in which is actually documented calls received in our PSR (Patient Service Reps) department regarding complaints, concerns, payments, etc.  Also, in addition, any correspondence the is received is also the responsibility of the AR department.  All accounts are worked to completion."
good,"Overall, I've worked in the Data Center Operations for McKesson for 14+ years.  The management of the Data Center value hard work and knowledgeable employees.  A typical day at work involves incident and change management, acknowledging, prioritizing, and assigning issues as they arise.  Issues could include anything from mass outages on remote sites, delayed shipping from distribution centers, to server and network issues.  When things are going smoothly, it can be a very stress-free workday, but when issues do come up, it can get very busy.  Management within my dept is great, they are the biggest reason that I've stayed with the company for as long as I have."
good,"The company itself is great to work for, but the department im in needs improvement. I love the people that I work with and the environment. "
good,"Sometimes the pace can be very fast. Often there is too much work an not enough time. However, you can expect a lot of collaboration among the teams, and help is an email away. Great place to work but the product line has run its course and the company is harvesting. At this time there is little or no job security."
good,Fixing problems and creating reports is the full amount of what you do all day. You are constantly on your toes moving around to different issues.
good,Ample opportunities for upward mobilization. Diverse and friendly staff. Steady flow of work. Leading pharmaceutical company in Canada. Very welcoming.
good,"picking,packing and shipping medical supplies to the homes of patients adults and children alike loading and unloading trucks keeping the warehouse clean at all times."
good,MedSurg business unit has gone through many changes since the PSS acquisition.  The PSS culture was not carried over to the McKesson team.
good,"I don't want to make it sound like this is a horrible job, there are some positives. The latest shift ends at 5pm, there is a lot of eating, and you get paid to answer phone calls. The problem is the amount of phone calls that you take. Your going to get slammed and breaks will be shorter because of it. At the end of the day, your just burned out by the time you finish. Your asked to bluntly lie to the patients and it is not a guaranteed full time position when they tell you it will be. The pay is little and you get the impression that they do not care about you. I have seen pregnant employees receive points for having to leave the job to have their baby delivered. Take this job only if you really need work."
good,"Great place to work, but you will Operated cash register, processed customer orders and resolved customer complaints. "
good,"a great place to work, the environment is wonderful and friendly, great training. co workers are nice and willing to help when in need."
good,"From my short time there the staff seemed friendly, i didn't have the opportunity to get to know everyone. The manager was supportive and understanding of personal time, like longer lunches and leaving earlier due to doctor appointment or child care. She allowed you to come early or stay late to make up time."
good,"Interesting work place with supportive management. There was a considerable amount of office politics that has enabled me to personally, as well as professionally grow.  The tasks and duties of each day also provide a variety of projects that were challenging and enlightening."
good,"Entering cpt codes in the system & findin solutions for denial claims"
good,McKesson takes care  of the warehouse associates. The associates are paid well and have good benefits. The warehouse is well kept with air temp control to a big lunchroom with all the amenities.
good,A nice community to work in and have gained experience with a number of different customers. I have learnt alot about procedures and as it is a big company there is always someone to refer to if you have any questions or need help with anything.
good,"Nice new building for corporate HQ in Richmond, VA.  Other than that, I don't wish to review at this time. Benefits are probably better than most places."
good,Fun work place with supportive management.  Very focused on numbers and also helping you personally grow and develop.  Decent amount of red tape but this is typical with a large company.  Most enjoyable part of this job is working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"It was a great place to work until just before the buyout of my division was announced, then many changes in atmosphere and expectations.  Things went downhill rapidly in my opinion."
good,"Fun work place, very supportive with remote positions.  Most management though resides in other states sometimes never personally meeting their staff."
good,Good Place To Work with Good advancement. Friendly staff and Friendly management. They also provided good benefits and a good opportunity to advance.
good,"I was part of the McKesson Connected Care and Analytics but was that division was bought by a private equity firm, renamed us Axispoint Health."
good,what can I say dealing with insurance companies is well you know. At least is was close to my husband so we could have lunch together every day.
good,"Fast-paced with lots of change.  Growth industry.  Has its ups and downs.  Management is uneven.  Not much more to say.  These prompts will not let me progress unless I type more, so I'm typing more."
good,Heavy work load at times. Learned on the in & outs of the medical billing world. Management was not stable but co-workers worked as a team. Nothing really too hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming together for potlucks or Holidays.
good,"Pretty good company to work for, depending on the business unit and location.  You will be able to grow and advance if you are able to work for the right manager."
good,"they provided training for your position and potential to move up in company. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. "
good,"You are busy all day managing accounts and providing solutions for patients. Your work load varies by position. If you don't like much change, this is the place to go. You will end up doing just about the same things every day. My biggest complaint is that if you don't like drama, RUN AWAY. Although the people are kind, there is alot of drama that is around the office here. The best solution is to just keep to yourself and work hard."
good,"fast paced, continually changing, feeling of no job security but offer good benefits and perks to employees.  Great people to work with."
good,Inbound calls coming in from providers and Patients. Should of been more training for the staff. A lot of miss-communication in the facility. Needed to be more organized.
good,Cubical covered work place with wonderful co-works. Advancement is endless if you keep to your work and really try to go above and beyond.
good,"The people I worked with were great, very capable and hard-working.  Have made life-long friends with some as well.  Management, however, never looks at the long view - only what have you done for me lately.  The team I was on was not highly regarded because of internal politics not our work or efforts."
good,regular daily routines are carried out maintaining stock of the shop. high amount of pressure from management to ensure sales are high
good,I Worked as a service advisor. I enjoyed being there but since its commission based your pay will vary alot. pay is not stable nor your schedule.
good,"Super busy, fast pace, management and co workers are all team players. Always learning, constant changes for health care needs. Love helping patients."
good,"A typical day involves assigning all staff members their tasks for the day.Conversing with the Pharmacist on what we are going to achieve for the day.IE: at least 2 MUR's and as many NMS as possible.Making sure that there is always a member of staff on the Shopfloor to help with any Customer queries Etc."
good,The treated you very well. It is hard to advance. It's a small town so high paying positions rarely open up. I really liked a lot of people who worked there.
good,Worked here through a temp agency assignements vary. Theyre too strict... Management is cool but very strict. The office was great.
good,Sorting and packaging prescription medicine for giant eagle through out the area.  It was fast paste and very tight security.  Each medication was sorted by individual orders
good,"No advancement opportunities are available and wage scale is poor.  The company itself offers very good benefits, but no cross-training is given to improve your knowledge for advancement or to be more of an asset to the company."
good,Typical day would be posting payments. Reading EOB'S and adjusting payments.  Make outbound calls to patients to set up payment plan.
good,"I loved doing my work experience at the Pharmacy because all the co-workers were very friendly to me and i got on very well with everyone. I learned that there are different aspects to the job, also that being a pharmacist you will need some qualifications. I never really found the work hard but what I struggled with was trying to reach the high shelves because I am a short person. There was always someone there to help me or I was given a stool to stand on. For my safety I was not allowed to stand on the chairs to reach the high places in-case I fell off and injured myself. My most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers and  attending to their needs."
good,Very professional..I learned a lot about distribution operations and Six Sigma.  I would definitely recommend this company to a friend.

good,"lack of growth opportunities, leadership doesnt value internal promotion, nepotism."

The co-workers are easy to get along with and the environment is culturally diverse.  They have lot's of potlucks and decorate your desk for you birthday.

good,"My typical day at works was answering patient phone calls, answering customer questions about there statements. Appealed claims then they were denied. I realy had good co-workers. The management were not all on the same page. I had worked for the company for 2 years when Mc Kesson bought them out. They kept all the supervisors and they some to have a hugh problem adjusting to the new company. The prevouis company was more laided back and they did pretty much what they wanted. But McKesson was totaly different."
good,I have enjoyed my time at MHS and would recommend it. The pluses are the people and the concern the company shows it employees.
good,"A typical day at work starts off with a daily 15 minute stand-up scrum meeting. After, the day usually consists of a heavy load of testing. A tough skin is definitely needed, because sometimes people will get a little personal. The hardest part of the job is lack of communication, the most enjoyable is getting to the end of a sprint and having everything complete and come together seamlessly."
good,"Typical day is dealing with public,orders to be put away,general retail duties."
good,Administrative Assistant to Executive Director of Revenue Management Solutions
good,one of few places that care about employee development
good,"A plus is the ability to telecommute, but I believe that is what lead to my teams dismissal. Our replacements are now located in Mexico. Management is hit or miss. This is not a Technology company so the technicians are not that valued. The job is expected for a Senior Oracle DBA, and there were bonuses. The companies community involvement is commendable. If your skills are deemed as valued, the skies the limit."
good,They were a good company until about 4 years before I left. Went through downsizing. I don't know what it is like now.
good,process telephonic customer orders
good,"Great benefits, and competitive pay. All new hires work graveyard shift which can be hard for some. No room for advancement, without a degree."
good,"I really enjoy talking to the patients everyday, I have learned that there are different ethnicity groups and everyone does not think the same. I also learned that everyone has different problems in their life. I did not find my job to be hard at all everything is a learning experience."
good,good company provided benefits. most enjoyable is being there for several years and the ground level employees forming tight family bonds.
good,What I enjoyed most about working for McKesson was to learn how healthcare IT worked.
good,busy trying to satisfy client. Learned what the client required. Worked with management.
good,"McKesson is a multi billion dollar company, 1/3 of medicine in the United States comes from McKesson. My typical work night starts at 6pm and consists of making sure the fartherest orders that we deliver get on the truck and out to Montana on time. The warehouse has an intercom system that can be heard all over; any employee that calls for help or needs anything i wil attend to. I have learned many skills over the past two years, box cutting, time management, employee comunication and mastering power equipment are just a few important named. We have pretty new and young night shift managers whom are still learning their jobs at McKesson so working through problems are becoming a nightly challenge. My co-workers are just like any co workers; there are some good ones and some that can be lazy at time but over the years we all become a family no matter what. Nights usually end between 330am and 530am; at the end of the night i have to make sure all the medicine has reached the shipping dock and is ready for day time truck drivers."
good,"processing of anesthesia charges for 72 anesthesiologists and demo code for accuracy. I've learned to work with patience and at the same time get charges process. Management said I need to concentrate as to avoid errors. We had an small office that employed 10 but I was like enough. I found it difficult to address my questions, the manager was not always present but the most enjoyable part of this job is the satisfaction of processing workload on time."
good,With on the job classes and training I learned the functions of the company product
good,Its ok uf you want to get in shape! You will be walkin all night!
good,"The work was interesting, and I was impressed with my colleagues. The morale was low because employees were not valued, but I'm told things have improved."
good,"Mckesson/Rxcrossroads was a good company, we made sure our customers are happy and have the Medication that they need .check the address labels to make sure it's going to the right Destination and making boxes that go with the Products and the right ice ."
good,"Worked on the inbound department - typical work day is vary depend how many shipments are delivering, and also required to assist outbound department when they are overwhelm with lines to be picked."
good,good place to work team supportive flexi time casual dress training given personal development slightly disorganised internally workstations a bit uncomfortabe  and some noise pollution from telephones ringing
good,"When it came to worki for McKesson, the hardest part of my job was never knowing what time I would be getting off making it hard to have a life outside of work. The culture at my location wasn't so positive on a daily basis, a lot of in house drama and between management and employees. I learned that I do have what it takes to work with a team and lead to be a key part of that team. Not to be afraid to speak my mind when it comes to how I'm feeling or any ideas I have."
good,"I held 3 different titles while at McKesson. "
good,Fine company to work for but the work itself isn't for everyone. Very repetitive and can be mind-numbing at times. The choice of shift for me can sometimes be a problem because it doesn't leave much time for a personal life.
good,Overall enjoyable experience working for company with solid structure and established Management. Benefits are good and though the work/life balance was not the best I still enjoyed my employment.
good,Was a good job employees were great mgrs were ok pay could’ve been better. Typical day would unload trucks with freight and check in orders and send products to other places in Warehouse to put away and when receiving was done put it all away until end of shift
good,"Great place for advancement if you are located in the Fort Worth, Texas area. Not so much if you work in the Charlotte, NC location. Good work culture without clear path for advancement."
good,My huge issue is that while your are a temp the health insurance is horrible. I waited 11m & was never converted. The company is only allow to have a certain amount of employees & the rest have to b temps. I met a lady who has been there for 18m&was still not converted. I was told conv was in9m
good,Environment is very micro managed and not based on trust. Only employees that are willing to be put into multiple management tests will be successful. Not a lot of inter team communication.
good,"Interesting company with good, friendly people around."
good,"Typical day/Log in at 8am-pull a case from the system and start your benefit investigation /your may have to make that same call to the same company up to three times to make sure you were told the same thing from each pharmacy rep, your expected to close 16 cases a day, but some days that's not possible depending on the hold time/transfers and plain old miss information/ for the most part this is a good company."
good,"It's a call center. There are many different teams and lots of people around. That part is great. However if you want to move up in this company you need to be able to be a supervisor's favorite employee on the team. They get the special projects, the OT and the 1st chance to move up in the company. Pay is not worth it, we do the job functions of 3 or 4 people and they won't give us a raise. However the benefits are very nice. Good amount of time off as well. Just be careful who you make friends with"
good,Great place to work for. The people are amazing there and are very welcoming in the area. The food trucks were amazing to eat of off. The space creates a great working environment.
good,"the job was easy to handle, payments were all credit card.  company moved credit and collections to corp office in Florida. Hired me knowing this and after 2  months came and advised of the lay off"
good,"good company.  not a great work environment, but definitely better than most. technology and mindset can be dated.  Culture is more reserved than some, but not as top down as I have experienced at other companies."
good,"I learned how to operate a reach and order picker forklift."
good,"Although, they had been looking for some to fill the position, the group/department didnt have any process or goals for bringing someone new to the company on-board.  They would send you to a general overall training - but nothing specific about your department."
good,"Good in training staff, plenty of opportunities to build a career and acquire transferrable skills. However this company lacks incentives when setting targets."
good,"The team I was employed with, the management team was always in meetings.  There was hardly any management on the floor.  We had a SME, but that person couldn't help the employees on the floor while the managers were in meetings because she was not properly trained.  She wouldn't even take call escalations."
good,I enjoyed my time at McKesson.  Once AllScripts took over things were very disorganized and without purpose.  The acquisition was too rushed and not planned out well.
good,"McKesson is not a bad place to work, most people are nice.  Case workers are underpaid for the amount of work expected."
good,"Very good company to work for, however the pace is not suitable for a lot of people causing too much stress and conflict."
good,"The culture at McKesson is great. Some of my critiques would include poor vertical mobility. Great horizontal mobility however. Some managers are good, some are terrible and don’t know what they are doing. Amazing facility. Overall good place to work. 3/5 stars."
good,Large corporation continuing to grow. Since combining with the corporate office the culture has drastically changed. They seem to be trying to find the right IT processes and methodology to use but fail at communicating or getting employee feedback. Management in the IT department I was in liked to think they knew where your skills fit better than you did.
good,"Very nice and friendly  environment"
good,direct people to different locations of warehouse to get job done.how to do all functions .best part of my job is helping people when they need help.and saving lives daily
good,Mckesson is a solid place to work but there are definitely long nights and overtime for warehouse workers is mandatory. Supervisor are also required to spend long nights at the office to complete administrative work while still engaging with staff. Be prepared to work hard if your want to play hard!
good,"A typical workday was extremely fast paced."
good,"Very hierarchical, little chance for advancement, but great home work life balance.  Lots of meeting with teams, that most of the time ended up being unproductive."
good,"My experience working at McKesson was fair, just it wasn't a guaranteed that you would have a job the next day . Management was fair, just a lot change in the company may because,  50% of the staff was contracted. "
good,"Everyone is paid about the same. A raise every six months for the first 18 months and there is a bonus system for picking more, accurately. I don't feel like the system is set up very fairly though as some areas are harder to make rate. Many people don't try for the bonus as you have to work really hard to make much of one. Plus in my warehouse you rely on your coworkers to set you up to do well and some people are not smart team players. Plus managers and supervisors don't seem to set people up either. Like not restocking the bubble wrap and missing location barcodes which slow people down. You tell them about it, but they never do anything about it. My warehouse is an older one and it has gotten slightly better over the last year. Maybe the more modern ones are more organized."
good,"MCKESSON was an awesome company to work for, but the limitedness in advancement and lack of acknowledgment with personal strengths for increases in income was very restricted."
good,"It was a good place to work. They have gotten out of software business, so I was laid off with decent package when company decided the department revenue was not meeting target. The rest of the team were off shored later with not so good packages."
good,A typical work at McKesson is logging into remedy and seeing what  remedy tickets are assigned to your group. calling the user and trying to resolved the issues in a timely manner.
good,"No job security, During my 10 years of employment, the was a minimum of two, departmenal Lay-offs each and every year. Management fails to address critical issues and concerns of employees"
good,McKesson came in and added a completely new system platform then shut the distribution center down. They spent about a million and a half and reassured all of the management and staff that the cutbacks would not affect us and then we were told a month later we would be shut down. The severance package was nice though and they did do all they could to help us prepare for other positions.
good,"A variety of issues at different locations. Always enjoyable going  to stores to troubleshoot and resolve their issues as quickly as possible."
good,"Get bounced to different departments and people do not help to resolve an issue. Poor communication, hard to get someone to go the extra mile to help their employees."
good,"Started this job as a part time  temp, and was eventually hired as permanent full time. Loved this job for a while, met some great people and learned a ton. But business changed as did the work and I was part of a workforce reduction."
good,"Pretty laid back place, advancement is not possible in such a small operation.  Other locations are huge distribution centers and have plenty openings for advancement and transfers."
good,Mckesson was a good company to work for. The management there could use some work. My manager often went against me and caused more problems with my team because she played favorites.
good,"Was a good place to work, sometimes a little hierarchical. But strong leaders and good vision for the company. The culture was not always great, lots of change while i was there which didnt help with staff morale."
good,Great company to work for in terms of compensation and the ability to work from home but very little job security. Encountered several incompetent managers throughout my 20 years of emplyment.
good,Received multiple calls daily from patients and insurance companies related to claims. Hours were adjustable as long as 40 hours per week were performed.
good,ok overall but all about profit in the end. most companies are in to capitalism so you just have to be optimistic to find a lesser capitalist company.
good,"Good place to work; relaxed atmosphere but the pay is low and there is no leadership. The work is easy, no one is on top of you, not stressful, the people are nice but somewhat loud and chaotic."
good,Great company to work for wish i could have stayed longer . Learned a lot from management. Hope one day to return.                   ................................................................
good,Great place to work if you are seriously committed to putting all your time into the company. I loved the people but management could have been a lot better.
good,This is a Family friendly location. Management is willing to work with family schedules. Great place to learn about medical billing with Flexible hour and a Fast past environment.
good,"Have to be driven, team and goal oriented and willing to relocate multiple times to advance up the chain.  Must be patient to when opportunities open up and must jump on them."
good,"Working at Mckesson, there was never a dull moment. It was always insanely busy and you constantly were learning more and more each day. I enjoyed the job overall but the hours and stress was a lot to handle when i was pregnant and mandatory overtime is not something i want or need with a family of 5."
good,"I have been working in this position for elven years and the company has changed over 3 times and  hope this will be last change over and we are getting to know the company and the administration, so far they have been very involved in keeping the employees involved with the company"
good,"McKesson is a leading edge, innovative healthcare company which provides flexible non clinical work opportunities for RN's who are working for positions in a non clinical settings."
good,"Great people to work with; managers do try hard to create a positive experience. Work/life balance is something that is stressed, unfortunately, the reality of the top-down management contradicts this. Corporate vision appears to change yearly and from day one to the last. Employees who worked there for 10+ years were afraid month to month of being laid off - all departments and company arms that I interacted with, and they relayed they always felt this way.  I did from day one. I thought, why are they even hiring while they lay off people with the same skill set?  This leads to much stress.  Company reorganization is a fact of life that most can accept, but to live with the specific imminent threat day in day out takes its toll on morale and work."
good,It was a good place to work but couldn't use the bathroom.The management was great but there was no upward mobility. I loved the atmosphere there. I would recommend this job.
good,"People are pretty friendly, great training and management is very helpful. It can be a very rewarding experience s long as you embrace the training and be a team player."
good,"The benefits are what kept me there for so long. If it weren't for them, the pay is not worth it.  They are very flexible, and the people that work there are great. The opportunity for advancement is lacking."
good,"It is a good place to work if you are looking for a laid back environment. To enjoy the benefit, you must really negotiate your salary before joining the company otherwise your income might remain stagnant or little increase every year."
good,"I love the company as a whole, but not my business performance center. There is a lack of information between the staff and management team. the environment is very micromanaged"
good,"I did enjoy the diversity and inclusiveness. My department was very good about keeping a good work/home balance. "
good,"typical day at work would be answer phone calls from patient's and providers with question's or refills or information on medication. "
good,Absolutely loved the fast paced walking pick/packing. The appreciation we received was amazing. Just need work on management/co workers to much drama goes on
good,McKesson is the oldest and largest health care company in the nation. they deliver one-third of all medications  in North America. One vision one goal
good,Great co-workers but always worried about layoffs or being RIFD.  Hours are flexible but you need to work overtime certain times of the year.
good,"A lot of changes as they are getting ready for a younger workforce.  The talk is all about leadership and growth, but most of the hiring is external."
good,"pay isn't great for how much they expect of you. some employees do the job of 3 and get paid much less than other companies where they'd only do one."
good,"- Projects were often time difficult to get accomplished due to lack of management support"
good,stable work place plenty of o.t. was a little uncomfortable for me to work there to the work force was predominantly Hispanic and I don't speak Spanish. we had a lot of over time so the work life balance was pretty non existent. Always on you about production numbers. Let some employees who had long time service slide with their production. Pay was ok but could have been better.
good,"secondary auditor on the financial team, was also a Quality Assurance Coordinator before doing my current job as an Auditor - I have been with McKesson for the past 18 1/2 years and have enjoyed it, at the end of this year the dept that I work is will be closing. They have already starting letting the Customer Service Reps go. The dept no longer wants to do Medicare Part b for Nursing Homes."
good,Substantial training during on-boarding process is provided along with mentor-ship.  Best group of co-works in any company to date.  Challenging position with strong relationship potential.
good,"Very financially responsible company, which can be a pro or con depending on if you're in a profitable group or not.  Collegial atmosphere, but there is no doubt that it's every man or woman for themselves.  Some groups are 9 to 5 paper pushers - management is very competent and focused on the bottom line.  Not a bad place to work, but uninspiring and the typically corporate juggernaught."
good,"This job is a highly complex position with multiple job duties.  Fast paced, heavy work load,with daily deadlines to meet; very high level multi-task position. Must be able to prioritize work load, manage accounts without instruction, meet quality assurance guidelines, customer satisfaction and retention a must.   Adhere to governmental Medicare compliance and regulations.   Privacy and PHI regulated.   Medical knowledge within the scope of the products provided and making sure all medical documentation is accurate and current."
good,Working for McKesson has given me the opportunity to provide a service along with make some wonderful friends. The environment is warm and laid back but fast passed and challenging at times.
good,"This a great company with a strong reputation in Houston and Austin.  The lack of trust among management, and constant micro-management on every detail, was enough to drive anyone crazy.  Cameras will follow your every step, so don't expect any privacy."
good,I enjoyed working at McKesson. I enjoyed working with the tenured employees. It improved the experience I had there significantly.
good,"Enjoyed co-workers. Lower level management lack necessary people skills, concerned more so about impressing upper management. Lack integrated computer systems so be prepared to quickly change depending on division. This was the challenged in completing task timely. Company very community focused - several opportunities to volunteer for the community."
good,"loved working there, was very good work atmosphere, lot of facilities for employees. knowledgeable team."
good,Most of the time at work is spent packing the medication orders and manifesting the totes.   The company is very organized and the pay is good.
good,"i was review every six months for productiv and hardworking."
good,I do not feel safe working in this environment.  management is pulling punches to promote themselves and not using the strongest members of the team
good,It a great place to work if retired and want some extra money. My co workers are fun and hard working people which some are older and comfortable with what they do. The work is not hard and can easy be done efficiently with proper leadership. The hard part of my job is bad decision on management end. I enjoy my job but working for multimillion dollar company that don't like compensating their employee for their hard work.
good,McKesson is a very large corporation and as with many corporations the benefits and perks are great but sometimes the little people get lost in the shuffle and their positions are expendable if it is good for the business.  Can be a solid job if you are willing to stay complacent in some departments.
good,"Not good, not bad, a decent title on the resume. Health care is not exactly thrilling, but if you have interest in HC, go for it."
good,Great choice for someone looking to settle in longterm but some of the supervisors aren't suitable for the job. Management turnaround is high. The pay sucks but overall benefits are good.
good,"With fluctuating inventory you must continously think of innovative ways of manging this inventory, it allows you to involve co-workers in the process."
good,I work in the call center. The work atmosphere is laid back but there is no future in this field for me. I don't see my goals in life with the company and definitely not in that department
good,A lot of knowledge to know about a lot of product.  Good training classes.  Help from product support and management staff is always helpful.
good,Good place to work!  Nice co-workers and management is fair.  They do support work from home for remote employees. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"A very fast-paced, very productive atmosphere. I learned something new everyday. I am a fast learner and and very dedicated. Management was helpful at times. Worked well with co-workers, friendly people. Hardest pat of my job was finding someone to help do the job function right. I really enjoyed my job. Loved the people, hours, and the benefits."
good,"I have an administrative position with McKesson. In general I love my job and my coworkers. But unfortunately this company seems to have run into some tough times. Things are changing for the worst, corners are being cut to reduce costs but yet it seems not to be in the necessary places. There is a huge disconnect between head office and the rest of the company. Benefits have been reduced. Positions are being eliminated. I have seen people who have worked for McKesson for over 20 years being let go with no warning, simply because they can hire someone younger and cheaper to replace them. I find it shameful. I had hoped that McKesson would be a long term career for me, but given the outlook of their future, even if my job is not cut, I question if this is the company I want to work for."
good,"It gave me the opportunity to learn medical billing at different levels. This office handled payments, customer service, coding and account  receivables for over 17 facilities."
good,Overall good place to work but the moral in the office could have been better.    The satellite offices are forgotten by the company as a whole.
good,There was always a good balance of work to maintain products for inventory
good,"McKesson offers plenty of  positions not all give you the opportunity for advancement.  Very little opportunities for outside training that they will pay for."
good,"Fun place to work but the type of work is not encouraging."
good,"Work includes collaborating with QA and development to make sure software requirements have the detailed content so that code is accurately delivered to the customers. "
good,I worked set hours with weekends off and learned a lot about medical insurance.
good,"Cleaned, prepared, stacked and move totes that are used for shipping products to customers, follow all of the company guide lines and safety rules"
good,i have always wanted to be auto repair tech so i worked at warehouses until i went thru school now im trying to get shop experience.
good,"A typical day at Lloyds consisted of dealing with all manor of customers and working with prescriptions as well as make up and perfume. I learnt a lot about medicine and how prescriptions are dealt with. I got on very well with all my co-workers and it really felt like a family. the hardest thing about the job was learning all the technicalities involved with prescriptions since they are so important its essential that there are no mistakes. My favorite part of the job would be selling the make up and perfume, I really liked helping people to chose products."
good,"I've been with McKesson for a little over two years and overall have had a wonderful experience.  I've been lucky that I've always had a manager and a team that I enjoy working for and with."
good,"8am-5pm, 1 hour lunch with 2 15 minute breaks."
good,"McKesson Automated Healthcare, during my time there, was an overall enjoyable/comfortable place to work. It was my first corporate job and I learned everything I know about the corporate work environment through the two positions I held there. Management is lenient and forgiving to the point of excess. Co-workers were a mixed bag of achievers that seemed to typically leave the company after they hit a wall and lifers that were happy with where they were and what McKesson was providing them. After a few years of working at McKesson Automated Healthcare I would classify it as a good start for a college grad or someone re-entering the workforce but I would not recommend it long-term if you have high aspirations."
good,"My typical day consisted of doing pm work on the conveyors in the plant. I learned how to work on these kinds of conveyors. Some of n my coworkers kept to their selves but others worked well with everyone else. The hardest part of the job was probably because you felt lie you on an island at times, The most enjoyable part was when you worked with others."
good,I placed orders for pharmacist calling in to order prescription and non- prescription drugs for patients. I learned how to use SAP and help customers with front end issues involving medications. The hardest part of my job were the constant changes and expected us to keep our QA up while applying what we have learned. I enjoyed being able to order medications and getting them to the pharmacist on time.
good,"a typical day to work"
good,"The work environment is pleasant. They offer a wide range of skill sets to learn. The people are open and friendly. The company, over all; offers their employees a good, stable job in this economical crisis. "
good,I enjoyed working at Mckesson but there was too much favoritism (in certain areas) and not many opportunities to learn new tasks.
good,"Everyday is a learning experience, we sell over 3000 items to our clients. You're always learning about a new item."
good,The most enjoyable part of my previous job was helping some one in time of need. Most of my co workers were team players and we thrived by helping each other out. The hardest part of my job was to convey that we were had all he answers instantly. Learned that I work best when not micro managed.
good,"I provide client support and technical issue resolutions via email, phone and other electronic medium"
good,"Well, like most BIG companies, I should say."
good,"My co-workers were great - very professional, smart, fun people to work with. That was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"It really depends on the group/manager you end up in. I worked in 3 departments with 2 great managers and one who is not so great. It is very tough to move around in general, and it is easy to get stuck in an unsatisfying job."
good,"Busy and challenging workplace, resources are an issue, company performance has declined in line with reductions in NHS funding. Too many internal structural and managerial changes."
good,"good work life balance and a good co-workers. I would love to work there again in the near future excellent manager I worked under."
good,Enjoyed the challenges on taking over new clinics and performing a business analyst on clinics. Traveled a lot which was the hardest part because of the unknowns when taking over a new clinic.
good,"Mckesson is pretty good job. You get 2 weeks paid vacation, sick time, personal holidays etc after 90 days. Hours are okay most of the time. Some days you could work 8 or more hours and other days you could work 4-5 and be done. You start early and you don’t go home until your route is done."
good,"I was only a temporary employee working for McKesson as a receptionist while their regular receptionist was on paternity leave. I saw people working very hard for long hours, but the office culture and compensation seemed pretty good."
good,working with professionals in the medical community is a breath of fresh air but the job becomes very stressful at times because unlike some other call centers you realize that the order that this doctor may not have received in the end affects a patient.
good,"its the typical warehouse job, good money, long hours, normally working over night. But I guess if you need work and like this typeof job them this iss the place for you"
good,It was a really welcoming and chilled environment in which I loved working in. The staff were very helpful and friendly and also very supportive in aiding a successful goal for the company.
good,"A big strong company with an imbedded culture. The size may leave the individual feeling small and overlooked. Fast paced daily work. Production is paramount. Management competence varies per person. Overall a job for people ready to work hard if in the warehousing division of the company. Health insurance, dental, 401k,"
good,This place has a professional atmosphere. Good place to work and gain experience. Did not really see a true advancement for growth after a couple of years.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company.  I think the vice president was great.  Management under him needs work.  The work was not hard, but I think you need more employees to do it.  You need to have a better training program for new employees.  Management needs to go through a training program."
good,I think McKesson is a great company but the opportunity to stay with the company and advance is extremely low. I know a few people that work there and most of them had to apply again after their first contract to get hired on full time. Keep in mind while employees are contracted they do not get any benefits.
good,Typical warehouse operation.  Wide aisles and lots of racks to store product.  Order selectors fill orders using pallet jacks.  Receivers and stockers use stand up fork lifts.  Everybody takes break at the same time.
good,Finance teams are a valued part of the overall supply chain structure and you have many chances of working with Six Sigma and Operations to develop strategies to improve the business.
good,"The time at spent as an employee at McKesson the days we long and repetitive. i did learn how to pack items according to types and weighs. The management team were very policy oriented, Working conditions safety structured, The most difficult part of the job was the everyday unexpected changes and what was your duties next. The most enjoyable part was of the job was meeting new people."
good,"McKesson is a decent company but it is not a friendly environment and or work culture.  The pay is good and benefits are pretty good though, but it's very cold and ""dry""."
good,"If you are unfortunate to find yourself in the accounting department in the Woodlands location you will likely have a hard time with career advancement. Only the finance guys get promoted or advanced. Plus, the pay, compared to other accountants in the market is very poor."
good,mckesson is a fast paced environment that requires a lot of multitasking. there is room for improvement in management and associate positions. McKesson has a good work life balance and decent benefits.
good,"Very busy place, barely have a break, which is not paid. Free coffee is available but you have no time to enjoy it. Benefits are very limited, won't pay for glasses."
good,"Individual job training wasn't good, training to understand the company and product was very good."
good,"Okay work culture, some opportunities to move up. Decent benefits and pay. Decent company to work for overall. And they do recognize the employees throughout the year."
good,Its a good company to work for and very helpful employees that help you find employment. I would recommend going through them to find career opportunities.
good,"Overall the job was great, I was able to learn a lot about the healthcare industry and medical insurance. The people I worked with were very helpful but the management was terrible."
good,If you have a degree and want to advance then this company is not for you. Office is made up of mostly women who complain about every little thing; if you're having a bad day call out or it will be used against you.
good,"McKesson is a good company. The only problem is that not all distribution centers are the same. Some have really good management. There farther east in the US you the the more terrible the leadership becomes, at least from my experience."
good,"The days could be long, but it was the short notice at times that got the best of me. The culture of the business is that you meet the need of the vendor, it has always been that way, it should not however come at the expense of the employee as it does so often with the long hours needed to get the job done."
good,"Good Company but poor work life balance."
good,"friendly environment, climate controlled, learned about picking and packing medications, the hardest part was having to do everything in a timely manner"
good,"The job was beneficial for gaining skills and the aide to patients felt rewarding. The facility is nice, surrounded by various food options. The premises are clean."
good,"McKesson has traditionally housed smart employees who are interested in healthcare and value a work life balance. The work is challenging and demands on time are real but the pressure doesn't exist like in other healthcare companies (particularly startups). The industry itself is challenging with a greater focus on cost reduction than revenue gain. This leads to constant re-evaluation of org structure, size, etc which has led a few recent downsizings and divisional move to Dallas."
good,"pick n pack n shippng , working with team . I have experience use air tool , power tool , 5 years delivery, 5 yrs assemly production job . work fast no problem."
good,"enjoyed working here, loved my coworkers and direct supervisor but was not very fond of the secrecy about the longevity of the campaign we were working."
good,"As a permanent employee, benefits are very good. Good work environment. Recognized employees and gave good incentives throughout the year. Good work schedules and comfortable work environment."
good,Not a bad place to work. They just don't pay enough. New hires get hired on making more than people that have been there 5 to 10 years or longer.They do have good benefits.
good,Mckesson was a nice place to work. Had great benefits. Interoffice communication was okay. Could have used more time in training. A diverse culture. Friendly people.
good,"management and peers were Team players. they were extremely supportive. Sales Force was extremely easy to navigate, the hardest part was trying to get the specialty pharmacy to comply. learning new skills every step of the way that will definitely be beneficial in the success of my career."
good,This was a good experience gaining position. Everything was play it by ear for the migration phase leading up to go live. Benefits were excellent although the pay was lower than expected.
good,McKesson is a nice place to work but the pay was not up where it should be and with that being the case they closed the office.  Which left over 40 people without a job/
good,"-A typical day at work involves 10 miles of walking in an eight hour day which includes a wide array of responsibilities within the warehouse and communication with customers"
good,"I have been working for McKesson for a little over 6 months and have enjoyed my time there so far. Parking can be difficult at times, and the job dues come with its fare share of stressful moments."
good,"Overall Positive Place to work,  great culture. A good place to gain experience and insight into the business. Good people with vast backgrounds and work well to collaborate to business expectations are met."
good,"Layoffs for mid level and entry level employees "
good,A place that provides opportunity to be challenged and grow.  I can truly say I have never been bored because of the focus on continual improvement.
good,"The team is great to work with however the management has been a tough one to keep up with.  In my three years with the organization I have had 4 different managers.  "
good,"Must be flexible and easily adapt to changes. Nice people, but there is always some personal drama going on.  Never apply for ADA/FMLA as they will fight you on it, no matter the reason."
good,"A typical day at work would be a very busy day, most of my day I do work over the counter where I have learnt how to communicate with customers and how to deal with their requires. Advising patient was a very good skill that I have developed."
good,"It is unfortunate for many, given the direction of a business, such as Mckesson is heading. Bittersweet really. Having said that, Mckesson will always be a model for successful business. Distribution Centres will turn more towards machine operated order filling, whilst creating less jobs for real people, and ultimately saving companies money. While this business will always need people to operate, it will over time, require fewer and fewer. The nature and the culture associated with Mckesson is very important in our day to day lives. Millions of people each day are touched my Mckesson in some way or another. This makes a career at Mckesson rewarding in itself."
good,"work load is high! Otherwise Managment has been good but meeting standards can be diffcult. Training is good, wish there was more time to keep yourself educated on coding changes within work hours."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. I have learn how to manage my own time and learned service desk role. Also experienced working with different vendors and departments.
good,"On line for the duration of 8 hour shift.  Able to contact people in need and able to provide needed resources.  The downfall is due to being telephonic you have the inability to conduct a true assessment. There are currently 3 social workers servicing the state and at times there is too much work.  Social worker are asked to assisted on contact calls to meet the required contacts per contract versus using the time to provide assistance to the clients already identified.   Clients are high risk and  for the most part appreciate the help provided.  Hardest part of the job is not being able to do things like filling out paperwork for the clients when there are barriers such as language, and impairments. Takes time to coordinate the assistance and time is lost. The most enjoyable part is the ability to connect to a great number of clients via phone and ability to help by reaching out to community resources where funding and assistance is available."
good,This company develops and promotes internal talent. I enjoy working here and have had many fellow employees assist me in my career growth.
good,"The work is very fast paced and monotonous. The hardest thing about the job is the fact that it never changes. Great company to work for, excellent benefits. I just need something that challenges my mind more and where I'm not working midnight."
good,My day mainly consists of entering medical information into an MDM calculator for billing purposes.
good,"I work in a very busy pharmacy known for having alot of addicts, for how much is expected i feel it is worth more than minimum wage, however when i have worked in other branches i appreciate why it is. my co-workers are brilliant and get along with all of them, and the management seems very sound overall too."
good,"A very diverse company to work for, great benefits, with a lot of great coworkers, a lot of research to put into certain clients."
good,"Normal 8 hrs at work"
good,good job i had long hours lots of OT but a great staff and management
good,"Dealt with customers "
good,"Ability to plan and prioritise tasks effectively whilst maintaining a high standard of work.  Can make decisions quickly and unaided in unpredictable circumstances"
good,"A typical day at work would be answering staff questions on their work and advise them what is priority based on client needs. I have learned that management is a very stressful position and it takes a lot of knowledge to be where they are. The hardest part of the job is making sure your staff is knowledgeable to do their job.Also the staff tends to socialize more then work so the focus needs to be rerouted to make sure they stay on track. The most enjoyable part of my job is making the clients happy. When a job well done is said it makes me smile, as I have accomplished something better for the company."
good,"Overall a typical day for me at McKesson was working A/R, calling insurance companies to follow up on unpaid claims, to verify insurance information, check authorizations, contact patients in regards to delinquent accounts, assist phone queue when needed, and take all escalated or complex phone calls."
good,I learnt a lot from Lloyds I went on a lot of training courses they where called the plus one and it was all about customers service and how customers should be treated.
good,"During my time at McKesson I have learned most of what I know about medical billing. A typical day is spent loading information from the client mainframe into our billing system. Ongoing, I spent the rest of my day adding or changing insurance, physician, or site codes in the system. Any insurance looking to be incorrect, I would verify with the carrier by phone or web site."
good,this company has potential work is not divided equally and is to stressful for Customer Service Rep
good,"Hard to give a rating when I have seen several different units and they all operate differently. Do your research and always ask questions. Overall, the corporation has good benefits except for the HRA health plan that started using using 3 years ago."
good,"Overall, McKesson is a great place to work. It is a stable company with over 175 years of a healthcare presence. There is a sense of company culture and you are surrounded by some of the best and brightest. Like in any company this size there will be management and personnel issues, but there are strong principles that the company follows."
good,I love working hear due to the flex hours you have being off by 12 on friday is a big plus with a lot of my team members. I have learned a lot in the years I have been    hear you have a good chance to move up in other position.The hardest part I believe that it has change so much we really do not know what to expect some time until  it happens.
good,"It depends on where you work in the warehouse. It’s a medical supply company. In the lum, you pick low unit of measure products. The heaviest is around 45 pounds. You can loose pick, case pick, induct, look for and sort out the damaged or loose products, and build boxes. The management is alright, they try they’re hardest to get everyone out at a decent time. It depends on how much work there is."
good,"We’re in an era of unprecedented complexity in healthcare. Patient care is not where it should be. While many of the organizations delivering the care need to get much healthier, too."
good,the job was great the people I worked with was fun and hard working. the hours was great. the pay was not that good for the work you had to do. but the guys worked hard to get it done
good,"Every man/ woman for themselves. Management is very unorganized and selfish"
good,The attendance policy alone is reason not to work there. It leaves no room for emergencies. It's also rather difficult to hit your numbers which results in write ups.
good,"McKesson is a name commonly seen in hospitals, but medical supplies are only one of the healthcare industries McKesson leads. It should come without saying that there is a world of opportunity within fortune 10 companies and that opportunity is it's own benefit, but this company values professional development, work/home life, continuity and retirement planning making it an attractive workplace for people at all stages in their professional career."
good,yes its a good company for entry level position. I was only there for a short while but was not that happy. They put me in a position that I did not like and I was not
good,resigned to live in Florida company going through transition. Learned new software along with management. ICARE principles main culture. Hardest part of the job catching up when systems went down. Enjoyed being a part of a specialty team.
good,"Its ownership of most of the market share makes this company slow and unwilling to change. The culture, although varying in different departments, has become stale. Instead of collectively determining the right course of action to tackle changing market landscape, they fire and hire people on a weekly basis."
good,"I was trained, educated and mentored until my comfort level was achieved.  I had support although I worked at home. Then the company sold the division I worked in to another company who lost the contract for services and the division members lost their jobs. Poor planning and insight on the part of McKesson."
good,"Up at 3 AM, arrive at warehouse at 5 AM."
good,"Pas le temps de s'ennuyer. Il y a toujours du travail pour vous occuper. Le seul point faible est au niveau du travail d'équipe, il y aurait place à l'amélioration."
good,"Team leadership genuinely concerned with team members' well-being and performance. Most difficult part of the job was travel, followed closely by expense reimbursement. The expense reimbursement process seemed very clumsy."
good,Advancement was lack luster at times. But the benefits were amazing. And work life balance was great.  Wish there were more opportunities for advancement.
good,Work at McKesson Central Fill is very repetitive and can become tedious. Employees are moved around to different locations but the tasks are all very similar and you are doing the same thing hundreds of times a day and thousands of times per week.
good,"Fast-paced environment enjoyed being busy building the healthcare applications and helping my customers. I have learned all phases of healthcare job workflow because I have to build each job role. I have documented all process and procedures involved in each job role, from Implementation, assessments,  workflow, and testing final build processes. I  have a small team that provides all the services around the hospital. Great relationship with my team. The hardest part of my job is the On-Call week when problems are more technical (i.e:: hardware or network issues) never wants to bother my team. I have enjoyed the diverse group of people and professionals I worked with and built great relationships throughout."
good,"I worked deep in the weeds of one of the locations that was an acquired company.  During the acquisition many of the original folks left and I was one of the new hires.  Then within a couple years it was all sold off to Change Healthcare.  The people were awesome, always willing to help and all had great attitudes."
good,As a contractor I was only privy to the daily work culture which was an overall enjoyable experience. There could be improvement in communication & selection of mid-level leadership in IT Operation & support areas.
good,"Sweeper; packaged, organized, and wrapped skids full of product; cut, opened and organized product into specific catagories. i enjoyed my 9hour night shifts and everyone that i worked with which was alot of people."
good,"My managers were great. The company seems to be ready to move out of CA. They have purchased a new building in TX, and are building a new campus in AZ."
good,Exceed defined department goals and activity metrics. Lead team/AR department in daily production • Assist my peers to help them reach our department goals.
good,"For over 100 years, McKesson Canada has been the logistics and distribution leader in the Canadian healthcare sector. We connect manufacturers and pharmacies with the very best supply solutions to ensure that branded, generic and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and products reach our pharmacy clients and their patients."
good,The local management team was great.  It is very difficult managing the personalities of physicians while providing compliant and sound reporting and running the finance department.  The management support from corporate needs to be stronger.
good,"works were a challenge at times.  I always make an effort to have the best relationship with my coworkers and with management.  the works could be hard at times, But all i can say it was roller coast at times"
good,Very nice company with a great environment full of friendly people. My days started off with stretching then individual placements. I learned how to maneuver in such a complicated environment. Manager wise I had no problem I thought they did a very well job but sometimes gave authority to the wrong individuals. The most difficult part of the job was trying to conquer learning the route after picking products which was going to find product that was needed referred to as shags. I enjoyed the atmosphere of positive people.
good,Never a slow day ok company.  Good people to work with.  Flexible hours.
good,"I really enjoyed the flex time they offered. Benefits were also really good. However, the pay was horrendous. For the amount of stress and volume of work I was expected to complete, I was grossly underpaid. Management is decent, depending on which department you're in. They're also overworked and underpaid. Co-workers are 95% female and weren't always the brightest bunch. A lot of cattiness. I learned a great deal though. We were always being educated. The hardest part about working there was feeling completely unappreciated and underpaid. The best part about working there though was definitely the flex time."
good,McKesson is a great company to work for.  There are just small pockets for improvements.  I think there should be better training opportunities for people learning the applications.  ALso the mentor/mentee program needs to be revamped.
good,"Every day I come in and would do the same thing. I did learn something new everyday so hat was a big advantage. Co workers were friendly until drama came around. Working with a bunch of women is not easily. If you do the wrong thing they attack like lions. Sitting for nine hours a day became tiresome, hard on the back, legs and feet. The benefits were what made me stay, their insurance was excellent and always had freebies."
good,Fast paced environment. Working on early electronic claim processing.  
good,Company as a whole has great things to offer.  The particular office I worked for stopped being about the client and became all about the bottom dollar.  That is when I took my leave.
good,"Working for McKesson, I am working with solving patients problems with a bill they may have received. I answer phones, correct bad addresses, take patient payments, schedule payment plans, locate and review EOB's. Call doctors’ offices and clinics to get more information on the patients. I contact insurance companies to get reasons as to why a claim was denied. Correct diagnostic codes in the system. McKesson is furthering my education in the Medical industry."
good,"great place to work I had a great experience there. "
good,"Best temporary  job to get, to gain experience  and gain a great work ethic, and optional career development if you wish to go beyond, but be prepared to gain thick skin"
good,"Good Benefits, prepare to sit all day. If you're looking for great benefits such as healthcare, dental vision and you don't mind being on the phone all day , then this is the job for you!"
good,The company is currently undergoing a lot of changes and this is reflected in the atmosphere of  the company.  They do a lot of things to try and boost the moral and help everyone feel like a team but the success of those activities is very limited.
good,Good company in general to work for. Healthcare is rapidly changing and McKesson tries to stay at the forefront. The are ample opportunities for advancement.
good,"A great place to work. The lay off was sudden but expected.  I just celebrated my one year anniversary. My desire was to grow onward and upward. Unfortunately, it is time to explore new options. If ever given the opportunity, I would return with no hesitation. A typical day at work includes learning something new about the business as it applies to DME.  There has never been a dull moment."
good,"Training went by fast consisted of 4 weeks. The last two weeks were rushed. Pay was weekly and a good per hour amount. Advancement seemed very achievable, as long as your performance and attendance met company expectations."
good,"Pros:"
good,"McKesson is fast pace job. Hardly room for any error however if you do your job well, then you have nothing to worry about. The raises were low but the flex schedule were great. If you were running a few minutes behind, as long as you put in your 8 hr shift, you were good."
good,"The environment was a fast paced production environment.  You often had to count and package shipments of 100 or more items in less than 10 minutes time.  In addition, the shift end time varied.  We were required to stay until the orders were completed and since they varied, our time to leave varied.  This was difficult for those who had family or other commitments outside of work."
good,"This was a great job at first. I enjoy most of the people I work with and enjoy the work itself. It is time to move on. "
good,"* Client is very friendly even in case of delays due to technical challenges"
good,"Fast paste"
good,A company that has changed over the years.  It is now a fast pace but fair environment.  You must have organization skills to do well at McKesson. The top management of the company should be replaced due to the scandals. The team environment is very good.
good,"Overall, I loved working at McKesson. The people are great and management for the most part are very good. The pay is on the low side for the tasks that are provided. I would have loved to have stayed with the company if the pay was more appropriate for the jobs preformed. "
good,"Receive calls for out patient new, established and updating of information in the EPIC Medical Records System.  There is much acquired skills for patience, accuracy and quality of service. There is a challenge that is overcome after gaining your experience in regards to answering to patients meaning theses are calls involving peoples that may not always feel good.  It is the most satisfying to know that the patient is satisfied and you are able to assist."
good,Great environment for inspiring ideas and to explore new opportunities. There are plenty of benefits and perks that make this a great place to work. It may be a 9 to 5 but at least theres coffee and donuts.
good,"McKesson was a very good warehouse to begin for me in my youth stages. McKesson has good benefits , a lot of opportunities, sincere/passionate workers."
good,"A good sound organization to work at. Management is always supportive and willing to embrace changes, and also work for the general good of the staff."
good,McKesson was a great place to work and i would have Web made a future with the company if it wasnt fot the case that wasfiled against me . I believe that McKesson is about production an incentives. I liked it there very much.
good,"Working at McKesson was also a fun experience, working at a warehouse was pretty cool. Everyone their had there days but overall it was an okay experience."
good,"Overall working at Mckesson was very good experience. The duties that were to be performed were to lift about 700 to 1000 totes in a very fast pace environment. While doing so, I gained a tremendous amount of patience. The job is not the hardest, but it is so monotonous that one would like to give up. The management there was very helpful, and they always had an open door policy. The co-workers were very family oriented. They were always helpful. The hardest part of the job was that it was overnight. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was very fast pace. The nights seems to go very quickly."
good,nice place to work at times. work life balance  was not always there but still like the job in spite of the work schedule at time.
good,"McKesson was a good place to work, they paid well and had decent benefits. You could learn a lot and move to different departments. Management could have been much better but as long as you were a favorite, you had no problems."
good,Assign correct procedure and diagnostic  codes.   I learned ICD 10 anatomy and physiology. Anesthesia coding.  Coworkers were always willing to help.  Hardest part is the lack of tools needed to complete my coding responsibilities. The most enjoyable was receiving an acceptable coding audit.
good,"McKesson for the most part can be a very good place to work. "
good,"McKesson had many pros and cons. The team leads and supervisor's were amazing. The health insurance benefits were great along with the work schedules. The cons with McKesson are the pay and work load. For the amount of pay that you recieve, you should only have to deal with maybe one or two job functions. At McKesson, I did 6 job functions and worked there for two years and made less then someone that had only worked there for 3 months and had 2 job functions."
good,I work through a temp agency.  I hear from permanent employees the benefit package is exceptional and the 401 K is amazing. I would like to be hire as a permanent employee yet with the job market in the dumps temp employment is all any company is giving now.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"5 + years ago when I started there, the department that I was working in was great! Sadly over the last few years, management changed several times and things became unorganized.  The product in which I was testing was not the greatest product and McKesson lost several big accounts because of it."
good,"The stress levels are extremely high as we deal with pharmacy personell who are unable to fill prescriptions for their patients because their computer is down. Multi-tasking and a fast pace is a must as you are working with more than one customer at a time, but you never get bored with all the different versions and types of software you need to know. You are constantly learning in training sessions and from your co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the stress, but rewards come with the appreciation from the customer when you are able to fix the system and educate them in the process."
good,"fast paste , gotta move around to were the work is . some people are lazy and will stack instead of clear the line. its a lot of different ways to keep your area clean and have a clear line without panicking ,"
good,"This was a great job, its the pay that was unacceptable. I learned a lot though and it was a great learning experience! I got my foot in the door and started my career."
good,"Great place for a first job,  though lack of promotion unless you are able to relocate to another state, great benefits, 401k, stock options, pedestrian raises in comparison with other companies"
good,"I was taught research and new computer systems.  The environment I worked in was pleasant.  The daily routine was assisting customer with purchasing, tracking any ordering McKesson products.  Dealing in the area I worked I assisted in proving quote information on new products for government agencies.  New accounts such as a new prison were required to receive at least 3 quotes on similar product prior to contracting.  Assisted Sales personnel with information on new product for accounts."
good,"Great supervisors that want you to succeed."
good,The company overal is ok to work for . It gives you chances and opportunities to grow and succeed!  I would definitely recommend this company to friends and family
good,"its a great place to work, with a friendly and save environment, the benefits are also great, specially if you have a family."
good,great company to work for learned a lot while I was here.  they should have a more reasonable understanding of workers leaving and let them work again.
good,Entry level jobs usually start at minimum wage.
good,Mckesson is a great job for your first job! Gives you experience in an office environment. It's very hard to move up within the company. The pay is terrible. Benefits on the other hand are excellent!
good,"Call center environment "
good,The company was great for working and developing your career. The people there were great but upper management was disconnected. It was like 2 different worlds and I wish the company as a whole cared about its employees. I miss working at McKesson and I wish them well.
good,"Customer Service Was great job, but than call center work removed  was moved to a different harder job, training was difficult for new job not allowed to ask questions and procedures kept changing everyday."
good,"Everyday work was great, no problems. But at the time that I was employed, there was some issues with the management and things were being done that shouldn't have been done."
good,I love the challenge each and everyday. I devoted my full energy to this company. I was very happy I got promote quickly due to my hard work but due to my mother illness I had to make a tough decision to leave this company. I put In my two weeks and worked beyond my last day. A year later when I was ready return I found out my supervisor did not turn in my notice. I was crushed that I cannot
good,"Going out to Wound care clinics and Podiatrist offiices building relationships, finding out what prodcuts they are using who is there current supplier, leaving samples and making appoints."
good,"On a daily basis with very minimal supervision reviewed and evaluated data from numerous sources"
good,"Daily picking of product "
good,fun work place with supportive management decent amount of red tape and politics but this is expected of a big company it not all about the number but how you personally grow and develop
good,"Good Place, benifits, management and co workers."
good,Ordering medical supply for the pharmacy and hospital to check orders to make sure that they had left from the distribution center and that they would arrive on time
good,"Typical Day at Work : Productive, exciting, staff goal and incentive oriented. Exceeds goals daily. "
good,It was very unsafe ethics with everyone rushing to finish picking orders as fast as possible driving cherry pickers risking injuring other coworkers. The management wasn't concerned about injuries.
good,"A typical day is very busy, high demand environment, Management is not very informative with things that need to be know. My co workers are willing to work as a team"
good,Good company to work for. Poor Management lot to learn from peers. poor compensation
good,"Company was good becuase the purpose was to offer excellent service and to expand. Once the company expanded, employees were no longer perceived as a great asset. Many got fired because they were not a good fit. All that got fired was anyone who did not have two languages."
good,"Good Conpany, I love that they have a casual dress code daily."
good,"I loved my position at McKesson until they decided to move my position to build a team of others with my job title. Unfortunately it was good in theory but the person they chose to lead the team was a bad choice. This person was big on picking and showing who their favorites were. This person was also of the mindset that all of their ideas were the best ideas and everything else was garbage. They were fast to put you down in front of others and very hesitant to provide any positive feedback. I knew working with this individual would not work for me because although I am more of an independent worker (and couldn't stand the migromanaging) when I do collaborate I like to actually accept new ideas or debate them constructively. Additionally this supervisor allowed me to know how much a peer was making because she carelessly attached his HR paperwork in an email to me. This peer was making thousands more than me even though they were brand new with no experience. I talked to the supervisor about it and was informed that my salary was about 6,000 less than the minimum budget for my role. They said they would do something  about it but month after month put it off. Eventually I was given a 0.51% merit increase bringing my salary up less than $300/year. The whole situation gave me severe anxiety and mentally depleted me. I attempted to speak with my bosses boss to adjust my salary and that person very aggressively told me to just deal. I got the same response just trying to get the okay and some direction to just leave the team. These people said over and over that they would rather"
good,Don't have a high regard for management.  Purchased us from McKesson and then sold us again  - 2 acquisitions in 6 months.  Unfortunately was not given an opportunity to work there long enough to have much of an opinion.
good,"Very busy workplace."
good,Working hours were great. Employer is very health conscience and allowed time for employees to exercise during their lunch and breaks.  Open door was always implemented whenever needed.
good,"If work-life balance you are looking for, this is the place to be. Some people work too much some not enough. :|"
good,"Company does not care about smaller companies they aquire, two years after buying the previous company I worked for they closed us down with no warning."
good,"Double check the quantity and quality of products, perform quality control includes but not limited to quantity, variations, designated lot areas, correct temperature within guidelines for perishable and fragile pharmaceutical products."
good,All employees have to do is call a 800 # to HR and complain if you give discipline to an employee that deserves it. HR does not work with management.
good,Can be stressful if you are not flexible? Constant change as they are constantly trying to improve business unit. Management styles vary from micro and very laid back. No support from management.
good,"Love the work, enjoy working with numbers. Environment is not the greatest, very stressful. Managers don't know how to address their staff. Some of them needs more managerial training."
good,"Great benefits. Lots of overtime."
good,"work hard , no advancement, no bonus, no salary increase if so it was less than five cents"
good,"i witnesses people working 9-10 hours a day trying to keep up on work, while they pay them less then 10 dollars an hour. They bring in temps then let them go leaving the main staff to struggle. "
good,"Came in logged in, worked my practices. Co-workers were great. I will miss them so much. Hardest part of the job, was leaving (laid off). I enjoyed coming into steady work place, and knowing I was making a difference."
good,A mandatory day was doing 500 claims per day in order for the insurance companies to process the bills for 3 hospitals and correctly input all insurance requirements for payment.
good,Enjoy working for this company. There are a lot of great people. Nice and clean environment. Lots of room to enhance your experience and learn new things.
good,McKesson was not a bad place to work as a EMR/Pyxis implementation operator. The only thing is contractors are expendable and full time employees reek the most benefits and easier job assignments.
good,They do advance from within but it is about who you know not what you know. I currently have more knowledge that the lead and one of the managers but because i can not speak spanish i was not promoted.
good,"If you like coming in and doing your work while at work and then leaving it at work and going home, then this job is great.  This is a billing office where you can do just that and never think about your work while at home.  The draw back is management tends to treat you like an idiot and incapable of doing your job.  If you can stay out of management's way then this job is pretty great.  The benefits are great and the pay is average for area given the work."
good,looking for a better job with respecting people or hard workers
good,"The job is a nice workplace enviornment. I learned to us rf unit, reach truck, and more about recieving. Management needs alot of work. (lack of comuniction). the co workers are really nice."
good,"A typical day is coding charges, billing, collections, answering phones and working appeals."
good,Handles large voulmes of product. We worked etremly long hours. Tough attendance standards. Management either wasn't around or didn't agree on how things should be ran. They did have nice partys for the hoildays and a rewards program.
good,I loved my job as I love all my jobs. I was in constant contact with patients and customers which is what I enjoy the most and flourish doing. It kept me very busy and gave me chances to give myself personal challenges each day to accomplish. The interview process was nice and professional and gave me excitement to start working.
good,"A lot of project and travel, Responsible for 13 distribution facilities across the country. Could be on project work for 6 weeks at a time. Some of the savings ROI were not achievable,"
good,Some nice people. Fast paced. Constantly reminded of your pace and efficiency rating. Not much training. Have to figure things out for yourself or ask other employees for help. sometimes get different answers from different supervisors.
good,"Stressful place to work.  Fast paced.  Worked after hours and weekend on-call, no work family balance.  Layoff at least once a year,  Co-Workers were nice and fun to work with,"
good,"I enjoyed working at McKesson it was a call center environment.  Casual Dress code. Paid great, It is a contracted position. I would recommend them to"
good,"McKesson is a great place to work, but the building managers are incompetent at best. The team is the only reason any of the managers keep their jobs.actually"
good,Tres agreable a travaille malgré les gens qui parle beaucoup si non belle environnements ..travaille avec beaucoup de pression
good,"Management could be better with support "
good,"The only issue I have with McKesson is that there is no avenue for advancement.  I started there to get to know the business and advance, although, I've been there for 2 years and still in the same position.  I have to take upon myself to find employment whereas there may be room for advancement or at least a higher salary."
good,"Take trouble call."
good,"Not much to say - time of transition and lots of change.  New management has brought changes in which is nice."
good,"Great pay as a temp; job duties for job advertised only lasted three mos on a six month contract so they made up things to do.  Went in as an Executive Admin Asst and spent a week cleaning a warehouse just to have something to do.   Management is divided - one group is friendly, helpful and outgoing (operations); Sales side of management is very snobbish and off putting - very professional, just not a group I enjoyed working for.  I enjoyed the operations side of things but they did not have openings at the time I was there."
good,"Top Down management style. If you are not on the management team, you are not represented. Benefit was good."
good,great place to work if you like data entry. keeps you busy from beginning to end. Friendly co-workers but best to keep your nose to yourself.
good,Stay to yourself and do your job and you will do fine here. Not ebough room for growth
good,"	Responsible for performing the physical tasks involved in shipping, receiving, storing and distribution of products, materials, parts, supplies and equipment"
good,"o  Being there at 5:00 AM - 5:00 PM (Temp Job)"
good,"I worked as temporary driver from an agency in the absence of normal driver, my duties were to deliver prescriptions to the patients home."
good,I love doing data entry for this company. My heart is really into data entry. I would love to be in an office to myself entering Data all day. It is my dream job!!!
good,Good place to work if you don't want job security. i was not able to utilize my vacation time because of work load. I constantly was losing my vacation time.
good,"dont work here if you dont want to work long hours. management was not good, dont expect to work at day shift until you are at least 40 years old, night shift hours are ridiculous."
good,Call Providers and Insurance company to verified Benefits. I will call and handle 30 cases per day. I will make determinations on cases wither they should be approved or not. I will set up shipments for patient that are approved.
good,"The position as a customer service representative is fairly easy. It provides you with a solid amount of knowledge in the medical and insurance field. The working hours are monday through friday and allow for some flexibility for outside commitments, depending on your performance. If you expect to be promoted, or even have a chance at being promoted within your first 2-3 years you will likely be disappointed."
good,"Very fast past, you have to be persistent and keep up with a positive attitude. Customers are always right, you must do everything in your power to guarantee their satisfaction"
good,the typical day at McKesson in the department that I work in would include assisting pharmacies with the purchased software provided by McKesson. I have learned the full pharmacy prescription processing methods and product maintenance. Management in my particular department is subpar however as a company as a whole the overall management is fairly good. The workplace culture is great and the only difficulty I have encountered is dealing with immediate management.
good,My manager sought out getting you in trouble which does not allow you to move in the company. Great benefits package. Some teams are fantastic. My manager promised to remove or correct our horrible supervisor and never did
good,went through temp agency and it was a lot of training in the beginning but it helped with our job requirement. It was really nice a lot of long holds times to get through to insurance companies.
good,"McKesson is a great organization, amazing benefits, great working environment, hard to juggle work/life balance with shifts, no opportunity for advancement"
good,"McKesson a toujours fait preuve d'un manque flagrant de communication avec les employé(e)s, peu importe pour quelle(s) raison(s)."
good,"A typical work day consisted of logging into all systems and running accounts receivable/payable reports for all Client that were assigned per team. I learned time management and the ability to adapt to change. Management seemed overwhelmed at times, and not very approachable. The hardest part of the job is the month end when it was crunch time, and the team was short a percentage and it was a possibility that a particular team or Client may not reach revenue goal for the month. Work was interrupted abruptly and special projects were given with little to no instructions but expected to be completed by a short deadline. Reports were ran based on the size of the client and what code be done to increase revenue. It could be somewhat stressful. However, it would be an awesome feeling when the Clients reached the goal for the month. The enjoyable part of the job was the employees in our department were like an extended family and we all got along for the most part. Because we got along it made our jobs a little less stressful."
good,To become an employee here with benefits is nearly impossible (Mc Kesson).  Your job is always in jeopardy.  They will transfer you at anytime.  Some management is adequate others the worse I ever had causing daily anxiety.  QA is ridiculous and you are micro managed.  Medix as a recruiter was great!
good,Macro Helix puts individuals in positions where they should not be. People managers needs training as they do not know how to manage and drive people off.
good,"With all of the remote applications personal, there is great team work.  Whenever staff needs troubleshoot or SMES.  The team works together to get the correct staff to help."
good,"Great place to work for, however no room for work/life balance.  The benefits and perks matches or exceeds most companies i've worked for in the past."
good,A very detailed and sometimes boring. Learned a couple of medical terms. Learned how to have many people out in the field. Knew where they were going and where they have been.
good,The managers were very selfish and weren't to concerned employees. I would say only 2 supervisors were extremely productive and dependable as far as manager duties. The human resources department were terrible with relaying important information. The work days were very unpredictable and we worked until finish so we never had any idea when we were leaving.
good,"Good people, but as a large company not a lot of collaboration outside of your own team.  The company culture is very professional, but most positions are temporary."
good,McKesson / Change Healthcare is a great company with good employee satisfaction. The day to day operations at my particular place of business were sometimes less than desirable.
good,very fast paced accuracy and hustle required . i learned most of what i know about the warehouse supply business there. company very worried about getting right balance of white black man women  not about who can and who cant get the job done
good,"I got along well with everyone at McKesson.  It was not a very stressful job as I enjoyed what I did.  However, when I needed advancement, there simply was none.  I could not move up so I had to look elsewhere for employment for my family's sake."
good,We started at 6:30 loaded our own trucks full of pallets of medical supplies. Management was not really around during my time here.The work culture was good enjoyed working with everyone. There was no real hard part to this job. Being out on the road and enjoying the customers.
good,"Many different business units and each has a different culture and challenge.  The spectrum varies, from heavily downsized teams struggling to keep afloat to more prosperous and balanced teams that are in an actively growing environment."
good,"I enjoyed working there , great place especially the people. Its hard to move up depending on your position everyone tends to stick around & the pay feels lower than the standard"
good,Not a lot opportunities for minorities if you don't know someone who can help you through the door. No true career track but excellent benefits and the pay is decent
good,"The hardest part of the job is the lack of training. This is a job for those who like to take initiative & are self learners. "
good,"dans cette compagnie j'ai appris beaucoup de choses "
good,"The people that work there are good, hard working people that work there, but the environment is harsh.     During my time working there I learned a lot about the Patient Folder software and what it takes to properly support that product."
good,Enjoyed the work and end month revenue was rewarding when the expectations were meet. It was unorganized to when Reports where delivered. A very small office and Office Manager showed favoritism but only 1/3 of employees actually done the work. To was hard to deal with Managers mood swings and her rude and immature behavior. Best to have my own office setting to get my work accomplished.
good,You need to have the ability to conform to change very quicly.  The ability to use various Microsoft system knowledge is important as information is not alway easily accessible.
good,"Over all it was a billing company to obtain clients for us to so all aspects of their billing. We lost a major client which was Tenet, which cause 70% OFF us to be laid off. Over 20 years of medical billing / collection and teaching I ever experience so much tasking back in forth to practices. I have always been one to handle encounters to the end. But with having to wait for permission to write off or adjust of balance according to what the EOB would state you still needed permission to do task that I was well aware what needed to be done even as far as coding.. We had procedures that were implemented and enforced to follow."
good,"Goal oriented, success driven company. Fast paced environment with management that engages all levels of employees."
good,"Come in, swipe, sit down at your work station, work, take your scheduled breaks, work, swipe out, go home. I worked there twice, once as a temp and once full time. I liked it there both times. But, just to be real, it's mostly indian and black races that work there, not that its an issue, it just is what it is. And they've got this really weird dress code and they don't give out raises without promotions no matter how long you've worked there. But the job is cool, it's not boring and the people are fun to work with and they have this nice cafeteria where the cooks will cook you really good food to order. Theres a little gym you can pay like $5 to work out in and you can walk outside when the weather is nice. No one is disrespectful or anything. It's a nice place to work overall. And for the easy work you do the pay isn't that bad, the benefits are pretty good and they have parties here and there and raffles and give aways. it's nice."
good,"Very good TOWP program"
good,"The morale is low, but people still love their jobs and what they do for people here."
good,Hard workers
good,Managers only spoke to you when you're not doing good and no encouragement. They gave you a point for everything.
good,"A job at Mckesson is a good one, but there's a lack of management and competence in certain areas, such as organization, problem solving and work flow. Plus an excessive amount of OT."
good,Not bad working there but I think they should pay more I liked the job but not enough pay good environment to work and co workers are great benefits are good
good,"I am very excited for an opportunity with another healthcare company that I can grow with and my goal would be to retire in my next position. I really enjoy working in the EMS Market and have found it to be very exciting and rewarding. I am not afraid to step out of my comfort zone, and would be open to new opportunities."
good,Long hours the hours didn't allow much family time during the week the people were the most enjoyable part friendly and caring from top to bottom need to get ac in the warehouse
good,"For the most part, it's a great place to work. You get to really make a difference in the quality of life for a lot of people. Most the managers are supportive of career aspirations."
good,My experience working at McKesson was a good one.  The environment was pleasant.  The work hours were not conducive to my home life which is why I had to leave.  I would have like more interaction with my manager but she was in another state.
good,Mckesson is one of the better companies to work at. I think that every company has it’s downfalls. Some managers I’ve had were young Micro managers and some managers were new but well rounded and supportive. My first and current managers are amazing. There is opportunity for growth if you work hard. The direction and fate of the company is uncertain which is why there is a missing feeling of job security.
good,"There was a wide range of career opportunities across McKesson within each BU and division.  In addition, the company was mature and had a lot of process and procedures in place which made consistent practices and efficiencies easily adoptable."
good,"The merger with Change Healthcare brought about some RIF and change in team focus.   I loved my boss and enjoyed working for her and the company.  With that said, I doubt if my position still exists within Change Healthcare due to moving all data production to Azure."
good,I like working here it's just the shift I am on does not go with my life. I need a shift that will keep me busy the one I'm does not. I do not know what else to write
good,Management there is very lacking in regards to employees.  Director is out of touch with staff and Asst Director is very condescending and controlling
good,"sink or swim environment, bad on boarding, bad training, dont like culture of negativism. Its all in who you know not your quality of work. regret working here"
good,Great company to work for once you're hired on permanently. Empty promises if you are a contract worker. Direction changes by the hour in most cases without warning.
good,"My location played favorites. consequences weren’t implemented per the policy of the company. It was very easy to get lost in the monotony of it all. However, my particular group incorporated many different things to make work more fun"
good,The office staff is great and ready to help a fellow employee if needed.  I made great friends with many co-workers.  We all push and learn from each other
good,"Time goes by fast, the employees definitely notice the hours and there is no set time to leave so you have to stay until the work is done. However the pay is good if you stay long enough and raises go by productivity."
good,"I loved the compensation, the healthy lifestyle that McKesson promotes and the full gym as well as cafeteria. The management team should aim to develop their employees to keep not herd through the blizzard season until the next batch of temps. I loved working there."
good,"McKesson MRxTS has a true vision and I believe that they mean it when they keep the patient at the center.  Many of the departments have a lot of flexibility, and the people are fantastic.  "
good,Nice place to work at.  Management very friendly to work with.  Management listen well to suggestions and look at supervisors to implement the suggestions since they work closely with the hourly employees.  Allows supervisors to  make changes without approval to increase shipping.
good,13 year employee - managed projects - good employees - poor management - IT was red headed step child - Programmers were not respected - Customers should have been treated better
good,"People at this company are fantastic. My challenge was reconciling the work with the 100% focus on profit w/o a clear mission, other than to make more money."
good,worked through staffing agency pay was decent but was not offered a permanent position no one was offered a permanent position even after told top performers would.
good,its was a fun place to work 16yrs ago i don't know how it is now. Management in my time there had mishandled things a lot. there was a big lawsuit against McKesson for fudging stock numbers.
good,"The staff with RemX is amazing they are very efficient and professional.  I really appreciated everything they did for me, however, Mckesson was not so great, they will not hire you full time in a timely manor. They keep 90% of their staff as temps and even if you are doing your best meeting their expectations there is favoritism to being hired full time."
good,The McKesson culture is fading away for the technology group moving to Change Healthcare.  They are all about cooking the books prior to the IPO regardless of who gets hurt along the way.
good,"McKesson is a great place to work, if you have a good manager.  Good Benefits.  Good Work Life Balance.  Lack of career paths and advancement opportunities."
good,"typical day at work: 7.5 hrs"
good,"At one the location in Scottsdale AZ was fun to work at, but with the change in management came changes that made it not such a fun and exciting place to work. I dont want to put every Location in the same group this is how I feel about this location."
good,"Day to day as a system administrator is a full day, I am busy from when I get there until I walk out the door. Overall it is a suportive environment and a great place to work"
good,"I enjoyed working at McKesson although it was a contract temporary job found for me by Corestaff.  I would have liked to have stayed as I enjoyed working with EHR and the medical electronic program, EPIC.  These were very enjoyable parts of my responsibilities at this job.  The hardest part of the job I would say was not having enough daily duties to last me the entire day.  I would fill the day by asking for extra things to do and usually was able to obtain them, but this was hard because it felt like I was taking tasks away from other employees of the office."
good,A typical day included:	
good,"Worked in a medical billing office. Learned a LOT about medical billing. Hardest part of the job was usually management, some good, and some a real pain. Oh, and the constant turnover, people would get a job, get trained, and then leave for better paying jobs elsewhere. The most enjoyable part of the job was the actual work, sometimes frustrating, but being able to do lots of different things, and completing the billing cycle and getting bills paid was very rewarding. The local office was closed, the remaining clients divided between other billing offices, and 30 people were laid off."
good,Managing several projects across the country and overseeing the production of a new platform replacing our old EHR.  We worked long hours to ensure all features and functionality was in place for Meaningful Use attestation.
good,"The position is complex, but the fact of taking calls makes the job very difficult to complete in a timely fashion. Accuracy is important and being a team player is more important, however some feel that they are over qualified in their position which add extra stress to your daily function. Overall the mission of the company is great but the management is outdated and tends to lack morale and employee appreciation."
good,"from a payroll prospective haphazard to say the least, basically not enough payroll knowledge from the top, until they appoint a proper payroll manager that will continue."
good,"Life at McKesson is generally great.  The progressive nature of work/life balance, compensation and benefits are all good and appreciated.  "
good,Our office was closed putting 40 plus employees out of work.  The work that we did was moved to a different location.  This caused a lot of stress within the office during the closing down of the office.
good,"Mckesson is a good company with great people. it strive to keep a good balance betweek work and family. offers great advantages such as flexible hours, etc."
good,"If you are working in McKesson IT, layoffs are frequent and deep. Outsourcing is rampant and you are allows worried about being the next casualty. Good luck."
good,"Busy, fast paced medical call center. I have learned that change is the task to master. Young, diverse, highly experienced to no experience work culture. Lack of precise training is a set back but the desire to learn and continually improve will set you apart. Individually the ability to assist the client /patient is the most enjoyable task."
good,"McKesson Provider Technologies was a great place to work for many years, but they made mistakes that has lead to McKesson trying to unload the medical IT business.  They built a large medical IT business on acquisition, but the different applications and businesses were not successfully integrated and operated as individual applications and businesses.  McKesson also sunk great deals of money into unsuccessful products and continued to pursue what they thought the clients wanted rather than listening to the clients.  McKesson overpromised and under delivered.  For many years McKesson did have some very successful applications that client really liked, but unfortunately McKesson felt it needed to shut those business down."
good,"It was a fun job at first but then towards the end it just became worse and worse. I've worked with some pretty cool people during my time there. The training was really informative and good. There's obvious favoritism there among the people. Some of the management team can use a lesson in respect and honor. The work is good if you enjoy the physical labor part of it. When I worked there, we did 8 to 13 hour shifts. We didn't have work life balance then either. It may be different now. Let's hope it was for the better."
good,"Great company, good benefits. Management in this offices needs improvement. They need to listen to their employees when issues are brought to their attention."
good,"Working for an international, top Fortune 500 company afforded was an excellent experience.  "
good,"McKesson is a solid company that strives to do things well.  While the pay is not great, there are lots of other benefits like the stock plan.  Healthcare costs are reasonable."
good,"Responsible for collecting from insurance companies and patients on radiology claims . Work denials through an computer que program, Government payer reports such as Medicare and Medi-cal to resolve denials and collect payment on claims. Work claim denial prior to being received by insurance companies to ensure clean claims are submitted. Train other associates in best ways to collect payment"
good,"Busy office, excellent co workers. good management. unfortunately temporary position."
good,"loved everything about the job, easy went to work and did my job and went home. the management/client was the reason i left. walking on eggs shells everyday wondering if your boss is gonna be mad at you or not. Just was OVER it"
good,working for McKesson was like working with your family. Small setting so everyone was fairly close. We worked hard and helped each other out if we needed to. When I first got there everyone else had been there for 10+ years and they were all very welcoming and eager to help. we had frequent outing and just bonding days. Great atmosphere.
good,"All of the workers sit in a cube and have double screen computers, all jobs are tied to billing ems transports. I pulled the lockbox for bank deposits. After in which I would input the data in a log system."
good,Its a good job just feels like you are there alot when working third shift. Good benfits and pay but hours are always changing due to change in seasons. Busier in fall and winter .
good,"I love working for this company I started as a contractor on April of 2015 and still a contractor as of today. I would have assumed  I would be turned into full time employee, but I haven't been that lucky. Other than that my peers and supervisors are awesome!"
good,"I really like this job. I learned a lot about how this industry works at this facility. At the time the management team sucked but as long as you are not a target for them, it was tolerable."
good,"a typical day at work would consist of restocking, sign prescriptions and hand customers their medication. I've learnt how to appropriately sign a prescription and what i need to do in order to give customers their medication. my co-workers were very quiet as they didn't socialise with me during my time there. The hardest part of the job had to be when i was signing prescriptions because i would forget how to do it accurately."
good,"I enjoyed working there, plenty of room to advance if you can ignore all of the drama that inevitably occurs. Management is cool as long as you come on time and just do your work. Only issue I had was the mandatory overtime, if I'm working 10+ hours everyday I think there should be a grace period in case I oversleep. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys hard work."
good,"The benefits are pretty standard at McKesson. Good Health incentives and perks for working out. Also, employees have opportunity to participate in wellness programs."
good,"Not a bad place to work at, very friendly, and fair. As long you're on time and having a good attitude you'll be ok. Its a growing business looking for individuals who want to grow and become apart of a winning business."
good,The job itself is a difficult one. It can be very frustrating at times. Most people that work there dont understand that it pays well for this area. The best part of the job is the group of people that i work with. THey are fantastic. A typical day i start with email and working things that have been sent to be done in email. Then i spend the rest of the day doing denials or whatever special projects management has to have done.
good,"I.C.A.R.E (Integrity, Customer First, Accountability, Respect, Excellence) are great company principles and the reason I am here here, but unfortunately not followed by many. The company is large and with any large company there is a disconnect between departments and management. The company does offer free drinks all day and has one of the best cafeterias around. They also provide a fitness room and showers. The facility is very clean, secure and safe.Depending on where you work the job can become very stressful. The 3 weeks PTO offered from the start is not enough to stay refreshed. McKesson does do a lot of great things for the community (IE Blood drives, donations, and charities to name a few). Insurance is average for a company that does health care. Work from Home days are a plus. It's a great place to learn how to interact with customers and enhance your technical skills."
good,"MCK has good benefits and is a sound employer. Compensation is average in my area, but employment fairly stable though advancement is slow. The culture is conservative and resists change."
good,"I enjoyed working for McKesson, I must say I learned a lot working in the healthcare field.  Management was very easy and outgoing.  Enjoyed annual cookout, parties, etc."
good,"It was good working with the company, but sadly my project is up. So had to leave,but overall a great experience to work and a pleasant work environment."
good,"A lot of good people work there, but vision moves and a lot of procedures and structure - hard to innovate.  Flexible with hours."
good,"i stay busy, i do my job and probably enough work of four total. i love what i do n take pride in it also. there are some amazing people to work for"
good,"Diversity but not always inclusion; great corporate culture despite that.  Ethically responsible and develops employees.  Employee Resource Groups play prominent role in supporting and promoting employee issues.  Products are subject to FDA regulation, so employees are trained annually and periodically on required policies and procedures."
good,"•	Took high volume inbound and outbound calls and screen and direct calls to proper case manager"
good,picking truck orders all day and filling shelves  poor management they dont listen when you ask for   fast pace company  they treat your horrible and make you work like slaves
good,A work day did not consist of much. I got on a order-picker and picked order until the work load was complete. Most of the management and all of my co workers made it a great environment to work for. Most of the co workers i worked with I considered them like brothers.
good,"An opportunity to learn about health care and how to stablish the connection between disease and resources available to modify the behavioral patterns of members of the state profile for chronic disease management. management does a great job keeping the team going, the hardest part of the job was traveling long distances to encounter members in remote or far away locations, the most enjoiyable was to see the change in members behavior towards the chronic illness they had to deal with."
good,I provided essential customer service whilst operating a till. I also helped to promote an engaging and friendly environment for my customers.
good,"Processes and Management follow through severely is lacking, there is no opportunity for growth unless you are willing to move to the other side of the country. Great Benefits and pay though. So just depends if you are trying to make this just a job or a career."
good,A typical day at work for me is very easy especially when I know what i'm doing. I learned that working with medicine is very important because there are different milligrams of the same name branded medicines. I have a great team of co workers mostly everyone works with there hands and not so much with there mouth. I love the work environment. The hardest part of the job is searching for a tote if you forgot to put the item inside of the correct tote/ if you are missing something from the customers order. Most enjoyable part of the job you never know when they are going to feed you. Just for us doing a wonderful job getting the linehauls out on time.
good,The work load was reasonable with frequent breaks throughout the day.  The workers were friendly and we all worked together as a team.
good,"They had a flex-time schedule that would accomadate their work force. The co-workers were very easy to work with."
good,typical work day consist of 10 hour shifts with many opportunities
good,The workload is a lot but keeps you busy and the day goes by fast.
good,"At Mckesson everyday is basically the same, which is perfect. The work was fun and things got done quickly. The only thing that was preventing that compay from being the best was the fact that the lazy people were a protected class for some reason. The people who really worked hard were not rewarded, and certain managers chose favorites for one reason or another. Other than that Mckesson was easily the best company I've ever worked for."
good,Very busy day
good,"good team moral, opportunities to further your career, one to one supervision, working on a front line customer service team I enjoyed the challenge of problem solving on a daily basis"
good,"Good job to work for. Good work schedule. The workers makes you feel comfortable, help you when needed. Easy work environment. Very easy to learn new things."
good,Good place to work. They don’t pay a whole lot but it’s very good training provided and a good work atmosphere. It has a good work life balance. They love to eat and fellowship a lot there. Team oriented for sure.
good,It’s RxCrossroads NOT McKesson. McKesson is wonderful. McKesson themselves has a lot of growth opportunity. RxCrossroads does not. They make it hard for you to advance. Gives you no clear direction.
good,It's a great company to work for there a family. Everyone works together to make sure all work is done. The staff is kind and thoughtful the managers are hands on.
good,The workflow was suitable. There isn't really organization with training in the pharmacy systems department which contributes to a stressful environment and high turn over rates.
good,Its corporate.....and all the goid and bsd thst entails.  We were contact employees hired after McKesson outsourced the IT dpt.  I had little interaction with anyone other than local people.
good,Always provided me challenging and changing roles.  Opportunities to travel and relocated including expat opportunities in Ireland and Germany.  Learned a lot working for them.
good,"..."
good,"McKesson offered a great benefits package and while on maternity leave, I had no worries and received 100% of my salary while off for 12 weeks to care for my newborn daughter. Great experience overall working there."
good,"McKesson Canada offered a productive and collaborative work environment, with many perks!  Colleagues were friendly and supportive. McKesson offers an onsite gym,amazing social club activities, a community garden and many more perks!"
good,This company has a customer and patient focused mentality and provides generous benefits to their employees.  They have an innovative and strategic mindset and are always looking for ways to grow and develop.
good,"Great training to complete job requirements, busy and productive place to work, very adamant about product and keeping number calculated correctly, and counts must be correct at all times."
good,"I  start worked at as order filler for 11 half years, then im on days, doing most cutting putting away product, picking and help with other stuff. Im get along with everybody and when have problem talk to management slove  the problems"
good,"The work was very repetitive. Speed is essential.Data was transferred from one system to another. Answered the phone on occasion, though we of limited assistance."
good,"The manager's daughter worked there and was given the easier accounts. Talking was frowned upon unless you were ""teacher's pet"""
good,J'ai apprécié travaillé à cet endroit pour mon emploi d'été. Le salaire est compétitif pour les étudiants et les horaires sont belles et toujours pareilles.
good,I had many opportunities to learn new skills and business processes.  My team were my mentors and I spent time and worked with subject experts and influential trendsetters for HR.
good,Honestly a great company with great benefits. They have a lot of different programs to work for the specific one I worked for had the wrong people in charge. If you ever disagree with something out the door. Try to tell upper management out the door.
good,"Good training, helpful staff, great hours, very diverse different cultures that blend well. Enjoyed staff and colleagues everyone was friendly and very helpful"
good,I enjoy working at McKesson. I have a flexible work schedule and work with a great group of people. The company plans fun events and make you feel welcomed like family.
good,"A typical night was heavy and fast paced. I learned so much about management and how to motivate people.  Supervisors were tough, but fair.  The people are very interesting and diverse.  I was able to learn other cultures and cultivated lasting relationships with many coworkers.  "
good,"Great team work, admin. was helpful, co-workers needed help with soft skills and professionalism.  Poor dress code with no back lash when not followed"
good,"Love working there, its a fast pace, training was very detailed and people were very nice and understanding , willing to teach. Work hours work very good with me"
good,quite a good working place. staffing problem though. very busy workload. staff problems never seem to end. good support from cluster managers and others
good,The work experience was satisfactory. There is lot of opportunity for company to provide career growth opportunities for the employees. Also there is opportunity to improve the benefits plan.
good,"great place to work and a lot of growth within the organization. I worked in the CMM (CoverMyMeds) department. I was very pleased to be employed, will recommend to anyone."
good,"Would work there again if offered a position.  Competitive pay, good culture.  The team values one another and efficiencies and creativity are valued greatly."
good,"lack of management. She was never there and when she was there she didn't know her job "
good,It's rewarding to work with great colleagues who make a difference in healthcare for many people. We work hard but also take time to participate in community and volunteer events.
good,Good till I had to move. It's relaxed but busy at times. I recommend you get rest and keep positive. Also McKesson had a lot of positive workers. I would work there again
good,Really enjoyed working for McKesson. They provide a good work/life balance. Have participated in several team building events and other company events organized by social committee. The management staff have held monthly town halls to keep us informed about the changes and the direction in which McKesson is headed.
good,"work an 8 hr day load truck make deliveries. management was good, co workers good to work with. the hardest thing was probably having to set up your pto in advance a year ahead."
good,"unstable job security"
good,It was a fast pace work hard work but the people made it fun we had a good group.  The management did play favorites but the employees were very nice and our parties were fun
good,New work environment is conducive to collaboration.  Good opportunities for growth across business units.  Close collaboration across teams and with customers.
good,"Company is great, unfortunately upper management within the building is not so great. My manager is fantastic, however above is less than desired. Otherwise the company is fantastic."
good,"Using walker-rollers we would take orders and fill pallets. Then the pallets would be wrapped and loaded onto the appropriate 18-wheeler for shipment. Plenty of overtime available, and the job had freedom (very little micromanagement). Employees were allowed to go about their day and check-in at the end of a shift."
good,You knew exactly what was expected of you. Management for the most part was fair. The hardest part of the job was having to do the exact same thing day after day! I enjoyed my co-workers!
good,nice working environment. love the people and had an amazing time working there. if you get the opportunity to work at the place I will encourage you to take it
good,"Just as I started in April 2016 they did a corporate restructure and it was over as soon as it started :-). Nice people but stressed out for obvious reasons,"
good,"-Handled customer orders and ensured on time delivery"
good,"hard physically demanding work. shiftwork,good pay and benefits. "
good,"Easy work, as long as you have a strong work ethic and strong attention to detail. Being on time is very important but, they are understanding as long as you contact and communicate with them in enough time if a situation arises."
good,"Working at McKesson as a remote employee was a fulfilling career choice.  I was trusted and valued as an employee, but as a remote worker, very few opportunities arise for moving up.  Management shifts constantly and over the 19 years that I worked there, each and every year there was a reduction in force - which left employees with a taste of fear that they would be next.  It does have a way of inspiring those employees that remain to work harder."
good,Good systems in place to do your job. policies and procedures in place to get the job done and good communication on up and coming events. Worked with other departments to get projects completed.
good,"Would go back to it, great hours, people are Friendly. Love working with the customers. The trainung the give you is very expainatory  with wht we are and needing to do."
good,"Typical day at McKesson was full of meetings. Everyday was different, there was not one day that was virtually the same. McKesson tends to make decisions very fast and execute on those decisions."
good,Temp Employee -  It is a great company over all but some of the salaries are very low in HR. HR does a lot but can make less than warehouse employees.
good,"Incredible job with very low salary expectations....no opportunity to grow, however. Management doesn't look inwards for their director promotions. New high level managers that don't provide guidance to IT workers since no visibility."
good,"The benefits, perks, policies and wages are above average, Parent friendly company with generous parental leave. Tools and resources available for career growth."
good,Mckesson is a great company to work for.  I hope to work for them again one day. They treat their employee's well. They offered a free gym and they had a cafe to have healthy food prepared for you daily.
good,"good place to work. the staff was friendly, they give you a great opportunity to move up within the company. The management staff was great and supportive."
good,"This project involved creating a Data Warehouse for sales/inventory reporting system. Data from ODS (Operational Data Source) was extracted, transformed, and loaded into EDW (Enterprise Data Warehouse) using SQL, PL/SQL stored procedures."
good,"Great place to work with great management, work life balance is something McKesson needs to work on. Overtime hours are available from time to time which is nice"

good,Good working experience that provided new opportunities. The culture is well diverse. Managers and employees are willing to support career growth. Good place to work.
good,"McKesson was a good place to work and worked there for 19 years before being sold to Allscripts. I enjoyed my time working at McKesson, since they believed that family comes first. "
good,"Pros the benifits are great"
good,"Good place to work. Now in process of outsourcing to TX."
good,"I can only speak to a short time in the high stress environment I worked in.  VERY high speed, high stress, hostile work environment, always under the threat of not having a job if performance was not up to astronomical standards."
good,"good work environment and culture. "
good,Answered busy phone system. Prepared corespondance. Compiled reports. Made travel arrangements. Put together mailing requests for marketing materials.
good,"les journées sont routinière mais facile a accomplir. Salaire de départ étais a 14.50$ et la 3 ieme année j'étais rendu déjà a 17.00$. Travail individuel de préparation de commandes. Mckesson est un grossiste en produits pharmaceutique et hospitalier. Chaque année, il organise un marché au puce avec les produits proche de la date d'expiration ou défectueux pour la vente. tout est a 0.25 cent ce qui rendra vos conjointe absolument au 7 ieme ciel."
good,McKesson Corp is a great company with a rich history.  The pharmaceutical division is highly rank and the overall financial stability of this company is fantastic.
good,not a bad place to work. need to improve pay. need to improve work life balance. Liked the people I worked with. Management was ok. training was good.
good,great place to work. i would recommend this job to others! the new location is way better then the old scottsdale location. i very much loved this job
good,"very little innovation, responds only to customers requests, development is only done once it has already been paid for, management doesn't see value in investing in new ideas or driving the industry"
good,I worked with this company for 9 years in somerset NJ. we had great time with summer picnic and Xmas day off.   management is very nice with equal opportunity
good,"For the most part, the staff are nice to work with.  "
good,It was a very physically grueling place to work. The conditions were a bit depressing as well. Never saw natural sunlight. Very strict about certain things as well.
good,McK was a great place to work.  Unfortunately there were layoffs.  I would have made this a long time engagement if I was given the chance.  Some of my friends are still there after 10 years.

good,its a fun fast paced enviorment. i really enjoy my work there. the supervisor is very helpful. the company reall gives you the correct knowledge you need to be super.
good,They were able to assist me with finding a job with less then one week.  This is a temp agency with good referrals and job services.  They place you with good companies.
good,A typical day involves serving the public and ensuring dispensed medications. Working at Lloyds involves constantly updating myself on new medicines and products. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers happy with your service and giving feedback to that effect.
good,Mckesson is a great company to work for and tends to its employees every need. They have great benefits and extra perks for the smaller things in life
good,"Managed day to day and strategic goals of the shared services support desk. "
good,"Company used to be a good place. Now not so much. Management is sometimes clueless, if you always agree with your manager you will do good. One AVP in particular has an open door policy, unfortunately it is only open when it is empty! Also they want you to talk to your direct supervisor and not bring up anything directly to them."
good,"A typical day involved planning and scheduling. I learned that with my experience, skills and knowledge, I was able to meet the challenges that each day brought. The management was supportive. The work place culuture was diverse. The most difficult part of the job was work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team work and reward system."
good,I've been working for this company for about 4 years now and so far everything has been good. Just meet your daily goals and everything is good. Great benefits
good,"Enjoyed my time there, however at times work would be quite stressful. Colleagues and managers did a good job to mitigate work loads and balance it out."
good,"Lower management like team leads and supervisors are great. Although if you're there through a temp agency, don't be surprised if you're laid off out of the blue."
good,McKesson hires talented and driven people.  It grows through acquisition so there are many opportunities to move throughout the company.  It is very fast paced environment.
good,Relies on individual performances to maintain safety and accountability of a wide range of medications and other products that are shipped to many customers.
good,"this company really care about its customers, they always drive home the importance of the customers. they have great managers, the hardest part of the job, which is the LMS program, which measures your production, and tracks your work, is actually the most enjoyable. because they pay you more based on your performance so you are in control of how much money you make."
good,"nice place to work, the work hours were great. The ability to learn new things was a good thing. You were never bored and the training is really good and easy to pick up."

good,overall  a very good company..very good place to enhance your overall skills. the management is quite friendly.. to overcome the targets provided by the company is little challenging..
good,"McKesson overall is a good company to work for. Every job is easy to do, there is a lot of standing and walking.  Lifting is required. Must be able to work at a steady pace. Work hours are not flexible."
good,A great job with plenty of traveling. You must be self motivated and personable. The company is a great company to work for and they train you for the position.
good,Everything at Mckesson is good . I want to find a good opportunity .at Mckesson  had a good Supervice and leader and management .  A lot of a good employee and team work
good,"I have really enjoyed my time here, lots of opportunity.  New building is great, on-site gym including free classes.  Parking Garage. On-site cafeteria."
good,Great place for mid level career professional. Employees enjoy the work life balance. There are a lot of opportunities within the company. Career development is limited.
good,"Working on maintaining licensing with the DEA, correspondence for manager, basic office duties, & work on an event or meeting. I enjoyed the people I worked with and for.  Management wanted me to slowly work into Human Resources.  This is not something I enjoy or wanted to do."
good,Good company the atmosphere and culture is a good environment to work.  Learned to be healthy they are very involved in the health of their employees.
good,"Overall the culture of this company is great. They work really hard to keep it a family like environment and it does make the place great. However, the work is tough on the body."
good,"I would be the first level support to incoming customers and internal worker. I learned customer service skills, documentation, and technical skills. The hardest part of the job was the commute. That was a nightmare."
good,The application process requires a test in computer skills so brush up and know your outlook. The whole application process took months! It is a nice avenue to get into the work from home venue in nurse care managment.
good,"I'm more knowledgeable with wound care, ostomy, catheter, and trach products. A typical day at work is calling facilities and confirming re-orders and new orders."
good,"Supervisors were rotating through frequently bringing in new and mostly favoring women in horrendous ways. Eventually it became about 70% women, with the few men there doing all the hard work. Employees were usually good to work with, it was a matter of supervisors being terrible in many ways."
good,"good working condition, good pay, the shift I worked, location, co-workers, all around a good company to work for with climate control and offers great benefits ,"
good,I have been with McKesson (previously MED3OOO) for 7 1/2 years.  It is a great place to work with a fun environment and room for advancement.  We take great pride in the work we do for the EMS community.

good,"Great company to work for with good benefits.  Worked in the accounting department in the Carrollton, TX area.  Large company with great group of management and employees."
good,"Caring management that will work with you the best they can. A little overwhelming work load with assigned lunch and breaks for customer service. All other positions are able to choose their breaks and lunch times.  Freedom to choose daily schedule, you can start your day at any time from 7:00 – 8:30. The company has community days to bring joy to cancer patients. The benefits are good, visual, dental and assistance with health. Work environment is nice up to date technology. The thousand Oaks office has a beautiful view of the mountains for your breaks. The lunch room needs more microwaves making warming your lunch, time consuming. All of customer service takes lunch at 12 making warming your lunch at 12 hard to do. The vacation time is decent when you start and as the years pass the time you get off increases. Month long vacations are possible but not always guaranteed."
good,Great place to learn and find a career. Diversify and learn all aspects of medical billing. Learn the cycle from when a patient goes to an appointment to every process in between- to when the patient receives a bill. Be able to have the understanding of the process and be able to explain to patients. Gain great customer service skills. Gain problem solving skills. A great place to grow and learn.

good,"made appointments, phone calls. Landscaping company. Dealt with posting receipts, quick books, microsoft, excel, etc. Co-workers were difficult to work with."
good,"In a company that size, your perception is in large part effected by your manager.  I've had an awesome manager who helped me grow and I am still friends with, and I've had a terrible manager who made me want to leave and get an MBA.  Your experience is determined mostly by chance."
good,Very productive and a very busy work environment. Its a great place to work and room for advancement. very family orientated . which is awesome.
good,"My typical work day included any administrative duty that was required including, customer orders, customer returns, faxes, phone calls, etc. I did these duties by direction of management via email and phone calls.

Like any other job you have to be careful who you talk to I pretty much social with everyone but keep it short and my business to myself."
good,"This is an amazing company to work for, however the politics of my particular position/team cancelled out any chance of fulfilling the career I could have had here."
good,This review is specifically tailored to the SoCal location where until you pass 5 years or so you will not have the required seniority to leave third shift.  Not recommended for a young person.
good,You show up and punch in then you get on your lift truck and start the cycle counts. After the cycle counts are done we start receiving in any product that was left from the day before or any that has already shown up.
good,McKesson is a great company to work for. They have great benifits and management is great. Co-workers are pretty nice but the hardest part about the job is liftingheavy boxes

good,I enjoyed working at McKesson for the last 14 years.  Great company with a bright future.  I wish all my associates success.  Good luck to all of you.
good,McKesson like most large companies lose sight of how important their employees are to the success of the company. They were also way to fast to pat themselves on the back. When McKesson took over PSS and its companies they never let it be known how many people were left without jobs and no amount of severance pay makes up for all the years of service.
good,"•"
good,"I learned a lot during my time there and really enjoyed most of the people.  Like all organizations, there is good and there is bad.  Much will depend on which department you work in."

good,"McKesson is a very good learning curve in the vaccination world I didn't know much but the team I worked with was amazing and they taught me everything it was to know."
good,This company wasn't the best to work for. While the benefits were nice the environment didn't really allow for much balance in my work life.
good,"Great fortune 500 company, work/life balance was more work than life. Travel averaged 90%.  The compensation was fair as well as the bonus structure.  Great benefits!  Job security was above average."

I learned how to stand up for myself and my confidence gained a lot. management and my co-workers were nice. they were very helpful to me in any problems that arose and that I needed help with. the hardest part of the job was I when i made mistakes and I would get very disappointed in myself and get upset and stressed when i left work. the most enjoyable part of my job in the chemist was getting to speak to all of the customers about their daily lives and helping them in any way possible.
good,"I liked my people and the job everything about it...pay, location the only reason I left was because I bought a bar and grill"
good,"bonne expérience, c'est une entreprise qui favorise le développement personnel."

good,"Not much opportunity for career advancement once you reach a certain position, but the people make working at McKesson Health Solutions great!"
good,"Picking orders, packing them, and quality control. Shipping and wrapping, then loading them on the truck."

good,I worked at McKesson Medical Imaging for 10 years but unfortunately the company is experiencing some financial difficulties and needed to reduce the workforce so they did a lay off.
good,"1. Review Webi reports and dashboards."
good,Mckesson was a pharmaceutical warehouse so i learned a lot about medication and how to store them. I loved my co-worker because if i needed to know anything they where there to help me.
good,Again I was brought in temp to hire. They extended my temp position 3 times and gave me hope I was going to be hired in. At the beginning of the year 2013 they let me go. Leaving me with no job until October 2013 when i was brought into  HealthDirect (Kinney Drugs)
good,The hours were long but manageable. Dealing with patients from different aspects of life taught me how to communicate effectively particularly when giving instructions on how to take medication and adhere to their drug regimen.
good,"McKesson was a great stepping stone for me to learn about the operations within a Hospital and the software solutions used that used to be done on paper manually.  I enjoyed ESI the most when it was small company and everyone got to know everyone and people bent over backwards to help one another.  After HBOC acquired ESi and McKesson bought HBOC, it just wasn't the same culture."
good,"•	Support users up to Tier 1 or 2 standards; escalate to higher Tier if unsolvable from 1st or 2nd line."
good,"The  atmosphere was good and the team work was great.  It was always something new to learn or to show, communication with the other satilites where also a good learning tool."
good,I felt like this position did not fit with my family needs at that time. The position grew to be stagnate instead of progressive.
good,"Our industry is a disruptive one that provided the tools to physicians to dispense prescriptions on site without the patient needing to go to the pharmacy.  We had a small IT team that developed the online software platform that allowed customers to order and track drug purchases from re-packagers, dispense prescriptions with payment types of cash and workers compensation, submit controlled substance reporting to comply with state and federal regulations, and run various reports for regulatory and profitability reasons. We constantly updated and evolved the software platform to comply with the ever changing regulations of the industry and to meet the needs of our various customer practice models."
good,I went to work for McKesson due to a previous manger making me an offer I couldn't refuse.  I liked working there they were just going through a restructure and I got laid off.
good,"I learned a lot in my different roles and my fellow RN co-workers were the most intelligent, hard working and most compassionate nurses I had the priviledge of working with. The most difficult part of the job was the micro-managing. The best was working with members and having them reach their goals."
good,"During the week I did both the jobs required by a retail assistant, as well as a dispenser as my work experience entailed gaining experience from across the pharmacy. I learnt how to dispense medicines correctly, as well as how to do stock and price checks. Management was good but lenient, they trusted me to get on with what I had to do once I had been given a satisfactory amount of instruction, and my co-workers were very nice in accommodating me as part of their team for a week. The hardest part was putting away the medicines after a delivery as their are stored chronologically by chemical name, not brand name, thought the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public to help them find what they needed."
good,Fun place to work at and a good learning curve for any student to start with
good,"My daily routine consist of issue resolution via email and three different issue queues from three different systems. I learned processing in 4 ERP systems while at McKesson as well as gained more in depth exposure to PO processing. The hardest part of the job was workload management, everything is urgent and priority. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers there is never a dull moment."

good,I was happy with the company and my coworkers. They treated me with kindness and respect.
good,During my one week work experience I grow a lot in confidence as customer service is very important in retail. I also developed an understanding of team work and good communication. I was only 15 at the time so I was too young to get offered a job.
good,"I am currently employed as a Data Entry Operator for a radiologist/pathologist billing office. I absolutely love what I do and love all my co-workers. Due to financial reasons, our location is closing. July 1st will be our last day. I will be available for employment on July 2nd. Thank you!"

good,I really enjoyed my time at McKesson.  My supervisor made the job easy and she was very helpful when it came to thing that you were not sure of.  I learned how to go to different websites to obtain the necessary information needed to file claims to the correct insurance company.  My coworkers were very friendly and helpful.
good,"Interesting work, with many excellent programmers.  Upper management changes every 4-6 months, often with accompanying changes in focus and direction."
good,"Worked as Corporate HR intern, building tools and creating data-base that focused on achieving quarterly fiscal goals. "
good,I learned the importance of team work and HIPPA. My co-workers are hardworking and very supportive of one another. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unknown issues that spring up from time to time. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning something new everyday.
good,"McKesson has an excellent, Informal, Client centric work environment. It is considered a leader in Healthcare IT."
good,They gave me good hours and the staff i worked with was very professional
good,McKesson offers the complete healthcare package of carrier oppurtunities.
good,"Employees and management worked very closely together. Wonderful culture to work in. Many employee events, management participation was great."
good,Fortune 500 company. Work life balance is good. Worked there for 7 years and I recommend it as a great company
good,I was very comfortable with the techniques they have used and I enjoyed work.
good,It was a nice place to work. Every thing ran smooth and management was good
good,great company to work for i hate that they closed down i loved working with the guys
good,"Depending on the seasom whether it be the busy, busy summer or the not so busy winter time depended on the typical work day. I had a great experience there with everyone I worked with. Over the years I was there I was able to learn several different areas that all varied in expectations."
good,I believe the company overall is a good place to work but the location I work at needs a huge moral boost. We are the forgotten office and the people they have in management can care less about us and what we do.
good,"I would do my usual duties of handling prescriptions ensuring customers signatures were on there, counting the prescriptons, talking with the customers and assisting them whenever they required assistance, as well as handling confidential files."
good,It was a great job it just wasnt any room to become permanent.
good,"I am so glad that I have the team of workers that I do, they have helped train me and helped me gain the knowledge that I have. And in return I will always keep them laughing because at times the day can get stressful."
good,Friendly enviornment with great pay. Great part time position
good,McKesson has very low turnover and for people who fit in the result is very positive.
good,Co-workers and direct management were very nice and helpful.Clean and safe environment with some unexpected amenities.
good,"Overall McKesson provides a cozy and safe workplace environment, helpful benefits and insurance plans. Management is stern at inspiring employees to work at their best, although their latest decisions are making employees feel uneasy and that their jobs are no longer stable. Those that are laid off or promoted are not being replaced, creating an ever increasing workload. Due to that and the fact I have been prohibited of ever asking for a day shift position again; lack of schedule flexibility"
good,"This is a very big, dynamic, exciting company to be a part of. There are multiple divisions to which you can apply and advance into. Just prepare yourself that the market and industry is constantly changing, so you have to be reactive and innovative with these changes."
good,"Trying to work at McKesson and live an outside life is harder then one could assume. Unless you gave yourself just a few hours of sleep, good luck trying to live outside of the job."
good,"While I loved what I did, I hate that they took our department to other states. It was great job with wonderful people. The satisfaction of helping someone pay their Co pay for their MD meds is what kept me coming back."
good,Good place to work with established reputation. Good benefits and hours. Really hard to get pto at certain times of the year when lots of long term employees have seniority.
good,"I worked there during the hurricanes and we had taken on nearly a third of the nation's business. Needless to say, it was long hours and I lost four layers of skin off my feet until I couldn't walk 🤪"
good,One of the factors for deciding to leave was that the single point of contact had to manage both case management and reimbursement services. I do enjoy working remotely.
good,"I think McKesson is a good company over all however, the pay could be a lot better.  "
good,Its a fast paced job with little employees. Benefits and bonuses are great. I have been there for a year now and I have no complaints this far. Management is understanding.
good,Depending on your job title you do inbound/ outbound work that consist of being a customer service rep & working on behalf of the the customer. My most recent job consisted of calling insurance carriers for patient's to obtain benefits. From this higher ups would gauge if any financial assistance would be needed. There was a daily quota of completing 25 cases a day. They would offer OT if available & pay was great. There was no job stability or benefits.
good,"McKesson has a great corporate infrastructure and has made attempts to foster a culture of leading and caring for their employers.  While the work is theoretically silo-ed, there is enough experience to grow and learn new skills. Management promoted from within tends to embody the culture, but some outside hires don't necessarily do that.  Work - life balance can be a struggle with sales deadlines looming."
good,"Would like a little more work life balance , maybe listen to there core people more. Some what of good place to work can be some time to a little crazy depending on work for that day"
good,"Never worked in a warehouse before or overnights. I like the environment but sometimes the work load gets s bit heavy, when to many associates call off or are on vacation."
good,"Learn as much as you can and ask questions often in order to keep up and move up quickly. Great place to work if you enjoy a relaxed, laid back atmosphere."
good,Very inclusive company despite the offices being located in different parts of the country. They strived to be transparent but that was not always possible.
good,"Company provides great benefits. The hours are long, you must not make a lot of mistakes, requires you to be on your feet and there can be some heavy lifting occasionally."
good,"I enjoyed working for McKesson. It was a disappointment when my division was spun off to a new organization where McKesson was minority owner. "
good,They need to listen to the drivers we are out there we know the goings on mgmt needs to care a lil more an be more understanding need to level the playin field so everyone's on the same page
good,Overall McKesson is a good stable company that has been around for over 160 years.  Experience is drastically different depending on the department/location you work in. Overall a great company and good culture.
good,"Solid company with great financials. Good people, good industry, the best at what they do. Still a large corporation, so decisions are made slowly, but overall very happy with the company as a whole."
good,"I enjoyed working for McKesson, even during reorganizations. The writing was on the wall of the future state of IT, so I pursued other career options outside of the company, but overall, I felt it was a great starter job to get experience with a Fortune 500 and take that experience with me to negotiate better compensation elsewhere. Several people I worked with left McKesson to come back in another role simply to negotiate higher salaries which left a knowledge gap on the team/area they left. It's unfortunate that managers/leadership did not capitalize on the opportunity to dig deeper into the aspirations and dreams of their employees and find ways to help them achieve these goals. If they had, those working for them would have partnered by transferring knowledge and would likely not leave the company with a knowledge/person gap when they pursued those dreams/goals anyway.Like any large and older organization, the culture was well established and transformation needed to accommodate the needs/wants of up and coming talent was difficult. Old behaviors die hard. However, all that being said, there were perks that can not be found at all organizations, such as work from home, amazing co-workers, great benefits and paid time off. At the time I worked there, these things were more important to me."
good,My position kept me working third shift at an average 9-10 hours shift. The pay was more than enough to justify the crazy hours however not allowing the time with my family that I desired.
good,The management of lum did not care about your life and did not support the opportunity for anyone who wanted to go to school. The company itself was amazing.
good,"enjoyed working at mckesson, staff welcoming and friendly. salary was good. only down fall was i was employed on a temporary basis would have preferred a permanent position."
good,I enjoyed working at McKesson. They merged with another company and moved the billing operations to other states that had lower minimum wages. I learned a lot working for them.
good,Strong college graduate program which opens doors to the new generation. Calm and relaxed atmosphere working environment. Execellent computer equipment and supportive IT staff. Great company!
good,"Review Agents and their progress each day, listen to calls and of my agents. Enjoyed my interaction with my Manager at that time, she mentored me and gave me the tools to succeed."
good,"Mckesson is a great company. The management is not so great. There is a constant change where management tries to make improvements. They start implementing a program and two weeks later they forget about it. They are very lazy when it comes to policies and enforcing the rules. They are supposed to give safety briefs, but the supervisor is riding on a forklift like a scooter, in front of all of his employees, before giving a safety brief."
good,"Management does not always promote success and some seem overwhelmingly inexperienced.  The ideas of growth and movement are talked about , but are not really given as an opportunity."
good,They offered work life balance but no opportunity for advancement.  I enjoyed working with the other teams on a daily basis.  Management was ok to work/
good,Flexible work hours. Opportunities for advancement and great training opportunities. People there are great and very helpful. Its like a family here. Travel opportunities.
good,"Very performance driven. Limited ability to impact budget. Many career development opportunities. Healthcare will be impacted in the coming years and drug prices as well, so we shall see the impact to McKesson... especially with consolidation."
good,The area is nice. It is a good place to work. Wish I could go back. The hardest part is showing up to work because it was far from my house. One of the security guards is rude for no reason that's the bad part.
good,"Good place to work. Benefits are great. Working with patients, and field staff was very rewarding. I gained a lot of knowledge of healthcare billing at this company."
good,I enjoyed working with my work family and if my job was not eliminated I would have been happily working with my work family doing what was necessary to complete my work loads to work as a team and  to help where ever I was needed. I did many different thing and enjoyed the commodity of changing tasks as needed
good,"There have been a lot of changes for the better, management changed a few years ago and it's the best thing that could've happened. There was a lot of favoritism going on."
good,"Job was great, but stress during division merger and subsequent buyout was very high.  Abnormal number of changes within 12 months.  General information and change status was limited."
good,Very busy but was given authority to make changes and improve productivity. Culture was tough and the employees were very difficult to manage but leadership team was excellent
good,Overall McKesson was a great foray into the Medical World. I learned a ton and worked with some great folks. There were many great leaders and a few poor ones--I'm not sure why they didn't get rid of them.
good,"Upper management preferred to not work out issues within my department and choose to ignore problems rather than to help fix them."
good,Relay Health was a great opportunity for me to learn more about Networking. I was able to collaborate and learn from some great coworkers along the way to better myself and take with me moving forward.
good,McKesson is what you make of it.  You can have a great manager and a poor company and still be happy.  Or you can have a great company and poor management and be miserable.  It is all about who your manager is.  Company is going through a major transition as of right now.  Lots of changes coming.
good,"Fast pace, busy customer service office.  Placing orders, processing credits, researching and selling medical supplies to nursing homes and skilled facilities. Working closely with sales reps to assure the proper service for customers.  Working with several computer systems such as Microsoft, outlook, as400, JD Edwards 9.1, RF portals, excel and Microsoft word. McKesson is a very diverse company with great management, and a family style staff. The most challenging part of the position,  The work is never caught up.  In this company, there is no getting ahead. There is always one priority that over takes another priority. The most enjoyable part of the position is that as an individual,  helping customers get the medical items that they need,  Being able to provide to the customer items they need for their patients or loved ones is a personal reward, with the warm feeling that knowing that we were able to help someone in need."
good,"Was finding out that my position was being terminated since I was a contractor, all contractors position was being eliminated at the end of the fiscal year."
good,"Great pay, Break rooms are good. lobby in the Galleria building at the time was good, very spacious. Poor management, did not lead by example. I would return, under different management."
good,McKesson's Pharmacist Support Job is a pretty good starting position for those trying to stay in the healthcare/pharmaceutical industry. There is not a lot of upward mobility.
good,"Pleasant environment, flexible work hours. I enjoyed my job at McKesson for 11 years until the outsourcing began. Fair pay raise, great health insurance."
good,Nice place to work if you enjoy customer service and being on phones for the duration of your day. The people were nice and I enjoyed being able to have a schedule that was conducive to my children's schedule.
good,"Great place to work at if you are a active person because you do a lot of walking. Nothing to hard or a back breaker. Employee and management are good. Got let go(laid off) because we lost a big account, would return if called back."
good,Laid off after 12 years. Always busy. Long hours not uncommon. Travel can be frequent depending on role. In final position before being laid off I worked out of my home (5years).
good,"If you work here, be prepared to work long hours. That has its pros if you like the job and need the money, but a con is that its not a set schedule and you will get off work at different times daily. Also, the breaks are short. Sometimes later than others. However, the benefits are really good."
good,A typical work day at McKesson consist of helping people in need.  I learned how to deal with prior authorizations and insurances while assisting doctors and patients.  The workplace culture was fairly comfortable.  The hardest part of my job I would say was knowing what the patients were going through emotionally.  The easiest part of my job would've been the joy of helping a patient get the care that they needed.
good,preparing a schedule for your day. looking to see what your daily run rate should be and smile and dial.days go by very quick because your busy.great team spirit and manager very positive.
good,"A typical work day included breaking down pallets ofter they were delivered from Atlanta. Sorting the three routes and getting the tickets in order.  Loading the tthree rucks up for daily deliveries. Then delivering to the customers in Savannah, Beaufort, Wilmington Island areas."
good,I learned a lot at McKesson and would have loved to continue my career there but my temp job didn't move to permanent. Good environment. I needed a better manager but good company.
good,"A typical day at McKesson for what I can remember was very fast paced, I learned that I would have to step my skills up just to keep up with the work load; the workplace culture was very helpful and friendly; the hardest part of the job was just trying to keep up, I really enjoyed speaking to different people and the encouragement each co-worker had for one another."
good,Working for mckesson is not bad at all at the time I was working there. There was a few thing that I will say is that the time that I was working there the managers are the problems
good,"The office in total was not a bad place to be, and most of the people there were nice or at the very least tolerable. The work wasn't too hard, but there was a lot of it and you had to do it quick. Personally, after 2 and 1/2 years I've just become extremely bored of it."
good,"Enjoyed the travel, customer interaction, and opportunities to help improve business of my customers. Recent Company changes created logistical issues for customers which were difficult to overcome. Legislative changes created challenges for both company and customers in recent years, resulting in cutting costs and services."
good,"Great fast paced environment. "
good,"You can learn a lot at this company, however you have to be able to handle stress and you have to be able to make every moment count and take opportunities to learn new things and make yourself noticeable in order to advance in the company"
good,"I would say that a typical work day would be about 9 and half hours of walking on your feet and interacting with people. I learned a lot of medicine names and what exactly some benefits they have, I really enjoyed management and they were very hands on and professional.The hardest part was probably the walking and hours on your feet but you get used to it. The easiest was the people and the music you get to hear while you work."
good,On the phone from start to finish every work day.  The company keeps track of phone call times and periodically assesses the calls.  Half and hour lunches and two 15 min breaks everyday.
good,Friendly environment with lots of job opportunities within always help there if needed and overtime available in other stores if not ours all try and help one another.
good,"Management was often supporting and beneficial to the work day. Sometimes, unexpected overtimes made it much more difficult to manage other obligations with the job."
good,The company is great in training but not to promote. The management is very knowledgeable but again not willing to help you exceed. The office environment was the best part.
good,A great place to get experience in a hunter role mixed with account management.  The role is very high paced but compensation does not match your efforts.
good,McKesson is a wonderful company to work for with many benefits. It does not pay the wages that I'm looking for and career advancement is hard to come by. I'm looking to grow in my career and found this impossible in my current position. Currently I adjudicate medical claims for a large physician group. I enjoy the work content.
good,"Working at McKesson is not bad. The pay isn't great, but the PTO and benefits are great. There's not a lot of room for advancement, unless you are well liked,"
good,Had a great time while working here . Was only a part time job(6hrs mon-thurs) the pays were great. Management wasn’t the greatest but I still managed to have a great time during my term here
good,"McKesson is a very relaxed culture, and great for those who want to go to work, put in the time, and go home .  It's a very balanced life.  Depending on roles, it can be stressful, especially with the constant change and evolution of the company."
good,"Change Healthcare is offshoring post of the Accounts Receivable functions. We used to be under McKesson so I don't know much about Change Healthcare. "
good,"The company has great benefits, wonder employees and team work. Management is understanding and works hard to accommodate its employees. Unfortunately they are shipping most of the work oversees to India."
good,OK place to work. Staffing levels not evaluated properly which caused multiple lay offs during my tenure.  Not sure how becoming Change HealthCare will effect the day to day operations.
good,Company overall is good. Down fall is some of they employees intend to slack off. Good vacation time the longer you stay with the company. You also have UPTO and Sick leave days off.
good,"McKesson offers a lot of benefits to their employees."
good,Good place to work with a relaxed atmosphere for a fast paced job that required quick action and follow-up in order to provide solutions to customer base.
good,"Great work-life balance, great work environment, lots of social activities but the technology of the work was a bit behind the times and training or other advancement opportunities were hard to come by"
good,"heures de travail flexible"
good,"You are required to do a lot of work for a lot of different departments but aren't paid for the work you do. If it weren't for the pay, it would be a great place to work, despite all of the work that comes from every different direction."
good,busy always. constantly growing. constantly evolving. constantly learning and adjusting and adapting to the departments needs. there never been a dull moment during my past 7 years with McKesson.
good,"This company has a strong culture, but lacks in the work-life balance department. Healthcare as an industry is facing challenges right now, and McKesson is certainly not immune."
good,The day starts early with hopes that it won't go into overtime.  Workloads are provided via e-mail so there is no need to rush to find something or transport anything to one's desk.  There are key teamleads that one can ask for advice. Requirements for each hospital are different but each has its own format.  Education is usually provided in on a need to know basis.
good,"Everyday was different and the work environment was always busy but the perk being there is never room for boredom to set in."
good,"Work is not that hard, management are quite new but they are good. Number of paid time off is awesome. It's the employees that I work with that's the problem.."
good,"Fast paced"
good,"My job involves a lot of attention to detail. We do the billing for many different clients, and they depend on us to be very prompt on processing claims to insurance companies, and to make sure we are working all of our denials in a timely manner to ensure we get payment from the insurance companies. I work with a lot of great people who are always willing to go out of their way to help me when needed."
good,Job was ok. People were good. Management tried to micromanage. You are just a number. As a material handler it is the same thing all day every day. You will walk at least 20 miles per shift. Two 20 minute breaks. Mandatory overtime
good,I enjoyed working with my hands. Would have like if they would teach more things and sent my out for training. The workers were very nice to be around.
good,"Typical day in the life of McKesson is upon arrival checking company e-mails and corresponding via e-mails and phone calls, closing out any open claims that you weren't able to complete the day before and then begin tackling the claims that you have for the day ahead through research, corresponding with non-clinical and clinical facilities for resolutions."
good,"Productive, educational and stable place to work. Central location downtown San Francisco. Good work life balance. During my time at McKesson I have gained a lot of very technical experience within international accounting and international tax."
good,"McKesson is a very fast-paced organization that is constantly changing in order to improve. In dealing with a complex process, you have the opportunity to learn about more than just the role you are in. a"
good,"McKesson is a good place to work.  Just like most jobs have their pros and cons.  However, the people are genuine and nice.  I have learned a lot working for this company, which has made me into an exceptional employee."
good,They pay you well for the job you do. Management is usually lacking on communication. Hours fluctuate a lot. lots of extra perks
good,"I have an experience of 7.5 years in the SAP CRM as functional consultant. I have worked in 4 complex implementation projects in SAP CRM marketing, sales and service including Interaction center module projects. I have also worked as lead in SAP CRM support project which has integration with SAP Mobility (SAP REX) "
good,"McKesson is a company in which you can have a long career.  There is not much opportunity for promotion or development though.  Once you settle in to your role, you can count on being there for a long time.  Some will say that's good, some will say that's bad but it depends on what you're looking for."
good,"well ran company but no room for advancement or salary improvement.  management does not have much medical experience, would like to see more improvement in company"
good,I was hired at Mckesson through a temp agency. McKesson was a very structured and strict work place especially if you were hired on through a temp contract. The trainer was very welcoming and encouraging but supervisors and upper management weren't very present.
good,Good solid company. Pay on low side. Good collaborative environment. Terrific customers. Great team in New Albany office.
good,"Working for McKesson was one of the best opportunities I have ever had. The atmosphere was amazing. Have you ever worked for a nationally known company where you could hold a conversation with your vice president and CEO? "
good,McKesson is a good company to work for. I have been able to learn a lot from the overall experience. My coworkers are the best at helping day to day with information to get the job done.
good,This place is tries to cater to the workers they play music in the warehouse and there are breaks every two hours they try to get involed with the employs lives
good,"As a whole the company is a great company to work for. Each day as it's own challenges, but with team work many things can be accomplished."
good,"Work for McKesson Company was a nice experience,A Typical day a work always be busy because was a very fast and active place.we working long hours a day,the overtime some day was 5 o 6 hours more,total 14 hous a day..The supervisors a Manager know we working hard,I know every day working hard is a bless.I like my co worker,nice people,make alot a friends there."
good,"Job not bad to work for if you don't have any computer experience because you can pickup everything that they offer in Data Center Operations in 6-8 months.  And the reviews they give you are so basic and not really related to your job because there is only so much that you can learn there,  And as long as you meet average which is what always is met unless you are sleeping on the job you will get small bonus every year.  Watch out for some people who have been there for some time because they don't like change and think they own the place,"
good,"it is hard to get days off, and it is a good job but you do not leave your home and you loose patient interaction also you loose valuable job skills not being in a hands on setting."
good,"I feel I can no longer progress, I am still young and need new challenges. Two people have left because we are due to have hours cut."
good,"Management seems like they are better than everyone else, expect to much and don't appreciate there employees efforts"
good,Fast pass environment with a higher stress level. I was able to move into several departments advancing with each move. While working at Cue & Case I learned several aspects of business from daily operations to purchasing.
good,Productive environment for individual and career development. Opportunity for advancement after one year of service. Career developement opportunities and educational assistance for continuing education.
good,"Very relax environment and very family oriented workplace."
good,I enjoyed my time there.  During my 10 years there I learned valuable lessons which I will always be able to pull from in my career moving forward.
good,"Work Day - non-stop work"
good,"Overall a good company to work for, beware of the March layoffs."
good,"Goal was high fill rates for hospitals and low backorders"
good,"I enjoyed working at mckesson.  I  pulled orders and"
good,was a fast paced pharmaceutical warehouse that schedule changed depending on demand of medications. Management did not watch over people very well and people would take advantage of that. Which in return made everyone else have to work longer than needed.
good,"Fast pace from start to end unless the computer goes down...lol..."
good,"When not at a client, a typical day consists of installing service offerings, responding to emails, answering phone inquiries, developing new offerings.  I was able to learn to manage my time as well as learn TIBCO Spotfire software.  My immediate managers are great to work for.  They do not micro manage and allow me to do my job.  They support me in my career goals and encourage me to make myself more valuable.  My co-workers are super.  They are driven, self starters who want to do what is best for their clients.  The hardest part of the job is to having to tell a client that the software cannot do something they desire.  The most enjoyable part of my  job is when you leave a client knowing that you have left them the tools to serve their patients better."
good,"Good environment for work/life balance for the right jobs.  Management is overworked, and leadership can be ineffective at times."
good,"•	Hand on experience in SAP Security, for User and Profile Maintenance."
good,Good benefits and stable work environment. Tends to be on the strict side regarding employee discipline.
good,Learned about their rebate programs for different customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was team communication and result orieneted culture.
good,McKesson provides many opportunities to learn and continue to learn.
good,"As i only worked at Lloyds pharmacy for work experience during school, I enjoyed working there."
good,"McKesson is a very large, very old company, so it takes a lot of time to get anything accomplished. My team was outstanding which is probably why I stayed there for so long. Many policies and procedures are antiquated, but they are a leader in the healthcare space and continue to grow through acquisitions."
good,"Not bad, not great either though. Management is kind of all over the place. Seems like they spend more time a week monitoring the employees then they do caring about the customers."
good,"I worked four ten hour days, beginning at 5:00 a.m., working with the continuous laser printers, printing off jobs that were needed each day to be sent out to inserting to be mailed out daily, loading new forms as needed. I helped in the mail room sorting and packaging the claims and statements using federal express, ups, and usps shipping systems. We were given a 30 min. lunch and two 15 min. breaks each day. Since you work with the same people day in and day out I developed a very good relationship with them and enjoyed that about the job. The hardest part of my position was that you basically had the same tasks each day which in turn made for some long days."
good,"A great place to work with a good team environment for accomplishing the most for the patients' interests."
good,"I enjoy working at McKesson, especially in the field of clinical software. The company is currently experiencing growing pains, and for those who don't work on the newest initiatives, we share a general concern about our career future."
good,"The health insurance is quite good. And they even have a program which allows you to reduce the costs of your insurance. "
good,A typical wrk day is that i stay pretty much to my self an ready to get the job done.That all company an management are not the same.Co - works o.k. could have help more as a team.I wouldnt say that the job was hard sometimes people make it hard..FREE LUNCHES......
good,"Highly demanding environmental that also incorporated customer relations, to deliver the best health and lifestyle care."
good,They have great benefits. Work culture is professional for the most part. People are friendly.
good,"A typical day at work... Just like any other office, you go in, start the computer and get going. There was a program we used that would organize different groups of accounts under categories according to the status of the account. We would work those. Example: Duplicate denial; call insurance company and find out why claim was denied as 'duplicate'. There were a lot of supervisors/managers; whom I respected and they, in return, respected me as a hard worker. I had great co-workers as well. The hardest part of the job was, I would have to say, just sitting in front of a computer all day long. I most enjoyed learning new programs and the people I worked with. We also had 'Community Days' where we would get packages together for children with disease's or for soldier's overseas as well."
good,I worked for US Oncology for 9 years in the Treasury Dept. After merging with McKesson I then moved to the Customer Care Team. I have enjoyed my 10 years in the Healthcare industry.
good,A great place to learn from the bottom up. Co workers are pleasant and helpful. You get great satisfaction in knowing you're meeting your numbers set out for you by the client.
good,"Working at Mckesson in a friendly fast environment, working at a fast paste handling the line working on the labeler that the machine where you label the product also I worked in quility Control checking the quility of the product to see if It's at It's best to ship."
good,It was something different and i learned alot about medicaid and disease management.
good,"... or maybe ""some"" of the managers do.  Speaking of managers, always transitioning a new one.  "
good,"My time at Mckesson was short as I had medical conditions that kept me out for almost a year.  Due to mismanagement of my paperwork I was almost terminated as management said my paperwork wasn’t received and I had submitted everything when I was out.  Due to these extenuating circumstances, I was allowed to get this paperwork filled out again and return to work"
good,"They have a talented staff and good opportunity to advance.  They have very talented people in the organization and they assist in your success. "
good,No comment at this time. My time at McKesson was positive overall. The one concern I had was leadership was too heavy. There are too many layers in the organization.
good,Good company to work for. Good benefits and good pay. Great people to work with in a culture that was fun. Not much advancement possibility in the Jacksonville location.
good,If you like to work a lot of hours and get a lot of over time this job is for you. 3rd shift is always hiring it’s super hard to get on first shift. Everyone on first been there for years
good,"Good place to work.  Contract position, but lots of good work there.  I enjoyed my time there.  Would have loved to stayed there, but it is hard to get on permanent."
good,"There were too many managers that were calling the shots and when you needed help to clarify some details it was the way that, that particular manager said It should be done even if it was wrong and you were the one responsible. There was no overtime because you were asked to cut your hours the next week to not go over. So not worth overtime even if it was mandatory."
good,"Working here isnt bad at all. Yes it has its up and downs, but its tolerable. We currently work from 8:30 PM to usually 530 am. Reason is because we dont have enough people to help us get out earlier. So some start working and quit a month or so in and dont wanna stick it out. Till we get some steady help to get out at 430 or sooner my checks are going to be nice because overtime. You can make 50K a year easy here."
good,"Mckesson main jobs for night crew are picking orders.  A typical day you will walk about 15 miles.  Breaks are provided and lunch is not paid.  "
good,"Loved working here, it was a very consistent reliable job and great manager. I loved being able to drive around the city and be outside in the sun enjoying the nice days in San Diego CA"
good,Good job hard work and most of the time you have to really watch what u do ppl that have been there a long time are relaxed new ppl have to work hard.
good,"Great company ""if"" you're lucky enough to have a good management team that knows how to manage,  that make responsible decisions that's great for the team as a whole, that's supportive, encourages growth & development opportunities, care about their employees individually but if they don't have these qualities, it can be quite challenging . However, they a have great Vitality program, good benefits & numerous company event activities."
good,Great environment great place to learn customer service and values of the company ICARE and the values of customer first and patient's cares and needs above everything. Overtime opportunities are great especially around the holidays.
good,"While it is a great place to work, it is difficult to find a career path because of how Silo'ed the organization is and leaders do not typically speak to each other about how to retain talent by promoting across the organization."
good,"There are a number of caring people that are customer focused and want the best for them.  In this way, there is a single point of focus, improving the customer experience and that is what creates a synergy and focus to provide a way forward and why we should work together across Silos."
good,"The days were easy enough. same thing everyday as far as the calls, track lost orders, create return labels, enter returns,& credits."
good,A typical work day includes meeting SLA's for tour customers.  I've learned how important it is to act as one team.  Management has expectations that are reasonable.  The culture is one of a comfortable atmosphere.
good,"Mckesson is a good company to work for, the compensation should be more competitive.  There isn't much opportunity for advancement. However I enjoy the work life balance."
good,If you can get hired on permanently to McKesson it is an ideal work environment.  Paid time off and affordable benefits help make the position worthwhile.
good,"Enjoyed job and team only issue was with the pay. Remote , great team , requested pay increase to be competitive with other coders in my area.  7 yr employee only left to make more $$"
good,"McKesson is a great place to start your career in Healthcare - however, I would say that after 8-12 months, there aren't many new things to learn and the days can get pretty mundane."
good,"Great job work and life balance, hours were 9am-5pm, Management were knowledgeable in helping you exceed at your job. Co-workers were very nice, family vibe."
good,A typical day at work scheduling patients with their doctors or specialists from NYU Langone. Working Monday through Friday 9 to 5pm work schedule....
good,Would recommend working here. They care about their patients as well as their employees and have room for advancement opportunities within the company.
good,Mckesson was a good place to work  but it became a very  stressful place ..... because of the competitive business that it is .it was starting to get military
good,There are more opportunities to be exploited globally for health care products and life science related companies. I would like to see a more balanced approach to cost management
good,Good perks. Some issues but fixable. Overall I was satisified. I wish they utilized Nurse Practitioners as NPs are valuable assets in the growing telehealth market.
good,"Worked at McKesson and overall, it is a great company.  Some of the management team there is questionable, but nonetheless, a great company.  They definitely support a work-life balance and depending on the position, there is the possibility to work from home."
good,Fast paced corporate environment driven by numbers instead of insight. Demand is high as the reality of field work slows the pace of return. Multinational distribution.
good,This job was supposed to be a career but the company decided it was best to relocate. I was unable to up root my family and move to bethlem pa. I truly love this company.
good,Corporate Culture. Huge company with many employees.    The company always has  lay offs.  They buy and downsize business units that don't fit the short term goal of revenues.
good,"McKesson is fast-paced and productive work environment.  Most positions are results driven with incentives on high performance, productivity and accuracy."
good,"ok work environment. Good Benefits but minimum coverage. Communication with personnel is good but could use improvement."
good,"Very strong and innovative company. They compensate well, and have a good work life balance. Their trade shows and ideashare's are great for the company and sales teams."
good,A good place to work for. I have learned a lot and value the Managers. Anytime you need to take PTO it is usually approved. Everyone is a team player and you are always learning.
good,Working as a payment poster was very difficult and expected the employee to catch on very quickly.  They lost accounts because of lack of good quality training.  Then they put me in a credentialing secretary role doing filing and answering phones.  The co workers in that department were great but the management had trouble meeting the bottom line and I was 1 of 10 people eliminated.
good,This is a good company to work for to get your experience and knowledge. Overall the work life is great. Not many opportunities to advance but definitely a company that you can stay at to gain knowledge and eventually work your way up.
good,"Big break room monthly, meeting and updates, comfortable to work with AC feed everybody food monthly and yearly family picnic and Christmas party good company."
good,Working here I learn that working as a team is very important. Because with no team business won’t run. Knowing your team makes the day go by smoothly.
good,"Seasonal employment "
good,"... Advancement was limited and did not pay according to one's ability."
good,In my roles we had a lot of autonomy to run our customers how we see fit. Hours are fairly long. Management is ok under the right team. Newer facilities are very nice and great benefit of working for McKesson.
good,Each day you had an assigned queue that you were to work and were responsible for. If you were caught up you were expected to help anyone who might be behind or need additional help with their accounts.
good,"It is a great place to work and at times I miss it, but it's more than a full-time job. You are always on the clock. Hourly employees not so much but as a manager you are always on call,"
good,McKesson is a great place to work but still has a who you know atmosphere when it comes to getting certain jobs within different distribution centers.
good,I worked at McKesson as a Contractor for a year. It's a great company just not enought money. I would work there again if I was compensated at the right salary and not laid off at the end of the year.
good,It was a really nice company to work for I was only there for 3 months.  It was too short of time to make a full assessment of the company.  The company had a special project and when it was done so was part of my department
good,"Management has its pros and cons. They will use you but will not advocate for you in your career growth. There is a ""good ole boys"" network if you will."
good,"Good place to work"
good,most Enjoyable Part of job was the customers.  typical work day was make 50 calls while having 70 incoming calls while processing credit card payments and releasing/reviewing held orders
good,Provided good community and volunteer oportunities.  I enjoyed working with the diverse people and collaborating across organizations.  My favorite was working in Human Resources.
good,Tackle  task or work issues head on to resolve in a timely  manner.  I do not tolerate  employee issues with each other.  They are immediately  resolved....always said we need to have respect.  I enjoy working  projects to increase  reimbursements.
good,Too many measures and too many internal measurements and not enough about the customer experience.  I worked for various managers  (6) over a 7 year period and having to deal with constant change of management style.
good,"Good company to work for, but there is a large disconnect between management and workers. Extremely risk averse, and filled with fear of making the wrong choice at the expense of losing any competitive advantage."
good,Lack of career advancement. A competitive environment and must be willing to put in the work and time to receive the benefits of meeting of exceeding your budget.
good,".. A place of constant change and opportunity.  Learned a great deal during my tenure.  Like most large organizations, McKesson had its red tape, constraints and selfish managers.  Overall, the VAST MAJORITY of leaders and team members embodied the mission of delivering better health solutions and improving patient outcomes."
good,"its a good  company to work with, benefits are excellent and what the hardest part is constantly changing the management. Its friendly environment, the most enjoyable is when you find a right supervisor for you and  your day go smooth and fast."
good,"It's a good place to work. They pay you well & the work can be stressful some days & they do like to reward you for your hard work, so never think they are not watching your working skills because they are."
good,Overall it is a good place to work. You have to be very detailed and organized. I work well with others to accomplish the job at hand. Very dependable and willing to work overtime as needed.
good,"Most people have been there for a number of years. May be a little disorganized at beginning of employment. Great benefits. Storing knowledge of excel will help you a lot. Constantly changing responsibility’s, and reorganization."
good,Good Company and work culture. Management focuses on cutting costs. Overall industry is changing which is affecting McKesson and the culture. Management has started to leave.
good,"The local management was very fair and knowledge. Hours were fair, management did not expect employees to give up their lives. Many good benefits and great healthcare coverage."
good,Rapid paced environment with various autonomous business units primarily in north America.  Good people but sometimes difficult to collaborate across businesses and personalities.
good,"Supportive supervisors, good learning environment.  Management does not encourage over time unless absolutely necessary.  Great staff.  Dealing with patients can be stressful at times but overall support on the part of management and staff members is very good. Have periodic office sponsored summer picnics and holiday events."
good,It's been over 3 years since I worked there. I'm sure much has changed and anything that I remember is probably no longer applicable. I left to retire.
good,Enjoyed my two months working there.  Was under supervision of halfway house which the company agreed to participate with. During my second month they apparently refused to comtinue cooperating and the halfway house had to terminate which the company knew was going to be the result. I just think the ICARE principal was not followed as the leadership never communicated with me about their decision. So lower leadership in warehouse was wonderful but senior leadership voiced ICARE but doesn’t live it in my opinion.
good,McKesson is a good place to work. The culture pushes you to be the best employee you can but the environment can be stressful and expectations are high.
good,"Received inbound calls from clients needing financial help for Embrel. Clients had been referred by their physician and I was the first line of communication getting their basic demographic and insurance information to see what type of assistance they would qualify for. "
good,People care about the job they do. It has a good workplace culture . Benefits are good. Management does a great job of taking care of the  associates.
good,McKesson was a great company to work for.  Because of the commitments necessary in the healthcare industry the commitment to meet the customers needs always came first.
good,"picked orders all day management has went down hill some since starting but over all its not a bad place to work . hardest part is so many types of write ups you have to keep your speed up our errors down and always be at work. some people there make it hard to work but most people are great. just a few bad eggs in the bunch. I loved working with the people and having a job that meant something to someone, you were helping someone in need."
good,"I only work for the McKesson division of SPAR.  I enjoy the flexibility of the hours and depend on the continued monthly work.  Keeping a good repor with the various drug store owners and pharmacists is essential and makes my job much easier.  Knowing that my supervisor, and his supervisor, may call any one of my stores during any given month helps me stay on track and always strive to do my very best."
good,I enjoyed working with others and documenting requirements. I learned communication is a key factor in being successful.  The hardest part of my job was being able to meet with the key stakeholders to define the requirements.
good,"Stable company.  Pays not that great."
good,"The atmosphere was fast paced and very busy.  There was not a lot of down time.  However, the staff was friendly and willing to pitch in and help when ever and whereever needed. It was a team based environment."
good,CHC purchased McKesson and we are still in the transition stage.  Communications have been great and plentiful. Culture is one of encouragement and openness .
good,It is a good company to work for but has a lot of unrealistic work requirements and not enough time off for unscheduled events.  The benefits are good and the atmosphere is fun.
good,I appreciated my time there. I was able to learn alot about the health care industry and how versatile it is. I was also able to get a great grasp on how fast our current health care policies affect everyone as a whole.
good,I enjoy reviewing accounts and taking step necessary to correct the issue with the balance that remained on the account after the insurance reimbursement.  I feel productivity is a good way to monitor daily activity but feel that weekly productivity is hard to accomplish due to one bad day can make it difficult to recover.  Monthly productivity is a more balance way to monitor a quality vs quantity claim analysis.
good,Good company to work for if you can adapt to change easily.  They have very competitive pay and benefits. I learned a great deal about the processes and software in the Accounts Payable department during the 10+ years I was employed.
good,"Great place to work when you become full-time staff with *High seniority and the job pays well. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Mckesson, met lots of great people, learned lots of new skills, the environment was great but only the management was not good, they didn't treat their the agents well."
good,McKesson paid well for the job that I done. I think they can do more to boost morale. The Head manager that we had was very cheap and would not supply the proper materials to do your job. Other management below him was pretty good they had their moments. McKesson tends to buy s lot of smaller companies and then do layoffs. Be very mindful.
good,A very fast paced work environment with very little room for career progress. The level of expectancy is so high without giving consideration for human errors.
good,"if you're needing a good job then this is a good one, the DC pays well but work life may become an issue because business is booming and that'll require some longer than wanted days especially on nightshift"
good,"Mckesson has taught me to pay close detail. On the job the hardest part is tryin to finish a toat when there is alot of ppll in the same zone cause its crouded with no spce to walk. Aside froom that I like my job, it's a very compfortable and safe work place and i really like wen they buy food for us."
good,"For the most part, I have no complaints about the company."
good,"McK is going through some though changes, layoffs. Unfortunately stocks are also going downwards. It's a pretty good place to work at. Very diverse company."
good,Excellent company for those who look for professional challenges on a Global and multi currency company. A very fast pace environment with the opportunity to interact with team mates all over the world. The systems and internal process work well.
good,EMR(Electronic Medical Record) is facing big change now and many people got severance package. company is trying to relocate people internally but no success.
good,"A Material Handler's job is basically consists to pull customer orders from the warehouse racks to drop them to truck's door. from the truck door, he initiates and process the loading activity of the pallet of material to the truck's trailer."
good,You need to pay attention to details and be smart in your decision making. I learnt a lot about team work. The staff and management were friendly and opened to suggestions regarding issues that emerge during the work process
good,"McKesson is a good place to work. Nice people, competent managers and an overall good environment. They are also big on community involvement and try to engage employees. Probably one of the best places I've ever worked. Beware of applying for any position with any of the IT units. Several rounds of layoffs point to McKesson gradually trying to divest themselves of all of their technology related business units and go back to their core business of pharmaceutical and medical device distribution. They have already spun most of MTS off, merging it with Change Healthcare to form a new company which will be completely independent of McKesson once they get it up and running. I think they said they have a stake in the new company for the next 5 years, after which they will sell their stake. I was part of the EIS division which was left out of that deal. They claim they are trying to find ""strategic alternatives"" but no one wants to buy the cast offs because they hold no value with the exception of the Paragon EMR which holds a small portion of the overall EMR market. With the big boys Epic and Cerner putting a stranglehold on that market, there's no remaining market share there to gain so growth will be stagnant and eventually that product will wither and die. It's unfortunate because I really did enjoy getting up and going to work each morning (with the exception of Atlanta traffic)."
good,Prepared daily Canadian deposit and Collect payment for past due invoices. Entered deposit into the AR System and Printed invoices and mail to customer. Prepared monthly account statements
good,They give you the tools and the guide to advance in your position. Also train you in another department if you want to make the change
good,As an employee you learn to take the good with the bad.  I can honestly say that I have had more good days here at McKesson than I have had bad days.  The  most important is to try and learn as much as possible.
good,Everything was professional. Loved the management the co workers never had a problem working together on a daily basis.just enjoyed each other's expertise.
good,my day would begin by doing a short workout followed by a short meeting to go over prior day production and receive our daily assignment. It was a great place to work we just didn't have a work life balance. We worked as a team and everyone would lend a helping hand.
good,Working for them for number of years give me a great opportunity to prove myself to myself I did so many new things that help prove my worth to my supervisors that allowed me to  rise up through the ranks from sales rep to regional manager up to retirement
good,"Verifications des prix versus celui des bannières. entrées de données, rapport croisés dynamiques"
good,"A typical day at McKesson, sitting down at a computer all day. I have learned a great deal from this job experience, especially on the computer. My management team was not very attentive to the employees. Several employees thought they were in charge which made it difficult to do my job. The hardest part of my job was sitting all day, I had a really hard time moving around and got very depressed, but the most enjoyable part of my job was learning new things and getting to know my best friend."
good,Good company to work for. Only issue is they hire and promote bad managers with poor management and employee development skills.  HR sides with managers in any issue and place a lot of power on them which is not fair when dealing with employee and manager issues (especially if you have a bad manager). Great benefits but bad base salary ranges.
good,"Good Company"
good,"McKesson has long term employees which tells me that something is right working there.  I worked there and found the same thing.  Great place, people friendly and helpful to the newcomers.  recommended place to work."
good,"Professional Healthcare Company with quality products and industry vision.  Fast paced, changing environment that attracts high caliber, highly motivated talent."
good,"Large corporation with a lot of growth potential for employees, health and education benefits and decent pay.   Overall good environment."
good,"I had a wonderful working experience with McKesson and would recommend this company. Great company, great management, conducive work environment, and friendly co-workers."
good,"A good company to work with overall  The hours were quite long and I mean week in and week out. I would guess that 60-70 hour work week was quite ordinary then but, the day went by quickly"
good,The Management was fair. Good Team Players. Not much room for advancement. Good information through regular meetings.
good,"Scheduled route to finish schedule in the most efficient manor "
good,"Working at McKesson has given me quite the experience for industrial work. The atmosphere is a energetic one, with team leads and supervisors that are good support if your in need of any help or questions. Working at McKesson has surprised me on the amount of teamwork."
good,"A fast-paced, professional environment working with talented staff. High-caliber team members consistently striving for excellence. "
good,"I enjoy working at McKesson for the benefits, coworkers and variety of job tasks.  The hardest part is large turnover and lack of employees to complete tasks which raise our call volume."
good,"McKesson is a complex organization that operates in a highly regulated environment.  Successful employees must be proactive in managing their careers, willing to stay current on their applicable area of expertise, manage multiple priorities and collaborate effectively with many different work groups with a high level of professionalism. McKesson also highly promotes the health and well being of its employees through a very active company wellness program. The biggest challenge that McKesson continues to struggle with is work life balance."
good,"Laid back environment on daily basis but still were pushed to get certain jobs done in a time frame."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy, never the same and full of very different types of customers with varying needs."
good,"You go in put your headphones on and work hard all day.  Talking to co-workers is at a minimum."
good,"Our day is fast paced answering phones, entering orders, resolving issues, product knowledge a must, calling vendors for order information, calling in drop ship direct to end user purchase orders. We have a good team with diverse backgrounds that compliment each other. the most enjoyable part is the satisfaction of knowing you have ordered the correct supplies our physician offices need on a daily basis"
good,Great place to work with a diverse work force. Enjoyed the interaction with associates. the hardest part of the job was working night shift. Outstanding company benefits. Not advancement opportunities available.
good,This is a massive organization offering a variety of opportunities in healthcare information technologies for IT specialists and non-IT professionals as well.  Business units tends to be cohesive & goal directed but reaching beyond the core group can be a challenge due to a silo'd business model.  Frequent reorganization can be disruptive.  Centralized access to company information and resources is easy and supports communication across the organization.
good,"Currently I, answer the nurse advise line from my home.  This involves computer knowledge and skills to manage and multitask several screens at a time while talking to clients on the phone.  Goal is to advise clients based on their symptoms to the right level of care, right time frame and right provider depending on the acuity of there symptoms.  This must be done very quickly and efficiently, without causing a delay in patients care.  Maintaining CEU's to keep RN licenses in all 50 states including VI and DC.  Keeping up with all policy and procedure changes and internal training.  Maintain and secure equipment phone and computer in home."
good,"Good place to work."
good,The day would usually start with learning what the average requirement of the client to meet the daily goals of member registration for Pharmacuetical Program for patients. Responsible for verifying member medical insurance and whether the medication was covered or not and it the medication administration fell member medical or pharmacy benefit or both.
good,"Job is fast pace, answer calls from patients, like a call center, work from a queue, open and batch mail, every day is a learning experience, there are groups within the company and each group is like your individual family, they treat you as though they are a member of your family.  The hardest part of the job is getting all the work done it seems to be never ending, which is good. Some days are better than other and some are more difficult.  I am thankful for the job and enjoy the challenge each day, each phone call and all the tasks that I do."
good,"I've learned a lot woring for Lloyds, as you are introduced to something new to learn almost every day. Great team work and communication is vital. "
good,Typical days involve working with customers to find appropriate solutions to issues that fit the customers needs.
good,"While change is normally good.   The management team wasn't keeping up with the industry and trends and therefore in the last few years the Software side of the business was getting hit hard with loses.  Overall, the company was great to work for, benefits and pay were good."
good,Challenging and rewarding environment. A good group of employees to work with.
good,Wonderful Coworkers and team environment.  Learned a lot about customer rebates and contract interpretation.
good,"The company is very stable and benefits are average."
good,A typical day at McKesson is always fun and rewarding. They make sure that ALL employees are well taken care of and that if there are any issues they are resolved in a fast and effective manner. Even though McKesson is a Large corporation you still feel like an individual that matters. Most of the time you feel like there is always someone willing to listen.
good,Management was ok they were able to help whenever they could lend a hand but the workload there for my position needed a 2nd person in order to complete within an 8 hour period
good,Working at Mckesson has taught me valuable life skills and work skills that have been very beneficial through the years.
good,"A typical day at work"
good,"McKesson is a solid company.   The culture is a little weird, though.    It's one of the oldest companies in the US and has a culture that's maintained some unusual quirks.  Mainly, it's a bit stodgey."
good,"to provide excellent customer service."
good,"Order pulling, staging, shipping & receiving for a Pharmaceutical  company.  Handling Prescribe drugs for Pharmacies throughout the United States."
good,A typical day consists of coding of medical documents. I have learned so much about the medical field since working here. My most enjoyable part of the job is just the new stuff I get to learn everyday.
good,"Management was very focused on getting the job done and achieving the goals we had set as a company. Everyday was different, reached out to clients to refill there medical supplies and offer and sale new and improved merchandise. Incentives and rewards was offered to workers who performed at a high level. Hardest part of the job would have to be moving up in the company."
good,"I came to McKesson via a temp agency. My director supervisor made me feel as if I were the greatest assistant he ever had. The people were awesome and I was saddened when they moved the company to another state. Had not been for that, I am sure I would have still been there."
good,"Overall Lloyd’s pharmacy is a very cheerful and pleasant work place as all the staff are very friendly and caring."
good,"Updating spreadsheets, calling customers. Co workers were great. Collections is tedious but I had a relationship with customers."
good,"enjoyed the work enviornment, but the customer service has gone by the wayside"
good,"Became Lead Material Handler within 6 months, my coworkers are pleasant to work with. We work hard as a team to get the work out on time."
good,Good Work Environment I Have the opportunity to grow professional and have traveled with the company enjoyed working there but for personal reasons I have to levee the company
good,"Great job to work the night shift and loose weight. You run your back side off all night long pulling orders. It is a Union job. The Union is part of the grocery store clerks, so the pay isn't good for what you do and the hours."
good,"Busy from opening till closing, with lots of good humour going round."
good,Great staff across the board. If I have the opportunity to come back I would.
good,"all jobs completed using Accumax, rf units"
good,"A typical day at work would include coming in and getting our computer system set up. We are required to make sure all charges were accurately entered as an error would changes the charge and the amount, so very close attention to detail was required. We also had a quota of over 100 claims per hour. It was imperative to keep this quota on a daily basis. I learned a lot about charges and the codes. Management was only one person and she also had an open door policy it was very seldom that we needed to speak with her about any issues. Co workers were nice. It wasn't as close knit as I would have liked but everyone got along , The most enjoyable part was the flexible hours"
good,"Receive, verify, stock and replenish primary and secondary locations with pharmaceuticals, complete order fulfillment and truck loading to meet scheduled departure times. I learned DEA policies and Florida Pedigree laws. Hardest part of the job was completing all tasks flawlessly. Most enjoyable part was knowing we helped save, comfort, or sustain a patient because we did our job to the best of our ability."
good,My job at Mckesson was a mostly low stress job. Most of the co-workers got along. All in all it was one of the best jobs I had.
good,"Short and sweet. This was a great place to work with a wonderful culture. The technical staff was spot on.  Employee review process could use work, it felt like they took processes from all over and created a kitchen sink."
good,"I knew if I worked hard, my leadership would support me in any promotion or transition I wanted to make within the company. The culture is meant for hard working individuals, but there is reward with your effort in professional growth."
good,Cons is that it was contracted and my assisgnment ended. I enjoy working here and I enjoy the people I worked with. I wish this position wasn’t contract or I would still be working there.
good,"Overall, you have a lot of opportunities for growth at McKesson. They invest in their employees. Senior Management thrive on making  a comfortable work environment. You have the opportunity to participate in mentoring programs that allows you to grow as employees."
good,"Leader in distribution of med-surge supplies and pharmaceuticals.McKesson is always looking to grow, and focuses consistently on many levels of process improvement."
good,Very stable enviroment with good benefits. Be prepared to adapt to the work day as it comes. Work life balance is good and the team members are easy to get along with.
good,"Formerly owned by Celesio UK, Finding cover for pharmacists was done well."
good,"McKesson Medical Surgical is a great employer. They offer medical insurance, paid holidays off, floating holidays, and recognize domestic partnerships."
good,"McKesson has a great work culture - management is caring about work/life balance.  AMAZING benefits.  The pay, however, is super low for the workload given and the raises aren't much.  Advancement within the company is not as good."
good,"Conduct full medical and pharmacy benefit investigations."
good,"Good company to work for. good benefits and the pay is good. "
good,"i really enjoyed working there, they have a gym and a big cafe! they changed the management and that sucked but overall it was a great place to work !"
good,"Picking orders in a fast walking pace almost non-stop to reach the quota they need and being strategically beating the certain number of lines required in order to be efficient. "
good,Management is very supportive of colleagues in the business decisions.  Individuals are allowed to make decisions with supporting business requirements.
good,"Was a great place to work for years, but leadership changes from the new CEO on down have everyone on pins & needles. Significant re-orgs every 2-3 years. Company is full of wonder, long-tenured people & provides excellent service to their customers, but is struggling to adjust to the ever-evolving marketplace."
good,"I enjoy the atmosphere in the office, the building amenities are great. An amazing cafeteria as well as a fitness room. I enjoy the individuals I work with on my team. Very flexible hours and ability to work from home is offered."
good,"Their office in Richmond can get pretty hectic - depends what team you're in. Overall, great exposure to different analytical tools to get teh job done."
good,"The distribution teams are all excellent, and provide extraordinary service to their clients. Very professional & team-oriented organization. Walk the talk on workforce & management diversity. All new leadership from the CEO on down, looking to make big changes. Company has been in austerity mode for the past 5 years; so many cuts to staff it's hard to get support from HQ in a reasonable amount of time."
good,"Enjoyed working here, fast paced always had jobs to do. Worked in teams, good people, night shift, good pay, most holidays off depending on what day and what holiday."
good,"Excellent work-life balance. "
good,"When you go in the morning no assigned seats its's first come first place and that gives you diversity on sitting arrangements and can sit anywhere."
good,"Overall it's good place work. Great benefits; friendly, could use better management.  Better job advancement .  More organization  of job description."
good,"I ultimately do love McKesson. I was just promoted to a lead position about one month ago, but I just feel like I need more right now. Of course more money, but I really mean more as far as fulfillment in my life as far as a job or career. Im still kind of new to the area and I know it's a lot out here. I will always love McKesson though because it's not a bad company."
good,McKesson is a great company respectable And professional  top of the line company fortune 500 and ranked number fifth  in the country Workplace culture Overall great company very professional Got to have on your A game To be successful
good,"Even with the new company policies which implemented/caused the slashing of H.R., under-staffing, and increased DEA check-ups the warehouse workers are very team oriented which makes the long, tentative hours bearable but also enjoyable."
good,"McKesson culture provides collaboration and partnership to customers, focus on putting patient first and opportunity to work across business units.  Opportunity to use pharmacist and health care leadership background to support customer engagement and provide value."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Enjoying my time there, coworker we’re cool, new vans for delivery, set routes take home the delivery van every day was a nice plus"
good,Work was great but management does not care about the employees. They layoff people that should work there. Management protects there own and not the people that keep Mckesson on top
good,"Relaxed and decent place to work. Friendly atmosphere, had a great experience with patients, very touching at times.Work balance was great a Monday through Friday and some voluntary overtime on the weekends. I enjoyed working here only if it was alot closer,the commute was 35 minutes away, alot of traffic coming home but can manage."
good,Handle a high demand of calls in a friendly environment with well kept supplies such as computers. Learned how to interact with persons on a multiple level with chronic and acute solutions to every situation. Well kept business with phenomenal staff.
good,"training provided as needed, "
good,Each day I would build relationships throughout the organization to identify opportunities to improve the culture for our employees. The company had a forward thinking mindset.
good,worked  remotely for the company and it was a fun and enjoyable job. Small group working together to get the job done. ran a pharmacy robot for Florida hospital
good,"Mckesson is a great place to work, however they are known for layoffs on a regular basis. Management created a great environment  to work and grow.  They put employees first."
good,"The workplace culture is good, everyone understands how hard the work is and for the most part handle the stress effectively. Holidays are almost always expected to be working, but lunch is always provided on those days. It is very easy to get addicted to coffee while you are there"
good,Provided excellent opportunities for learning new skills and advancing career.  Enjoyed working with talented employees that cared about the work.  Wonderful Agile Software Development environment.
good,"pros:"
good,I really enjoyed my time employed here. I loved how involved with the community they were. Management also cared about the employees and the needs of everyone that worked there.
good,"I worked for McKesson for 20 years, started off as a Material Handler 1, and had the opportunity to advance to Material Handler 3. I had good working hours, paid holidays, and weekends off."
good,"Definitely a great company to work for,  Great work/life balance."
good,Great work in the community. Very diversified staff and culture. I was very happy to have such a good management team. I will really miss it. Too bad they closed the DC I was employed in.
good,"Working here has been great, unfortunately my family and I are relocating. I've looked into other positions within the company as well but will pursue what is the best option."
good,Overall the job was fast paced  However I was concerned that management would take it as a joke whenever someone wanted to train or learn something new.
good,I worked for this company several years ago and I learned how to work in a call center for the first time and I did not like it. Some issues were not resolved in a few minutes
good,Great work culture and team. Fantastic vacation allotment and lots of opportunity for movement and growth within the company. Many perks like free lunches and annual team building days for your specific program.
good,"Smiling faces from employees "
good,Enjoyed working there. Do your job no body breathing down your neck. Stable place to work. Stay till work is done. You do have to do certain amount of lines everyday but as long as yiu stay on task not hard to do.
good,"I have worked remotely with Mckesson for 5+ years. I also work a FT job in a large hospital as a Clinical documentation Specialist. I am able to commit to 20 hours a week, and work at my own pace. usually a few hours in the evening during the week, with the bulk of hours on the weekends."
good,Good manager. Friendly people. Nice atmosphere. Snack food always available. Comfortable place to work. I enjoyed being there. Even as a contractor I felt like a full time employee.
good,"Good people to work with.  Management needs to make better decisions.  Just when my organization began working like a well oiled machine, they began laying everyone off."
good,I worked for McKesson for 12 years in several different positions.  I just as many bosses.  It was difficult to continually change bosses and meet their new expectations.  There was no consistency.  There is not much job/personal life balance.  I worked a lot of hours all the time.  The most enjoyable part of my job was that I got to meet a lot of different people because I worked a lot with McKesson customers.
good,"I worked at McKesson for a short time as a contractor, had a great experience. They are customer focused so they try to provide the most assistance to members. They are wonderful to their employees."
good,Enjoyed running returns department and processed returns both saleable and saleable on daily basis as well as handling damages thruout warehouse daily. Keeping returns area clean and safe.
good,"Although it's been more than a decade, McKesson was a solid employer with good opportunity for advancement. Would recommend for most positions. Thanks to them for career advancement."
good,The company has many opportunities.  There is a lot of work across business units in product development.  The environment is very team oriented.  Employees at all levels interact on a daily basis.  The work can be challenging but the results are usually worth the effort.
good,"Great management and intelligent co-workers. In support role, you're always on-call, but that was always made-up later. Culture was a bit stale, but that helped to get work done."
good,"Manager I work with is pretty hard to work with. new to management like an micro management style."
good,"Friendly work environment. Great company to work for, they put on many company events for staff and family members. Shift hours however are not family friendly."
good,"I love what I do, but some of the leadership is pretty difficult to get along with. They don't like to work with employees when they request shift-changes, and advancement within the company can practically be impossible. This company could certainly benefit from listening to their employees more. The benefits are good, but insurance is on the high end. Being closed for federal holidays and having paid holidays are definite pluses!"
good,great company to work for good team work love the work environment good perks and salary good time off and 401k great training and balance work and life
good,We have the same problems any other large corporation has.  Lot of red tape and broken policies but all in all it's a good company and somewhere you can build a career if you are willing to work hard and deal with constant change.
good,"Work/Life balance was satisfactory.  Never a dull moment always something to do and something on the go. A job that you can really sink your teeth into, provided a nice challenge and satisfaction of a job well done at the end of each day.  You really felt like you were making a difference in a patients life through the service you provided.  I returned to school in January 2018, unfortunately there were no Part-Time openings, reluctantly handed in my resignation."
good,"Overall great place to work, good benefits if full time,"
good,"McKesson does a lot of unique things for employees that set them apart from other employers. They go the extra mile to show appreciation to their employees. Sometimes they cater food for us, or bring in cookies or donuts. They have a point program set up so you have an opportunity to be recognized for going the extra mile. Benefits are great and overall the people are great. Only downside is the amount of overtime worked, but it looks good on the paycheck."
good,"The Waltham office is a good environment to work in, the office is quiet and the work is distributed evenly. You have to work as a temp/contract employee for at least 1 year before becoming permanent and some are there more than a year and have not been offered a permanent position."
good,Went through a lot of turmoil in recent years with reviews and divestiture of Healtcare IT businesses.  It really depended on the group and division you worked in.  I found it to largely be a great place to work for 16 of 18 years spent there.
good,"Experience depends on office and managers. Mostly pretty laid back, good pay, and nice perks that are common to large companies. Some managers are overly bureaucratic, and any ideas for change/improvements will most likely be shot down without being seriously considered. This is a good place to work if you like upholding the status quo. It is comfortable, and you have tons of opportunity to grow within, just not much of a say when it comes to bringing change."
good,"I enjoyed working at McKesson, I felt very much that the open door policy with management was more than lip service. I do wish that there were more job opportunities in operations that allowed for greater analysis of job functions and ways to improve performance and quality... more procedural/lean consideration."
good,"I'd love to work there again, there is room for advancement and good hands on trading. Mckesson takes time with their clients and patients. It's a great company to work for."
good,Working at McKesson I learned a lot about the different specialty medications that just added to the current knowledge I already have. Working with the people in office was great yes at times I felt there were certain people that didn't think I deserved to be there but overall my goal as a person is to make sure whatever it is I do I gain some type of knowledge that I didn't have prior to working for that company.
good,The responsibilities of a Reimbursement Customer Service Rep were relatively simple. A rep is assigned a group of nursing homes to make sure their tube feeding products were refilled monthly. Your daily flow was left up to you mostly and things didn't get really busy until you were assigned a project.
good,The company went through several different buyers before it became McKesson. Overall the company is okay. Some of tge managers are great to work with. If you get the right manager you can learn a lot.
good,I was happy with my work at McKesson - overall good work environment with a good work/life balance. The business entity I worked with was a small piece of the bigger McKesson - enjoyed the small company feel within a much larger company.
good,"Great company, Management needs work. Overall, a great company with great growth potential. Leaving due to relocation to different part of the state and up coming marriage."
good,Was released from job after 9 years .Business was slow and I was let go.Supervisor was new but learning.New director was young and ambition but I dont think was quite aware of the cut throat business that would cause him stress.We did not build in his regime but business left. And more business was coming in to replace it.
good,"Worked for less than a year as an outsourced IT manager at Tift Regional. When outsourcing mutually ended, I remained at Tift as overall IT Director. Working at McKesson gave me the opportunity to start in healthcare IT. The local director was supportive and helpful in my professional growth. McKesson was implementing a new billing/revenue system at Tift at the time. This introduced me to large scale system implementations."
good,"McKesson offers a variety of roles, and rewards hard working employees with opportuntiies and advancement, as well as access to a significant amount of training."
good,"I worked on 2 Specialty Pharmacy Medications."
good,"I worked at McKesson for a few years.  It was a transition for me between colleges.  I liked my work environment, and they gave me many opportunities to improve my status."
good,Challenging but a good place to work.  People are great but lots of expectations with service industry that sometimes are out of the control of the company.  Need to set clear expectations with clients.
good,Recommended to anyone who is looking for a 8 hour shift or more.  Management can be a bit better at communication.  they have great benefits for their employees.
good,"Then they merged with  Change Healthcare and moved our office to Tulsa, OK and we all including management lost our jobs. Believe this was due to lower pay rates to save money."
good,"•	Installed hardware and maintenance"
good,Everyone here is very nice and its a great place to work with the pay and benefits but Monday thru Friday it will literally feel like you live there. Up to you to decide if its worth it
good,"The Software Development division of McKesson was sold.  I never worked for the other divisions, but I know they have good benefits and are very profitable."
good,"Unfortunately the division closed, prior to that it was a great place to work.  Benefits were above normal and most of the time work life balance was encouraged."
good,"We all worked in our specific teams to get the job done.  Management worked as hard as their teams, which I found motivating.  "
good,McKesson EIS was good but the merger with Allscripts didn't go very well for a lot of people.   I'll miss the way things were but I'm glad I was in the first wave to be let go by Allscripts
good,"I had a good experience working for Mckesson. They offer me good training and benefits,  my position was challenging I did like and enjoyed my job . My position was working remote but I always felt as part of their team. My supervisor was incredible and professional"
good,"Company merging, going through many changes. Different management changes, and policy changes. Pay and benefit to low for the workload given. High turn overate, I believe it's due to pay and travel. Living in California is expensive, pay doesn't match economy."
good,Enjoyed my team and my boss. All breaks were scheduled. Usually a busy day. Started to be able to work from home on occasion. Lots of opportunities to move depending on your career path.
good,"Loved the people, work and environment were a bit dull. Not the best run software group. The rest of this review is filler because I left there several years ago and believe that much, if not most, of the software development group was moved out of SF."
good,"Very fast paced and tends to runs lean, but they do value employees and have very generous benefits. "
good,"Its a good organization to work at. Being a fortune 5 company, it provides you with a lot of exposure to the various parts of the organization and its workings."
good,"intense, fast pace and a lot of work. It can be overwhelming most of the time but with the family style atmosphere its make it less stressful. management can be better organized but when a company has there set ways its hard to sometimes change."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Mckesson Canada, this was my firs position as a bilingual reimbursement specialist. loved everything about my work over there."
good,"very busy place to work.  Stay busy all day.  Decent pay and benefits , McKesson is not going anywhere and is constantly growing.  If your looking for longevity this can be the place for you."
good,The most enjoyable part of my role was the team I worked with to accomplish our goals.  A typical day was busy and fast paced. Over the years I learned to be adaptable in an ever changing industry.
good,The Post documentation position/ Collections position at Mckesson I found to be rewarding. It's business wraps around patient care and medical billing. I enjoyed my stay at Mckesson and would recommend to anyone seeking to work in a patient care environment.
good,The job has it's cycle throughout the month and year. Management is flexible with the work schedule as long tasks are completed on schedule. The company believes in a strong work/life balance.
good,"I enjoyed my time at McKesson since 2009.  One thing that was characteristic was change - change in philosophies, products, management, and approach."
good,"The Central Fill facility I worked at has many positive attributes such as job security, growth and decent pay.  However, the hours are hard for many individuals.  The 2nd shift which is the main shift is 2pm to 10:30 pm plus overtime. Temporary employees with the potential to be hired have to work both Sundays and Fridays with a hope of being hired to have your scheduled changed and have either a Sunday or Friday off."
good,"I take responsibility for my career but, McKesson puts it all on the employee.  Good managers recognize their high performers and ensure they have a career path to follow.  That doesn't happen at McKesson."
good,I am a contractor so my daily task(s) are on a normal basis. My typical day at work is attaining the ability to multitask and work in a fast paste work environment. I have learned a great deal of the importance of clients/stakeholders. Meeting their needs are number one priority.
good,I started out as a Tax Manager in the Shared Services Center. I had to create a department from scratch that eventually grew to over 30 people. During that time I received all the support needed to accomplish the task.
good,As a contract employee I was treated very fairly.  A very good place to start a career.  Competent management also looking for ways to improve.  Fortune 100 company.
good,"very busy company always had work and approved overtime. "
good,Great company for flexibility. Typical day at work may be exciting depending on the department. Management is very concerned with the employees morale and iften engage in fun activities to increase it. Offers many great benefits for your health.
good,"whilst working at Lloyds, I learnt a lot about dispensing medines in a friendly manner. I learnt how to engage patients and to inform them how to use different types of medicines."
good,"McKesson is one of the best employers I've ever had. While you will be within a small function of the entire company, your role is important and they tend to let you know it. The incentives and perks, such as work/life balance, is the top reason to work for this company. Unfortunately, they do not reward well on the bonus/raise platform, but job security is okay. The culture is outstanding, but management needs a touch up."
good,Reviewed insurance claims and payments. Worked in several billing systems. Entered surgery charges for client offices and hospitals. Refunded money to patients and medical insurance companies.
good,"Because of the size, communication was sometimes disjointed.  It was a ""boys club"" in terms of decision making and management.  Disappointing that customer needs and decisions about which SW to  focus on (instead of trying to maintain 3 of the same thing) was not done long before it was, as I'm sure they'd still be a major player in the field, if they could have delivered value."
good,"i was worked with this company for nearly two years ,enjoyed working there,love and like my job serving customers, friendly colleague  i got on very well with them ,only reason i left there because it too long journey to travel to work with family commitment."
good,I enjoyed my time at McKesson.  A very relaxed environment.  Those training you had patience and didn't make you feel in bad if you made mistakes.  Everything was always fixable they said.  Was brokenhearted when they had to let people go because of the merger.
good,McKesson is a great place to work and grow. I learned a lot of many different positions while working there for over 16 years. They have good benefits and the pay is good.
good,"overall Mckesson is a good company to work for overall.  They create a working environment that is relaxed and enjoyable to work. "
good,"Great company to work for!Need more opportunities in the Charlotte, NC office. There are more opportunities in the midwest or west coast than East coast."
good,Forcing employees to move to hubs or lose their jobs regardless of skills sets and value does not promote a positive or productive environment. ........
good,Fast paced and productive environment. Management encourages and teaches LEAN principles.  Workplace culture is playful. The hardest part of the job is meeting deadlines. The most enjoyable part is co worker interaction.
good,Heatlhcare group has been spin off and merged with Change Healthcare.  Transition from custom development on a base software product to a new platform with little customization but difficult implementation processes. Al lot of good team members. A little top heavy in  management.
good,Company is changing its focus.  I would hold off on any positions until things settle down.  I very much enjoyed working for McKesson and would return if the opportunity presented itself.
good,I enjoy working at McKesson however; this is a temporary job my a staffing agency. Work pace changes day by day depending on how many enrollment forms are received each day. I enjoy the environment and my coworkers. I also like that I can choose what time I take my own breaks and lunch.
good,I learned how to be precise at work.  The hardest part of the job is when there is too much work and it is understaff.  The most enjoyable part of the job is if everyone is floating in the line when someone is needs help.
good,"This was a good company to work for because all the staff were friendly and i was able to learn many new skills. Coming to work didn't feel like work, it was fun."
good,"I ran in circles picking products to be shipped out to anywhere that had pharmaceuticals. It was a small shift, only 6 of us most day, so it was fun and quiet and we were like a family"
good,Great Company great atmosphere the only thing poor management at McKesson. The need better communication between call center leads and upper management.
good,"I would assist pharmacist and pharmacy technicians with pharmacy software Pharmaserv. I also assisted with hardware such as Network Printers, Barcode Scanners, and Image Scanners. I would remote into the Pharmacy Clients and servers to assist with running SQL scripts and assisting with Administrative Duties."
good,A typical day at work is from 9:00 to 5:00. I have worked on a voice based navigation on the iKnowMed2 which is a Electronic Medical Record software. Co-workers are friendly and helpful.
good,"I worked for McKesson for almost five years total. Management put a lot of pressure on me to wear several hats. Perks of the position: flex-time with generous time window, cooperative and collaborative fellow employees in my department, open door policy with management, great experience with several different insurance payers. Limited hospital access or none at all, which sometimes made the position more difficult than it should have been. Not a lot of room for advancement and they do not give great annual raises. Overall, I'd say my experience with McKesson was a good one."
good,The 3rd shift team @ Mckesson Grapevine rocked! We're the backbone of that warehouse. I agreed very much on that. The management team are good people. They do look out for you. Great food and a lot of fun to work with these people. It was an honor to have worked along side them. Fast paced and a hard working crew. Way to go 3rd shift! :)
good,the management is great and we work with great people. the company has been around for over 5 years and it deals with a lot of people and obstacles
good,"A typical day in mckesson we have a time to start  but we wont'n have time to ger out."
good,McKesson was always good to me.  I would have retired there if we were able to stay open.  Great hours/pay/benefits. They were always willing to listen to ideas and suggestions.
good,"Enjoyed doing my job and answering questions from the practices."
good,A great place to work and learned a lot from here but meanwhile the management is very good also got support from my co-workers. At the time of production i got a bit issue but sorted out ASAP and i am enjoying my days here.
good,Good place to work as long as working with minimum training is acceptable - Variety of work assignments never allows for dull days.  People are very helpful and encourage questions and learning as long as they have time to train. Compliance dept is great at talking through the quarterly Audits with the coders for education
good,"A typical work day consist of working on month end activities, projects assigned by my manager, production support, day to day operations and any follow ups that need to be handled. Also, sending out daily reports needed to the operational teams. I learned from management to always maintain an ILEAD mentality. The hardest part of my job is learning new reporting techniques. The most enjoyable part of my job is making a difference in my environment."
good,"As the parent of children with disabilities, it was hard to overcome McKesson's operating hours for some positions. I was working with a small team, and none of the other employees had children. So I felt as though I was a burden to the team. I had to put family first, and I will not work for another company that makes a grateful employee choose between work and familial obligations."
good,"McKESSON is a good employer."
good,"McKesson is going through some integration and restructuring but overall is a good solid company to work for. Company puts a large emphasis on  work life balance although not always easily achieved. They back that up with offering flex hours, generous PTO for new employees, as well as telecommuting for several positions."
good,"I worked there for 14 years until they closed our branch.... I moved up three times within the 14 years and loved the people I worked with. It was a sad day for us all when they told us the news. The distribution center is now operating out of Winchester, VA."
good,"... of course it depends on the team and organization where you end up.  Most of the managers are excellent, and some are still learning."
good,The company culture is dry. Not a lot of personal connection. A typical day at work is cold calling to grow territory and building existing relationships. Management doesn't give much input and stays out of my business for the most part. My co-workers are fantastic and all work together to help one another. I love the freedom it affords me to spend extra time with accounts when they need the extra attention. The hardest part is having to come out of the sales field several times a month for countless phone conferences. I have loved the actual job itself. My customers are so wonderful and what I do to help them is so rewarding.
good,"I liked working at McKesson, I have gained the experience and confidence working as a team or individually with minimal supervision over the years I've spent there.   The most enjoyable part of the job is finding the problem and being able to fix it makes your day perfect."
good,"Je travaille présentement dans un environnement dynamique, qui nécessite beaucoup d'interactions avec des partenaires externes, de même que des clients internes. Les tâches qui incombent à mon poste, me permettent d'avoir une vue d'ensemble sur tout le cycle des payables. "
good,The night leads and supervisors did favoritism and there were lil groups of people they keep and families. If those people don't like you then they let you go. Because I was just as fast as everyone there and they said I was to slow.
good,"The position I was in I had daily tasks and also monthly tasks. I worked on different spread sheet entering employees names, etc. I was in charge of printing out certifies, and delivering them. I was in charge on e-mailing managers, as well as supervisors. Some of the co-workers took the time to help out, others didn't. The management referred to an online training, to help learn how to do your job. There was no direct one-on-one training. The most enjoyable part was being able to sit at my desk, and work on my daily tasks."
good,"A typical day at work was about attending every activity concerning how a pharmacy works, from uploading and stoking deliveries to filling shelves, and collecting prescriptions and despansing medicines. Also giving advices and making sales over the different corner of the pharmacy.I learned about prioritising activities day by day considering the customers' flow and pharmacy's practical needs."
good,It's a fun place to work. Great management. Unfortunately a commute for me has always been a problem since I live about 27 miles away.
good,"Professional co-workers. Excellent communication between supervisor and employees, fun place to work for. My supervisor trust my work, no much supervision needed."
good,"Nice place to work, however, at the franklin location, there is no room for advancement. a lot of work for the compensation being paid, stressful at times."
good,"I love the work environment. The training McKesson offers its staff and clients is second to none. The company treats for lunches and mixers on a regular basis. It is a very challenging job with 75% customer facing. We get to solve technical issues as well as train the software. ""Keeps you on your feet""."
good,Like I said Mckesson is a solid and good company to work for and treats its employees very fair.I wish the pay would be much better and have a great time with my customers
good,"•	Responsible for the month end closing process of accounts payable"
good,Typical day at work was fun and productive.  Management and co-workers were good.  The hardest part of the job was repetitious work and the most enjoyable part was working with a great team.
good,McKesson offers good work/life balance.  There are so many smart and intelligent people willing to help each other for the greater good.  It makes it very enjoyable and satisfying to go work with people like this on a daily basis.
good,"Typical day of work :"
good,"Dynamic environment; informal corporate ethos"
good,"First of all, I am studying Masters of pharmacy which means i am acquainted with most of the roles that a pharmacist or dispenser does. I have had couple of pharmacy placements in some prominent community pharmacies as well as hospital. Working in pharmacies and studying pharmacy allowed me to learn how to dispense the drug effectively, how to counsel patient about the dose, form, route of administration of drugs and their side effects. I have also learnt how a secret or confidential information are maintained as patient's information should not passed to anyone according to Data protection right. I also learnt how and where the control drugs are kept , how they are checked and how the tolerance level is maintained by looking at the interval of the patient. I am good at adapting myself with the SOP of any pharmacy. Moreover, i am good at communicating with the patients and the customers according to my lecturers and my fellows as I was trained for this at the university. I am very soft spoken and can be patient while working even in the busiest hours with lots of people. The hardest part of the job was to ensure that all the doses mentioned on the prescription were correct and the correct labelling were done. The most enjoyable part was to learn new things about pharmacy from the experienced pharmacist. I am good at explaining things to the patient and am ready to repeat it until patients understand it because patient's safety is my first priority. Last but not least, I have compassion for this profession and as a part of continuing professional development, i always keep myself"
good,A typical day at Mckesson Claims processing AR and Customer service. Management was strict & Co workers were Amazing. Revived lots of knowledge and experience.
good,"Good company, good benefits, nice people, however no career path for remote employees.  The travel comes and go, some days in 3 cities one week and the other sitting at home."
good,"Education Consultant for ten years, responsible for delivering education to both employees and customers for the following STAR product lines, at company's education centers or customer's site. "
good,Excellent pay and benefits. McKesson does an excellent job with employee focus. The only issue I would have to say is with growth. There were not many opportunities to advance.
good,"A great company to work for, lots of opportunity to move forward, learned a lot about medicine and I was part of a great team."
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,My days at McKesson consisted of taking calls from patients with questions regarding bills. I learned a great deal about medical billing. Direct supervisors were very approachable and my coworkers and I worked well together. The most difficult part about my job was time management but it made me quick on my feet. I enjoyed solving problems for people.
good,The job was very difficult and stressful during busy times. At first difficult to handle upset clients but eventually got the hang of how to deal with them. It was very fun workplace and very festive. They celebrated or did an activity for almost every holiday.
good,"I learnt several things whilst in this job, how to dispense medication correctly, how to pop in dosage boxes and the advantages and disadvantages of the medication. I also learned about the medication they give to customers who are suffering with drug addiction and how it is taken and what is consists off. I got on well with all staff and higher management, they listened to any problems I had and if I wasn't happy they would try they're best to solve it."
good,"My day began with a quick review of my email to check for any new urgent items. I did this because I had many contacts throughout the different time zones, handling anything that needed immediate attention. Next, I would review my previous days work and take care of any items that needed a second step such as clearing general ledger accounts or sending data to, or reviewing data sent to the Supplier Portal, which was used by a large percentage of our customers. After clearing my desk of the aforementioned, I would reach out to my contacts to determine when I could expect data for me to do my part in the process. At this point I would begin taking care of all pending items, including any emergencies that  I would regularly handle."
good,"As you'd expect with any large corporation, your actual work environment will vary a lot... because it depends more on the individual office, product and managers you work with more than the corporation overall... so the usefulness of this corporate review only goes so far."
good,"I enjoyed the freedom to work independently.  Management was understand and flexible.  The work environment was great, wonderful coworkers.  I chose to leave this position only because I finished my degree and moved into my field of study."
good,A typical day at work was picking orders.  I learned how to use a wrist type RF scanner.  The management was fine but didn't want to disclose quitting time.  I liked my co-workers;  I more or less had to because I was with them more then I was at home.  The hardest part of the job was climbing stairs all day long.  The most enjoyable was laughing and having a good time with my co-workers.
good,"Day begins by receiving calls from clients looking to obtain assistance with getting free medication.  Job required that you obtain clients personal demographics which included income and any insurance information.  Evaluating the clients information to determine if they will qualify for programs available based on clients and government qualifications.  I learned how to work with medicare and other government agencies to help clients qualify for programs.  "

good,"managing a remote based nation wide Robotic Service team"

The company delivers vital medicines, medical supplies and healthcare information technology solutions that touch the lives of patients in every healthcare setting. McKesson is committed to creating a health care system that leads to lower costs, fewer mistakes, higher quality and better health for all."
good,Great company to work for. Opportunities for internal growth if interested. Co-workers are actually helpful.
good,"This was a typical customer service job. Overall, I would say that most aspects of this job are better than some other similar positions. Management and co-workers were fine and it was enjoyable helping customers receive product that was urgently needed for their patients."
good,Average day consists of me picking and packing orders for shipment while maintaining a 100+ LPH (lines per hour) fill rate. I've learned many different tasks while there and am very experienced using the scanners. Hardest part of my job is actually trying to get any time off . But the most enjoyable part is all the friends i have made while being employed here.
good,Extremely dedicated workforce!  Patient care is foremost in their mind.
good,"Very approachable environment, where people are very friendly and always ready to support. My biggest motivation to work here is my team and other people arroung me."
good,"I worked at night and enjoyed the people, management and collective personality of the business itself."
good,"An accounts receivable specialist's typical day at work consist of working in queues and helping out other team mates on special projects. Management could improve on training process for new employees. Heavy work loads at times and balancing out priority tasks can become challenging. I learned how to multi-task and find ways to make my daily functions easier by finding solutions to problems. Overall it is an enjoyable place to work, friendly atmosphere, great benefits and flexible schedule."
good,"A typical day would start by 9am sorting through prescription to go out to surgery for ordering that day processing them on the computer. Completing any walk in prescription which on an average day would be about 120. Collecting previous days prescription from surgery and make them up for collection or delivery. Organising deliveries of prescription to customers who cant get in to collect. Putting away stock orders twice a day usually at least 5-6 totes. Checking existing stock dates and disposing of any out of dates, keeping the place clean and tidy. Making up dossett boxes for customers who find it easier to have all ther medication in one place marked exactly when they have to take them. Serve on the shop floor when short staffed which is most of the time."
good,Very high paced work flow handling high dollar prescription and over the counter drugs. Gained a knowledge on some drugs and the pharamcy field but in an warehouse environment. Hardest part is being woredown and fatigued every shift but you somewhat get use to it.
good,"This job role involved a lot of customer care, dealing with customers in a safe and responsible manner, long hour working days, giving out medication, taking care of a patients needs, speaking to people about their problems and deciding which over the counter medication would be mostly appropriate. Passed many exams including modules 1-10 of Healthcare assistant course.The hardest part of the job was working upto 15 hours a day until 11pm, and the unpleasant customers who needed a lot of calming down at times, also having to run the shop on my own on a night was a bit un-nervy as i was on my own running the shop."
good,"Very mediocre job, very laid back customer service environment. Small group of kind people, almost everyone there has 5 years plus under their belt. Pay wasn't great, no over-time but lunch was provided randomly and the tasks themselves were VERY easy to learn and handle."
good,I started off placing orders for this company and took a job in a smaller department cross referencing data. It was very detailed and felt good knowing we were helping nursing homes and home health care.
good,They have incentives for healthy living: ie discounts on health care benefits.Lots of local charity work and drives.
good,"I have worked 50 hours a week for over 3 years. I habe managed well when we were short staffed and have increased company profit through doing medicine use review, proving fast, accurate service to patients and developinf relations with other customers outside of the pharmacy. I have done an analytical chemistry project at university and have achieved a firtst class in that. Degree I have done requires you to understand all aspect of science, not always related to pharmacy. Multi tasking is the greatest skill I have developed over my 6 years as a pharmacist."
good,"Lloyds Pharmacy are a lovely company to work for, currently they are going through some changes making the working environment difficult, Wonderful group of collegues, and Management are helpful friendly and compassionate."
good,This company is a great company to work for. They rank #14 on the Fortune 500. The office I work at has 3 departments that bill for one of the major teaching facilities in California.
good,I loved the majority of those I worked for and with. This company believed in treating their employees with respect and I only wish there were more like this one out there for fun places to work for.
good,The company has great benefits and lots of perks. Management is old school and not very versed in good business practices.
good,"The company I was originally hired by, was acquired by McKesson a few years after I was hired, so my answers are based off the original company.  Did meet a lot of McKesson employees during the acquisition and they were very nice."
good,"I enjoyed the fast-paced environment. However, it can be quite loud and strenuous at times. It is very much so both an independent and team-based culture. The hardest part, in my opinion, was when others did not perform accordingly. This caused poor performance not only on them, but to the whole team. And management needed improvement. But they have great expectations(just needed to be amplified more), benefits and you're helping save lives!"
good,"Great place to work, and great team atmosphere. It is a big company, but you feel important in what you do. They have flex hours, and the opportunity to work from home."
good,"McKesson is a great place to work! In a market that is ever changing, McKesson evolves with it and provides opportunity for their employees to learn and grow as well."
good,poor communication with changes in company needs vs employee needs- company sold to another that lost a long-time contract with the state forcing elimination of Case Management division with loss of 34 RN positions
good,"McKesson was a nice place to work until corporate buyout occurred. I was greatly saddened to have to find another job elsewhere. If it were not for the corporate downsizing, I would still be employed there."
good,"Currently ranked 7th on the FORTUNE 500, we are a global healthcare services and medical supply company dedicated to delivering better care."
good,"Great place to work at. management was not so good at the time I left."
good,"I do not wish to write a review of this company. The drug was too expensive for anyone with commercial health insurance, even with the Copay Assistance Program."
good,This was by far the best company I have worked for. The pay was excellent and the overall culture was very positive. Management was good and they let you be yourself without a lot of micromanaging. Very good place to work.
good,"fantastic company to work for.  In the warehouse it is noisy as expected but in the corporate offices the building is state of the art with a cafeteria, catering in house, technology for collaboration, and white noise along with bright lighting."
good,It was a good job. They big on safety management is okay . They let there employees disrespect you. And don’t believe you. A lot of people get fired from he say she say stuff. You gotta stay to yourself there. Fast pace you get off when the work is done.
good,Not enough pay ...stuggling trying to pay my bills.  Applied for a few different positions but was not considered as of yet.  But the company itself ia a good job to learn about different medical supplies.
good,It is a great company to work for with excellent benefits and a lot of paid time off!! You get put on teams and you compete for prizes that are awesome!!!!!
good,hi i had a great time  working for this company. I feel like they taught me alot and i enjoy the follow employees they were helpful to me. I liked my hours and the job location too.
good,"McKesson is a good place to work with many perks, including the yard sales.but if I could change one thing it would be the start time of the night shift."
good,"Great company with lots of good people. Basically redeems the stereotype of a corporate job. People like to be there and stay a long time. Mostly nothing but the best to say about them. I just wanted a change, variety of experience, and had a chance to jump on with a promising family company."
good,Company is very health oriented with free onsite gym for employees and cafeteria with fresh cooked meals.   All employees are very friendly and helpful.
good,The long-term success will depend on whether the company successfully implement its transformational changes within to serve customer-patients. Competition on pricing and government actions to keep healthcare costs affordable are some of the challenges.
good,Great breadth and depth of support from leadership and peers.  Performance reviews were compulsory as were staff advancement reviews.  The ICARE and ILEAD principles were embraced and effective.
good,They do great promoting from within. I am a product of that. I hope to do the same with my team as I build my bench strength. Plus the total compensation package far exceeds other companies.
good,"Great mentors that were focused on development; only opportunity to move up was to relocate."
good,"A typical warehouse environment. Shipping, receiving, picking and packaging. On your feet all day and on the physical side. Learned equipment like the forklift, pallet jacks and narrow aisle machine."
good,"Exposed to opportunities to make self decision and be accountable for the outcomes."
good,"great place to work and make a impactful change in the lives of others. Management is great and supportive, company is always changing and thriving to meet demands of innovative healthcare."
good,I honestly enjoyed working with the McKesson company and it’s employees in a face paced environment with different medications . I Highly recommend applying for this job as a material handler if you like fast easy money
good,McKesson was a constant moving job that always kept your brain and body going. With constant goals to hit you were always striving to be your best. Lots of great benefits as well.
good,"Over all great place to work, and room for growth. dislikes was getting a late start or short staff of our team which slow down production. Because bodies has to be rotated and moved around."
good,Good place to start and for some people a good place to beva lifer i thought the company was great but every place has its good and bad but i think its more good
good,"Overall, I had 11 good years at this company and I worked with some great people.  Unfortunately,a death in my family this year impacted my ability to stay at this company.  Otherwise,  I would still be there happily doing 40-50 hours a week"
good,"The work environment is fast pace, challenging and require team works to finish the job. Its a easy job that requires long distance walking, lifting and picking orders. there are a lot of department that has different roles."
good,Constant change. Career coaching stops after you make Supervisor. Nothing other than online classes from there.  Be ready to be thrown into the fire with little support or training.
good,"Smart, dedicated employees who believe in the mission of advancing patient care. Employee resource groups create culture of respect for diversity and networking."
good,McKesson is a good place to work with professionals. Respect is a principal from the top down. Leadership has created an environment that promotes individual creative thinking and allows decisions to be made for project progression. I would work for McKesson again without hesitation.
good,"High call volume with attention to detail, but very thorough training was given. Gained knowledge of prescription discount programs and multiple high priced pharmaceutical drugs on the market. Also acquired knowledge of major or new pharmaceutical companies  on the market providing prescription drugs. The hardest part of the job was taking angry or upset calls from customers unable to obtain the prescription drug discount program. The most enjoyable part was the fast pasted environment and flow of the job throughout the work day."
good,I worked daily to improve customer relations by supporting all of their communication needs on their work phone systems. I worked with a great team to support our customers phone systems so they could in turn support their customers as well. I maintained phone systems for triage nurse locations which could potentially lead to very stressful situations and with being primarily a health cate company it was very important they have reliable communications at all times.
good,"This job was the foundation for my stable family life. It gave me a secure and supportive company that I could depend on. It was a type of job and company one could work a whole lifetime on. Although the salary was meager, there were raises and benefits, paid vacations and holidays."
good,"it was a good company   I meet wonderful people"
good,This position was a contract position that could've been better for a permanent position. I have no complaints about management.  Everyone was friendly.
good,I worked for a group that has since been sold to NetSmart so I can't speak to the current environment.  My time there prepared me for the position I am in now.
good,"Fast paced and long hours. Hard on feet and back. Risk of carpal tunnel in hands. Long hours but good pay. Able to learn other things like forklift, etc."
good,I worked with over 100 hospital executives in my time at McKesson and was able to impact nursing practice in a positive and efficient manner.  I felt valued as a clinical expert by my team and co workers and felt they rewarded us favorably.
good,"McKesson is a much larger corporation and culture than at my previous job. This is good because I learned a lot about processes and procedures that I would not have learned at a smaller corporation. However the disadvantage is that there is a much higher level of bureaucracy, and many of my coworkers lacked interest in the larger objectives of their roles or of the accounting department."
good,The typical day at work is very standard. I further improve my forklift skills. The management are nice. The couture is very diverse. All in all it's a good starting job.
good,McKesson is an old and large company in a profitable business. It would be a good place to retire IF the business model can sustain. Nice people. Good benefit. Lots of politics. Poor onboard training.
good,Overall not a bad place to work. Everyone starts on night-shift if you want full time work and it takes many years to get a day shift spot as it goes by seniority. Pretty good pay for a job that you can master in about a week. Work life balance isn't great with the long nights 5 nights a week. Management is pretty good and company provides food at least once a month to employees.
good,"Days are your standard days filled with meetings, projects, emails and deliverables. People are interactive, collaborative and typically happy. I like that it is local and easy to access."
good,I enjoy working for Mckesson and I would recommend the Company to other people  . It would be nice if they offered a Daycare onsite or at another location for employees.
good,It was a contract. The pay was pretty good. They have a lot of different departments. It was a good culture. Management was good. Other Employees were satisfied.
good,Working is a reward. Not a bad place to work. It's a pretty quiet atmosphere. So you can get your work done.  Culture is friendly. I like most about this job is I get to do the right thing for our patients/customers.
good,Followed up on prior authorizations for Medical Doctors offices and spoke to payers to find out the results of prior authorizations.  Sent requests for any missing paperwork to Case Managers to follow up with MDO's or customers.  Updated information as needed.
good,"Working from home is a definite benefit working for McKesson.  My travel is usually about 1 week/month and McKesson is very accomodating for travel expenses.  Overall, I find McKesson benefits have been fantastic and a main reason I continue with them."
good,"In the account management area, it is a male dominated area and it feels like the women are excluded from many of their ideas, activities, etc.  If this area was address, it would almost be perfect."
good,"I was able to move up fairly quickly from an intake specialist to a case manager iii within less than a year. I have good health care via cigna, 401k plan, and stock options. Vacation time is givein at the beginning of every year with over 4 weeks off a year."
good,"Working in teams is essential and requires collaboration, must be detailed oriented and display good verbal and written communication skills, as well as, good excellent customer service skills."
good,"The days are busy, plan on walking more than 5 miles a night in the warehouse. Preparing shipments of medical supplies to clients, and stocking/organizing products. "
good,large corporation no longer Moore Medical integration into McKesson. Not sure what direction they are moving at this time. not going to review this company at this time.
good,"Contact payers to verify patient eligibility and coverage information. Contact payers to obtain prior authorization for medication. Verify benefits details with payers, verify if member have deductibles, out of pocket, and what the copay would be for the medication."
good,McKesson is a nice place to work out. They do offer good benefits. But the team I was working on was very drama filled. Over all they do try to treat their employees well.
good,A typical day  for me at Mckesson was average. Got along with my coworkers & managment. I learned to pick the accurate quantity and product upon customers request.
good,"I enjoyed my time at this company and felt it was a positive experience. The leadership was open to change, and they were good about encouraging professional growth."
good,"This job was a very active one. As an order filler (Material Handler), it required a lot of walking back and forth, using an rf unit to scan locations and pick required amounts of items and place in apron before dumping contents into a tote and moving to the next tote. "
good,A day of work for me is interesting I handle a number of different tasks and I start and finish them until I am done on a daily basis.I complete the money that I handle get them prep an balanced for the bank deposit.  There is nothing that I dislike about my job I enjoy my job completely.
good,"Training was hand's on from the start. Managers were helpful, as well as coworkers. Contract work has it's negatives. No control over when the contract ends. One day you have a job, the next you don't."
good,this is not what I would consider long term for most people. this was a great job to attend college and work. it allowed me to work at night and attend school during the day.
good,Worked with HBOC until it was bought by McKesson.  There was a scandal with software that did not exist and cost upper management their jobs.  Some went to jail.  I left right before all of this.
good,"Many opportunities on the rise. Growth is on the horizon.  My team is great, leadership is great and really listen to the comcerns and comments of the employees"
good,"Although I traveled alot to client sites, I had a very reasonable amount of flexibility when I was working remotely in my home office. Management was always supportive of, and encouraged, good work/life balance."
good,Enjoyed my tenure while it lasted.  Overall good place to work.  Good culture.People were very friendly and the work life balance was good.  No issues to report.
good,They need to change management staff in certain Distribution Centers. Some managers are not what McKesson need on their leadership team. Some of their attitudes are disrectful to the hourly and exempt employees.
good,"This is a good company to work for, its a fast paced environment and time goes fast, i really recomentd working there, lots of friendly people, good luck"
good,"It is a clean, very organized workplace. The company culture promotes a fluid communication between employees and management. Several Sick and floaters days are stable."
good,I think that McKesson as a whole was a good company. There was time that I feel my managers did not understand me. I would return to work if they would rehire me.
good,"Great place to work when it was Med 3000, slight down hill slide when it became McKesson.  The staff, the management were excellent and easy to work with.  Car expenses were paid on monthly expense report and were very fair."
good,"load truck drive to customerdeliver product clean out truck"
good,"Good job, high paced with many scheduling opportunities.  Based on sheer volume of work in the facility hours are spread out to accommodate customer needs."
good,Great company to work for and great place to grow with. The President comes frequently for team building opportunities and also the recognition is awesome.
good,Was a nice company to work for but they loss contract (was not renewed) so many of us were laid off. Was a good experience and work atmosphere (work at home) while employed by them.
good,"Fast paced, patient oriented environment, where focus on patient service and comfort is the primary goal. Working in the team like environment has taught me that teamwork is everything"
good,"I have learned so much in the EDI , Admin Assistant duties, Payment"
good,"Great pay, great management, great job security.  The hours are stressful due to working night shift.  Great benefits and incentive program.  PTO is outstanding"
good,Good company to work for. McKesson closed the Moore Medical Side. Work schedule was Ideal for home and life balance. Worked with a great staff of people.
good,"Come set up for job"
good,"A typical day at work I would set up pallets in my lane to make sure that the totes full of medical supplies would be properly sorted, stacked, and scanned into the system. I would then band up the pallet and load it onto the trailer so that the driver could take the load to its destination. The team and management are great and working there is more than just a job. Each tote is like a patient and each time we send it out we could be saving a life."
good,"Its a really good place to start out with CSR. Training is really fast past, and you learn alot in the week, but on the floor, its really laid back. I really enjoy working here, I just wished that the had PTO for contractors"
good,There is always opportunity for growth within the company. Leadership does encourage growth. Friendly environment. All around a good company. There are several different teams with the company with several different roles and opportunities.
good,"We had a physical location in Scottsdale, and they needed more room, so I was one of the employees that they allowed to work from home full time and I have been doing so for 2+ years with minimal oversight from my boss.  This query for a job has nothing to do with any issues with McKesson, I am looking for an additional opportunity to learn new skills since I get off from my amazing full time job at 2:30pm."
good,"I very much liked my role at McKesson as a DevOps Manager. While my role was duplicative when the merger happened (and I had to be let go) I had a great team to work with, and everyone was highly motivated and skilled. It was a very diverse workplace and I'll miss the people more than anything else."
good,Nice clean offices with plenty of light. The environment in general is quite and furniture is new. Coffe and softdrinks and free. Company is involved with the community.
good,Great place to work. Friendly environment. The company is going through a revamp with layoffs but still is a good place to work. Treats the employees very well.
good,"belle équipe, travail à rendement, belle formation et beaucoup d'apprentissage sur le plancher."
good,Very good company to work for. I would recommend anyone to work there. Good competitive environment. Benefits are great! Always a plus in my book. Hate I relocated.
good,"I was hired after 90 days working as a temp. Unlimited OT at the time because we were so behind. We also went from hour lunches to 30-minute lunches because we were so behind. Many changes without the needed organization. Your job is pretty important, you're helping people receive their much-needed oncology medications. Teammates were a little difficult to deal with; nobody really wanted to take initiative for anything and wanted to play supervisor. New programs constantly without training."
good,Fast paced but balanced environment. Currently a supervisor and I enjoy the atmosphere and culture. The short breaks and lunches are frustrating but over a good place.
good,"Typical work day: Everything is on a timed schedule. Worked rejections in the morning, went on to work correspondence, then took a break. Returned from break to finish correspondence then moved on to correcting claims. Ended the day working on a spreadsheet that kept changing by the minute. Had to met production which made it a little stressful."
good,Mckesson is productive and fun workplace. Working culture is good. Good opertunity to learn business and new things.I would like to be part of this company.
good,"Worked with multiple departments and levels of management."
good,"The culture and environment changed drastically once all 10,000 MTS employees moved to Change Healthcare....it negatively impacted the culture.  A lot of talented people were displaced."
good,"Being employed with McKesson for 15 years, what I have most enjoyed is having had the opportunity to work across multiple business units and learn different parts of the overall business. While I would say that McKesson is a stable organization and one that allows for employment growth and  mobility, it is also siloed in structure. It can be difficult to navigate and collaborate across the various business units."
good,"I would rate McKesson as a great company to work for, but they need to consider employees with long years of service before laying them off. Need more heads up prior to lay offs."
good,I enjoyed the work I was assigned to and the people I worked with.  You were allowed a 15 minute break and a 30 minute lunch or no break and a 45 minute lunch.  They allowed you to come in early or work later if a you had a Doctors appointment.
good,"Worked as a temp. No cons, except very traditional environment, where others will potentially find more appealing. Stable work place with offices across the country."
good,"The job isn't particularly difficult, but all training is on the job. Pay per hour is absolute minimum. Good for learning basic shop management and related tasks."
good,"Everyday tasks were to answer phone calls from program members, assist them to process their claims and call insurance and clinic in order to get paperwork processed quickly and on time. Excellent paid training time which stretches as long as 2 weeks. Management very compassionate. Hardest part of job was sitting all day and the most enjoyable part was the cafeteria which had excellent menu and subsidized pricing."
good,The leaders allow you the room that you need to get your job done. People are friendly and training was adequate for the role.The company's longevity and ranking in the industry are pivotal in attracting talent.
good,"great place and people. flex hours nice location, easy work environment, reasonable work load with reasonable time frame to work within. very little micro management"
good,"A typical day never goes as planned, but in what job does it ever.  McKesson has GREAT benefits.  Advancement is probably where the problem lies.  If you get hired and you are happy and content with the job you have then that is great.  Trying to advance is where you get stuck.  However it's a fast paced office and you will never have any down time, lots of job security if you follow company rules and come to work to work."
good,"It is pleasure working with this company. The one good thing about the company is competitiveness and continuous learning process in every day life. There is a healthy work culture environment and also Pros like free lunches, team outings, gift cards etc"
good,"its a very fast place to work, but over all its not so hard, it just cold. but very nice and friendly place with managements. over all I like the place."
good,Excellent training and the work day is very busy but staff very helpful. The department I worked in helped people to get assistance with prescription cost.
good,McKesson is a great place to work with good benefits. You have the opportunity to work with teams and grow.  The people you work with are good and are like no other.
good,"Working in Data center.  Many layers of infrastructure that had many ""points of failure"".  Management was good and open to new ideas and willing to discuss processes and routines that were needing to be changed."
good,"Great work/life balance,  the people I work with really seem to love the company and the environment. The schedule is very flexible. Just a comfortable place to be."
good,My review is that they don't compensate there employees enough. Not enough job opportunities. My department doesn't supply ample training for the positions.
good,"The workplace culture is centered around employee engagement, increasing the health of the company, the employee, and the customers. McKesson is a place where innovation is celebrated and change is constant."
good,"Enjoyed working independently on my assigned clients which included accounts for South Carolina, Florida and Indiana. Setting up access to Insurance websites to verify information on patient eligibility and claims status, printing Remittance Advice. Great place to meet people from all areas of the country now relocated in the Atlanta area and forming friendships.Great sense of accomplishment when resolution of accounts resulted in payment adjustment in a timely manner."
good,"At McKesson we strive everyday to help our clients and bring better solutions to their business. "
good,"This company is great just recommend paying employees every 2 weeks and better options on benefits instead of just one choice. Otherwise, great atmosphere."
good,"Its a very customer focused company, high volume of targets to meet. Generally a very enjoyable place to work set in th eheart of the community, so the best bits is that I know my customers really well"
good,"people had awesome spirits "
good,"There was also a set schedule working for this company. I learned different ways to multi-task, also meeting new co-workers. The most enjoyable part about the job was meeting new people and helping customers get any problem resolved."
good,"I enjoyed being a part of the McKesson family, I enjoyed just doing quality work. Diverse work environment, where I can say its was like family. I worked in all area's, I had the privilege to be their facility trainer."
good,"Fast pace long hours but over all a good place to work I learned a lot shipping receiving cycle counting order conformation ,UPS world shipping forklift operations team work Management was good keeping us on our feet and on point with our work duties . My coworkers made it enjoyable . Been there for 9 years"
good,"Quiet work place due to tedious work responsibilities.  The importance of maintaining spreadsheets and the posting of patient and insurance payments warrants concentration and the need to be meticulous."
good,Working at McKesson was a good experience.. Definitely suited for one who is able to function well with large workload and adhering to strict timelines
good,"●	Accurately and efficiently completed customer orders for over the counter and prescription medications as requested"
good,"The co-workers and environment are really the best things about this particular position. Other than that it's bleh."
good,The people at Mckesson were great. I do however believe they could get more work out of them if there were better raises and/or some kind of incentive program that works.
good,I enjoyed working for the company Mckesson we did radiology bill for a bout 8 different states. Pt will call in to discuss their bill if they didn't understand something or wanting to know what they got done on that day
good,"McKesson is a large stable company. With many different business unites, there are a lot of different opportunities. I am glad to have had an opportunity to have worked there for nearly 5 years. Quality of work life balance is something the leadership talks about and looks at. Though leadership changes faster then what I have been use to in the past, the current leadership has a good game plan for the business. There are some good people that work there at all levels."
good,"Great Management.  Informative (lots of meetings/updates),  "
good,great co-workers. helpful/positive attitudes. very clean facility. fast paced work. everyone was willing to help out. I learn ALOT!
good,"I worked for McKesson for 10 years and it was a pleasure working for them. I unfortunately was a part of a RIF however McKesson was a good company to work for when it came to salary, benefits and being able to work from home."
good,"McKesson consistently raises the bar for excellence in project management. It is a challenging environment as most healthcare companies are today, but they respect their employees and deliver on promised made through performance appraisals and targets they set."
good,"Overall, a well run organization but definitely facing a challenging time ahead in their distribution services division."
good,Enjoyed my time there. Met some good people learned some valuable things. Got paid good and I enjoyed the raises. We stayed busy until the day we shut down and they laid off approximately 45 people. I had good memories there.
good,I was able to work with this company while I was going to school. The pay was good and great bonus plan. I took inbound/outbound calls and was able to learn some medical products/terminology. I enjoyed the people I worked with and made life long friends even though I only worked there for a few months. The hardest part was this being my first call center job and having to learn everything that is involved in a cell center. The most enjoyable part were the company parties and the experienced trainers.
good,A typical day at McKesson was busy and very laid back. I learned a lot about the pharmaceutical business that was very interesting. Management was the best they went above and beyond. My co workers were the best team players ever. The hardest part of my job was at year end when I had to renew contracts. The best part of my job was management recognizing and rewarding employees for their work.
good,"Responsible for interfacing with customers, company sales and/or service representatives to handle pre-sale and post-sale service functions."

good,Had a great experience here at McKesson before they announced the move. My manager was very supportive of my career goals and stepped in to help whenever he could.
good,"Overall McKesson is a great company.  The department I work in is considered a sub unit of McKesson; which is RX Crossroads Pharmacy and the business partner is Amgen Safety Net Foundation.The company experienced a lot of growth in a small amount of time.  There are a fair amount of growth opportunities. The opportunities are slightly above a lateral change. This position started out with a business casual work attire, it changed to a more casual dress code.  With the change in dress code, made the work day more comfortable, however, the culture was a bit more laid back. With the rapid growth, a need for massive hiring was appropriate; which I believe allowed for the company to be more flexible. Being a Case Manager for the Amgen Safety Net Foundation is very a satisfying and rewarding role to have. The foundation provides free Amgen medication to patients with financial needs. The patient assistant program is paid for completely by Amgen, the manufacture of the medication."

Everyone knew their daily tasks and were encouraged to seek out others for advice when applicable. The culture was extremely diverse, respectful, and light hearted. There would be days that an entire row of people would be laughing hysterically because everyone genuinely enjoyed their coworkers.

I've learned a lot of things, Specifically a lot about the company in general and how we are needed regardless of anything. Management is always there when needed, and is very helpful. I do not at this moment in time think there is anything hard about the job, I think the fact that it is repetitive can bother some people.

I enjoyed working the denied claims for the WC department with Marshall University. My lead never hesitated to assign me a new workflow to learn and master. The only reason I left this position was because I couldn't afford the childcare at the time. If it weren't for that, I could easily still see myself working with this company."

good,"Answered 100+ calls a week"
good,Overall I think that it was a good company to work for. It was challenging at sometimes but it was always achievable to me. At first it may seem difficult but once someone gets use to it then it  will become easy. The best piece of advice is to stay consistent  on a daily basis. The people overall that worked with me including management were okay to work with. The best thing about the job is that your hard work will pay off eventually. The hardest part of the job is that is 3rd shift which is night shift which eventually took a toll on me saying that I need to make a different job choice.

good,"I work with a great team of nurses.  The nursing supervisor and manager are fun to work with, makes getting up to come to work a pleasure.  The hardest part of my job is last minute replacement requests or sick calls.  I enjoy the independence of working and being responsible for my area."
good,"I always stay on task.  I complete the job that is assigned to me, no matter how long it takes.  I get along with my co-workers, but still have to be focused on getting the job done in a timely manner.  After working for a company for so long, you get comfortable.  New employees come up to me and ask my advice.  I am a motivated worker whose only goal is to get the job done."
good,I haven't had any bad experiences.  I am able to do my job without being micro-managed as I work remotely. Company seems to be doing good but concerned that they may be consolidating in the near future.

good,"There was never a dull moment in my work day as the AP/AR Returns Supervisor. It was a daily job of multi-tasking escalated unpaid deductions, approving payments above representative's threshold, sending weekly performance reports, and holding meetings as to how we can improve our team dynamic and performance.  The hardest part of the job was coming in as an outside hire, in a supervisory role, and earning each team members respect. This was probably the biggest goal achieved, because I had to be able to separate the task at hand, and not feel as though anyone was offended with constructive criticism. In due time, with individual one on ones, we were able to build individual professional relationships, which in turn helped our team turn more positive as opposed to coming in on the first day.  I enjoyed getting each task done on my to-do list of priorities each day and knowing at the end of the day I was productive.  It was definitely challenging with my own work load and the escalations of others, but that is what I enjoy most.  There was not much interaction between myself and upper management due to the sheer size of the company, but the meetings we did attend together, they were always open to ideas and had the company's best interest at heart."

good,Great place to work especially under my current manager. Lots of changes that I'm not happy about but it is just business.
good,The layoffs are too frequent; the culture and the benefits are wonder ful and I am involved in quite a bit of community activism/volunteer. Very rewarding.
good,McKesson is a great company which continues to grow as it acquires distribution and technology businesses. Stock has nearly tripled in the past three years.

good,"A typical day at work for me, would be coming in about 10 minutes early going in to the office in the back room sitting and talking a little, with the manager and some other ladies in there drinking some coffee and a baggle before it was time to clock in, some times clocking straight in and heading to work. Which entitled going to my desk and getting a patients chart out and then start typing there billing information into the system, there would be times when I would be doing that and my manager would call me into her office to file stacks of papers, or copy 2 big stacks of paper works then go through them and Highlight certain pt. and see which ones had paid or needed to pay which ones made there Co payments and etc. Other times there would be missing files that we would have to locate and so forth. I learned a lot from how to Bill customers, what to look for on a chart as far as there insurance, Name, date of birth social, and how much they paid, filing and faxing information. The Co- workers where all very nice we all got a long, when we weren't to busy we all talked quietly and worked and helped each other out; when I was finished before someone else I would just ask who ever needed help then grab a stack of papers from them and help them out and so forth. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is standing for about 2hrs just copying all the papers or trying to locate a pt. information that wasn't in the computer we had stacks of boxes we had to go through and if it wasn't in the right box with the code on it we had to go through other boxes to locate it. The most"

Make sure the quality is correct before being shipped. Then the process starts over again. New products are always being brought in which requires ongoing learning. Relationships between the management and other staff members are possitive. The hardest part of my job is not always getting my full week in of 40 hours a week or more. I enjoy getting the work accomplished on time and down to perfection as well as knowing that the company is satisfied with my duties.

good,"McKesson really gets it when it comes to work-life balance, fostering a great work culture and encouraging promotion from within."
good,When I first started working with McKesson it was a long commute from the mall parking lot to the building in Scottsdale. You could take the trolley but that could make you late depending on how many people were waiting ahead of you. But after you got to work it was well worth the exercise or the ride. It seemed that everyone really   loved working for this company and not to mention all the managers made it interesting to learn the material. There seemed to be always some event going on at the office as well which drew the workers in and had them more motivated in a positive way.

good,"McKesson was a great company to work for. The culture was excellent, management was the best I'd ever experienced. I loved my co-workers. It was a very supportive work environment. The job was very stressful though. Sales always has a lot of pressure attached to the position and a lot of time and effort was put into obtaining sales and customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job was my relationships with my colleagues and many of my customers."
good,"I joined the organization not really knowing the value of the organization and have been very happy with the work, interaction with co-workers and company values."
good,"Arrive to work for my shift, and get what is told to do that night (supply/amount of work depends on how much material is brought in). Learned to be organized, respectful, time appropriate, responsible, and work well with others. I enjoyed my co-workers and had no problems with this job. The hours were a bit hard for me, especially on nights we had large shipments, causing late nights and early mornings with school. Yet at the same time, the most important thing I learned balancing school and work was time management. "

By the time this was done the first of our two daily deliveries would have arrived which I would have processed and either put on the shop floor or in the stock room. I would serve customers if and when they came into the pharmacy by helping them get the best medication or treatment for their problem, or by getting their prescription for them. If it was busy the supervisor and I would decide who would stay on the shop floor to put the stock out and who would stay around the till area. There was no sense of hierarchy which I liked about Lloyds and it made the supervisor more approachable if I needed her help."
good,"I actually work for RelayHealth under McKesson and still working there. I believe it's a good company for Technical folks as I work in the technical field and not sure about the other departments. As long as you perform well, job security is there. I have been with company for over 5 years and first time in my career stayed at place where I am looking forward to going to work. Work life balance is great, management is very flexible with work schedule as long as the work gets done. Co-workers are one of the smartest people I have worked with. Company defiantly believes in keeping the talent in house."
good,My typical day was to stand and watch products. I have learned ways around the warehouse to make my job a lot more interesting. The management weren't such a hassle to deal with being that it was a wide-range environment to deal with. My co-workers were mainly to themselves. The hardest part of this job was unloading the trucks. I enjoyed the peace that was given. The teamwork as well.

good,very laid back just wish it wasnt a temp job. i enjoyied every minute of it and it was cool inside of the work enivorment and the security wasnt good but as far as working for a great cause was outstanding
good,"No life balance "
good,It was an excellent opportunity to learn the clerical side of the medical field and you'll gain a vast amount of knowledge in regards to insurance. However it's a temp agency and the chances of being hired on were slim to none.
good,"The ppl are hateful, liars the team leaders, h.r. is in cahoots with the line workers plotting to get other ppl wrote up,always worrying about other ppl,trying to get ppl fired,dont come here if u wanna get lied on management is crooked, dont dont dont dont come to this place."
good,"If you have small t"
good,None the job was simple but the environment was not open and friendly the pay was great not the environment was not business it was more personal in my opinion
good,The company and corporation as a whole is amazing! The office in Ft Worth and Carrollton are very hard to advance in because of favoritism an nepotism
good,"My typical day is going to doors and ringing door bells or knocking hard as the person you are visiting could be deaf and you have to be heard over their tv set being up loud.  Talking to each customer giving them a smile and asking how they are then telling them to take care, and they seem to be happier than when they first opened the door to you."

good,Long hours. Never know when your getting off of work. If you have a family or a life don’t work here. You get 2- 1/2 breaks and one 15 minute break since you work so long.  YOu go in and they say it’s going to be a 9.5 hour day and it ends up being 12-14 hours. How is it even right that they work you this much.
good,"McKesson has a very good work environment.  The Network Growth Business Unit on-boards Oncology practices into the McKesson Specialty Health, US Oncology Network.  The PM work environment requires attention to complex project management activities and has a demanding project control system that is used when on boarding practices.  We strive to mitigate any negative impacts affecting operations or patient care."

good,The company was a fun place to work. a typical day - very busy and a lot to learn. there were programs to  educate employees in different areas of life. Culture of all.

I appreciated the training and comradeship that was afforded to me through McKesson.

I love working with people and worked with all kinds of people buying and selling real estate, realtors, loan originators, mortgage processors, attorneys, inspectors, construction contractors, and more.  The work was challenging and that was my favorite part about it, along with working with people.  I also enjoyed the investigatory part of the job.

good,"The job function was very simple and I gained a lot of knowledge the longer I worked there. I didn't like the management because they didn't care about our health.

We get all sorts of patients and pharmacies calling about their prescriptions and we provided services to ensure coupons work properly and enrollment patients in different savings programs.

good,"I work for McKesson as an outsourced IT professional at a healthcare facility. It's a great place to work. The only downside is being very detached from McKesson. A lot of the news and successes shared with us via newsletter do not really apply to us nor do we know the people involved. I feel it is easier to relate to the successes of our client because we are part of them."
good,Good work life balance. It all depends on the business unit you work for. Some business unit are not stable enough
good,Working with the Corporate Litigation Department I came to make many personal friends. While I was dedicated to my tasks helping build an eDiscovery Program and deplohing an EDRM suite I saw many talented individuals leave McKesson due to lack of advancement and compensation. I really love McKesson and its people and culture it just needs some overhauling as it relates to employee retention.

The calls could be for anything from unlocking accounts and generating passwords, to processing prescription information or entering Patients into the system.  I learned about the drug Isotretinoin and the severe risks from the drug.  The management in the program I work in at McKesson are great people, who attempt to accommodate and help their employees as much as possible.  I work alongside an awesome group of friendly entertaining people, who will go out their way to assist others.  The hardest part of the job would have to be making sure you have the correct information when contacting drug Manufacturers about Potential Adverse Events.  What I enjoy the most is speaking with a stakeholder (Patient, Pharmacy, Presciber or Wholesaler) and ending the call with the caller happy and satisfied as they were successfully assisted."

I would count the stock in the shop area and work at the counter, taking prescriptions in and on the till. I also learnt how the dispensary worked. The staff were all really friendly and I learnt a lot from my time there. the worst part of the job was when it was very quiet and the hours dragged, and the best part was the bacon sandwich on a Friday morning!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of data entering applications, verifying patients insurance and determining eligibility. After completing this process if the patient qualified I would proceed to process and approve the application, send determination letters and order medication. Management was very good at keeping everyone informed on guidelines so we could help as many patients as possible. The hardest part of the job was having to deny patients that did not meet the eligibility requirements. I really enjoy helping those that are in need."
good,"I am a pharmacist at Lloyds. I work 40 hours per week. Mostly accurate checking (dosage boxes aswell).  I am very careful and I make no mistakes. I am a fast, responsible and friendly worker.

McKesson also made it possible to transfer  to Orlando with ease which in turn improved my family life ."
good,"Great place to work ,lack of communication  amongst supervisor and  employees .you can be cross trained at any time.open door policy give recognition  for there good employees"
good,"I am a contractor, so job security is a question mark even though I've been there 5 months and I've never called in sick or been late the entire time. I'd love to communicate with other clinical staff that work there to see what other nurses are doing within the organization."
good,"This was a great company, however the manager I had sucked. They start at 15.39/hour which is good for a customer service job. After 90 days you get PTO and 3 optional holidays. I only lefy becuase I found a better opportunity with more money. Great benefits and low prices."
good,load truck  for delivery  with fork lift route delivery driver  i worked  for mckesson  for 12 years  great company   lots  of overtime  good  benifits   3 week s vacation  i liked this  the company  the company  was sold
good,"This company is a great company to work for but how ever they seem like they only care for certain employees. The work life balance is so bad, the over time is to much. Management is okay, but it could be better."
good,Great company to work for if you like being laid off. I worked for them for 5 years and was laid off twice due to downsizing.
good,"Lloyds Pharmacy was a great place to work as I learned so much and its a job that you can progress in. my co-workers were very friendly and my daily requirements were dealing with prescriptions and housekeeping of the shop. the hardest thing about the job was giving out methadone, the most enjoyable part was progressing into a healthcare assistant."
good,"Mckesson is a great place to work. However, they closed the Seattle office."

good,"I'm totally satisfied. Multiple locations. Fortune 500 company. The benefits are the best. They really do care about their employees. The pay could be better, MUCH BETTER but overall they might not care about you personally but they have the best benefits ever. If you have a spouse that can pick up the pieces, you got it made."

good,This job was a good temporary position to gain new experience in the medical industry. They provided me with work for 5 years and I had minimal issues with the company.
good,"Mckesson can be a fantastic place to work if you have high level skills or degrees, but cuts short for those who do not. Advancement is difficult and very competitive but possible for those who put in the hard work. The people you work with tend to be more mature (opinion) than most call centers, since the company try's to hire individuals who show promise as opposed to warm bodies. The pay is decent for the work requested and there are a myriad of benefits from 401k to stock purchasing assistance and beyond. People complain because it's work so it's obligatory but truth be told it's a good place to be and there are places to work that are far, far worse."
good,"On my first day as a temp I was made to feel very welcome, my cubicle was ready and laptop imaged.  Since then I've been given some training, attend meetings and am continuing to learn new skills and further develop previous skills."
good,"The brand new building is bueatiful. Everything is up to par with the latest equipment, however a lot of management changes. Due to a lot of people moving up, we didn’t have a consistent manager."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is helping people and the customers. All companies have things they need to work on, but overall great company to work for."
good,"While I am still a contract employee, I want to work my hardest and show I am a productive and qualified candidate. Unfortunately the contract position I am in I have heard upper management say it is ""the longest job interview of your life"" and I believe it! That is the only reason I am willing to find another opportunity."
good,Very nice excellent I like the McKesson Canada
good,"Large workload. Development would not fix issues.  Product was always breaking. Hard to tell customers there would be no fix for the issue."
good,The pay is great especially for an entry level position. Management is terrible and doesn't convey information easily. The employees pretty much run the place which is good and bad. Over all McKesson was fun to work for
good,"A nice place to work and good co workers. This was a contract position, I was only there for like 3 months so really can't say too much. My typical day consisted of talking with patients regarding their balance and co pays etc. Had to do some basic math relating to insurance but was not difficult to do. Overall the company is good and good co workers.I would definitely work there again had no complaints."
good,Learned a lot on managing a group of people.

good,"McKesson's pharmaceutical distribution supply chain, health care services, and medical supplies & equipment help address the challenges health care organizations face today—and shape how they’ll overcome the new challenges of tomorrow."
good,"I love working for McKesson, but the business is in transition to move a lot of positions to the Texas area. It is unfortunate as a lot of jobs were lost and having to find new opportunities."
good,great place to work and the benefits are great oppuurinuty for job growth is not so great however it is a very good business to deal with and to be a part of
good,"very good...always went above job requirements, seldom absent, always on time, completed work on time and willing to lend a hand to others. got along with other employees"
good,"Telephonic and field work. I learned the importance of providing health education and services to those in communities who are less fortunate but desire the same knowledge and health opportunities as others. Management and the workplace culture was appropriate. The hardest part of this job is working alone in many of Chicago's challenged communities. The most enjoyable part of this job is working with client's (disabled, elderly) who appreciated the services and felt ""special"" when services were provided."
good,Comfortable working culture/environment. No manager breathing on your neck.  Able to do work independently. No weekends or overtime offered. Nice to receive health insurance.
good,Great company to work.  I enjoyed the organization and the executive team.  The company is very goal oriented.  The benefit packages were excellent.  The General Manager genuinely cared about everyone
good,A great place to work.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.  Hours are great and the folks are very helpful.  I love it!  Its great that there are locations all over the U.S.  They have a great learning environment for its employees.
good,"Typical day at work, training is good, management is alright but be prepare to be on long holds. I felt like I barley got 2 cases done a day. You have to obtain 8 or more a day. It was challenging when you have unprofessional individuals on the other line who are not wanting to give you any information, but yet calling the wrong numbers only to find out you must be transferred or research for a number to obtain the information, It was a headache but perfect for some. Patience is key with this place."
good,I'm a hard working woman. I love to work and I never pass up an opportunity or a challenge in the work place. I love to see new faces & meeting new people.
good,I Loved working with my clients and also my peers but I did not feel secure at the company. My position there was a temporary position and employees were laid off on a daily basis. I am currently seeking a career not just a job itself. Also it was temporary only
good,Really fast paced job that requires a lot of hours but can be fulfilling. McKesson has a great program for leadership training and promoting internal employees.
good,"Best place I worked, doctors are not only great at what they do, but they treat there staff like family. Had a great time and learned lots!"
good,Learned alot of my computer skills I met my future boss at this location and will be willing to learn more. I worked in computer room and as a customer service rep.
good,"Great experience from one of the top AR and Collections departments from McKesson."
good,Enjoyed working for a successful implementation or upgrade which came in under the required time limit.  Was able to work from home or come into the office.  Worked with a very good team to work with which were able to provide assistance and accept assistance as needed.
good,when I worked on nights I filled orders all night. I enjoyed it because I found it interesting and it kept you busy. I worked on nights for 21 years. found my coworkers to be cooperative and kind to me. Management knew they could count on me to get things done.
good,"Checking all the Senior Managers diaries and ensuring all documents are at hand for meetings, meeting rooms are ready, travel documents if required are at hand for any external meetings, ensure any appointments that are cancelled that day are re-arranged and managers are aware of there day to day activities.   General admin duties throughout the day.  Prioritising workload to ensure all managers work is completed accordingly."
good,"Loved the job"
good,I like to stay busy. Make sure my work is accurate and correct. Enjoy meeting new people and talking.
good,"Very busy professional office. Responsible for supporting the Vice President of Business Development and four directors.

Scheduled and ran monthly WebEx meetings and tracked client agreements in an Access database. Process correspondence and updated presentations, reports and agreements using Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Communicated to staff using Outlook. Participated in Business Continuity Planning meetings"
good,Typical day consists of about 10 to 12 hours.
good,Loved the job the management was not understanding very unprofessional. Among my peer they were very respectful and outgoing great people to work with.
good,McKesson embraces their ICARE and ILEAD culture.  The employees are a fine example of their values.  Everyone is willing to help each other making it a great place to work as a team.
good,"The environment is wonderful due to the people that work there but like with any place you have certain things that could always improve on. I think like with any job you need to feel that you have some independence, well if you do a good job you do get this type of responsibility."
good,"I like working for Lloyds pharmacy."
good,International and domestic travel and schedule management. Various executive level exposure. Crisis management and small to large scale event coordination.
good,Cool job but no opportunity to grow. Keep you as a temp agent only hiring on people based on popularity not skills. Proven fact if you are not a social person always in managers faces everyday its hard to get ahead.
good,"The pay was the best part and bonuses. The HSA, You just have to be ready to pretty much run all night with a heavy sack on your back. And you have to stay until all orders are completed. You work every holiday and holidays are when you work the most hours."
good,"Being a driver for McKesson is not an easy job. Start times are very early, loads are usually heavy, and deliveries can be time-consuming. Responsibilities are commensurate with the role and level of mature responsible behavior and professionalism is expected in accordance with company policy and DOT rules and FMCSA laws."
good,Good Company to work for. Leader in the Healthcare integration industry. Good benefits and respects work-life balance. Fortune 10 . US based Company .

good,"Very great place to learn and experience new things. Management is nice and helpful, on call help was always there, different caters for lunch was always a good surprise."
good,McKesson people are mostly in it for the health care aspect. I find they bring that care for others into the office environment. High-tech solutions and international scope are there in the Canadian division of this multi-national corporation.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, as I felt like I was doing work that matters and had an impact for the good on society. I would recommend the company to others"
good,"Great place to diversify your career and grow.  McKesson has a culture that puts the client first, but does not completely disregard the employee.  One thing that I wish McKesson was better at was that it was very siloed.  Different business units competed against each other rather than worked together."
good,"Management is the worst at McKesson. Most managers/supervisors are highly unskilled and micro-manage in the worst possible way. If you are seeking a career where management is what drives you, I would seek another company."
good,This is a very humbling place to work. The job that you do is to provide the financial pathway to life saving treatment. The employees worked seamlessly together.
good,Very good caring People and company to work for. They actually cared about the employees. Even the different entities of the workforce enjoyed there jobs and were treated well and a lot of room for advancement here or change.
good,I was hired through a temp agency. Loved it there. Was let go due to attendence (sickness). Never warned about it. I still enjoyed it there! They didn't make expected budget so there is a hiring freeze and temps are the first out.
good,Good Company and colleagues are great. However the leadership need improvement need to learn work together. I felt that the leadership doesn't listen to staff  it one way only.
good,McKesson Corp - Employees and management are wonderful. Jobs pay well.  You work a lot of overtime.  Work/Life Balance is not their priority.  Like all large corporations there is no since of job security.  They are constantly looking for areas to outsource.  They routinely have large layoff to lower budget.
good,Every company has issues  but overall McKesson is a great place to work. Nice people and great laid back atmosphere. .......................................................
good,"great job excellent benefits,pay was below average at the time,climate controlled facility with modern automated conveyor system and machinery different hours my shift was 7pm to 330 am or 8pm to 430am"
good,"very busy answering phones for 3 clients, processing and posting credit card payments, loved being busy and loved the staff, learned to get complete goals"
good,The overall culture of this branch of Mckesson felt like family. Great days off and it has an okay  benefits package.  It is  a  semi stable job. It all depends on the person.

good,"McKesson is one of the best places I have ever worked. The people, the atmosphere, and just overall the experience I had was great. I learned a lot about the place i was working and what we did for the community. I never thought i would like to work in a warehouse, but it was something I would not hesitate to do again."
good,The company and the benefits are great.  Job security and room for advancement.  The company offers a great variety of jobs for non management employees.  It is very hard to transition into management or the IT department.

good,"This was a contract job, great working with management and co-workers. I woul love to have a Job with this Company."
good,"My job at the warehouse was too sort pallets and put the like medicines on the same pallet. After sorting at least 30 pallets, I would operate a stand up lift and using a RF scanner locate the proper place in the warehouse and put the pallet in the correct location. The hardest part of the job was getting some of the pallets in the locations that were two stories tall. Sometimes I would have to move a pallet over with the one I had on the lift while the fork is really high in the air just to make room. It was a very challenging job but I got the hang of it and before long I could perform it with no trouble at all. I didn't really get to know a lot of my co-workers there. Most people kept to themselves and did their jobs. The manager was a really nice guy and any problems went straight to him. I got a sense of accomplishment out of learning how to operate a stand up lift in that capacity. I would think that if someone had a fear of heights that job really wouldn't work for them. Overall, it was a good job and if given the chance I would run a Stand Up lift again."

good,Both in office and remote working options allow for flexibility to the individual. Incredibly intelligent and business savvy colleagues where much can be learned about healthcare business. Management is efficient and directive. Occasional work overflow into personal but individuality is key to keeping boundaries. Often new grad/new hires compete for attention.

good,"I was offered the positon out of 8 other candidate's. That made me feel really good, that they saw something in me that would bring to the company.My supervisor tried to get me hired on after the lady returned back to work, but the job postings had be to posted internal before external. Unfortunately another employee got the position. So I was laid off shorly after that."
good,"This was a great job which I really enjoyed. Had alot of daily contact and interaction with co-workers and management. Got to travel to other locations to work with different managers and was given a variety of work to do. Problem solving, event planning, helping others. It was all enjoyable and it was close to home."

good,"Since doing work experience at Lloyds Pharmacy to gain my NVQ level 2 in Community Pharmacy dispensing accredited by Buttercups Training Provider I found the experience to correlate with my versatile skill set having worked in pharmacies before. I enjoy the busy periods of the day and also made use of the quiet times by finding something to do if it wasnt cleaning the shelves/recycling, I would use my own initiative and start checking expirys on POM medicines. I am given an hour to study in the back so if I have any questions they can be queried with the pharmacist him/herself. I have learnt to keep good relations with customers building up a rapport with them so they know I am there to help as much as I can both bilingually and efficiently as possible. Customer Service is very important, so listening to customers is key, even though rarely there may be a mishap with the patient not recieving their medicine at the correct time or that the order has'nt arrived so dealing with the customer explaining to them apologetically is important so that the customer is able to see these things can happen and its not the fault of the dispensing staff. Management at Lloyds Pharmacy is spot on they are very friendly and happy to help and listen to me personally which makes working at Lloyds Pharmacy a very productive place to be. My co-workers are great and we work efficiently as a team getting all jobs done. I make sure if I am unsure about anything for example when doing the trays to ask which one to do first in this way priority is given and customers are served on a first come first serve"

But times you still need a management team to come and train to insure you know what that you are able to complete a daily task and know the complete SOP of the job position.

I would still be with Mckesson but they took me from my contract with Wellstar Health Systems and threw me in with Perse workers and expected me to train my supervisor customer service reps and even the director when I was not being compensated! My next move up the ladder was lead and my supervisor gave it to another girl that she knew from a previous job but I knew all the contracts and had builded a repore with Wellstar.
good,"Typical work day is filled with challenges that excite the mind. Employees do not work in pockets but as one unit. The culture is indicative of the leadership.

I had to then verify the patients drug coverage by calling the various insurance companies and specialty pharmacies. Also working on special projects that the management would assign based on your skill level and experience. There is a lot of people working at McKesson it is a huge call center and I hardly spoke with any one just the girl to my right and left. The hardest part was trying to reach your deadline or complete a good amount of prescriptions because it all depended on the insurance companies and if they were open and their holding times were almost always really high. The enjoyable part was going home!"
good,"I am enjoying my work efforts very much at McKesson Corporation. I especially like the work environment, the professionalism and Management ethics of the Company."

good,"This was only a 4-6 week placement, which we are expected to completed during education.(16+). A typical day at work would include assisting the pharmacist with any needs or instructions, such as finding specific drugs, labeling and mainly observing how dosages are made up and quantities are completed. I also worked on the till, where prescriptions came in. I assisted customers who required help or information on medications and any over the counter medication. I also completed invoices and orders where I had to order, sign, check and put away drugs under A-Z filing system. I learned how prescriptions are filed and taken in, How drugs are administered and how dosages are made up. I learnt how to work the tills, place orders and invoices. I worked in a very small pharmacy where there was only two pharmacists and one assistant. They were lovely people to work with and always willing to help me with any queries i had and teach me more. The hardest part of the job was not being able to do much in terms of hands on work with the pharmacist however it was enjoyable learning new things and watching. I wish my placement was longer so i would have had the opportunity to do more."

Work was sent to me daily by my supervisor and it was up to me to manage my time and meet my production and quality requirements. I enjoyed the experience of having the autonomy to make decisions and getting my daily goals met. I had a great network of other remote coders to discuss coding situations. The most difficult part of the position was not knowing how long the contract would last. Overall, it was a great learning experience."
good,A typical day was reading packing slip to get product information and then pulling those items and packing them in appropriate boxes to send on down the conveyor belt for the next area to be packed. It was a fast paced environment. The co-workers were a diverse group of people that got along well with each other. Employees were eager to help each other when and where needed.

I went from order picker(materail handler) to now working on the shipping dock. The hardest part about my job getting the trucks out of the facility on time. Some days are harder then most. The best part of my job is my co workers and my management team. We work hard and long together in order to get the job done.
good,"Enjoyed 10 years with McKesson and the wonderful very knowledgable colleagues.  Senior leadership was very supportive and engaged.  Customers were highly satisfied with their ""partnership"" with McKesson."
good,"McKesson is overall a great company to work for as they provide excellent benefits. The pay is slightly lower than market, however, the company is very stable. McKesson offers great working hours providing a work/life balance. It could be difficult to move up within the company. Management is generally great to work with."
good,"Its quiet and clean with rarely any issues. Attendance and a Positive Mental Attitude are key. There is a gym at your disposal. For someone who likes to get physical/ active, I would not recommend."

good,The job was great I just had to relocate. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a job to keep them going every day with a little change daily. Also its great for learning about new information in the process as it offers access to multiple  tid bits of information along the way.

good,"Out of all the Customer Service jobs I've worked, McKesson was the most professional, had the most reliable management, offered the most effective training and was the most clean and pleasant place you could ask for. If I hadn't have moved to another state, I believe I would still be there today."
good,"lovely customers and lovely workers, really nice people to work for but got to be prepared to work when it gets busy.its hard work but the benefits you feel from helping others is a good feeling"
good,"McKesson was a great place to work .I worked 10 hours four days a week and sometimes 8 hours on Fridays. I learned how to work as a team .It was well managed and we had a understanding how important our role was. Having acknowledge of the operation of each machine . We were like a family there ,we have watch children being born  to them going to school. We had great benefits , we had sick days and paid time off. The job wasn't hard at all, but like many places you have some that would disagree. It was enjoyable when we had our yearly parties. Just being able to sit down and talk about our family and other things. We were able to stay a year after they told everyone the company would be relocating to  Memphis. We still had responsibilities to do our job with quality and performance as we always did."
good,Loved working with my providers and staff. Learned a lot about the provider environment and what it takes to run a successful practice. I had great leaders to show me what to do and coach me.

good,"Best company i have ever worked for.  I wish I would not have been is a division spun off to change healthcare. I miss the culture."
good,"You must be able to be patient and maintain a positive attitude with customers, as some issues can be very tough to handle. Managers and coworkers are great, they always try to push motivation and encourage you to continue working, by providing rewards (pizza lunches, donuts, candy)  Hardest part is dealing with irate customers, best part is the people and how understanding managers are"
good,"During my time at McKessson/Change Healthcare I learned and completed the following:"

good,"Fun and fast paced place to work, job benefits are great  401k are solid when you go all in. The environment is a fun and diverse environment to work in."
good,"A typical work day at the Ridgeland-Jackon call center is experiential the least, fun and collaborative for the most part and rewarding when you make the effort to do your job and stay focused. Each day is a learning experience and some days are challenging while most are preferably repetitive. You will learn alot with the resources and constant training advice given by the well informed training staff both on-site and visiting staff from other sites. The workflow is individual in how one maneuvers in/out the multiple screens like JD Edwards AS400, 9.1, supply manager and Salesforce. You will learn your best routine in handling calls and inputting case notes and follow up calls to previous customers. Management is involved, understanding and supportive of your professional development and your social involvement in your community. Management is professional, seasoned and well resourced with the necessities to help you grow. The hardest part of the job is minimum to non existing. I would suggest that you have at least two years customer service experience, preferably sales and solutions based. I personally enjoy my job and excited to see what the future holds for me and my family at McKesson."

good,"I love this company, when have you ever walked into a new position and on the first day everyone says HI, smiles and says if you need anything just come ask! And when you do ask they are more than happy to answer questions or help in any way possible. Management has been very supportive and compassionate to employee needs and they are very relaxed all that they ask is that you come to work and do your job the best you can and be coachable. The Ops manager leads by example and personally thank you for going above and beyond.As an ex UnitedHealthcare employee I have jumped into this new company with both feet and will never go back, this is what a real healthcare company should do for their employees. I am a Unit Coordinator and the pay they offer me is $9 more an hour than a Team lead position with UHC. If you want a great place to work and the great team to help you grow and succeed this is the place. I hope to continue my employment and be a loyal employee for a very long time."
good,"Mostly women work here and you have to be careful to not get caught up in any drama. Keep your head down, do your job and this is a great place to work.

good,McKesson is a great company to work for. Great benifits and competitive pay. It is very physical work and fast paced on night shift and day shift. Incentive pay for woking above the required productivity standards but standard is easily acheivable. Oportunity for advancement if you are looking to make a career out of it like I have. I love knowing that what we do every day impacts other people's lives and is much more than a regular distribution center job.
good,It was a wonderful place to work for and I enjoyed going to work everyday. My coworkers and management made working there pleasant and family oriented.
good,"A typical day at Mckesson corp would include pulling all files for the customer service representatives, making copies for them and returning the original files to its place, sorting out old files and placing them in storage, scanning all new files into image now and making sure that the file was presentable in the computer for all who had access to it and assisting in the mail room whenever necessary. Management was tough but fair. The hardest part of the job and with most jobs that I've been able to work is meeting deadlines however the most enjoyable part was getting the job right and being able to see how important my role was within the company."

good,"The typical day at McKesson was primarily centered around Safety and watching out for your fellow co-workers, and of course pulling orders and such. The hardest part of the whole job I would have to say is the amount of walking that it entails, I logged per night at least 20+ miles so if you really want to lose weight fast this is the place to go. But seriously, the walking wasn't all that bad after the first week or so. For me the most enjoyable part of the job had to be the openness of the other workers and the management, one can have tons of fun at this job."
good,I can't really say a lot because I was only there for 8 days on work experience whilst I was at school. However I enjoyed working there the people were friendly and the customers were friendly as well. I would happily go back to this again in the future.
good,"Material Handler, or pick packing the only bad thing about it is that you get timed while you pick, if your not fast enough you will get disciplinary action other then that, The management is great, they really know how to take care of there employs, if you like a fast pace job it would be a great fit for you"
good,I have really enjoyed working for this company. Never have I work for a company that is so family oriented. My fondest memory of this company is all the love and support they have given to the communities. I have a personal outside work relationship with just about everyone there.
good,"This company is superb, treating the employees as well as its employers with utmost respect, open communication, and safety consideration. While the life change can be undesirable (its a nightshift job, so it shifts your day into the night, and your sleep into the day), the pay and culture is second to none. I would definitely work here again if I could stand the nightshift lifestyle. Very physical, fast paced and efficiency centered."
