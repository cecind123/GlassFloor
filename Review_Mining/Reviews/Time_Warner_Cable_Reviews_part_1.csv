rating,review
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"very busy, free service, need more parking, multi-cultured, variety of departments. Company is very large. intuitive, spanned across the US. "
bad,I would not suggest this place for anyone  the owner is a cheat lier and doesn't stand behind his people  I suggest you look else where he terminates for mo reason no matter how hard you work
bad,"I worked for the timewarner cable - no interview. "
bad,"Management sucks,  they pretend to help you but don't and run you over with a bus,  back and forth!  All they care about is their numbers, which makes you just a number."
bad,All they are focused on is how to do sales even if that isn't the job your assigned to. The management there is very poor and they do not give you the training you need to succeed.
bad,not a good place to work.  I went thru 8 weeks of training and i took practice tests that I obviously bombed and their answer to me was oh you will be ok. Then my 2nd week on the floor they came to me and told me that i wasnt utilizing the 5 systems we triained on sufficiently.  Then they gave me a two day ultimatum to get it or they would have to let me go.  I was completely devastated due to I told them  was having trouble from the beginning and they did nothing to help me.  Very discouraging and I walked out balling and never returned
bad,Lets just say that I've had it a lot better before this new age of bundling services and the competition. If a customer asks you to do their dishes before you leave... you had better.
bad,"Not the best place, short training didnt cover all aspects of work. Poor management and low pay. Bad work life balance, very little help or support. Trivial and arbitrary"
bad,"We are expected to manage employees who work about 2hrs/day if they show up at all. We are not able to discipline them but we are responsible for them not being at work, hardly working, or under producing. An employee can complain about anything whether it is valid or not. Supervisors are reprimanded as a result, but the employee is not held liable for their actions or inaction. Their is no system of organization and no support. We are powerless to do anything but are expected to do everything!  The supervisor position is a joke. However, if you want to apply as a direct sales rep, please do so. Direct Sales reps can get away with just about anything. In fact, they will feed you pizza as an incentive for simply showing up to work. It's so hard to be fired as a sales rep, you may as well stay for the base salary and free cable & internet as long as you can. But as a Supervisor, this job is stressful enough to make a 21yr olds hair turn grey after 1 week."
bad,This was the most disorganized and poorly managed company I have ever worked at. Employees are treated disrespectfully while management lectures employees on diversity and working like slaves. Glad I am gone. Enough with the reorgs already which just hide senior management incompetence.
bad,good work and good company but not really good the supervisor good insures and services free for employes  and pay millage  so in general it good work door to door is maxim experience
bad,No chance for advancement.  HR standards are ignored by departments in favor of unwritten hidden criteria.  You are expected to provode your own phone for company use.
bad,"Any job where you are working for commissions and does not explain how you will be paid UPFRONT is a LIE! "
bad,Doesnt care about employees mental needs. And play towards favoritisms to make the company look good. Hidden unethical steps to creating negative numbers to theyre score
bad,This company is all about keeping a warm body in the chair. I worked in the call center and was written up several times because I went to the bathroom before my break. I was also written up on my absence because I was sent home by my manager because I had the flu...remember my manager was the one who sent me home. I also needed to take some time off for a major surgery but because they were not willing to work with  me I ended up quitting.
bad,Work my but off for this company did not appreciate the service at all do you need to you are you getting laid off oh you can still find a job within the company yeah right that didn’t happen
bad,"I was fired in November for missing too much work to take care of my mom. They told me that if i didn’t want to be there, then they didn’t need me because they  are always hiring. They claim they appreciate their employees but they don’t care."
bad,"The people the pay, no one cares about you. You could die doing this job and they wouldn't care especially with the amount you get paid. Truly this job is a waste of time yes you may learn s new skill but it comes at a price that no on one should pay"
bad,"This place is full of drama, managers are young and immature and only white people get promotions. I worked here for over 7 years and gave my all to this company and all they did is take my credit for the hard working hours I put in and when I will ask for a raise they just kept saying they had to keep it equal with everyone else, knowing I was more reliable and took initiative than anyone else in my team."
bad,This department sucks. It sucked the whole 2 years I worked there. The department sucks. So do the managers & supervisors. You can do much much better
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I was supposed to start Training Friday Hired Tuesday, "
bad,Near 100% turnover in less than 2 month after training. 200+ agent and manager have little to no experience in a high volume call center. Everything in the bldg is recorded even the break room. Everything is the agents fault no matter what the issue was.  You get free cable with the job and 2 week vac the 1st year.  Your whole job performance is based on stats that no one in the bldg know how they are calculated.  No really.  Place look amazing on paper.  Talk with anyone who worked there.
bad,"In the mornings I would dread getting out of my car to go into the office. Much of the time is spent defending yourself. "
bad,"This place pays their employees really bad, they also will terminate without reason. I was let go for going to VA appointment by leaving early which I cleared with direct supervisor weeks prior then was told he knew nothing about it and because I left early I was terminated! Horrible job, terrible pay, took months to get all equipment and tools needed for job, had to use personal vehicle for first month on job"
bad,Had to go back and knock on doors that had been knocked on in last few weeks . People were sick of seeing you coming. Terrible place to work would never take a outside sales job like this again.
bad,"Leaders play favoritism, only advance in company if you can continually rip off the customers in selling them services they don’t need. Or overcharge them for services they already have. No life work balance. Management cares more about numbers than people"
bad,"Working in the billing call center... it was horrible. The customers are not nice and job task are pointless and management cares about your performance. You can’t disconnect from callers who are screaming, cussing, and belittling you on the call. You don’t get a break in between calls. It’s now stop back to back calls. In weekly coaching you listen to calls you have taking and your coach tells you how you need to be a better rep. I will never work for this company again."
bad,"Just very disappointed with the overall environment of this prior employer and most of the tactics utilized by management smacked of a zealous need to impune the employees at any length. Their ""goal"" was  to hire 10,000 people for the year, and not to keep them; oh that's the catch."
bad,Spectrum was such a horrible place to work I don’t even want to use their services as a consumer!!! Horrible staff in HR the training was the best part. Floor support is trash and God awful scheduling!!!
bad,"Lied to and told job will be rewarding career. Workload can be sometimes heavy, other times slow. Pay starts out okay but stays stagnant for rest or career. Progressions to get raises more like college courses and take up a lot of time. Must be completed during time off. Expected to work overtime,deal with rude customers, and put your safety at risk. Management is no help to get you out of a jam. Requirements and policies always changing impossible to keep up with"
bad,They hire everyone.  Stuck with groups of used to be homeless people.  Turn over rate is tremendous.  Urban culture needed to be able to work in that culture
bad,HR did not support work life balance for every employee.  HR would always favored the manager who wanted to discipline the employee.  No respect for confidentiality
bad,They punish you when you want to advance your career and go indifferent directions. Very very inconsistent on what they preach management and supervisors dont even know the job or what it takes to be a successful technician.
bad,Not only does spectrum care very little about it's customer base but it cares even less for it's employees. Since I've left the company every employee who worked with me is now gone. They only care for themselves.
bad,The store manager apparently knew the right person to blow... she was not the best fit for area manager but got it anyway.  I guess you can lie and steal to make it to the top!!!
bad,"Spectrum does not care about you at all. If you are a call Rep in the Tech dept your working conditions will be terrible. While you are working extremely hard sometimes taking back to back calls for hours you get the pleasure of watching the managers and supervisors do nothing."
bad,Stressful they make you feel like you are lucky to have a job so they can treat you  like you are worthless . You are not sure if today is your last day. Now that Spectrum took over it got worse. Job not secured. Please do your self a favor and look somewhere else . Supervisor constantly remind you that you lucky you have a job so they can treat you and make you feel  like you are nothing.
bad,No loyalty for ling term employees. Just want turnover. Management gets all the credit and the work sraff is filled with nothing but bullies. I would not suggest even applying...
bad,"Worst job ever! They do crooked things to customer and leave you to explain and make sense of it. When ultimately you agree with the customer , because they are a crooked company that preys on their customer and the end result is always...because they can! They are worst than a dirty cop!"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"This was not the best company I have worked for. I'd say a few people have good experiences with Spectrum, however, most are not experiencing pleasant days at work since they bought Time Warner Cable."
bad,The company needs to focus heavily on keeping the turn over down. They need to make sure the Supervisors are in tuned with their employees needs and address the issues and concerns properly.
bad,"Spectrum says employees matter but their actions show they don't care about employee loyalty, seniority, or have any compassion for employees to team build or cultivate any kind of employee relationships."
bad,"Do you like overbearing management with unrealistic goals?  "
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work here..They have no compassion for anyone you die they do t even acknowledge it. No support from management its about quantity not quality.
bad,"I worked for Time Warner Cable for 8 years and were bought by Charter Communications/ Spectrum.  "
bad,"I worked for Spectrum when it was Time Warner Cable.  The job was terrible, but I met amazing people in co-workers. Lots of pressure to meet the performance metrics. Customers were the worst."
bad,"There has been Managers to leave and not return. Some managers have no clue about some required metrics. You have managers calling shots who’s never worked in call center, has never taken a call. They require too much for what they pay. Things are always changing."
bad,"I am still owed around $3,000 dollars and i have yet to receive them, three months after my employment with Charter. The manager was very difficult to work with and constantly made derogatory comments against Hispanics and African Americans. To which i complained and was terminated as a result of complaining."
bad,"The sales leads are atrocious. This just requires every waking hour of the morning, noon, night, weekends 24/7. I never met anyone at Spectrum who had integrity at all. We had over 5 supervisors come and go and over 50 sales reps in a little over 2 years. If you have a complaint only use ethics point. The supervisors and HR appear to had zero integrity."
bad,I hate spectrum and the ignorance that comes with their customers... micro managers on yearly salaries that shows no helpful support for employees!!! Retail dictatorship!
bad,You get hired in these days as a dispatcher but in reality you are just the dumping grounds for what other departments do not want to do. There is no real dispatch there anymore
bad,I would not waste your time and apply to Spectrum at their RSC. They do not care about their employees or the hostile work environment. Every is held to different standards here. There is no communication.
bad,They tell you they care. Then abandon you. Management lie to cover up for their mistakes. They tell you one thing to your face then go behind your back and tell your co-workers another.
bad,"This is the kind of place where after a period of time( less than 2 weeks) you are given a test with 20 questions in 60 minutes. Passing the test is 80% or better which means you can only be wrong on 4 questions or get 16/20 correct.This means you can only average 3 minutes per question,this means reading the question,looking up the answer and selecting an answer and if you do not answer a question it is counted as wrong.Also the information is not standard IT or windows information that you can go home and study.This information is Cable Industry information.You are not allowed to stay after training class either.I tried 3 times to pass the test  and each time I missed passing by one or two questions.Also they change the questions each time also so you don't get the same questions every time either."
bad,Bad payout barely have equipment cheats customers out there money then expect the installer to make it right when its not nothing you can do if you dont have the equipment
bad,This is a horrible place to work they don’t want you to succeed do not provide help when needed do not train properly just not a good place to work period
bad,This is the worst company that I have ever worked for.  The sales department has horribly rude and incompetent managers.  Very disorganized.  A total nightmare.
bad,"Regional director is the start of the problems.  Employees are treated as number machines.  Personal relationships are discouraged and it is very cut throat.  I worked for the company for over 6 years.  "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I've never had a more incompetent management team. Unreal is a good word for how bad is the leadership at Charter.  This is a huge corporate behemoth that is as ineffectual as a company could possibly be, leaders and technically. The technical inferiority of Charter's network is made worse by the leadership failures.  Managers, Directors, and VP's alike all fail in their duties as leaders."
bad,"Management is horrible and so unorganized, and each manger has there own favorite supervisor. They would much rather belittle you about your work then try and help you. And then forget it if you try and talk to HR about anything.That will automatically put a target on your back from then on out."
bad,"i wasted 2 years of my life there.  I have a disability, I made it well known in the job application,, as well as the interview.  They are not set up in anyway to support HOH.  No matter how much I asked, begged, pleaded... their response was-- that I do not have the right to tell Charter what to do with their facilities...yes all of that is ADA illegal."
bad,"Underpaid, horrible schedules, decent benefits; but nobody stays because of the verbally abusive customers and uncaring management team. Parking is horrible and you will work every weekend forever"
bad,"Working for Charter(Spectrum) as a Retail Sales Rep was one of the worst experiences of my professional career.  Leadership was pushy and unrealistic of all the job consisted of and what was expected of us.  They were constantly implementing policy to inconvenience the customer and in turn us as employees.  They are going to a 7 day a week, 2 holiday a year schedule in the near future and that is not ideal for anyone with a family.  I rarely felt like a valued employee or that they ever appreciated my hard work and effort.  The commission structure is a joke and not fair to the sales reps.  The base pay is laughable as well.  Please don’t apply for this job.  I worked for them for 4 years and it was mostly an awful experience!!!"
bad,"Not recommended job is too much for not enough pay, expected to preform more work than paid for, always adding on unexpected job functions that originally applied and hired for."
bad,"relaxed workplace "
bad,"Horrible place to work, your just a number to them, don’t waste your time, find a better job, there isn’t one good thing to say about this job other then they give you a company truck until they fire you"
bad,"They hold commissions for no reason what so ever. When you question them they say they are looking into it and stall. Then they will tell you they just do not have to pay you based off leadership decisions.  The service is garbage outages every other week customer service is a joke, they set you up to fail.  I was one of the best in the country then I couldn't take these garbage practices so I left."
bad,"The stress doesnt come close to the pay. It is not worth it. The management is extremely poor, the way they talk to you is questionable. Your sanity isnt worth what you're day to day will be. Stay far away"
bad,Never been so degraded in my life by customers. Dispatch and management doesn’t care about what you have to say. Really only writing this to save everyone the trouble and not to waste their time.
bad,"didn't like it the manager was very dishonest , i wouldn't recommend this job to anyone , until tim is removed from this office , no upside not enough opportunity for growth"
bad,"No work balance, unable to advance management is poor. They are micromanagers who do not care about employees or customer. Run away from this company or do not work as a field tech"
bad,Training was long and did not meet the expectations once released to the core floor.  It was like being thrown to the wolves with no support.   Management would not answer questions and the support instant message took was no help at all.  Very stressful
bad,I worked for this company for almost a year and got let go yesterday due to a first offence safety violation. Management sucks HR sucks dont work here
bad,Laid off from this company with zero warning and the assurance from VP level that nothing would ever happen we wouldnt know about during the time warner shift o spectrum.
bad,"If you enjoy forcing people into packages they can't afford or mislead them, then this is the job for you. Enjoy having supervisors who don't keep up to date with changing policies, force rules on you that not even they follow, and honestly have no clue what they're doing boss you around."
bad,This is by far the worst company that i have ever worked for. Especially at this location. Management sleeps with agents. They allow SMEs to show nude pictures on women to other agents across the floor and HR did nothing about the situation other then to get mad at the Victim. They harass their agents. Managers talk down to their agents. this company is a sexist. they treat male agents better then women. and they have issues with keeping the restrooms clean. the production floor has roaches and bed bugs as well.
bad,Metrics expectations were ridiculous ...t..completely unrealistic. Management was non-existent. Communication and staff suppose was never available. One of the worst place to work.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Worst company. Treat employees like a number or robot. Management is horrible. Pay is not enough. Environment negative.. Think twice before involving yourself in this melodrama company.
bad,"Not job security, doesn't pay you for the work you do. Constantly implementing new policies and procedures that they themselves are not sure how they work. Extremely stressful work environment."
bad,Pay always changing the jobs they give u is not enough and the travel is not worth it u have to work too much to get a good pay not time to spend with family no paid time off
bad,"A typical day of filth.  The hardest part of eating your food is with utensils that are weak.  Trash is everywhere, workstations are filled with dust bunnies, vacuums are uninitialized and carpets need to have stains lifted.  The most enjoyable part is eating at the Smokers section outside.  The safety is even worst where there are no emergency exits--you are trapped with the Ghetto people inside and no safety with the crazies on the outside."
bad,Spectrum is the most stressful job that i have ever had. they are all about metrics and not about the employee at al/ I f you do not meet their metrics you are on their bad list and they will write you up for anything and everything
bad,"Age discrimination rampant. Horrible mentality and working conditions.  Taught to lie about services purchased.  Nothing was normal, lied about horrendous working hours and then giving great hours to the people  sitting next to me and others"
bad,"A typical day would have leads, call people ask them if they want stream or choice, beg and plead with the customer to get that. Go into coaching where they nit picked all."
bad,The attics in the summer are 140-160 degrees or more. You will start to melt and rethink of why you got this job. The free cable is not worth it. Plus supervisor suck too. They only care about numbers.
bad,Been in the business for close to 20 years Spectrum was the worst to work for out of all the companies that I did. TCI Adelphiia TWC. They just do not care for their employees all you are is a number to them. Their expectation is to get the job done fast but you better hope you pass TQA. I would never recommend anyone to work there
bad,"Worst experience of my life. Avoid this place at all costs."
bad,The company is a giant bait and switch they hire you in telling you one thing and every change that is made makes it even harder and harder to make money and they don't care for feedback at all and are not receptive to what thier employees have to say this job is 12.98 plus commission be prepared to live off 12.98 a month and lie to ppl on a daily basis. Apply elsewhere it's a huge lie 80% of ppl leave in first few months... And for good reasons
bad,"Doctors excuses are not acceptable as an viable excuse for illness because as the department manager stated ""everyone knows you can buy a note off the street"""
bad,I have never hated a job more! They scam you into working here under false pretenses. Then you get the job and they want you to scam people into buying services presented as free trials. The managers are horrible!
bad,"Very insecure job , very low base salary, benefits are good but the unrealistic goals and unethical and lack of knowledge of the people working in management positions. I have strong experience with communications companies and as far as si know the FCC is a very strong regulator but this company acts like, “there is no FCC OR EEOC”"
bad,You're overworked and under paid. You have a bit of freedom with this job but your pay isn't close to what other companies will pay. You do get to take your work vehicle home.
bad,Hated it! There is no culture or moral. Working here makes me feel like this is what prison would be like. Terrible place! Do not choose this place unless it’s the last option you have.
bad,Management need to improve and learn not to stress out their agent and to treat them fairly and to also have value for their long time working employees  and appreciate their hard workers instead of stressing them and to also stop playing with their commission money
bad,"I worked for Spectrum for over a year and nothing ever changed. The supervisors are messy and juvenile. It’s a gossip center instead of a call center. Spectrum allows customers to disrespect you, call you vulgar names and curse you out. All you can do is hold the phone and take it because anything else will get you fired. This company wants your soul and your spirit in exchange for free cable service!!!"
bad,They have 6 weeks of training that is a joke. You don't learn anything. Human resource is horrible. They will lie constantly.  Never keep there word. They don't communicate with workers. Put you on a team separate from your management
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"The turnover rate was very high when I worked there. It was an organization that was highly micromanaged, so if your revenue was not at a certain level within two hours of arriving to work, your supervisor would want to have a meeting about it."
bad,"Stay far away from Charter if you can, the management has no clue about the demands of the tech positions. They give you deadlines that you won't be able to meet unless you work yourself to death."
bad,The training was a waste of time due to the fact they didn't teach me the must important thing that was dealing with migrating customer from Time Warner to Spectrum..  Changes happened quickly and unorganized.  If you love stress this is the place.  I believe the score card given aren't based on employee it's all based on circumstances outside the control of the Rep.
bad,"Prefer not to write a summary. Inbound call center. Prefer not to write a summary. Outbound call center. Call center environment. "
bad,Constantly get the response from support staff with coment that is not my department and u are asked to do more but when u need to have the more fixed do to errors in systems that are thrown together overnight and products that are not working on a day to day basis
bad,"not a good place to work, they have clicks and your either in or your out. they will promote people who do not have the skill and less time and education."
bad,"All was well until sudden A push in directives , the morale in this place has gone to the dump , how can anyone focus if they dont feel their job being secure ? We all walk on egg shells and management is poor ."
bad,They will fire you for the most mundane mistake ever and call it malicious. They treat new employees like gold and kick veterans to the curb like they're nothing. I hope they fail
bad,"The day to day business model was to keep angry customers and  how to make each customer who was already upset with the service pay more. Any loss of service, even if not your fault is counted against you and drastically effecting your commissions."
bad,"If you enjoy watching permanent people go to conventions and take PTO when you can't because you are a contractor, then this is the place for you!"
bad,"Really high turnover rate no on last more than 3 months, that's all you need to know. Save yourself especially if you are a women or minority, stay away."
bad,This company is downsizing it’s sales work force in Van Nuys and in Culver City the sales decision is moving to North Carolina it was leaked out to me while on the sales floor they are terminating employees for any little thing they are finding reasons as to terminate searching for ways to fire their employees in order not to pay the severance pay once they ar moving and terminating people a call center of about 250 I’m Van Nuys has reminisced to 64 in a matter of a year they are not going to be here much longer they are not hiring for sales in  ca they are moving to North Carolina
bad,"Management plays politics and shows favoritism, not a great place to work at. I wouldn't recommend to anyone, you will be overworked and underpaid. Lots of stress and it's not worth it, they don't care about their employees at all."
bad,"From day 1 working with Spectrum/Charter they were disorganized with documentation. No one would give directive as to where to find documentation and don't dare ask anyone because management will tell you not to communicate with other departments. Management, Directors don't have a clue how to run a corporation that is successful. Don't expect to get anything done at this job because there are too many road blocks in the way. Unrealistic time lines when they do want something done but don't give you the support or tools to accomplish anything, just another way they get rid of employees."
bad,"It was ok then TWC came in & now it's just terrible. Took our good shifts & now get stuck working late or through lunch but it was supposed to minimize ot. We are given bad cheap equipment to install if we can even get it. They have really gone down hill & average employee is around just months. Bad supervisors & even worse managers, no one takes responsibility or fixes anything. Even holidays off you may have to work, they just don't care or only about shareholders. Hopefully you can hire some of them. New motto ""you don't like it quit"", so I will asap."
bad,"I worked for Charter for 14 years, as a senior Manager I saw upper management take advantage of employee's all the time. Its a ""my way or the highway"" at Charter, don't like the policies Quit they would say."
bad,"The management was not very good.  She micromanaged every project, but seldom did any work herself.  The pay was not good and they made you do the job of two people."
bad,"A typical day involve taking inventory of sale items. Clean and prepare stand with all inventory items. Prepare food for cooking-popcorn, pretzels, and hot dogs, Take temperature test during cooking for proper temperatures. Account for cash through cash room. Assign tasks for employees. Maintain clean, safe stand throughout game/event. After event closes, clean and sanitize for next game."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,when I had an opportunity to work for spectrum I jumped on it they bring you in they say welcome to the family but there's really not a family it's very hostile unfriendly unfair and very unprofessional when it comes to training they more or less leave you on your own and a dispatcher is kind of push you aside it's set up for failure
bad,Rules constantly changed. You were forced to change your schedule regardless of what you have going on in your personal life. Job was not worth the pay at all.
bad,you would spend the full day doorknocking. 90% already have Charter. When you find the ones that don't you sell them. You don't get paid to they install. When you are ready to hit you target for the big money your install gets delayed so you don't hit the big payday.
bad,"Where can I even start. Most stressful job I ever had. I was a billing agent. Needless to say I was yelled at and cursed out every single day. We were never allowed to hang up, even if someone went off on you and threatened to kill your family. All you could do is get a lead on the line. Everyday you had to find a different seat to sit in so you could never get comfortable. They tried to make it seem like a great job by giving you food sometimes, but all it did was making everyone there overweight. Worst part is, they never converted my account to an employee account so they shut off my service. After weeks of trying to get them to backdate it because I worked there, no one ever did a thing and they sent it to collections for something that wasn’t my fault. They should have converted my account to an employee account. You’re forced to throw away integrity and straight up lie to customers. While the company steals money by lying and never giving a fair price."
bad,we took inbound calls to charter for sales an billing issues. the hours at first were good but to meet there standard for sales was challenging. cause depending on the hour of the day depicted the type of callers.
bad,"I'm sorry but this was a horrible job. I was totally mislead. you had to hit a certain amount of installs to get paid, and it felt like they would hold back your last few installs. Then they would install at the beginning of next month so you wouldn't hit your bonus."
bad,"working for Spectrum was not a positive experience for me. It was a controlled environment, and the manager I had was lazy and blaming and never wanted to be responsible for her actions. It wasn't a good place for me."
bad,"At Spectrum you will be treated like a number just like the customers. "
bad,"Absolutely horrible. The pay use to be good but its just not there anymore. The leads suck, the commission structure is the same however  it is harder to make sales now because of Spectrum's mission to keep overcharging customers and soliciting them to buy things that they do not want nor need; so that alone sums of the reason of why pay is just not the same. If you take a job at Spectrum than you will be setting yourself up to live paycheck to paycheck GUARANTEED !"
bad,"We all cringed when the public would ask ""who do you work for?""  They have a horrible reputation for doing anything about their poor poor customer service ratings."
bad,You receive 8 weeks of training 6 classroom 2 rookie row and its on the phone and metrics are very unrealistic. You have a very difficult time if you need help you have a lead and a supervisor in your team but you are told to only ask questions in group chat dont even think about walking up to your sup or leads desk. Half the time they ignore you and when they do respond its as if you are bothering them but yet you are expected to reach your quality and all other metrics. If you ever get a call requesting a supervisor you have to explain over and over why you need a supervisor because they dont want to take over the call so then you handle time and hold time goes thru the roof. Overall a very stressful place to work and i am so glad i left
bad,"Literally the worst place you could choose. I worked for one of the chat sites. I did not get paid nearly enough for the abuse that I endured from customers. I was fired after almost a year over one word that was used in the chat. The customer asked for corporate number. They fired me because they claimed that it was considered an escalation, though it was not posted in any document or poster around the center containing escalation situations. I got no warning, no write up. Just fired. I had never gotten into any type of trouble with the company and my stats were all in the green, above what was expected. I passed about 90% of quality checks and maintained a 95% average attendance rate. But that didn’t matter to them! They’re business tactics are twisted and wrongful. Just look at the B.B.B cases. Save yourself the stress. They don’t care enough about employees  to make it worth it."
bad,Management does not communicate with techs only with other managers. The open door policy means the door is open but nobody listens or care enough to fix anything thats wrong within the company.  And the only system that works there is the Good Old Boy System.
bad,Spectrum was the worse company I have ever worked for. Theres low moral. Management doesn't give a care about you or your problems. You're just a number.
bad,I worked at least 60 hours a week and was totally taken for granted.  I was the only supervisor in my department that knew how to do my job.  I was constantly called for outages after hours and on weekends.
bad,This company has completely unrealistic expectations for what employees are supposed to accomplish in work day.There is absolutely no work-life balance at this company. I have never before seen a place with such high turnover of employees. Employees are not valued and are taken advantage of in my opinion.
bad,"Just as an example, they have had about 20-30 retail reps hired and left in a span of 2 years. You better not make any mistake while here because they will hold on to that and if you seem like you will be a problem in the future, they will use that mistake to fire you without any corrective actions. The education level of management is laughabel. One can just browse their linked in profile and will get a clear picture of their 'qualifications'. "
bad,"In training they got you pumped and excited for a long lasring supportive career there but ince you are out if training they act like they don't know you and you should never go through any personal issues while there. Spectrum should be your only concern. They give you all these personal, sick, and vaca but look at you side ways if you take 2 days due to a family/personal matter. The customers were spoiled & horrible and the support system was not there as far as being able to feel comfortable enough to voice grievances. They expectations to constantly perform put on unnecessary pressure on top of troubleshooting programs that constantly went out."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Company is not upfront about a lot of things. As a DSR you travel everyday some times hours at a time. Clawbacks are brutal and the $2,500 bonus that was promised when you get hired is not actually guaranteed."
bad,"We employees have to take the Brunt and I-ll-will of so many people annoyed with their service and the truth is, Charter/Spectrum really and truly doesn't care. It's a rooted in basic corporate greed. I am so glad I got away from there. Everyone that works there pretty much HA TES their job."
bad,Worked in excess of 60 hours a week just to complete assigned duties without assistance of other departments just to get scope of position completed. Poor senior leadership is an understatement. Do not plan on this company as a retirement option.
bad,"Time Warner was the worst place to work.  Management treats you horrible, hours are bad.  For please supervisor and above you work 16 hours a day and get paid for 8.  No thank you no help and your to blame for everything.  Would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,Long thankless hours. Poor management.  Very high personnel turnover.  Angry customers. Bad dogs. Bad weather.  Very dangerous work environment.  Internal politics.  Insane HR policies.  Impossible work requirements.  Vehicles are rambling junk.
bad,You as a front line agent have to take on all the responsibilities of management. The advancement opportunities are talked about but never there it seems they hire external leadership only. You have to work a ten hour shift with only two different schedule options.
bad,"The training people are amazing but then you are thrown to the wolves. If you don't sell you get reprimanded, the pay isn't worth the stress and the working environment is horrible."
bad,"This company sucks . They are anti-union . Local 3 has been on strike for 21 months , management refuses to negotiate a fair contract and they hired replacements for all the workers ."
bad,There is a lot of driving involved in this job. There is a lot of technical things to be fixed. The schedules change. I would not recommend this job to people.
bad,treat employees extremely unfair and there is a great deal of favoritism.  the company continues to operate as if it is a mom and pop company in a centralized location
bad,"Our jobs were removed to only say reapply if you want the job back. They did not keep you informed of what was going on in our department. The pay was not good, and neither was the benefits. The commute was long."
bad,Treated me like garbage after someone came in my lane and hit me head on . They acted like the accandet was my fault. And eventually got me to quit because of the fear of driving
bad,"Horrible atmosphere. stadium seating with the managers looking down on you like they are better than you. not conducive to promoting teamwork."
bad,"Call center was closed, and relocated."
bad,to be honest it was a nice little gig man i cant complain at all . just th enviornment wasnt really for me in my opinion and im kinda tired of doing these reviews in all honesty
bad,Customer Service in the cable industry is one of the worst experiences ever. You constantly encounter unhappy customers whole at the same time being expected to upsell them services. $13 an hour in NYC does not pay the bills and only adds to the stress.
bad,"Prepare to get pulled off the phones 3 times a week. I was ranked in the top 25 out of 226 sales people and I was constantly belittled and pulled off of phones for minor things. I had enough 1 week when I got pulled off 4 times! Yes, 4 times! I always was above quota, aht was great, and always received great surveys. Yet they will pull you off for the smallest things. I was the 4th person to quit off my team in 2 months. Also, you have some veteran agents at Spectrum that were around during Brighthouse who are on a different commission structure making 4x what you are making. Also get ready to do cold calling on down time, calling to existing customers upselling them."
bad,They started hiring anyone right off the street and it killed all critical thinking. Cared more about butts in seats instead of a quality work force. But that’s how power stays at the top. Hire people that don’t have a clue.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Do not work here unless you want a short term job that abuses you.  If you lie a lot, you'll make some money until they're done using you up.  If you are an honest person who cares about other human beings this place will grind you to dust."
bad,Like the job did not get along with supervisor. They did not supply me with tools no uniform From the beginning and gave the tools I ordered  Away to  Other associates. kept me out of loop On what was going on with the company and all the changes. Gave me all the old equipment on my totes kept new equipment for themselves and coworkers.   Nepotism runs rampant  within this company
bad,"A typical day at work is an 8am-5pm, some days I could complete 6 -8 jobs. What I learned is that productivity work better than quantity of jobs completed.There is no team work in Management. The workplace culture is diverse."
bad,"The only good thing about working at Spectrum was the free cable services. The pay was not good, calls were always in que, you were always getting yelled at by customers for things that were out of your control, even though you schedule a service tech to come out for an install or problem and ask that they call before arriving, they hardly ever did so the customer was never home and then got irate because they had to reschedule the appointment. couldn't take time off when you wanted it."
bad,If you want every second of your work day micro-managed criticized and love to be berated by management then this is the place for you. It is just cable and they push you like your selling life saving drugs. New hire get the worst schedules and you will start with a shift that goes to 1am and no consecutive days off. They don't even give you free cable your still paying for it.
bad,"Time Warner was my first job out of college. Spectrum took over shortly after."
bad,"If you want to be a slave and be treated like your stupid and supervisors rather fire you than help you, or get shouted at by the customer for horrible service? Then this job is for you."
bad,"This was a very sexist company. I would not recommend working there. Executives are constantly making inappropriate comments. Only the women seem to get fired. This was not a collaborative work environment. The company did a terrible job merging BHN, Spectrum and TWC."
bad,"Typical direct sales schedule was six days a week, with morning meetings in the office and then field time from 11-8pm. Aggressive sales techniques expected with unrealistic sales goals."
bad,This company puts near impossible work schedules on its employees without any regard for family or health. The amount of stress caused by near impossible deadlines is ridiculous.
bad,"Since the buyout of Time Warner everything has went downhill. Even the micro managers are being micromanaged. No direction on real workplace problems, no support for the base employee, and dont expect to make a living wage here."
bad,"Administration is lacking. They say one thing one week  and then expect another the following. "
bad,Do yourself a favor and look somewhere else. If you have any natural talent or ability it will be wasted here. Spectrum management is concerned with their bottom line and nothing else.
bad,"This is one of the worst companies to work for. "
bad,I worked there when it was Time Warner.  although the had great benefits and paid well there was a constant turn over problem.  The management didn't respect anyone below them.
bad,"They bring you in with Promises of making great fortunes and the potential is there if you're that one person. One person in the past 10 years has made the number that they're talking about but that's the number they give everyone. they tell you you're going to spend a month in training and then a month of on-the-job training and then you're going to be on the floor when in reality you might be an on-the-job training for months and months on end. You are not a person to Charter Spectrum you are just a cog in the wheel.  "
bad,"Don't care about employees, management incompetent, focus is sales only, unattainable goals cable industry losing ground, horrible, burn out place, only good thing is medical benefits and possible free cable svc."
bad,Don’t know what to say about it but I don’t want to be a bad person I was the top employee for a good while and had health issues and they fired me long story short
bad,"Worst job I ever had. Completely toxic work environment. Oppressive management via ""metrics"" you are required to meet.  Every 2 weeks you get a talking-to about how badly you are at your job and I'm in the top 15 of 500!"
bad,I do not agree that the company has the best interests of our customers.  They do not make decisions based on feedback from those that are face to face with our customers.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,The horrible management style comes from the top down. Unrealistic goals are given with no support given by the departments to reach those goals. Be prepared to be make magic happen out of nothing.
bad,its sucks period. No time with family. its always the techs fault. Company will not own up to it's own errors and draw backs. They lie the the customers saying the tech can do this and that
bad,"Extremely high stress. Many large changes that are very close together. Too close to adjust. Management does not care about employees as people, just thinks of them as emotionless cogs. Rampant sexism and racism in terms of trying to advance in your career. Absolutely no help or assistance for employees with mental health issues."
bad,This was a good place to work until 10/2018. All of the accounts have gone to prepay when they sign up at the door. That means you have to collect money on the spot. This is near impossible. People do not want to give you money on their door step at 9pm at night. The hours are horrible. they are from 1pm to 9pm at night 6 days per week. I have had guns pulled on me and have been run off of peoples property due to knocking on their door 2 hours after dark. This position is begging for an employee to get injured by someone knocking on their door at 9pm. Your drive time is also not included and I have a 2 hr drive time one way to my territory. I leave the house at 11am and dont get home until 11pm and the majority of time without a sale due to the new prepay policy. Stay away from here. A bunch of empty promises that changle like the wind. You can do better than this bottom of the barrel position.
bad,Work place is not professional manager does not know how to speak to tech there no accountability the tech are unhappy Human Resources can’t get answers to simple questions
bad,"all i can say is run from spectrum, cause they are waiting for you to screw up so they can fire you.  Managers will ask you to do unethical things like add start to a customers account without the customer knowing, so the supervisor can win a trip to Hawaii.  When you don't do this, you make it on to their radar and they wait for you to mess up the smallest thing and you are gone."
bad,ok so they are very petty and they have a culture of having your job hanging in the balance the moral is very bad here due to the fact that its continuously micromanage their associates on every level
bad,You only get 2 shift up bids a year and you have to rank high to get it also the good shifts are taken by the lifers so the shifts for bid sucks. And also if they create a new shift who ever gets hired last’s gets the best shifts so your stuck.
bad,The tech support in san antonio blue crest lane is back to back none stop long 10 hours day manger play favorites and  just sit down at their desk and eat all day dont really see why they are there. They would pull people off the phone when there 150 calls to do something eles. Poor communcation
bad,"Unfortunately, SPECTRUM is a dog that won't hunt. "
bad,This company does not care about there employees and how they affect there life and family. The pay is not worth the work you do and the abuse you take from customers on a daily. I would never choose the company for anyone.
bad,Their motto for their employees should have been DO MORE WITH LESS. The expectation of their employees is almost impossible. Call after call after call consistently all day!
bad,"Was great with Time Warner, Spectrum doesn't care about anybody but Spectrum, They doubled everyones bills and then do nothing for anybody  Supervisors are jokes that spend most the day filing their nails or watching you tube videos"
bad,not enough info to rate. was with Time Warner cable for most of the time. Time Warner was great but I am not sure about Spectrum . Just worked under the for awhile
bad,company does not care about customers anymore. they only want their money. I lost the passion for the company and would rather work for....AT&T!! and that is blaspheme
bad,"If you are a pretty female and you get a female sup, you have to understand you will become a target. They will try everything in there power to get you out the door. It don’t"
bad,From the  recruiter I dealt with to the management everyone was unprofessional and seemingly unqualified to be Fry cooks at BK let alone be in positions of any kind of decision making.
bad,"Lie, cheat and omit are the foundations of what Spectrum/Charter promotes to their sales people. I am embarrassed to tell my friends I work here. Reps are always being assign training modules which completely contradicts what really is demanded my management."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Only apply if you like doing multiple positions at once, if you can be a customer service rep and complete task at a very fast pace and dont mind non stop job threats and a separate but equal office settings, this is the place for you"
bad,"Go see the movie Sorry to Bother You before considering this job. This place is like Regalview, the only difference is the employees in that movie actually knew something was unjust. This company has come into aggressive leadership requiring mandatory overtime, and an impossible commission structure. Sure, they will ""SELL"" you the idea that a lot of money can be made, however the hoops you'll need to jump through will pale in comparison to the EVEN MORE STRINGENT hoops they will roll out next week."
bad,Not a great place to work. Who you know not what you know. No room for advancement of.  They hire outside instead of promoting within the company. Pay flexuates. You never know what you will get paid.
bad,"Same as ESM. highly stressful environment. I tried to keep employees happy and have fun. Fast pace, they cared to much about procedures, and not about people. Poor manager."
bad,Alot of favoritism. company makes lower paid techs do what the higher paid techs are suppose to do with no pay difference. Its just a horrible place to work
bad,"This company has sinking ship written all over it. They brought me on as a contractor, then lied to me about the wage, and cut my salary in half when they hired me full time."
bad,It was the worst job I have ever had. They used every way possible to steal commission from you. The customers would yell at us most of the time. It was awful.
bad,They don't care about their customers or employees.  The customers are always irate about high bills. Every customer  is angry.  I will nit recommended this job to anybody
bad,Do NOT believe anything remotely positive they tell you about this company when you walk through the door. The hours are not flexible at all. you only get 2 weeks for vacation the entire year and all they offer for bonuses is food. They even lied to their existing employees about pay being raised to 15 dollars an hour only to tell us it would be by the end of the year and then to find out the increase is actually the value of compensation meaning what you get for free w/ your regular hourly rate. Good company I think not.
bad,I do not like that job thay act like you dont have a life all thay wont us to do is work with no day off 7 days a week and no time to speed with my kids and family its stress full if u take a day off it 4 points then thay wont you work 12 hours a day
bad,Accounts Payable is micromanaged to death.  Bad managers.  Will not promote within unless you are favored by upper management no matter how hard you work.  Would advise anyone looking to work in AP to find a different company.
bad,horrendous expectations and required to work 6 days a week and 12+ hours a day with no protection for workers. would not wish this upon my worst enemy
bad,"There is nothing good about working here. The culture is terrible, leadership does not support you, sales representatives treat you like you are beneath them...leadership wants robots to work for them. Not people. They do not care about you AT ALL."
bad,never working here again - not only is the outside customer service terrible but that culture is rampant on the inside. Could have changed now that it's Spectrum but my time there was terrible.
bad,"I never work for Spectrum,at all. I do not know why they are asking me these questions. I worked for Time Warner and I left before Spectrum took over."
bad,The employee is overwhelmed with constant changes in process and expectations. management only cares about numbers. The customers are almost always irate. i enjoy my coworkers and doing a good job.
bad,"my typical day at the office included getting yelled at by many customers, and my upper management not caring how I was treated. They only care about numbers, the reason I have been there as long as I have is the people I work with are amazing."
bad,"I worked the late shift"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Technicians need to be paid 20+ an hour to deal with the nonsense of customers and homes. For the work u do the pay is not enough. Working in a hot attic crawling around in insulation is not worth 13$ an hour
bad,The average employee is utilizing the EAP program and seeking outside counseling within their 1st year of employment. (Advised by a hands on counselor)
bad,"poor company     "
bad,They no longer provide the tools or access to resolve customer issues.  We are advised to listen to the customers to a point however we have to have the customer off the phone in 3minutes or less
bad,"Spectrum is the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of working for. I worked for Time Warner Cable for 8.5 years before Spectrum took over. I absolutely loved my job with TWC. I was always looking for opportunities to move up and TWC had mentors and partnered with people that wanted to do that. The medical benefits were great. Then Spectrum took over and positions that I had been ""promised""no longer existed. The benefits were awful. Then they started moving people (not me) to different departments and closing those departments (laying people off) only to reopen under another name and hire ""their own people"". I took a package as soon as I could leave. Spectrum cares nothing for its employees so I left."
bad,Poor management. Little to no communication. Impossible to move up through company. Employees constantly hired and quitting. Expected to up-sell all customers even if what you are recommending isn't good for the customer. Other companies that sell Spectrum products tell lies that you have to tell the customer about when they call in screaming.
bad,This job is not what it cracked up to be. Has a lot of favouritism and the supervisors are very unprofessional. High School antics. People steal food.
bad,"Managers force you to do many things to advance there own interests and do not care for the well being of the projects. Managment will step all over you and treat you less than dirt. It is not worth it, find a job that will treat you like the perfectional you are."
bad,"Terrible job, first off when I got hired. I had to talk to this lady about my schedule she gave me a bunch and before I was even able to say which one I wanted she gave me one 4pm-1am. I should’ve said no to that. That’s was my fault. Training is great to be honest! The issue is when you get on the floor, I don’t know about any other teams but mine was god awful. First of all we have an average handle time that needs to be 9 minutes I think(?) but when you’re on a call and need help and you put in the chat that you need something (fireaxe, Prd, cmts) things that a LEAD or SUP can do and some tier 2 reps. It would take forever to get a response I remember I needed a prd for the first time during my ptr time; no idea what it was but I was told that only a lead or sup could do it so I went to my LEAD and told her that I needed that and she was like “only a lead or a sup can do it go ask *mentions 2 names* and they can help you” I had no clue who those people were but umm why could you not do it? Long story short it took me about 20 minutes to get a 10 second program ran for the customers. The lead did nothing but talked all the time. Everyone from my training class talked about how much they loved their teams and I’m just there like..... good for you. My supervisor was terrible as well, not the fact that she was gone all of the time because being a supervisor I get you have meetings and all of that but what's the point in having a gross nasty attitude? Just awful truly. My ptr even told me that when she found out that she was going to be on that team just to help me she was like"
bad,treats their employees unfair I'm on strike since 03/28/2017 my family and I have been through the rocks and back because of this company poor and selfish management
bad,Micro managing call center that did not allow you to get everything you need done during your work hours. The order process was not streamlined or organized. Irate existing customers because Charter gave better deals to new customers instead of existing.
bad,"I cried every day leaving this job. They promised a great experience and lots of money. After training, I was given horrible work hours and the job was not what was explained in the interview. Do not work here."
bad,"This is not a place to work at if you are looking to stay for a long period of time. If you need a job now, its ok but I would continue searching for a better job!"
bad,"Would not recommend this place , very fast paced , always on you for sales , when company is mainly equipment swaps and retention . hours very , hard to manage day care ."
bad,They do not care about their employees even a little bit. All they care about is stock prices and subscriber numbers employees are disposable to the corporate people running things
bad,This company did not value their employees. once their merger went through they completely threw us to the wolves. Laid us all off. they did not have any benefits that was remote decent for an decent price. Time Warner ensured us that we will all keep our jobs instead 5 departments shut down. very very hurtful.
bad,"A typical days work is log into your phone and take calls nonstop until the end of your tour, sweat shop mentality, extremely poor customer service, if you provide quality customer service you will probably be terminated for performence"
bad,"Poor management, commissions are always being questioned. Hourly wage is low compared to other competitors. Incompetent co-workers and management, you start losing brain cells working here. Stay away from this company!!"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I worked for Time Warner Cable for years before the merger and loved it. Since Spectrum took over its absolutely terrible. We lost 15K per year, work 10+ more hours a week, goals doubled monthly and we generally get treated like garbage. They replaced all management with terrible people who were brought in to terrorize us. Every day we were ridiculed and belittled by every step of management. Not only that, my job was sales, now it’s strictly customer service. Spectrum no longer allows us to lower anyone’s bills so all day we are slammed with people screaming at us and we can’t help them. We are told to tell them to cancel for 31 days then come back. It’s terrible and disgusting what they are doing to their customers. I put up with it for over a year and eventually one day I just walked out, I couldn’t do it anymore."
bad,the modern day equivalent of working in the coal mine. I have never in my entire life worked for a place that is so negative day in and day out if you want to remain happy search for a job elsewhere.
bad,"Very unpleasant to come to work every day the customer's were always rude, yelling, cussing and the manager did not coach you on anything give you feedback on how to handle the situation and then they decided that they don't like you and make up lies to fire you"
bad,while working at Time Warner it can be very stressful. I would suggested that whoever would like to sit in a cube all day to make calls to customers about the company promotions and so on. TimeWarner is the job for you.
bad,I very stressful job . Selling procedures keep changing to make sale other then to save a customer.I happy to find thi to help me with strength in selling.
bad,"Logging onto work station computer requires multistep procedures. Policies do not give us much to work with to help lower customers' bills. Extremely frustrating when customers are on a fixed income and cannot afford the price hikes that this company pushed on them.  Certain members of management act cold and snobbish when you try to greet them.  The only good thing about the job, is the pay."
bad,It’s very simple. RUN! Run the other way very fast. It’s a very negative micromanaged environment with unprofessional and inexperienced supervisors who make matters worse than what they could be because they have no people or management skills.
bad,"This job was worst than a nightmare, worst job Iever had.. Hate every minute that I work there. Best thing of the job was speaking with great prospects and existing customers.  Main reason I left was due to lack of management experience and integrity when coached and forced to sell a customer the highest and more expensive product than they qualify for. My Supervisor and his manager known each other from working on a different site and would do anything to compromise agents integrity and not do what was in best customer's interest in order to gain their trust, instead they were all about making them pay more. Understanding that it is a sales environment, no agent should be force to lie to any customer. Remember we are all consumers out there."
bad,"At the time I worked for TIME WARNER before Spectrum acquired TWC. "
bad,The management and the training is not what that put out to be they don’t give u the right training and u get in trouble when u reach out for help  and wrote up
bad,"Under Time Warner it was an excellent place to work for. Union wages, pension and medical. Plenty of room for growth. You was treated fairly based on your hard work. After Charter took over so did Corporate Greed. Unachievable metrics started that are used to discipline employees, reduction in medical with higher premiums, elimination of guaranteed pensions, reduction of personal hours. Instead of doing the job right managements only concern was the numbers for their reports and not the customers."
bad,"You will get terminated for the least little thing, you can be easily replaced so they have no problem getting rid of you and finding someone else, if you are late, you get a point, if you call off, you get a point, there is no sick time you just have to show up for your scheduled shift, no exceptions. They said if you on your way to work and you meet in a accident and unable to come to work, you still getting a point"
bad,"door to door, probably the worst place to work at in regards to compensation. don't recommend anyone to apply. unfortunately management is completely disconnected from reality"
bad,Spectrum is survey based you will get fired just because a customer failed your survey. No job security whatsoever or much benefits. Can’t get to comfortable at spectrum as they hire large groups every 3 weeks
bad,Time Warner Cable was a great company to work for. Charter/Spectrum was just horrible. They turned a technician who loved his job into one who hated his job
bad,"I hated this place, once charter took over. They froze the only real reason I was there for and that was the pension in which that was the first thing to go."
bad,This job was a huge waste of time. Spent 3 years working with terrible management and teaching myself how to do everything. no upward mobility. company is trash.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Since spectrum took over, majority are blacks and there is discrimination towards white males! The management is absolutely horrible, rude and undesirable to work with. It is a very stressful place to work under such supervision. You aren't able to express your opinion and you do not get any opportunities for advancement or promotions!The choice is always yours."
bad,Started out great but after acquisition of Time Warner it all went downhill.  The currently management defends and encourages bullying sales representatives and managers.
bad,"The worst company I've ever worked for. Treat employees like cattle. Want you to just ""shut up and do your job"". When any concerns about management are brought to HR or management you are told ""you can find a new job if you are unhappy"". No attempt to retain good employees. Let you know their policies and their work is more important than employees."
bad,"if you have nothing good to say...then,,,,,I didnt work for spectrum it was time warner at the time but its probably no different. Glad to be out of the sales rat race of cable sales."
bad,Doesnt care about employees .corporate greed . Company expects you to do things you werent trained for . Blame techs for bad service when the problem is there equipment and network.
bad,"This place use to be a good place to work. Unfortunately, due to Charter taking over and some new management it's now a trap atmosphere set up for failure. The job titles are constantly changing for no reason, and management never has a clue what is going on. It's very disorganized and very unprofessional. The good thing I will say is they have great workers who look out for each other, but this company as a whole is lacking in leadership and fresh ideas that make sense. This extends to the way the customers are handled not just the employees. I would not recommend anyone come here. It went from a professional organized environment to a call center of unprofessional behaviors and gossip banter."
bad,"Not a comfortable working atmosphere. Too much demand on unrealistic goals. The way of motivation is through threats and intimidation. If you're not meeting the goals, you're immediately isolated."
bad,"The hardest part of this job was realizing that beyond the 5th sick day that you were given disciplinary action by being suspended for a day without pay and no appeal, but that's what happens to the lowest people on the totem pole in the TWC call centers. TWC is no longer in Houston, but I'm sure nothing has changed."
bad,this Job needs to be over hauled to take care of the needs of the client and to services them in a great manor. training the staff is a big plus in my book.
bad,"Where do I begin? "
bad,Never what was promised during hiring and training. You have no control over your commission and you work for over 3 months before you see any real commission. Supervisors constantly stress you out over your numbers when you are not making them which is always because 90% of the calls are not sales call. The whole sales floor employees are complaining but management is not listening so they are constantly losing good employees and so they are constantly hiring.
bad,I worked here before it was Spectrum it was Time Warner. I knew while I was in training that I couldn't make this a permanent career choice as it was not conducive to my home life balance. I made it work until something better came along.
bad,"technicians has been on strike. Spectrum refuses to sit down and settle the strike. All we and asking for is job security, health benefits, and a pension plan."
bad,Time Warner Cable was a great company to work for.  Good pay good atmosphere.  However when the company changed to spectrum it became a horrible place to work.
bad,I don't have anything  to say about working for this company.. I worked for TWC so all my comments would be for them. The company started off good to work for then went downhill. Put in 12 yrs.
bad,"No assigned seating working as a billing representative in a call center. Every call was one issue or another and most were escalated. A lot of Spectrum customers are in very rural areas which translates to a lack of understanding basic math and prorated billing.  Last manager was the best one I had, but over all a weak management team."
bad,blah i have nothing to say and i dont feel like having to do this  review.  it used to be a good company. charter bought it and ruined countless lives. Took the heart and soul away and they are blah.
bad,They don’t care about their reps.. they literally told us this care about shareholders and nothing else. They make us lie when selling to the client. Save your self the trouble and go elsewhere
bad,"Where to start, I have been with the company 4 years in business class where it was supposed to be green pastures. However with the merger with charter restructure came swift and unseen. I generated tons of revenue and business for time warner cable along with many loyal employees. In addition, they strategically let vets go just because they get a high payout and hired new people to pay them very little and half the payout on commission as well. I get it o the higher ups and CEO can profit. However if you go into business class your wasting your time with little pay very high stress and people get let go every wk for no good reason. At least all the loyal vets. I am glad I do not work here anymore best thing that ever happened to me. Now I have an amazing career with s great company. I will never recommend anyone to work here, I will do I can to spread the word as well to not choose spectrum of ever work here to everyone I know. There downfall will not be immiediate but just like AT&T saturated and employees with a high turnover and underpaid. In closing, don’t even bother working here it is a huge mistake and you will lost you time and life will not be enjoyable anymore. Worst company out there to date."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Pay was really good. But the hours were terrible never saw my family never worked at a call center before didnt know what i was getting into. Cable customers are worese than pawn shop customers
bad,"de l'esclavage de rookies."
bad,Never knew is you were going to get fired. Supervisors never available to speak to unless you were being told your employment was under review. you would get told one thing to avoid getting in trouble and after you would be reprimanded and told that what you did was wrong and that your employment was under reviewed and that you were possibly getting fired.
bad,"Spectrum pays their employees terribly.  Average of 14 dollars an hour and they feel this is competitive salary.  I am guessing they take into consideration the benefits they provide as part of the salary, which honestly no one buys.  For the load and the demands expected on this job it should be at least $17 hour or more."
bad,"When time warner switched to spectrum we got the shaft, they completely changed how we were able to do our job and cut our throats on territory. the company sucks."
bad,"All leads are generated by managers and leads are distributed by who is the managers favorite. Unfair. The managers pick who makes money and who don’t. Big turn over. They are always hiring because of unfairness "
bad,The shifts are terrible and all of management sits around and gossips about the staff. The shift bids are done poorly and the pay is terrible. They don't care about their employees
bad,"When I first started with this company they were Time Warner Cable and  Fabulous, but then Charter came in and bought Time Warner Cable out and everything that was great is now gone. I went from making 4,000 take home to barely making enough to pay bills even when I dropped everything down to just my basic needs, when I asked about it they refused me an audit on my sales from 2 different managers and then they blamed me and my performance and had no good explanation as to why I took such a bad hit on my pay.They lie to their employees promising they would make more money and that no one had to worry about losing their job when the changes into the new company were happening not only did ppl lose money from their checks but they have fired a number of ppl and now have closed the department down as of the 4th of January. There are employees ur own co-workers that steal ur sales and take ur money and the company does nothing to stop the problem or punish those who get caught doing it. This company doesn't care or respect their customers either.This company shouldn't even be in business let a lone would I recommend this company to any one for a job or services in fact ppl beware this company is awful to work for you wrk here at ur own risk."
bad,"$1300.00 Sign On Bonus!!!"
bad,stay away.. its a scam. its a scam. its a scam. They'll lie. Dangerous place to work. they wont pay you. almost everyone that you'll be hired with will be gone in less than 2 months
bad,"Nothing good to say about Spectrum when it was owned by TWC, thing may have changed. Nothing was the same for each employee, treated differently it the manager liked you."
bad,"horrible place to work and to top it off they brag about a new buiding, but the stupids didnt have enough sine to build a parking lot, so theres no parking for 250+ employees."
bad,"Working when it was brighthouse,  training on the job was none  which is sad because u really need it.   when you start youo get the horribly shift worked all weekend,   u have to cross sell to every customer,  so if they call in screaming and cursing you have to be nice and you are suppose to carry on a conversation ???? and you have to up sell if not they fail you on call quality"
bad,poor info. distribution. mgmt. disorganized. pay unreliable. co. manipulates call volume to negatively impact rep bonus payout. unfair advancement opp
bad,No career advancement.  Management was terrible.  They only cared about the company and not the employees.  Everyone is depressed and never happy.  Only enjoyed the discounted cable service.
bad,i wouldnt let a dog work for spectrum.  It is a homerun company and the managers take all the work and leave the crew with peanuts.   had pay issues with checks being late or not there at all.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work at spectrum cable. before the merger it was awesome, and after it felt like they made ways for us to be miserable. People that have worked there for years have been seeking other employment. That should tell you how the department is ran."
bad,there is a good chance it could work if you're into sales i didn't do such a good job at it i didn't know how to sell every single day but i sold a little
bad,"This job was brutal.  Extremely long hours in Austin heat.  Supposedly it can be a good way to make money if you know what you're doing, but in order to figure out how to do the job well you end up needing to train making nothing for a while."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Field technicians went on Strike and they are hiring inexperienced people to work there.No career advancement .No benefits for working family or pension
bad,Spectrum should pay for pension and honor people who build the company.GEO made over 99 million dollar and they can not pay a pension for worker for a better future.
bad,Management has corrupt metrics that will not let you progress - in the old days it was alot easier but now that they want the UNION out of the company - they are looking to write you up on everything on this aging system that they have in NYC
bad,"I absolutely hated this job. I would dread going into work everyday. I was hired for customer service and they push sales down your throat. Granted, I worked there when it was TWC and not Spectrum. Not sure if things have changed."
bad,"Spectrum is not what time warner cable uses to be."
bad,"If you are not aisan or local, You'd better not do anything wrong!!! There is no room for error, mean while trainers can make racist jokes, use fowel lang, and make sx jokes to emp, But because he's filiPino chineese, a blind eye is turned to him. No reprimand, just an explanation of Oh this is Hawaii we joke about everyone's race here..Or Oh that's just B,he just a silly local boy, he so funny!"
bad,"Terrible treatment from customers, have to be a glutton for punishnent, your life is irrelevant to them, your only need is to answer the phone and be robot without a mind of your own"
bad,Company was great when it was TWC now that Charter has taken over there isn't a sense of direction and customers hate our guts. Unrealistic goals and there use to be a CAP on commission. Company takes more than they give.
bad,took phone calls from customers and tried to fix their equipment or send out a service call. it was very competitive because they always wanted you to sell something
bad,"if you like working in a place were none of your feedback is taken, you are told to adhere to policies that make no sense and you are told to give your customers terrible service coated in a smile, this is the place for you"
bad,Terrible period they treat there Techincan like garabagethey took away our pensions and medical benefits and now they want us to pay for our own benefits
bad,I cant answer this question honestly. I was employed by the previous owner and not under the current regime. This shouldn't be a required step. I dont feel comfortable answering
bad,"Time warner cable used to be a nice to place to work, where i could see myself growing into retirement with. Now it is run by spectrum cable and they have no regard for their current employees who have been on strike now since april 2017"
bad,From 2008-2015 it was a great place to work. It HAD Great UNION benefits and great pay.  Now they are taking away pensions. An 8 month work dispute will never end.
bad,"How do we provide clarity about what they are working toward and how it contributes to the success of the organization"
bad,Spectrum is a horrible work place environment.  The CEO made 98 Million dollars and still wants to take away from its workers who built the system. Technicians are still on STRIKE after 7 months fighting Spectrum's Corporate Greed
bad,"Excluding the last manager I had there the management was terrible. while they offer a lot of vacation days good luck getting any day off unless you put in for it at the beginning of the year. Little application for employees. with meaningless benefits like free popcorn/snacks. no respect for employees time(i.e you must clock in on time, but they do nothing to ensure you can leave at your scheduled end time.) "
bad,Left over labor dispute. This is a union busting company. Would not recommend this company. Worked here for 27 years and the next thing you know you are out the door
bad,I learned how to repair cable tv. management did not care about the employees. I would not recommend working for this company. the hardest party was determining the codes.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Extremely disorganized. Compensation is lower than average. Many benefits aren't available until after one year of employment. "
bad,Poor management and leadership skills. Very demanding with no reward for good work. It apears that they DO NOT care about their employees and customers
bad,"You must be willing to endure any type of weather conditions. There is no sympathy for absenteeism during harsh weather conditions even if you are a family oriented parent."
bad,"1800 workers still on strike since March 28 ,going on 7 months with the company starving the workers out and the CEO making 98 million salary thats $47,363 per hour, so if you think their giving you good salary look again."
bad,over worked and under paid. Its commission based and unless you want to work your life away for not enough money then go ahead. If you don't care about being under appreciated by your company and customers then go right ahead!
bad,"I don't know what this is for.  I am not filling this out, because this is not correct information that the computer thinks I have worked at Spectrum.  This is not accurate."
bad,horrible place to be the customers are verbally abusive and there is no protection for the reps when dealing with customer like the the other departments uses retention as a dumping ground for matters not related to our job we have to take disconnects when ppl take there equipment back to the store even though it it policy for them to disco the account when the equip is taken in we have to take the hit and that effects our pay
bad,this company should look at the people that work for spectrum as human an not a number it might help to increasing profits.  The way its going its not going to be successful.
bad,"Not a very fun job at all. Horrible hours, have to find and sit in a different seat everyday. Male supervisors are bordering oharassment. Overall unprofessional"
bad,They only let you move up based on who you know. They allow customers to curse you out and you can’t disconnect the call. They also don’t pay enough .
bad,very strick care about money not employees epecially the ones with health issues really strickt not family oriented did not understand of those whoe had diabeteis or other issues at hand it was the job or nothing
bad,"Since the company has been bought out, this company has gone down the drain. Would not recommend working here. The only thing important here is numbers. They don't invest in their employees anymore."
bad,"After the merger, there were no vision from above, where is the company heading? No communication from above. So my interpretation was that I had to make numbers and number = $$."
bad,Spectrum does not care about you as an individual.  Everyone is there just to get a pay check.  Because they don't care every good employee is forced to find better work environments.  I remember their facilities always being nasty and the people they promote should not be promoted and were never held to the same policies as everyone else.
bad,"Do not apply, do not have anything to do with this company. I worked for them for two years and was a star agent, never got offered to move up, then scratch = gone . They make you take half lunch on busy days whenever they choose, the sups don't know anything to actually coach you, it's just be nicer next time or your not nice enough. The managers only manage themselves, they never talked to us, never or encouraged us. The best thing about that place is the sign. Cause that's all they care about."
bad,"love working with clients "
bad,"High stress, lack of communication from leadership, no room for advancement, slow tools/computers. Unfair performance metrics. I was proud to be a brighthouse employee, now I don't even mention where I work.  Your expected to keep calls very short while making sure you, solve customers issue, educate customer, keep low truck rolls, make sure customers don't call back but make sure customers are happy or it affects your performance metric. They have gotten rid of multiple departments, very little room for advancement... employees are all very stressed to the point most end up with health issues. I would not recommend this job to anyone. Again very high stress, high paced job, low employee morale.  Constant change on protocols.  Lack of information, you can ask a question to leadership and get different answers each time. Job security is very low."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Did not work for spectrum worked for Time Warner Cable who did not offer enough advancement opportunity, nor did not offer retirement pension plan.and was not family friendly."
bad,company take over and nobody survived. Bright House was fantastic and I would still be there if not for the take over. I was One of the last employees to go because of my worth to the company.
bad,It is a very difficult job.  No flexibility anything to do with them..  They are not competitive and priced way to high.They do not care about their customers or employees
bad,Unfortunately I signed a document as part of my severance package that forbids me from talking about Spectrum.  Let it suffice to say I'm not a fan. We'll leave it at that.
bad,"Unable to advance, poor schedule for those that work hard. Poorly managed, salary and benifts are terrible for the work you do.Training is sloppy, due to management. Managers do not listen."
bad,"On strike unfair labor practice "
bad,Spectrum created a very bad relationship with Union workers. No contact and no pay increase. Manager treat worker like their Slave. increase work load and decrease respect.
bad,Worked in the dispatch department regulating field technician productivity by streamling routes through the utilization of wfx software. Fast pace changing environment
bad,"There is no break in sight at this job, whenever you get a very upset consumer they almost refuse to take an escalations. Useless management that likes to sit on their butts and get paid for it instead of helping."
bad,"Time Warner Cable was a great company to work for and I loved the competition. Spectrum appears to be a company that is looking for a government bailout or to file bankruptcy.  In Albany NY, the top sales center in the company, over 60 people have left because of the pay cuts and bad company policies. Management sends out ""company policy"" emails and then retract them the next day. No consistency in management and they are all in over their heads.  It is truly sad...."
bad,spectrum does not care about you or your family they will just use you and when your no longer good to them your gone. when it was before charter TWC was way better with employees .
bad,Spectrum is the Worst Company to come to existence and should not be in Business due to lack of management experience in cable industry. They are Liars and cheaters and do not respect their Customers nor employees they are only concerned in their Greed of money and doesn't bother them if they destroy businesses or families as long as they get their blood money. That is the Goal of the Ceo and upper management. Whatever they over you they will take away with interest so do yourself a favor and save and save for life and Career for a different Employer!
bad,"Stressful environment, poor medical benefits, lack of advancement opportunities, sudden changes, lack of communication by leadership, fluid environment due to merger of Time Warner Cable and Charter, policy changes and job responsibilities often change with little warning."
bad,"I did not work for Spectrum, I worked for Time Warner Cable.  I am unable to rate or speak on company culture, rate of pay, training, policies, day to day skills needed."
bad,worst place to work for does not value its employees. no career path management has no education.  No consistent practices set in place took a huge pay cut on commission.
bad,"theres a class action law suit against them, they had the employees work off the clock and didn't compensate for the time they worked off the clock. every year your pay decreases. The management micromanages and its a super stressful work environment."
bad,"I was laid off, so nothing good to say.  The work that 12 of us were doing was passed on to about 50 people for them to do.  Plus, we had to train our replacements!!!!"
bad,wonderful people and environment. very focused on customer relations and experience. Always designed some or the other challenging and motivational events.
bad,"When Spectrum came in, they changed the commission payout structure. With Time Warner Cable I was making close to $70,000 a year. I will be making about $25,000 less this year as a top salesman for Spectrum. They also introduced a cap for the commission. Before the sky was the limit, now you can only earn up to a certain amount. So if you hit your cap, whatever you sell afterward, you earn NOTHING FROM THOSE SALES!"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"incompetent onboarding team did not start background check until day before start date"
bad,"I have learned much about technology working here. Every day a new policy or procedure is implemented or updated. Management is poor, at best. There is not much concern for employee well being, attentions are focused on the numbers. There is a lot of turn over. The hardest part of the job is meeting expectations set forth without the proper or functioning tools being provided. The best part of the job is the discounted employee services benefit."
bad,Worst place to work to stress full no help from management. But the pay is great and the co-worker are not friendly no room to grow in the company. Na
bad,"when I first joined this department I was making great money, commissions were amazing and the atmosphere was great.  Over the last 4 years upper management has destroyed everything we loved about TWC. Unrealistic goals, 60-75% drop in commissions, bully tactics on managers & Sups, no work/life balance what so ever. You might be looking to get in but everyone in there is looking to get out.....FAST"
bad,They do not care about how you work except that they want the worker that is willing to work for less pay and no benefits. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you are willing to sell your soul just to get some money.
bad,They are currently over working everyone management is running around like a chicken without a head. You cannot call out sick you will be fired NYC is one of the toughest environments to work under especially when dealing with angry union workers that want there jobs back. Very intemidating I don't recommend working for this company at least wait until the strike is over.
bad,"CEO was making 98 millions on 2016.but The company cut off a lot of benefits like medical, pension , employees discount..... , also they layoff a lot of employees. Charter also start with internal fighting. They are using micro management to make a lot of employees working stressful, Charter is still using very old technology . the fast speed is 300 download. Please look at fios google fiber ...! Charter need to wake up . They need treat employees and customers better !"
bad,had a one year agreement once buyout from time warner completed/ was closed that same month/ had a uniform change and made everyone buy all new clothes the month before it was closed as well/ just amusing
bad,easy company to work with. room for advancement. Great supervisors and they are ready to assist. Great place to work and OT pays good. They have different departments to work with.
bad,I worked for the company when it was known as Time Warner Cable. Per my choice I spent very few months as an employee of Spectrum. When the merge of the companies initiated spectrum forgot the importance of the employees and were extremely disorganized.
bad,"I have work 18 years with TWC ...but since they sold it to charter..spectrum ...the work is bad ...in a tech and now they require us to meet this impossible metrics ..and if you don't you will get fired...they don't want to give us a rise....they said we're over pay,..no pension...the started salary is almost minimal pay...it a joke ..the management is a joke...this company ....charter ...is a cheap...company...the love to fired people...and. Hire young kid ...with no expirence at all ..and do a training in 1 month...must of them quit in less the a year ..because the pay is bad..."
bad,Hostile work environment. Extremely high turnover due to heavy handed management style. Sales support group was just opposite of that. Poor process and focus which lead to 300% turnover in the short time I was there
bad,"Anything good about working at Time Warner Cable was lost when it was sold to Charter. They killed creativity and the culture. All decisions are made by top leadership, which means everyone else is just a worker bee."
bad,rules change every day. the place is based on who is the persons favorite. also since the new owners took over the place has become non welcoming. i would not recommend to friends that they go there for work
bad,"good pay, not very good management period. in this job its nothing but favoritism. they don't care about a person just the company itself. don't work for the dumb company"
bad,"Treated employees like machines and had no interest in getting to know employees."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I've worked for this company for over 10 years, It was a great job at one time but now its become nothing but corporate greed. They try to make their employees feel helpless, take away every benefit they have and funnel money to the top of this multi billion corp."
bad,"Repetitive job sitting all day answering phones, backache, headache, swelling of both feet, could not sit as long as I had to.  Had to see multiple Doctors."
bad,"No opportunity for advancement, the pac dept was treated as a seperate entity, raises took to long to be implimented management was of no assistance nothing nore to add"
bad,A lot of people have come and gone in my tenure. They hire in droves and then let go a lot of people just before the 6 month mark. They will have met the number of employees by the end of the year they promised at 20000. There will be no permanence for any major number of people. This is also a reason prices are going up.
bad,"A typical day at work means either 0 calls or being forced to work additional systems taking up to 60 calls while your neighbor kicks, back and relax."
bad,"They will definitely remove you from your children's lives in the blink of an eye. The pay is good and you think its worth it until you've missed 5 soccer games , missing tooth and a ton of other moments"
bad,"I am a 20 year veteran in the cable industry and worked my way up to sales manager. When I came back as a direct sales rep it amazed me by all of rules being broken and trainers telling new employees how to cheat. The manager dint listen to the employees and held them responsible if the installer dint get the install done due to weather, if he dint show up, or if they couldn't get it all done at one time. My job was to close the deal it is the companies  responsibility to get the job done. They dropped the ball consistently. The Director of sales dictated to his employees and dint listen. The sales managers had little or no sales experience and were from the technical department. It was unbelievable.  My boss had me train new sales reps all the time because no one else wanted to do it. No extra pay and no reduce quota while I trained them. In January I slid down the steps and fractured my ankle. The company paid for hospital bills but terminated me because I couldn't make quota. They hounded me about my winter coat but it was cut off on the emergency room table. They dint beleive me. They had an all out shake up and a lot of people were fired for falsifying documentation. The manager knew about it but they dint say anything because they were making there bonuses.   RUN! RUN! Run as fast as you can away from CHARTER!"
bad,Under no circumstance would I ever working for time warner. They are unprofessional and ever since they switched to charter they pay way less and the commission sucks. Only work here as a last resort.
bad,"The company has no value in their customer base or supporting agents, the majority of the representatives treat their positions like they are in senior year of high school and they are allowed to do so with little accountability."
bad,"They are horrible!!!!! They shipped me to California with travel pay and all and when i got to California they didnt give me the job, that i interviewed for in Florida (they told me to come)  and i ended up homeless because they sent me 2700 miles away and just abandoned me more or less.  I will NEVER work for a company like this again.  They ruined my life"
bad,The job is miserable. Its run by corporate flunkies and high school failures. The company is more concerned about warm bodies in seats than quality of employees.
bad,There is no support. They are only looking for warm bodies. Super high turn over. Dishonest to the customers.No tools. No car allowance. show up and Hope.
bad,the job isn't the best in the field . Id rather find employment else where because they do not value hard working employees nor are they looking for long term employees
bad,this company is the worst place to work the management is rude and unhelpful the environment is bad no direction no coaching broken promises no flexibility nothing the supervisors are rude and unprofessional when
bad,I had got a interview with them today and I came early 20 mins like the interviewer said and  they had me wait a hour but the lady who worked their that gave me a tour was nice. when they interview you they have three management people that who interview you at once and make you feel uncomfortable with crazy question. worst experience ever.
bad,The workplace culture was competitive. I didn't enjoy the lack of care from management. One positive is that they prepared me for the career i currently have by giving me strong customer service skills.
bad,worked with them when it was time warner cable it was so terrible management was the worst. impossible to move up and pay wars lousy
bad,"Since the merger this company has become the worst place In colorado to work. Benefits suck. Almost no commission structure now.pay isn't worth the stress. No job security. The customers you speak with are the worst I've ever had to deal with ."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,I learned how to resolve customer concerns. The hardest thing was dealing with ignorant unprofessional management members. I enjoyed all co workers and the incentives.
bad,Currently working invalid rejects for commercial phone provisioning department. Enjoy working with my co-workers with great teamwork. Everything learned was on my own self-direction.
bad,Once purchased by charter the whole company went down the tubes. Work day includes rushing around from job to job hoping you do not mess up and get a repeat or you barely get paid for the month. Climbing poles is unsafe with equipment they use. The vans are old and rundown. Management was terrible and refused to fix my truck more then once.
bad,I am not pleased with the commute. The overall job description does not interest me. I don't feel like the job challenges me enough.
bad,"There is no organization in the sales department. It survives by limping from crisis to crisis. There is a very high turnover, even by call center standards. Management is in constant disarray due to the blatant refusal by supervisors to follow the rules, or make their reps follow the rules. There is no room to advance, as the call center is extremely small, and management positions are few and far between. The best part of my experience with this company was the training."
bad,Its a boiler room atmosphere.  Training for inbound sale reps is not informative and a waste of time.  TWC has a high turnover rate and therefore not a career oriented company opposite from what was told to me during my initial interview.
bad,"This review is written based on my experience as an inbound sales agent at the Akron call center for time warner cable. After my experiences there I have no issue in saying Time Warner Cable is the absolute worst company I have ever worked for. Between being ordered onto a medical leave of absence by an HR person (illegal seeing as only licensed physicians can order medical leaves), to not being paid for said medical leave even though I was told I would be (even have the paperwork given to me when I was put on the medical leave documenting that I was to be paid during this leave), to them changing the length of a commission cycle so you don't earn the money you worked for. Because of all of the above and more I have no issue saying that Time Warner Cable was the worst employer I have ever had the misfortune of working for. Worse than any other employer I have ever had, hands down bar none. "
bad,A typical day consisted on begging customers to keep the service. I learned that there were a lot of television and internet competition. Manage were ok at times very unprofessional. The co-workers were very stressed. The hardest part was trying to get customers to keep the services when their minds were already made up. They found better deals and TWC wasn't willing to compete. There wasn't anything enjoyable about the company.
bad,"I go to about 9 different homes each day to fix there "
bad,I was very fortunate to be a part of this company.  I learned so much and was very always very pleased to be part of the industry.
bad,"Time warner cable, by far one of the most unethical companies I have ever worked for. Where do I begin, this company is revolving door every month of new hire classes because the job is stressful they fire the reps that have been there a long period of time for frivolous things or they push you out! There turnover rate is 80% they will tell you otherwise to get you in the door. They say when the nice young lady gives the tour around the call center "" that its a family atmosphere! No it's not. They will say anything to get new hires in. They are not loyal to the reps that have been in 2years or longer they will look for ways to get you out! Management picks favorites. Forget about being promoted on how hard you work it's all by who you know and who you kiss up to! There equipment is awful they will not spend the money to update their infrastructure constant outages more so at the end of the cycle when your suppose to get a bonus, they will find a way to get out of paying you're bonus. It's always what you do incorrectly, nothing you do right! It's always the reps fault they take no responsibility for anything. In order to survive here you need a degree in reverse psychology because their constantly blaming the reps for what they can't fix as a company! Maybe put money into the product that you're pushing down our throats to sale, or fix the equipment so customers can actually enjoy the service that there spending 200+ for then maybe the reps would see it beneficial to say that stupid robotic csat closing! You have to beg a customer for a satisfaction survey, because TWC and corporate"
bad,"I have worked for time Warner Cable from 2007 until 2012, and I have to say  this is the absolute worst place to work! The worst job I've ever had. First, let me start by saying that they have excellent health insurance and benefits. That is it. This company expects you to give everything you have and gives nothing in return. The company is badly mismanaged and the employee gets treated with no respect. I started as a customer service representative and then they pull the rug out from under you. Next thing, you're being forced to sell their products, meet rediculously high sales quotas, perform technical support duties, act as a retention agent, all without any increase in pay or lose your job! If a customer is abusive, you can not release the call. You just have to put up with nastiness. Verizon allows you to warn the caller that you can release the call if they are being insulting or verbally abusive. Management is verbally abusive too. They expect long hours, short breaks, and the pay is awful for the abuse you have to endure. All the time I worked hard there, I left with only a 2 dollar and hour inceease in pay. They dont reward hard work! I wouldn't encourage anyone to apply for a job here! They laid off hundreds of people, top executives included! I enjoyed a job at a SUPERMARKET after I got laid off more than time Warner Cable! Apply or take this job at your own risk! Take it from someone who's given 6 years of their life. No one should have to put up with this!"
bad,"Knocking  doors "
bad,"Too many unqualified people in management which creates an unprofessional, unhealthy work place.  Broken furniture and broken policies make for a bad situation."
bad,"It's a difficult job, so team members support and encouragement is very important. If your team isn't working well together your day can be very unpleasant."
bad,"Very corporate, no personality whatsoever, would not recommend anyone choose Charter as anything more than a temporary position to make ends meet."
bad,working in the upper side with snobby customers was not a preferable job option but I had to deal with them. fast paced environment
bad,"TWC is a key player in the CATV industry as well as telecommunications."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"You walk around with scanner and pick orders. The scanner will tell you where to go and what part to get. They hire the most unmotivated,lazy workers and expect you to work 58 hours a week. Every Saturday. Management is suppose to give you a review in 90 days but won't. It is the worst managed work place I've ever worked at and I've never seen a place have a part time HR who just isn't there."
bad,There is no where I would like to be less than time warner cable. My boss was actually sued and settle a sexually harassment claim. She was quote possibly the worst human being I ever met and they kept promoting her and protecting her.
bad,the company hired like 20 of us told us it was full time postion and then came up with excuses to fire us all at the same time on the same day
bad,Worst company I ever worked for. Was there for 2 1/2 years and was frequently advised to mislead or all out lie to the customer
bad,Decent place to work in a town that has nothing going for it.  Traveled for this job and hated every moment of it. Pay was good and commission was good.
bad,hated working here. worst job I ever had. management dosent care about their customers or try to help out the customer.blah blah
bad,not very organized. insufficient training poor managers. very confusing place to work. one hand doesn't know what the other is doing. no one takes responsibility for there actions
bad,"I don't want to write a review on this job TWC is a great company and pays very well, unprofessional working site, fast pace call center and everyone does thing different no one is on the same page!!! if as customer calls in twice per day they would get a different price every time!"
bad,We had a meeting in the AM to go over what happened the following day. We also discussed what we need to do to succeed. And what are plans was going forward for potential clients.
bad,"I worked at Comcast for over 7 years in Fresno, CA averaged 70k a year. Relocated back to Southern California due to school. Worked at Charter for 6 months making peanuts compared to Comcast. I left Charter to work at Dennys when they raised sales quota from 10 to 12. Due to Charters poor customer service in the past, most potential subscribers I have encountered hated the company."
bad,"Management works against employees not with or for them. Long hours, too many jobs in one day to get home at a decent time. Absolutely no support structure."
bad,Horrible place to work really do not care about customers only care about money not a stable place to work frequently move people to other office far beyond a fair travel reason steal money out of ypur checks .... please dont wate your time the managers suck and will throw you under the bus at any given time
bad,Time Warner Cable is a company that cares solely about the business and not at all about the employees needs. As long as you are selling and making money for the company they are happy. The minute something goes wrong in your personal day to day life they will look for any reason to let you go.
bad,"Bad Management all they care is about numbers and goals don't care if you quit or get fired, you get 5 chances then you get fired and they pack you a white box with all your stuff so everyone could see that you got fired.  No job security and bad work place to work!!!"
bad,"I worked my tail off for this company and didn't get much in return. Pay was low for as hard as we worked. Management was lazy. Overall it was an alright job, if you don't mind pulling weight for those to lazy to do their own job."
bad,This company is going down hill and has been for quite while. The company culture has changed. Management is under pressure to perform.
bad,The manager is RUDE! They do not treat employees with respect. Other employees gossip about coworkers all day WITH THE MANAGER. Overall a horrid place to work at.
bad,Company has no respect for its employees and is all money based! Lack of interest in its employees and their health and welfare!
bad,"They will sell you a dream job, and double your income, only to then when you start training realize you're making 11.00 an hour for the next 5-6 months, the training program is horrid, they fired their best trainer KT, hope you're out there doing better now."
bad,i enjoyed with the kids and in the end i was so attached to many of them. I still see some of them in their high school lives and a lot of them still keep in touch with me
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Not much to say---CATTY women, everyday people play the race card, whiny technicians, whiny employees, whiney managers, no teamwork......could have been the department I was in but I wasn't interested in working there just had to pay the bills"
bad,"call center job, complaining customers, stats, glued to the phone all day-bad schedule-work holidays-mandatory shift bids-back to back calls-customers are all angry. if you need money and stable hours, then this is the place for you."
bad,"Daily and weekly changes to procedures and policies make it difficult to take a day off or vaca time.  There is little to no support from superiors and floor leads.  While some customers are pleasant and friendly, most are irate, irrational and belligerent.  If you cannot adhere to rigorous rules, constant change, and screaming customers, this is not the job for you."
bad,This company is the worst to work for they do not care about the employees at all they only care about putting money in their pockets. They make the employees lie to the customers to keep their business which of course just causes more problems once the customer realizes they have been lied to. The management team looks for any reason whether it is legal or not legal to fire employees and immediate supervisors will go to HR and lie about employees if they do not like the employee so they get fired. They work employees long hours and try to get away with avoiding paying overtime to employees that work more than 40 hours in a week by coming up with off the wall strategies to work the system. The only plus is the employees because everyone is in the same boat unless of course you party in the bars with the management team and immediate supervisors then you can get away with anything and get the best hours and best assignments.
bad,ACS was the worst call center environment from dirty cubicles and nasty managers that think they ruled the world.
bad,Management is incompetent and not qualified to lead it is a place of if you scratch my back and brown nose me I will advance you.
bad,"I have had 18 job interviews within the company and got none of them.  I really truly believe that the choice was based on gender, ethnicity and age, period."
bad,"Not much I can say other than it is a call center and you have to ""work with"" the general public calling in about stuff that is broken.  Keep in mind no one calls a company to say ""hey you are doing an awesome job""."
bad,"Not willing to work with students, even if they know you are a student before getting hired. Management has a I don't care attitude with how they interact with agents."
bad,"I would never want to work there again and would never recommend working there to anyone I cared about. "
bad,"I worked for Charter for less then a year. The training you received was bad and they are changing policies and procedures almost every day with poor training for the changes. The supervisors that really care to help you are far and few. The expectations on the sales floor change frequently and I believe they do this so people commissions are low. When you do speak to management about problems they have a way to turn it against you and never address the problem.  While I was there I saw people leaving or fired as I was and the turn over is high. When they finally fired me they were rude and did not care what happened to me as they have done to others. "
bad,"Back to back calls constantly, very little support, unrealistic expectations, penalize your pay because you use the restroom. 1/10 do not recommend"
bad,Politically charged unattractive culture that pushes unreasonable deadlines for products.  This often means products are delivered with tons of defects.
bad,The Charter Contact Center in Louisville KY is one of the most micro managed messes I have come across in my 20 years in the corporate business world.  They are more focused on controlling their workforce than they are about providing quality service to their customers.  This is reflected by their employee turnover rate of between 80 and 90 percent in the first 2 months. Add in that the location of the center insures that employees are unable to go anywhere during lunch or breaks which means they are effectively prisoners.  Unable to use cell phones or even their own computers unless they are specifically at their job there is also no phone access to employees without getting preapproval from a supervisor thus eliminating any incoming emergency calls for employees with children.
bad,"Then this is the job for you.  Management is very poor, and there is an extreme lack of leadership.  There are many complex systems upon which you utilize to perform essential job duties - many of these systems you self learn as training for the job doesn't fully dive into all functions of these systems."
bad,"I had worked there for 9 3/4 years as a technician and every year of employment things got worse.  Management here is a joke and any concerns or issues you have always fall on deaf ears.  This company cares zero about its employees and only about lining their pockets.  All they do is set you up for failure and then come down hard on you when you don't ""meet or exceed"" your monthly goals which are completely unrealistic in the first place.  If you want to be treated like dirt then this is the company for you.."
bad,"job lacked in team work, management was poorly trained and did not care"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Selling Charter all 3 lines of business on a daily bases. Main goal to sell was their triple play gold.
bad,I do not wish to comment on the company.  Great company to work for.
bad,"This was a very tough job and management made it a horrible experience.  Dog eat Dog. "
bad,answering phone calls and selling time warner cable products
bad,"Very Demanding"
bad,i hated this job more than any other job i've had. Time Warner service sucks.
bad,"There is not good coaching available. Upper management offers no constructive encouragement, only negative. The good phone calls go the the favored reps."
bad,fun and exciting... always learned new things about products and services...love working with people....best part about working is making my customers happy.
bad,Really bad company to work for it seems this company is devided into three different companies. Technicians don't do the work right customer service doesn't have a clue about DSR offers. The CEO and marketing department are a joke. Charter technology is stuck in the 90s. Base pay is a joke nothing good to say about this company it really sucks.
bad,"They pay like pennies, and want you to do multiple jobs.  This is a dump.  Worst than Walmart."
bad,"My day at TWC is pretty much cleaning up other peoples messes. Someone didn't put in a w/o right, or they told the customer the wrong thing, and instead of being honest, lies and then waits for them to call back, knowing it's impossible to get the same rep twice."
bad,A simply awful place to work but it provided sustinence for the time being.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job at Charter was working with the more difficult customers. They always presented a challenge because they were very upset and in their mind, initially there was nothing you could do to help their situation. It made me feel very good to able to turn an irate customer who is ready to walk away from the company into a customer who is singing praises. The hardest part of the job was knowing that you were not able to help everyone and come up with a solution that economical for them. There was always lots to learn. The cable industry is constantly changing."
bad,The HR did not pay me what they offered me the trainer was a liar. They just threw in to it
bad,"It is said not to say anything if it is not positive. Great perks, and discounts/benefits."
bad,"Hated working here. Management mircro manages you, publicly degrades you in front of other employees when you make a mistake. Constantly changing process and procedures. Can never stick with one process. Supervisors are lacking in experience. Just as you get used to the new way of things they change it and reprimand you. Very particular about your bathroom breaks. Lots of dirty politics going on in south texas. Not paid enough. There is no fairness across the board. Will never work there again."
bad,"very messy quick job if you have a background,bad pay tho."
bad,"A very frightening environment, my shift was from 12-7 am and I was by my self , doing head counts dealing with federal inmates at a halfway home, not knowing if anything can , or would happened to my safety."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Family owed business who now out of business.  Poorly run and family took advantage of management.
bad,The corporation has manipulated their entire customer acquisition package and does not allow loyalty discounts for existing customers to accommodate for the consistent price increases which the corporation does in such a discreet fashion where the customer is unaware and once the customer calls upset about price changes the corporation trains its employees to provide as little as possible and try to upgrade customers on packages without disclosing accurate pricing as long as the monthly quotas are met. The corporation tells it's employees its not their concern if they loose existing customers because they will continue to gain more customers because they have mastered marketing so don't worry about upset customers.
bad,"Typical work was great, coworkers and managemntn was a good relaxed enviroment steady work load always busy. I to hit,repair, package, perform cosmetics on coverters. As well as the computer aspect of find location of ewuipment entering equipment to and from techs and wether or not the equipment is on file or on a customers account."
bad,"Management was more concerned about your personal life then they were about the company, and God help you if you had friends at work!"
bad,"The workers here at Time Warner Cable are great they are friendly and team players. However the company is changing they are laying a lot of the workers off. I have been here for five years they made a drastic change here they took away the seats from the workers. We are not allowed to wear comfortable sneakers. It is so many things that have changed and not for the better. We now have a quota that none of us is meeting which is resulting to verbal, coaching write ups, etc. I apologize but there is no enjoyable part of my job. "
bad,"I had a very serious traumatic injury including two orbital bone fractures with an orbital floor blow out.  I was unconscious, having seizures and intubated.  I had to have an operation to put a metal plate in my eye socket and it took months to be able to see without double vision.  Any use of my eye without frequent breaks rendered me teary with blurred double vision.  When I attempted to return to work, I asked for job accommodations of frequent breaks from the computer just for five minutes or so to rest my eye (IF NEEDED) and was denied the accommodation.  Saying that they would not make the requested accommodation and if I did not return without it they would assume I resigned my position."
bad,Time Warner Cable was a terrible place to work. Jobs constantly out sourced over seas to the Philippines and to other states. Constantly offering cheap technology and high prices to customers to line the pockets of the CEO's. Always hiring management position from the outside and not within over looking their current loyal employees. Terrible hours unless you get extremely lucky.
bad,I wish I would've been warned before applying here. This company sucks!!!! They do not value their employees at all!!!! YOU WILL BE TREATED LIKE GARBAGE!!!!! YOU WILL BE MICROMANAGED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT AND HARASSED FOR USING THE FREAKING BATHROOM!!! Don't say I didn't warn you.
bad,A typical day at work would be answering phone calls and answering questions. Greeting customers with a freindly smile. Managment was ok. Co-workers were nice to talk to and got along well. The hardest part of the day is when is unbelievably packed and you have customers becoming very inpatient. Was unorganized. Most enjoyable part of the day was working close with friendly and positive people.
bad,Been sued time and time again yet they still refuse employment to some and force them to do the same job as a contractor.
bad,"The environment is stale, old and feels like you are always riding at the back of the bus. That is the perception in the way they hire, fire and promote."
bad,They like to hire for promotions from the outside and most of all and they do not check their current employees backgrounds to make sure they were management before hiring. For this company it is who you know. I knew people who worked garbage jobs in the past for other companys and they hired them from the outside to be supervisors.
bad,I joined this company after college with the promise of making large amounts of money in commission. Let me break this position down.
bad,"I worked for twc for over 14 yrs in tech support, because I didn't sell enough to make them happy I was fired. We even had a sales,billing and repair ques, yet they expected way too much from"
bad,"WORST Company EVER,,,, QA monitered your calls, you have to say closing, if a customer call to complain about there high bill you had to UPSALE. if a customer removed something cause of bill being to high, you had to remove it and turn around and UPSALE or get written up."
bad,management sucks and they pick favorites. Dump everything on the CSR crew and never upgrade pay.
bad,Great job for a high school student ok security and a typical day at work was fun with the young people.
bad,"They do not care for there employee‘s. Management has known clue of what you do, or what it takes to do your job."
bad,"Worked here for a few years, the company is very much like high school alot of drama, gossip and cadiness.The only good part about the job was the individuals I supported. The main office staff were terrible very unorganized and blind to the things going on inside of the homes. It was hard to get them to perform maintence in the homes, hard to get supplies and even harder to get in contact with any of the higher ups for serious problems as theyb often dont answer their phones."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Charter is a very difficult place to work for. They will work you to death with no reward. Promises will be made and never happen. Their pay is sub-par and their benefits are worse.
bad,"Love it , Fun place to work, I love it we have fun and we make sure we take good care of our customers"
bad,"As a talent that created content that eventually sold the ads that drove the revenue machine, I felt totally under valued."
bad,sucks every which way possible. management is shady. co-workers are shady.
bad,"They over work you every day then when it's time for a raise they offer you a great review with a 10-30 cents increase..Terrible management from HR dept down.Very unproffesional,no values or good work ethics displayed by most people that work in the Duluth,GA location. They will also terminate you even with a doctors note if your late more than 6 times in a 6 month period even by 1 minute!!!"
bad,... just over all everything stinks.. management was poor... co-workers were fighting all the time while managment did nothing..
bad,at first this was the perfect place to work until management steps in they can be very hard for no reason at all especially since most employees have more education and experience then they do
bad,Vey shady management they expect you to do stuff you were not even hired for if you don't listen to them and do sales also when you were hired for customer service you will get fired. This is the worst company I have every worked for in my life. They expect you to sell 40+ cable packages in the summer when nobody watches tv in the summer if you don't you will get written up and maybe fired.
bad,I worked here for almost 2 years. I started thinking I was going to be hired as a Technical Rep as promised half way through training I was told I was a customer service rep. I didn't argue with the company and stayed hoping I would advance to a technical rep that was a joke this company will never let you get a better position no matter how hard you try. Some people were very fun to work with but not the management they were very shady people. One thing I hated was I got hired to help customers then they started making me also do sales and told me I would be fired if I didn't make a ridicouls sales goal like selling 40+ cable packages a month in the summer when nobody watches tv. They also promise you allot of benefits but never let you take them you get one sick day every 90 days and they don't care if your sick its a call center they say. So they expect you to come in and get everyone else sick its disgusting.
bad,VP's great excitement when she called exclaiming that a person with technical skills like mine was perfect for the job.
bad,Easily the worst place that I've ever been. High turn-over rate.
bad,These people should be in prison for how they treat there employees. Its a freeking cable company not the freeking CIA!!!
bad,Pay cut last four years.
bad,One day i got an notice not to return to work...a day before i told them i was with child
bad,"I left Time Warner on good terms only to find out my previous boss was giving prospective new employers bad references. He was angry that I left and told other people in the office he was ""going to get even."""
bad,They are not very understanding of diffrent things that may come up
bad,My reveiw is if u dont have a family or going to lischool and u want to be verbally abused by customers. and micromanaged and treated like a prisonor this is the place for a teenie bopper. Oh and pleas dont have car problems its a wrap!!!
bad,"Worst company ever! They dont care about there employees, or the customers."
bad,"There is a lack of trust with this company that did not exist under previous leadership. Feedback is received and rejected with no attempt to understand. Agents are micromanaged and meant to feel under a microscope at all times. There is no autonomy, ability to grow, or understanding. There is no communication and in any direction."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Everything was black and white. If practices were better with Time Warner it didn't matter. It was our way or no way."
bad,"The company is good, but the supervisors not. The want you working Saturday and is without paid. This bad psychology “if you make the sale you no waste your Saturday” the pressure they put in you, and pushing for the sales but when you have problems with the commission (all the months) they not help you. "
bad,"While the company appears fun with the employee breakrooms and amenities like the gym, the job itself makes it so miserable to even be there I stopped utilizing these places just to get out of the building. They do NOT support employees, once sick they do not care about you and will release you immediately and state it is for attendance."
bad,Delusional sales goals and unfair commission structure.  Commission guarantee during ramp up period is the most commission you will ever make here.   After ramp up you’ll be lucky to make $300 in commission.   Hours are long and management micromanages your breaks.  I hated every minute of working here.
bad,Spectrum is not a good company to work for.  They don't care about employees.  You will be a number.  They don't care about their employees and don't treat their employees with respect.
bad,Pay is very low for industry standards. Managers are hired without industry knowledge. Lack of proper training causes employee turnover. Also hiring temps to help without experience.
bad,Save your energy and skip right past this terrible organization. Management is less than mediocre and reps are just stagnant cogs in the wheel. Commissions are paid 60 days after sales are made.
bad,I feel spectrum should provide more options for us to give to customers they call in about a high bill and all we can do is say sorry we don't have anything. Customers need some type of loyalty program for the time they have been with us. Then employees are verbally abused we have to go thra whole script before hanging up on an rude customers theres no employee appreciate what are crn points no company partys or holiday partys no thank you for the hard work and having to put up with angry customers that spectrum has created
bad,"This place is a horrible place, not nearly enough hands on training, No support, they make you feel incompetent and belittle you. It's full of stress and you are tossed out on the floor without knowing what you are doing.. If you can handle a lot of stress and grief then this job is for you."
bad,"Please be cautious in applying here. I worked for Spectrum for almost a year.. harassed everyday by male coworkers & when I complained, it took them so long to even start an investigation through HR. The management here is awful! They will not help you in any way & will only find ways to push you out. The Lake Elsinore location is the worst location to apply at. Go there if you want to be degraded & unappreciated everyday."
bad,"ever since time warner cable was bought out it went down the toilet bowl, long hours with minimum breaks. desk sharing, it felt like a sweat shop. poor management and lack of communication. hr is in the same bed as management so not much support there. so many complaints to the eeoc its ridiculous."
bad,"After training be prepared to be on your own with no ability to get help without being judged or talked down to. I received no coaching after training and when I would call the ""help line"" they made you feel like you were stupid for not knowing. This is a very stressful  job as it is and showing up to be told ""you can't wear those boots, you can't have your jacket on (keep in mind its snowing outside and they have the call center floor cold) while other tenured staff is allowed to not follow the ""dress code"" makes it more stressful to show up. I never write reviews but I  feel people should know what kind of company this is. The free service is not worth the stress."
bad,"Bad Management."
bad,"Worked for 20+ years at  Adelphia/Time Warner Cable. Had a great team the accomplished many fantastic tasks.  Not enough to save us from Charter and their ""EVERYONE MUST MOVE TO DENVER"" toxic culture.  They even made people move from 40 minutes north in Broomfield.  somehow their stock still does well."
bad,Not a place I would reffer anyone I know too. Non personal management. Incredibly Micromanaged. Low start out pay. And not a lot of flexibility for work/life balance.
bad,"Poor Management. Managers would rather flirt with eachother than help u . lots of missing sales. No report to show u where they went. they expect u to find them but u will have to overcome lots of obstacles in order to do that and even if u succeed there is a 99% chance u still won't get paid for them. They make every excuse in the world as to why they can't "
bad,Hated working here. Customers were always unhappy with the cable services and treated you horribly on the phone. Management expected a lot from you but would be aggravated if you asked for help.
bad,"The only upward mobility in this position is reserved for either former Time Warner Cable employees in North Carolina, or those who have a personal friendship with a director or directors. There has not been 1 corporate recruiter promoted in St. Louis for at least 5 years. They talk a big game about promoting from within, but they don't really mean what they say. There have been two opportunities in St. Louis for a recruiter to move into a management role since 2017, but they chose to go with Mr. External Hire each time."
bad,"Do not fall for this position there is a reason why they are allways hiring ouside sales reps. They pay you 10 dollars a hour  wich is less than minimum wage your comission takes two months to get paid, gas is only paid from the moment you arrive at the field wich sumtimes you never recieve money for gas. They micro manage and they make you do 2calls a day wich are completley a waste of time!"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"A typical day at work:"
bad,"Didn't get help when I needed it. Made promises about assistance, but this never happened. Must work overtime on a 10-hour shift. If you don't struggle there is promotion potential."
bad,"Management is a joke, good ole boys club special treatment the whole nine yards. Place sucks bad at least in our area. You will never have a successful career."
bad,The company no longer exist. It was not fun to work there. It was not fun to be there. They didn’t pay enough. They were sold off to another company and they’ll no longer exist.
bad,"This place is an awful place to work. "
bad,"Very important training is fast paced, don't miss a day very critical, after a few weeks of training please be aware that it continues on the floor. Do not expect to learn everything you will learn on the floor and trust me you will. There is some good supervisors and some that are really pushy and the position went to there head, along with management it is really unorganized. The clients are ok but with the work overload it becomes overwhelming and no I mean no positive feedback on your good job done. Everyday is a learning experience stay calm and focused also there goals are sometimes overwhelming to achieve, also too many good people leave because of the stress. Stay positive and focus this may be the job for you."
bad,I started in Feb and LOVED it but that quickly changed. My sales and bonuses were GREAT until they made rules that killed our sales. Things change on the daily and it isn't always communicated across the board. You may as well not even count on commission. Being cussed out every day by customers is no fun. They actually train you to keep talking until the customer hangs up or tells you to put them on the do not call list.
bad,"While my immediate supervisor isn’t bad, the upper levels are terrible. Different departments don’t communicate, and are often at odds. Upper management are aware and have no interest in trying to fix it, they just say don’t expect anything to change."
bad,"Unfortunately we are required to deal with some unhappy customers. Spectrum Management requires employees to deal with them a specific way in minimal amount of time. Management needs to work on minimizing stress levels their. I thought it was just me, but when you see the turn around of employees, made me think about working at Spectrum. I moved on. However, good luck to any who tries to make a career at Spectrum. FYI, I'am once again healthy. :)"
bad,To much greed spectrum is not taking care of employees as a result their will be lots of churn and more reps that are not qualify giving bad customer experience. Dont apply this commision structure does not give you enough to save and live on your own.
bad,"Dishonest on ever level, the facilitator S%$ is a Horrible human being and he was the reason why i left..He should not being helping anyone he is only hurting the company."
bad,"This is definitely a boiler room at worst. Misleading in interview/inadequate training. Allowed bathroom breaks ONLY at 3x w/o dr. notes or write up. Algorithm in place to record all calls and screens at all times. No room for error, no notice, or support unless friendly coworker. Hope you get a good supervisor or forget it. 60% turnover, which they tell you at training. Unappreciative, demoralizing, unhappy people. Corporate at its worst. Go there if it is the only way to feed your family."
bad,"This position is so focused on sales and yet the company decreased the amount of commission you can receive and increased the quota.   "
bad,"I worked in a call center and it is the most grueling thing you could do. The customers are flat out rude to you, you're expected to improve a dozen or so metrics where management doesn't even understand how said metrics work, and the culture of the workplace is the most toxic office environment you can imagine."
bad,"Do not work in the call center unless you are desperate, especially if they start you with awful hours. They will hire people after you & give them better shifts. Supervisors micromanage via chat. Too many systems that don't work to support products they know are broken (tv app). Poor training/not enough floor support"
bad,They claim to be different than others but you are really just a number and replaced by months end. Management changed more than 3 times within two months of working there.
bad,They dont care about their employees.  Dont look into things but use anything they can against you.  They give you sick time but write you up if you use it even once and dont take doctors notes.
bad,"Toxic environment, toxic culture, full of unethical people. Most management is completely incompetent. Shocking how few intelligent people could work in one place. Likely hired simply for their lack of ethics."
bad,"After 6 years my paychecks are 1/3 of what they used to be. Pay cuts, mandatory overtime, forced 6 & 7 day work weeks, horrible insurance, no disability coverage, no future, no advancement."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"If your looking to just make a paycheck, stay in the same position, answering the same questions 50+ times a night with no opportunities for advancement, then this is the place for you.  If, however you are the type that wants to advance within the company, doing something different after putting in a year of perfect service with the company, then take my advice and keep looking."
bad,in a call center taking calls back to back   average of 90 calls per day  people constantly upset with the company and griping to us call center people
bad,"TWC was great until Spectrum bought it out, raised goals, and cut pay... now the company is a mess which is why they always are having open interviews for their inside sales positions."
bad,This company does not appreciate anything anyone does. They have unrealistic expectations and penalize you when they are not hit. They take advantage of their good employees with zero recognition to anyone but their favorites. There is no direct line of promotion unless management likes you and if you try to fight this they will make your life very difficult until you are fired or quit
bad,"Door to door sales is made more difficult because he is really not needed to sell products and services; customers can just go online, go to retail store, etc. "
bad,"Upper management is poorly run.  They have you bust your butt to advance then pull the job out from under you.  Upper management and middle management is very top heavy."
bad,"Toxic culture for sales professionals.  Company overstaffs which leads to continuously high turnover.  Local markets are managed by standardized staffing model, regardless of local characteristics or market conditions."
bad,"I joined Charter thinking I have an ability to make money and have a stable career.  I was given the tools, the education, among other things to get going.  Unfortunately, I was placed in a position where I had to knock on doors in a low-income county and hearing people say they couldn’t afford Spectrum on a consistent basis.  And when you go back and give the feedback to management why you can’t get sales, you get yelled at and placed on corrective action/probation.  There’s no corrective action for lack of sales when people can’t afford Spectrum. "
bad,Company cares about 2 things training and fake shoppers.  Every month there is about 6-7 pointless training on the computer you have to do that takes you off the floor for hours. Which doesn't really Matter anyway considering the sales goal you have to reach in order to make the low commission is so outrageously unrealistic it doesn't matter. They are always worried about these fake shoppers they send in. That wast an hour of your time when there is a line wrapped around the building waiting to yell at you because the bill is to high and the service never works. And if you are actually going to get a sale there is icoms which has got to be the worst peice of xxxx you will ever encounter. With that being said you lose most of your sales because of icoms. This company is very unorganized and poorly run. STAY AWAY.
bad,Worse place to work for. If you like to be treated horribly leadership and the callers then you found the right job. Bonuses are ate away when theh raise over pay for call center. Use to be a great place under time waner. Spectrum ran it to the ground. They dont care about employees just about how many calls you take and how fast you can get them off the phone. You will take over 1000 calls a month and have to make your metrics of being around 300 seconds per call. Worked 4 years and would never let me advance when meeting goals. Stressful and you will get fat for not leaving ur desk for a 10 hour shift. Heath care dose not pay for anything. I started at 13 an hour and made it to 15.55 in 4 years the year i left they brought pay to 15 an hour and ate all my raises away. They cant keep people at all. Most people quit in 2 months. I would strip for a living befor working their again. Dont waist your time here find a better job then this. Managment is a joke. Few good sups but most are horrible. All policies are a joke and no one can give you correct info on how to do the job. Waisted time working here. You also take back to back calls all day long with customers crying about pricing and they give you no ways to lower bill and a 25$ credit limit and just tell you to position value to the cust and that they have the best price available. Its a joke and a scam and they are getting kicked out of new york for shady dealings. Also you have to wait 15 to 20 min to get a lead for help on esculated calls and they still want you close to 300 sec per call.
bad,"As an agent your role is simple.... just don't try to retire there. Management usually never has a REAL idea of how to execute the goal.Its always trial, but more error."
bad,"The sales goals are not realistic. The work environment is negative. People are constantly worried if they are going to be able to keep their jobs or if they are next to be cut. When we were Oceanic Time Warner Cable, it was a family environment and that is sadly not the case anymore."
bad,This is not a place I would recommend to anyone at all due to its inability to train people properly and then hold them to those standards. Just dont do it
bad,"Charter came from a bankrupcy and bought Time Warner. They ran themselves in the ground with sorry upper management decisions and when I left had started down that same road with the new company.Not sure from here how they are doing now. I do know they are taking massive disconnects from TV customers."
bad,This is not a great company to work for at all. Low team moral. Would  never and did never refer to anyone. One of the worse job experiences I have ever had.
bad,Not a great working environment for a Salesman. Charter has a very bad HR environment for the Salesforce as well. Unfair and unwise expectations for the salesforce makes selling too difficult in an environment  where the product is on the decline.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"The Field Tech is the guy who makes everything work. But the company has a system which adds even more responsibilities to his work load. The mid-level manager I was under, was a back-stabbing liar. And upper management turned a blind eye to it. I think it is common in the company."
bad,"I worked as technical support for 8 months. too much work, too much stress, no room to advance. the pay is very low, not enough to pay the bills in Florida. too much angry customers. management don't care. they only promote their friends and family members to the good jobs. more than half supervisors are not qualified to do the job."
bad,"Incompetent management, no support and irrational business decisions. The sole objective is profit, nothing else. Employee and customer satisfaction metrics are non existent."
bad,Low pay. Long hours are expected even though it is unspoken. Routes are over booked on a day to day basis causing stress from a never ending list of impossible tasks.
bad,Challenging and stressful place of business customer calling cursing you out because service aren't working or the bill to high. taking abuse from customers
bad,Field work is hard for this company. They do not give the support needed to fix problems in the system.  You fear retaliation if you tell the truth about the job
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here. It was fun and exciting when it was brighthouse but now it’s has become way too corporate and it’s all about the bottom dollar. They seem to forget the little people that got them there!
bad,"no work life balance"
bad,Job was not compatable with my age. Cut throat environment is counter productive. Demands are unreasonable and often outrageous. Very shady methods used to get rid of unwanted employees.
bad,"Hardest part of the job was trying to achieve the unrealistic goals. Getting rework held against you do to weather related issues, customer tampering."
bad,"Worked here years, Charter bought us. Benefits went away and so did my job. Out to Rochester. Horrible place to work now. I would advise to go elsewhere."
bad,"merge made workplace super stressful. cut salaries, very strict, unprofessional settings, don't teach new techniques. nobody has time for you everybody has their own agenda"
bad,Very strict adherence to the work matrix. No way to be successful. Always pushing for more out of the agents. Unreasonable work rules for a call center. Very controlling even down to dress. Management is constantly focused on goals they set that you did not meet. High turnover of employees due to stressful work conditions. Constantly running training classes for new hires to replace vacancies.
bad,horrible  company to work for   they do not care about their employee it a cut tongue environment like a sweat shop  I have not good to say they give you lead that were used by other reps and youre expened to create sales with the leads youre not able to go out of your terroritry and get sales
bad,"Despite stating they care for their employees, and that employees are empowered to make the best decision in any situation, Spectrum (previously Charter at my location, and Time Warner in others) undermines it's employees with vague policies, training documents that you are never given the opportunity to review, and discriminates against anyone who needs accommodations for medical or family leave.  This is done by inconsistent information, supervisors advising against going to human resources for employer offered benefits and resources, and advancement policies that prevent anyone on an intermittent medical leave of absence from moving up within the company."
bad,"Since the change from Time Warner Cable to Charter Spectrum:"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Typical work day answering 60+ calls from customers. Some nice, some irate. POOR management. Day to day operations change at the drop of a dime, no consistency among team, leads, sups, mangement, etc."
bad,My mom had cancer and they didn't care. I was wanting to continue work with them but they did not show any compassion.  My boss only cared about stats. which was more important than what I was going through.
bad,"Not a good company to work for at all. Leadership lies consistently, the culture is horrible and it is just words with no action. The reason cable customers complain about the experience they have is no surprise when you work here you understand completely. If the company doesn't find value in having techs work at night to fix problems for customers, why would you think customer are important at all. That is just 1 small example of many that I could give, but it goes on and on. Basically the company runs just how the customer think when they talk about the negative experience. Management just  sits back and allows things to happen, while customers and the experience they receive suffers. This company is the only company I have ever worked for that we spent time at a leadership meeting trying to figure out how we could change metrics that we rate performance on to make it look better, instead of changing the issue to actually make it better. That is right folks, we spent 2 days trying to figure out how to make reporting look better so it would appear as if we were doing better, when we could have actually made changes to do better and provide a better experience to the customer, and made our reporting better by improving our network quality really."
bad,"When the company was Time Warner Cable, the management cares about the employees and cares about the customer experience. Since the merger, the management only cares about the numbers and no longer cares about employee or customer satisfaction."
bad,"Time Warner wasn't great, but at least they weren't trying to actively destroy the lives of its employees like now. Don't work for Charter. They will use you up and throw you away."
bad,"This company has no direction, treats employees poorly and the management is horrible.  The turnover is HUGE and no clear direction from management ever.  RUN AWAY!!!"
bad,Company does not care about its customers or employees. They will fire you for no reason. They will outsource as much work as possible. They dont want people to have careers.
bad,Spectrum is not an employee centers place to work. You are made to know that you are replaceable. They don't like unions and union workers and their matrix for evaluating employees is flawde.
bad,"Great benefits...."
bad,"Had six weeks of paid training for ""Repair and Customer Service"" to use for internet, cable and phone repair for Charter Spectrum. Last few days of training everything was about SALES!! Merit pay was based on selling and amount of time with customers - faulty advertising for job - would have never applied if told would be based on sales."
bad,"Very stressful. This has to be one of the worst jobs that I've ever had. The managers are terrible; the co workers are terrible, and the work environment is terrible. They do not care about their employees."
bad,No job security.  The amount of cliques was beyond crazy it made the environment feel like high school.  If you didn't make friends quick you were left out and even picked on in unprofessional work manner. Would not want anyone I know to have to endure that kind of environment.
bad,"A smaller company took over a much larger company who uses ancient processes.  Reports that use to take 10 minutes to produce now take 3 hours since financials aren't kept in the same system.  It allow for less production, longer days, and less accurate information.  Upper management never listened.  I would have to do things the way they wanted me to, allow them to fail, then they would ask my opinion on how to get it fix. The moral of the staff decreased tremendously due to this culture. We lost benefits that was provided under Time Warner Cable."
bad,"depressing, zero room for advancement, and poor pay. The staff are more focused on themselves rather than the clients, and the clients reap no benefits from staff."
bad,"Job was ok to start, decent pay for entry level, on the job training.  Things progressively got worse. Unreachable expectations of customer service, time frames to meet.  Management doesn't care about you, only if your numbers are getting them a bonus.  Techs were pitted against each other.  Favortism runs rampant.  Benefits keep getting worse and worse each year.  Best part is when you fix a customers issue and how happy they can be."
bad,When I started at Bright House Networks life was great we had sales commission we had incentive programs to help boost morale and quality of work by adding friendly competition between teams we had service supervisors that for the most part kind of knew what they were doing as far as managing people not just knowing the information. Now with Spectrum supervisors don't know any more than the tech does we don't have lead technicians anymore so we don't have anyone to call and ask for help constantly overbooked underpaid all of our incentives have been taken away our commissions have been taken away. Needless to say I no longer enjoy the work load that Spectrum has put on service technicians. They keep adding responsibilities and not adjusting for workload. Morale is at an all-time low indicated by high turnover and subpar quality of work. We no longer have the help of contractors with line replacements.
bad,This was one of the worst places for me to work.  Daily you are being sworn at because someone's cable did not work correctly.  It was hard to get the supervisor to speak to the customer when the customer requested to speak to him.
bad,Culture is business driven and lack team spirit. Teams work long hours during the week and weekends. No work life balance. Many leaders do not offer support. They are busy trying to secure their jobs.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I found out the hard way that co-workers can steal orders from you and that management lets troublemakers go without punishment because they are making profit for the store even though they are cheating and scamming and stealing in order to do it. On top of that, they expect you to cold call (which studies have shown is not an effective means of selling) in the winter in Cleveland when nobody wants to open their doors."
bad,"I worked here for less than a month. First they tell you that you just gotta make few sales and you'll be fine"
bad,"-Micromanagement, micromanagement, micromanagement; at all levels of the organization."
bad,"It's one of those companies that rules with an iron fist. Unless you're connected through any means possible, even if you have to lie and cheat over deceive your coworkers to get to the top, there's absolutely no chance of advancements. While the rest of the world is advancing forward with new technology, this company has a new idea of rolling the clock back with no casual clothing, no flexible work arrangement, and certainly no contest for being asked to work day and also support work at nights and weekends without questions asked."
bad,"There is a lack of cooperation between departments. Poor management and support from the top down. Communication is poor. Project dates are pushed out without any real consequence. One expects things to shift and change but because of the chaos it is like spitting in the wind to get anything productive done. "
bad,"This company will overwork you and management doesn't seem to know what they are doing most of the time. The only thing that the managers and team leads are concerned with are themselves and how to make themselves look good. The problem is also the upper management who walks the floor everyday fails miserably at engaging with there employees. They sit outside and smoke with employees but they fail to converse. This is a company that has no idea what they are doing and on top of that they are so disorganized. "
bad,"Time warner cable has a bad reputation when it comes to customer service so when people call they are already expecting bad service. Even if you go out of your way for them, most customers still have a misplaced sense of entitlement. They expect their services to be on 24/7 without fail with the best picture quality and the fastest download speeds. It's a thankless job, at least in El Paso, TX. The management, for the most part, is lazy and they are never around when a customer requests to speak with one. HR is a total mess don't try to ask about your benefits because no one in the HR department has a clue."
bad,Wish I could go into great details of this job but there is not enugh room on this page. The sales team greatly supported each other  because the Management would not. There is not any sort of ongoing training Do not expect IT. Even if you have years of sales experience you will not be treated as you do and will never get any respect from your supervisor.  Good luck make sure you have a brand new car your gonna beat it up in milage and don't expect to get any support  on the weekends your supervisor will not be reachable. Very disappointed in the supervisor.
bad,the supervisor in Duluth are the worst its not place for people with children you will get written up if your kids have and emergency. The bulling in there is so bad and nothing is organized. However I think its just the Duluth office that's bad I have heard that the other charter offices are organized unlike Duluth. This job mandatory make you work over time with little than two days warning. The head of the this division  is the worst can you say ghetto fab.   The dispatch supervisors don't no how to help there employees and walk of the floor to gossip you work every weekend. However the pay is good not worth my happiness
bad,The pay is definitely not sufficient for the work. all other companies pay more than spectrum. i love the consumers i cared for but the homes have poor management.
bad,The management has a turn and burn philosophy when it comes to hiring... they are NEVER held accountable for their failures (which are numerous) instead of changing out managers that cant handle the business needs they blame the reps and just continuously rotate in new employees. I worked there for 6 years and during that time I saw hundreds of people come and go.. it got to a point where it wasn't even worth it to get to know new people because odds were they would be gone in a month or two... that being said the employees that work there are genuinely good people and  fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the unreasonable customers who want the world and being pushed from behind by management to provide the customers with the least value possible so essentially you get the worst from both sides. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone I know or care about and would go so far to say that this is possible one of the worst companies in America to work for.
bad,"The free cable is the only perk. Call center always busy because agents are never properly trained to do their job right. Management? LOL let me know if you ever find them, theyre probably off in a meeting to discuss useless representative metrics and ways to make employees fear for their jobs by not meeting said metrics. Supervisors all show favoritism and their metric system for judging employees is a joke.  Why should employees be penalized for doing whats right for the customer and not your bottom line? And they wonder why their customers hate them???  Best of luck with the merger twc i just hope comcast does away with all the rubbish, you guys could use a good house cleaning."
bad,"Not a good place to work! Thy treat you more like a # Than a person, they lie to their employees and they exploit them!"
bad,"Not a long term option but good for transition job.  Merge with Comcast = commission changes = sales agents taking lots of retention/cust care/billing/mover calls."
bad,"In a typical day you will handle about 30 to 50 calls depending on the time you will need to spend with each customer. Some customers are very easy and the need is simple and others will require upwards of an hour or more of your time. Usually this is when someone has a bill question they don't understand or wants to disconnect. I never felt uncomfortable dealing with frustrated customers as a phone representative you need to remember we all have felt the same way if you can let the customer know that you understand where they are coming from it will ease them and make the call go much nicer for you and the customer. For me I was given a lot of latitude and far as giving customers credits. My employers understood that I was not going to give credit to just shut them up, I was giving credit for a goo reason a fair and honest reason. There where a lot of young folk in the center and they would not be able to approve any amount because of their inexperience."
bad,They lose a lot of good people because they refuse to pay what the market demands.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Employees are great, upper management doesn't take time to train you"
bad,Very demanding on your time. It is not a job where you are helping a customer but building the company image.
bad,RUN AWAY! As fast as you can. If it wasn't for the money I would have quit years ago...
bad,your like a robot in a cubicle hours are horrible management is horrible
bad,They expect you to work 16 hr days 6 days a week no overtime. And if the weathers bad... Show up or get fired!!!
bad,Terrible management they will overwork you and have no respect for their employees
bad,Worse place I ever worked. Management doesn't care if you have a family or long how you have been there. They change your schedule to whatever hours they want and give new employees better hours.
bad,This was the worst job I've ever had there is no Job security and they have a high Turn over due to unprofessional Managment and staff.
bad,Upper management gossip's about employees. They give nicknames and treat them poorly. There is a good old boy cable network that takes care for their own. There is also a woman in cable club that is harsh and makes fun of women not like them. There is no room for advancement. NEO is made up of ex-sprint management. They've been bringing on buddies and running out talent. The VP comes in the office and closes the door. He says there is an open door policy but if you speak with him he becomes annoyed and contacts your supervisor.
bad,"I can only speak for the training development department in Colorado, but if you’re looking for a job I urge you to look somewhere - anywhere - else. The best word I can use to describe management is sneaky. They provide half-instructions and then reprimand you for not “hitting the target” – often publically. You oftentimes have to work dozens of extra hours to re-do work and make up for the poor instructions received. Their practices are unethical and self-serving. Their treatment of people is demeaning and borderline psychologically abusive. They pit employees against one another in an attempt to maintain power. It was the very worst working experience I’ve ever had – and that includes my first job serving fast food and cleaning toilets!"
bad,I had a negative experience with this company due to the overall lack of ethics and values.
bad,Zero confidence in upper management.
bad,"Very poor working enviornment, treats employees horrible and disrespectful. Poor communication between boss, and manager to technicians."
bad,"Typical work day involved being a salesman, I didnt like that, at all"
bad,Bay News 9 and its managers will tie your hands and your creativity. Managers don't know what's good or what's bad as far as news judgement and content. Stories are lame and workers who don't pull their weight never hear about it. If you are good you will be overloaded without any benefit. Few people really care about what they are doing. Walk by a managers desk and they are on facebook while you are underwater. If you just want to cash a paycheck (and a weak one at that) feel free - you can have it
bad,The only way to get ahead is to suck up to management.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Not real fond of the Company as they have evolved from Chapter 11, they do many things underhandedly and will do what they can to step over the employees."
bad,"All they’re about is money. They tell you in the beginning that your job is secure and as soon as your performance drops they threaten to fire you. I worked for spectrum up until 1 week ago. They don’t value their employees or customers at all. Management has no integrity & they hound you for sales. It’s not about what the customers want, it’s about the money that management wants."
bad,"Almost forced OT, barred behind a test that barely has anything to do with the job at hand for a promotion which has a less than 30% global pass rate, compensation is really poor given the housing market in the area, the workload is tremendously high with little to no breathing room, expectations are high to the point, one mistake and you are threatened with a write up, the commute was terrible for me personally, too much political wars between departments and the field technicians were the ones paying the ultimate price."
bad,"The training program absolutely does not prepare you for what you have to deal with in the field. You do a 4 week class and 2 weeks of ride alongs with a mentor and you're then expected to do this job on your own. The culture at this office is the worst I've ever experienced at any job. Felt like the military. Alpha males, rampant transphobia and homophobia jokes from both Techs and the managers. When I escalated this to HR they did absolutely nothing to resolve the issue. Everyone in the company who was there from the Time Warner days talks about how much they hate their job and tries to make the new recruits as miserable as they are. I was told multiple times to violate safety rules to complete a job. But if a safety supervisor rolls up on you while you're doing that you'll be fired immediately. There are way too many mixed signals and nobody can give you a clear cut answer on anything."
bad,Been Employed with cable industry  for 20 years  when spectrum  took over the micro managment  became over the top crazy. The job of servicing  customers  I have always  enjoyed  the daily interaction  with them has been a pleasure
bad,I worked in Spectrun for almost 2 years which it was full of stress and as a job it is boring. Managers keeps stressing the supervisors and guess what happen after!!!
bad,I don't like how the company expects everyone to work the same. You're like a robot and your supervisors are allowed to bully you. They don't listen even when you let them know you need help. You are lied to about incentives and if you haven't been there a year yet and you get pregnant...just don't do that.
bad,"Management was not transparent. Management made a lot of promises that they could not deliver. The culture was unstable due to favoritism."
bad,Worked under empereon Constar. They really made he hate going to work with their poor management skills as a company. Drugs and fights in the parkjng lot.
bad,learned a great deal about the company; work place culture has changed over the years- people work less as a team; very little to no work life balance
bad,"Specturm is a amazing place to work. However depending on what dept you interview and work for can be challenging. The direct sales dept is a waste of time. They lie to the reps and there is no real training. The supervisors take on all the blame and are overworked with ZERO support. You will have leads that someone else just worked 2 weeks ago and will be told they are fresh and great to work "
bad,"Get away from this company . Only thing that matters is the bottom line. Bright house was a Mich better job place, they cared about there employees and the customers happiness above all else. Not the new company"
bad,I first thought this job would be great. It has turned out to be  job from ——.  They say they will support you but all the instructors and managers do is tattle . I would not recommend this job .
bad,working here suck management is bad its alot of work for a very low pay plus you have to go to a difficult training for weeks you have to work  no matter the conditions they don’t care no matter where you drive there constantly watching you then they’ll call you and act like you’re jealous wife where are you where you been why you’re taking to long at a house its reallyyyy bad place to work at and pay is even worse
bad,Supervisors were allowed to have conflicts of interest such as dating their subordinates which caused low morale as other co workers felt favortism was unfair. Managers and HR were aware but no consequences for supervisors. Agents expected to be on back to bsck calls 8 hrs 5 days a week while sups favorites/partners sat in their offices socializing.
bad,Base salary after all meetings and time spent is less than minimum wage. Meetings on site twice a week and over the phone twice a day. Work 6 days a week only off day is Sunday. Working hours are from 11:00 am central to 8:00 pm. Bonus after sales quota is met. Not met only Salary pay. Knock same doors over and over again.
bad,"I was constantly under a microscope. We were expected to do multiple jobs at once that individually were already difficult. We were basically expected to be 5 people at once so whenever we struggled management would take ""corrective action."" Completely over worked and severely underpaid."
bad,"I have many years of call center experience,  this is the first call center job to make me seek medical help for stress/anxiety. VERY stressful, hostile environment every day. You are belittled if you do not meet metrics..constantly told that you are expendable.  Micromanaged every minute of every day. The money is not worth your sanity. I'm on antidepressants for the first time in my life because of this place."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"You lost the time with you family and they don’t even trust you ,pressure and poor management. Never had backup support,you make a deal and the company help you to lose the sale"
bad,"They send you to school and give you time to learn but when time comes to be on your own little to no help from management. Better off calling a co-worker. They will find a away to screw you out of your quarterly bonuses. They do not care what the weather is like, they want you on that pole. If a pole is unsafe to climb or put a ladder on it's hard to get a bucket truck out there and if you end up getting someone out it takes for every so your productivity points for the day are shoot. They will throw a 2-4 or 5-6 whatever time frame on you at last min with hr drive time and it will be your fault for not making that time frame. They will push safety all day but when things are unsafe they say just get it done."
bad,"Bad place."
bad,Horrible work place hostile work environment employees sending obscene photos while in training to others in  training it so mis manage they will tell you show up to work and use your tools non stop they will tell you this lied to about training if your metrics aren’t there you will be treated hostile if you aren’t in the click you will be treated horrible hr the most miss managed and uneducated
bad,"Besides working days and nights, now I have to work on-call shifts also, which was not part of the original deal. No training or documentation for on-call work."
bad,"I went in with an open mind knowing the service I received as a customer was horrible. Its worse as an employee. This company's leadership at the Irving TX location is sickening and embarrassing to see people treated so badly with no regard. Words can't describe what goes on at this place.They do not care about their customers period. All day everyday valid service complaints. Sales is so fraudulent they put people in service they don't ask for. Then Spectrum bills them and won't credit or clear these people profiles in the system. I don't have enough room. Spectrum needs to be sued and closed its that horrible, period."
bad,"Spectrum starts off great the training is good, a couple months in you start to see your hiring class fall apart, by one year only one or two people from your class remain, they are constantly losing and rehiring people. You’re in a constant state of stress getting yelled at the entire day, and the management teams don’t make it any better. The money isn’t worth the toll it takes on your mental. I seriously contemplated suicide just from working here"
bad,"If you want to work at Spectrum don't work for the Field Branch. Spectrum has wonderful opportunities in other branches. Being a field tech Spectrum will make you go into the most unimaginable houses. If you go to a house with bedbugs good luck trying to get out of it, they will find some way to make you go in. Houses that are health hazards you will be going in. Supervisors like to harass you daily and while you are outside busti and your butt they are having catered lunches in a nice air conditioning office. Good luck with getting promoted, they have to schedule your tests and classes. Which they never do because they don't want you to have a raise."
bad,Performance is metrics-driven which causes management to be very competitive.  Constant training and re-training fosters a culture of confusion and uncertainty; their moto is “fake it till you make it”. Frequent re-organization and moving of workstations ensures that agents remain unsettled and unable to build core relationships with peers
bad,the job is nothing but fixing the problem the company makes itself and talk the customer from leaving the company. upper management does  not care about agents because they can get more every day for the 15 they offer
bad,"Managers are only there for themselves. Supervisors definitely pick their favorites. Money is decent as long as you perform well under pressure. They keep promising that they will have a shift bid ""in a few months"", it STILL hasn't happened 2 years later. You really have to lose some of your personal beliefs to work here."
bad,Extremely strict and stressful work place. Company has no plan for either their customers or employees which cause stress between customers and employees. Policies are always changing for no reason. Would never recommend anyone working there.
bad,You have to do door to door sales and you’re lucky if you get a decent area. Management will blame you if you don’t sell in you're target period ! On average you have to sell 8 programs a week. On top that training was done over the phone and hands on. Most managers will team you up with other employees. You’re lucky if someone even tries to mentor you.
bad,I would not recommend this place to my enemy. If you want to micro micro managed. When they have a system that doesn't work. You will see immediately why their customer service is so bad. This job will keep you motivated to find another job. They have a very high turn over and are always hiring for a reason BEWARE!!!
bad,"As a contractor I was given no direction, but expected to make decisions (that required managerial input) on the work I was doing. My contract was terminated over a medical issue."
bad,Favoritisms at all time high. Mess around with your Sup or manager and you may get promoted. Metrics are almost impossible to meet. They will fire you for handle time. Currently working here and looking for way out. Free services not worth all the stress.
bad,"Management micro-manages and talks to employees with little or no respect in the call center. Employee morale is low and 25% of the workforce is on FMLA or out sick due to negative stress and management mistreatment. Management nor HR doesn't listen to complaints, making employees feel like there is something wrong with the employees. The culture is toxic and employee turnover is constant. I wish I had of stayed at my old job."
bad,"You’re micro managed! I worked here long before charter came along, and with time warner cable they’re main focus was building ‘value’ for the customers! So when they called you genuinely cared about what they asked for and asked questions to build their package and pitched it off of what they needed. When Spectrum came along they only care about pitching the highest priced package, even if its an old lady asking for only phone and she keeps telling you she can’t afford anything else! And because you have a heart you don’t try to sell her what she can’t afford and than you get in trouble for not pitching it, than defending it, than dropping down, than defending it, than dropping down and defending it until you finally give her what she wanted! My turning point in HATING this job was when I had an old lady who wanted phone so that she could use her life alert, spectrum phones Do not work with life alert and they never have, I told her I’d check just to make sure. do you know my manager told me to pitch a ‘triple’ and tell her that he phone ‘could’ work! This is an old lady who’s LIFE DEPENDS ON LIFE ALERT and he wanted me to lie to her just to get the sale! I did not! Because I have a soul! They do not, it’s ONLY ABOUT MONEY!!! Period! Than you get a schedule and get comfortable with it and they just randomly have shift bids without telling anyone, than you get stuck with a 2-11pm off Monday and Wednesday only and you can’t do anything about it! The calls that you get half the time aren’t even sales, they’ll be tech support or lower my bill, but because they’re phone system is"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Talented people are run ragged and expected to work harder. If you don’t get it within a few months management sees you as subpar and makes it difficult to succeed in a negative no time for coaching environment.
bad,"Spectrum prefers you answer more calls and not fix the customers problems. Most problems could be fixed during the phone call, but the matrix that needs to be followed does not allow this to happen."
bad,They push you hard and treat you harder. Half employees are on fmla due to stress related issues. Seen multiple ambulances called due to panic and anxiety attacks. Large new hire classes where only 2-3 people last more then 6 months out of 20 people. Managers treat employees like garbage and HR doesn't care. It's a horrible place to work. Inbound sales.
bad,"The company used to be employee and customer driven, now that they have merged it seems that their only motivator is money.  Supervisors come and go like a revolving door. Have to have broad shoulders as customers constantly come in and yell at you because of something that wasn't in your control at all.  Not a fulfilling place to work."
bad,Don't work here unless you intend on not using any if your skills besides customer service skills and the allow the customers to talk to you like garbage all day.
bad,I worked in the billing department...the employees are miserable in that department. There would be employees crying in the bathroom stalls or at there cubicles. The customers that call in are not that bad but the company is unethical with there employees and with there customers. I would not recommend working here. The turnover rate is really high here  because of this.
bad,Back to back calls and metrics are terrible. Always having to apologize for services not working. I worked there to long. Customers are ridiculous. No work from home options
bad,"I was with Spectrum for 6 years and earned multiple top Technician awards.  This company took my health, my marriage, and my life.  After my health started failing due to the job they threw me away like yesterday's newspaper.  I would strongly suggest against applying for this industry unless you want your life ruined."
bad,"Prepare to be punched, kicked, spit on, bit, stabbed, head butted, choked and cursed out. Kids ranging in age from 6-22. This is the most honest post."
bad,This company is absolutely horrible to work for. Its like a call sweat shop. All they care about is their numbers. Which mean nothing in the long run beceause your employees are miserable. Customers are not happy with a product that is always out or texhnology that launches and doesnt work consistently. But management only cares about the numbers. By the way dont even thi k about going anywhere in this company if you work an evening shift. Their quota numbers are impossible to reach unless you work a day shift. All the same employees get employee of the month and recognitions month after month. You would think they would adjust their metrics accordingly to give everyone a fair shot due to the type of caller that calls in and the type of problems that are trending during the different shifts. Any idiot with a brain can tell you this. But this company just doesnt care!
bad,"I went to work for this company because l thought being my own boss wasn't worth it, but l was truly wrong. I will be quitting my job real soon. You can't take time off unless you have accumulated. Not worth the time or money."
bad,"At first it seemed great! But the management is unprofessional discusses confidential information with other reps. Upper management and their open door policy Is a joke because they just hold down the floor supervisor when they are wrong and go back and tell them everything you say. Every other day there is a new policy to take away ways to get sales but the goal does not reflect the changes. They just lowered the commission scale so everyone is getting paid less. If they don’t like you and you make a mistake, they hold it against you and get rid of you! Horrible place to work the company is not employee friendly at all!!!"
bad,You are giving too many jobs and not enough time to do them without getting overwhelmed. Tools were supplied along with materials. Free cable internet and phone.
bad,I personally did not like working for this company. On a daily basis you got verbally abused by clients. The management when i worked there was not good. They wouldn't allow you to really use the bathroom unless you were on break. While i was pregnant i got reprimanded for using the bathroom to much and when i was put on bed rest they kept threatening to fire me while i had a doctors request for the bed rest and i kept in contact with the person who was supposed to be handling everything to the point where i ended up having to quit because of the way i was treated.
bad,very high stress position. unrealistic sales goals were often placed on the tech support agents. The companies merger with spectrum was handled poorly.
bad,"I would sincerely not recommend working for this company in this specific position unless you are content with being asked to clock out and continue to work, mandatory overtime that is put in your schedule same day at the BEGINNING of your shift (not even short notice--- NO notice), and very, very poor and negative management and coaching procedures. There is so much more I can say about this terrible company but I will leave it at this: It is by far the worst place I have ever worked."
bad,"Never knew when we were getting off of work, was belittled and cussed at by another employee in front of customers, training not good, manager only in office once a week, worked alone a lot safety issues (was only one in building for 8 hrs), a lot of call offs and customers were very irritated their bills went up all the time, was a lot of favoritism and was pushed to sell cable services"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"""Account executive"" means outdoor business door to door knocking. They just give you a list of addresses and you show up and try to sell Spectrum services. If you are in a legacy charter area, steer clear. In my market we were at about 80 percent market penetration and had about 50 sales reps. Spectrum will lure you in with their commission structure, but you'll soon realize that its near unobtainable. Some of the best reps on my team that had been there for years were not hitting the monthly quota consistently, and they had multiple referral partners."
bad,"It is very much like High School. If you are in with a Supervisor, you will have job security. If you are not however, they will eventually find a way to terminate you. Although there is a 1-5% raise annually. NOBODY gets above 3% unless you are the favorite of your supervisor.Although you receive 2 weeks of vacation, you more than likely cannot get the days you request because it is automated and most times the system will decline your request or take up to 2 weeks to approve."
bad,Horrible place to work they have a metric system that wil not allow you to advance in pay they are having problems with the there equipment and they blame the tech
bad,"Metrics system is just crazy. Some good managers some bad, very high turnover people usually work there 3 months and leave because they cant take the pressure, its high stress job, pay for NY cost of life still not good enough good thing is you get free internet and free cable etc... Not bad if you live with your parents and job security is not an issue."
bad,there less than an year and everything has changed since I started. Constantly changing leadership. everyone hates their jobs including management and it shows.
bad,"Spectrum is a terrible place to work.  Charter is run by a cable maverick from the 60's who bought Time Warner stripped it down, lowered pay and increased benefit costs.  Avoid working for this company.  There is a reason it is one of the most hated corporations in America.  They run it like a prison."
bad,"Most disorganized company I have ever worked for, including upper management. Some employees would should 1-2 hours late per day and no corrective action was done."
bad,The only plus at working for Spectrum was my supervisor working with my Army Reserves schedule. The pay was minimal and the work was tiring. The training does not transfer well between companies.
bad,"Spectrum took away one of the best benefits you had working as an agent. Scorecard payout. Essentially, you would get a bonus every month for being a great agent. Even if you weren't a top agent and in the middle, you'd still get a piece. They took away holiday parties, at home service benefits (which you now have to pay for with a discount on some products), Work from home option,   and the list will go on. I was lucky to have experienced being a part of TWC, because now I know where I set my standards."
bad,"What is told at training ends up being different that what was represented. You are recorded, analyzed, and screen saved for every MINUTE of every day. There is constant issues with the surveillance software and when there is a dispute the software prevails. The negative publicity in Social Media on national news prompted a firing spree. Beware, any issues that may arise among the thousands of calls is good press for their executives."
bad,"When it was Charter, it was a good company with good people. But once upon a time... some imbecile decided that a merger with Time Warner would be good for everybody. right... Well all the bad stuff that TW had, we got it, all the good stuff we had we lost it. Management is deplorable to say the least, and they are only focused on share holders, and that's the bottom line. This company had a vision and they lost it! They goal is just to make money no matter what it takes! Maybe some big company will come and buy Spectrum and rid of all the bad apples. Wishing upon a star...."
bad,"Hands down, the worst company I have ever worked for. They want you chained to a desk for 8 hours a day. No breaks unless scheduled. Mandatory overtime on a minute notice and that went on for months on end. They are a billion dollar industry that offers bare minimum in salary and commission and offer no sort of hardship for those employees who face such times. No raise in over 2 years. Director is a revolving door of outcasts let go from other departments in other parts of the world as assigned by the CEO. They hire outside people for supervisory roles rather than promote qualified and educated sales reps that have worked hard to advance. This brings a whole other sort of problems like now supervisors have no clue how to use our programs, they are not properly trained, they are thrown on to the floor to sink or swim and subsequently quickly fired. They do not promote within. Management/Leadership, I would equate to Third World Country mentality. I know people from other departments that do not feel this way. My only recommendation is that you NEVER work in direct/inbound sales. EVER."
bad,"Now the culture is mobile phone sales. If I wanted that I would work for a cell carrier. The residential sales agent, has nothing to do with sales. You are mainly a customer service rep. Customers call in with more complaints than customers to sell too. If you are looking for a first time job, this is the place. This is not a longterm job unless you are willing to move out of state."
bad,"Welcome to Spectrum with a promising Future. WHAT A JOKE. I worked for Spectrum for 9 months and was completely disgusted. You will getting written up for being Seconds Late from breaks and lunches. NO LUNCH BREAK OVER 30 MINS. If you have a pattern of being 1 min late on a few occasions YOU WILL BE TERMINATED. The door is revolving, not because anyone is quitting but simply because people are getting fired for NO JUSTIFIABLE REASON. They train you to lie to the customers and rush them off the phone. If the customer ask you to call them back to help them, you will get in trouble for making outbound calls. Everything that you think you're doing right its a reason for a corrective action. This place felt like PRISON...... If you are looking for Job Security this is NOT THE PLACE. In technical support you are forced to Sale / Migrate customer's accounts from TWC to SBPP know as spectrum. There is no incentives / bonuses. This Company DO NOT CARE about there employee's. Only thing they do to reward you is give you a Free Jean day pass.... SERIOUSLY....."
bad,I did retention with spectrum. I found myself going home and snapping on my significant other due to myself becoming extremely short tempered as a result of taking irate calls all day. You’re held accountable for well-known unrealistic goals.  The micromanagement makes you want to cringe. It isn’t a healthy environment and I do not suggest this to anyone whatsoever. You aren’t valued. You being 1 second late from work twice a month will get you fired - even after you working with the company for 20 years.
bad,this is the worse company I have ever worked for.  The culture is toxic and the managers are terrible.  Nobody took responsibility for anything there. It is a very very stressful job.  Most of the people there are on medication.  Do not work for this company.
bad,"The good old days of Bright House are long gone. This was a typical company buyout where smaller company buys larger companies then hopes for the best with a plan not well thought out. Spectrum Mobile is the latest endeavor, however, the workforce to sell it will face many challenges to keep the dream alive. As a result, jobs are cut and the middle management down to entry level suffers. Work to hire state so jobs at Spectrum are always on the chopping block."
bad,"Company is in the IT industry but is still run by old head.  The work culture is from 1900's. Not a good company to advance the career."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,as far as a csr  this is the worst job ever they  change things every week don't tell us when things change nobody on same pages custimers have to wait over an hour to talk to a manager worst company to work for since they switch from bright house to spectrum
bad,Spectrum in Colorado Springs Colorado was a cool place to work but managment sucked. They were biast and too strict you get fired for having to call off at all
bad,"When I started it was great- the commission and bonuses meant if you were even above average at the job you’d take home anywhere from 5500 to 8000 a month, and there was little to no stress at all. Now the constant micromanaging and the changes to the incentives have made it incredibly stressful for half the pay. A lot of the higher ups have left and the new director is apparently only filling positions from outside the company instead of promoting from within, so it’s even more of a dead end job. "
bad,"Very bad experience at this company.  With exception to the benefits and compensation, there is really not much to be said in a positive light.  There is minimal opportunity to progress in one's career and the current leadership lacks management expertise or direction. There is an expectation for working very long hours with no appreciation.  Disability discrimination and harassment is commonplace and not corrected by the poorly trained HR group.  Leadership cannot forecast growth properly and growth/spending is out of control."
bad,"Charter/Spectrum"
bad,"A typical day at work: "
bad,"*0% work life balance"
bad,"Those promoted are friends and are in clicks.  Advancement is not based on experience, skills, and professionalism.  Pins and needles is what it felt like working at Spectrum."
bad,"Not an employee or customer friendly environment, extremely stressful, decreased many employee perks and benefits, no customer care for internal or external customers"
bad,"Working at Spectrum was definitely something different for me at first the only hours available were those late at night and chances to change shift will come but it’s not definite that you will even get what you want when the time comes. If your looking for something to make advancements in and for a long term career... look somewhere else. The management doesnt really care about your personal issues although they say they do, the only thing they actually care about are your numbers and what you are doing for them not factoring in that your still a human.  Also the company as a whole is pretty unorganized they are never clear on when they are releasing something new or doing an update to something, although they literally have set dates for things nothing ever goes as planned or on time so your stuck dealing with irate customers because something went wrong with the update and now you have to explain to bunch of people why they don’t have their cable or some other issue. But to be fair the benefits are good in terms of 401k and health and dental but in my own opinion I do think the employees should be getting paid more for what they have to deal with on a daily basis."
bad,The work is boxed cubicles.  They won't let you even look up motivational stress relief qoutes.  They miscommunicate progression within the company (its very difficult to get off of the phones so if you are trying to utilize getting into the call center just to go to another department- typically  you may have higher education or a greater skill set- you will be stuck at the call center for a painful year.  I have medical bills based off of stress alone from working at spectrum.
bad,Charter came in and changed everything for the worse and bought down the morale of the company. They don't care about their employees at all and make them aware of it as well. They make you feel you have to be conniving to customers to meet their unrealistic expectations. You feel as if you are being treated as a slave. Time Warner treated us much better and didn't make us feel we were just a number. They have made it a miserable experience to work for them and everyday is a dread.
bad,they changed my  job description from csr for phone/internet to billing. the customer typed changed and i was not trained  to handle people who wanted service and did not want to pay for it. that line of reasoning i could not understand. i got let go because of this.
bad,"Job wasn't as bad when it was twc. Just like the customers say Spectrum sucks and it does! So many changes and you aren't informed until hours later through email or a supervisor yelling it across the call center. "
bad,I have been in sales a long time.  When I started here I was told nothing but lies.  I think it should be partially blamed on them implementing a new internal system.  There are many dishonest people who work here and finger pointing galore.  This place is time warner with a new coat of paint all over again.  Beware!
bad,My employment was with Time Warner.  I have no idea of what changes were made when Spectrum took over. Time Warner was a dead end for me. The only thing I gained was a in depth knowledge of the cable industry to build on my communication knowledge.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,The 24-hour format they use is not your typical news set up.  Stories repeat constantly with sometimes little to no local content. They expect lots of content with very few people.
bad,"This is easily the worst place I've ever worked.  The leadership was poor and dismissive.  My colleagues were intrusive and harassing.  To be honest, I would never wish working at Charter on my worst enemy (although they belong together).  "
bad,Management attempts to keep agents unaware of current information. Policies and procedures became much more difficult after Time Warner Cable merged to become spectrum. Performance bonuses went away and now all agents' metrics compete on a bell curve. Those at the bottom of the bell curve potentially face termination.
bad,They micromanaged every single thing you do while working here. Its a script that you have to follow and you can not sway away from. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,Company promises moving line of compensation that makes earning impossible. Upper management not in touch with sales field and makes limiting choices for sales reps and ability to cold call
bad,Severe lack of career advancement as well as a severe lack of annual raise(s) and they decided to then base your job security on the amount of commission based sales per each call that came into you every month.
bad,"managers and supervisors only care about themselves and their bonuses which is why they are pen happy with write-ups. HR has not clue what they are doing, always referring you to the wrong department when it should be handled by them directly. Don't expect a decent schedule, nor should you expect that they will work with your school schedule. To them Spectrum should be your number one priority, not family, nor school, or much of anything else."
bad,"the management is not truthful they withhold information from employees regarding their future with the company,seem to play favorites. always indulging in rumor mill, and never deal with any issues directly, always pushes issues off on someone else."
bad,My experience with charter spectrum was a horrible choice I made. I left my previous job to commit to a company who DOES NOT treat employees fairly. HR is completely unorganized and apon hiring the  recruiter  Ask when are they days you need off? But HR DOES NOT CONSIDER THE DAYS THAT YOU REQUESTED. Unprofessional staff who  engage in call center drama; Have tons of rules but the company it self does not honor them themselves. If you are someone who is looking for a JOB(check) and not a CAREER(5plusYears) this is definitely the place for you to be! Good luck!
bad,"A typical day is very hectic with some managers providing little to no directions but expecting thorough results. "
bad,don't know enigh about this company to rate them.  Please do your research.  Not appropriate for me to respond on this organization.  Hopefully that are doing well and providing an excellent service.
bad,Tons of great coworkers...The numbers they want you to achieve are insane. The pay plan is even worse ....you are always  told you can do better even when you kill it ...very bad / stressful work place. Every one is looking for a job so they can quit!  Think twice before you take this job!  You will be job hunting shortly after training I promise !
bad,"The company as a whole treats the techs horribly. The bonus is always tampered with, they will find excuses to stop you from progression which equal raises, andsend you in the field with broken equipment and penalize you if it malfunctions in someone's home."
bad,"I was verbally abused and bullied at work by another employee and Spectrum did not do a thing about the situation due to that persons numbers were high. I made one mistake with a call. And was terminated. I never had a written, verbal, or any corrective action on file yet one bad call i was terminated."
bad,"Greenwood Village - lack of qualified management makes this a horrible environment. They will do anything to keep their inflated salaries. People are robots. Everyone is miserable. Lots of back stabbing, cliques and immature people"
bad,"After working here for a while I noticed that not all of the sells I made were guaranteed to be installed. This should be made aware of during the interview process. Technicians will show up to appointments without cable/tv equipment for customers, postponing the installation date inconveniencing the customer and ultimately canceling the install with no communication to the sales rep. Technicians also tell customers anything to get out of having to install/ work that day, canceling your install for no logical reason. I’ve missed out on 10 sells in 3 months due to technicians, with a very low base salary of $24k. Stressful to say the least."
bad,Strictly metric performance evaluation without introspect to the parameters of evaluation. Arbitrary percentages are the only thing that matters. Not a true indication of job performance.
bad,"I won't ever work there again. They don't hire great people to work there. No matter how much work you have done for the company, or how long you've been there, they will terminate you the first chance they get."
bad,"There is not a life work balance.  They do what they see fit for themselves not the employee.  Even though other employees get to do the items you want to do.  Micro management is through the roof.  Your suppose to be done at 7 yet they are still taking on same day calls and scheduling you to roll to them.  Overbooking at its finest and have multiple screenshots to prove it.  Once dispatch gets it out of there hands they don't care about it."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Charter bought TWC it seems after the purchase Charter cut cost cutting our commission and job tools we used  to execute our job function this cause a very low morale in the company not a fun place to work
bad,Ever since Spectrum took over Time Warner Cable it has gone downhill. For the last 2 years I was very unhappy in my position. I had been with the company just shy of 12 yrs.
bad,IF OFFERED DON'T DO IT ...Managemet is not good.  This is a dead in job with no advancement.  Not to mention the office where I worked moved which left us jobless.
bad,"Disappointed. I loved everything about TWC. The change was hard for everyone including those in management. However, the fact that TWC employees lost their voice during transition was my breaking point. We watched customers come and go. It became a numbers game instead of people caring about you or your well being. Spectrum can be for you if you're interested in high call volume and selling. However, if you prefer a casual call center with proper training and structure then this isn't for you."
bad,"Working for this company actually gave me panic attacks. Stay AWAY! Management was never there for you, never knew what changes would occur until that day. Policies and procedures would change it seemed on a daily basis. Only good thing was free cable and internet!"
bad,"They pushed out all experienced employees and made it a cold place to work. Management lied and brought in inexperienced kids, some with zero work history, to work a position that requires extensive experience."
bad,A typical day at work is very stressful. Expected to sale products and reach a number that is unattainable. Also cannot reach out to management for assistance as they are always busy.
bad,Typical day at work is open to close. The hardest part of the job is trying to reach unattainable numbers when it comes to sales. You are given vacation days although you can't use them without being called off of vacation.
bad,Leave and never return I actually hate people after this job. this are always change and honestly that wouldn't be a bad thing but as an employee they change and you get updated after the fact. people are always calling and yelling about what they never did or we did right this job to be completely honest with you not worth what they are offered and the offers are not that great anymore.
bad,"as Bright House Networks it was a small, employee friendly company."
bad,"Constantly being live monitored and coached; coachings were repetitive; company decided to let the cat out of the bag as to our department being closed, but would not let us know as to when it would be closing; did not take into effect that people's livelihoods were on the line; when asked when dept closure was going to take place, management advised us not to worry about it but to make sure our daily goals were met in order not to be terminated prior to when department was going to be shut down permanently;"
bad,No room for advancement.  High turnover.  Metrics are unreasonable.  Let a tech do a good job and not be rushed.  lack of support.  no advancement opportunity.New tech are hired at higher rate of pay than old one.
bad,the customer ratings depends on you keep your position even if you are delivering excellent service even though there service is terrible but customer ding you in the survey's
bad,"Store is usually busy---with office hours, we are often short handed.  I've learned that advancement is near impossible. Monthly sales goals are high."
bad,This company was a very stressful place to work. The management was poor and I felt like I was alone and had to make decisions which I believed was for managment
bad,Not a stable company to work for. If you aren't apart of a click you will not get promoted. They rarely promote people that actually know what they are doing.
bad,"The merge between Time Warner Cable and Charter communications brought with it changes for the worse.  The treatment of both the customers and the employees is horrible.  Time Warner Cable was an amazing place to work.  They took care of us and in return we took care of the customers and the company.  Charter Communications is a terrible company make poor business decisions.  They have lost valuable, successful employees by the dozens and customer as well.  I highly recommend not working there!"
bad,Worst place to work I work in NYC area we are union but currently on strike because company wants to cut our medical and pensions management sucks they don't know the system but want to penalize techs for it horrible place to work go find a job elsewhere.
bad,Great job for people who love to troubleshoot and work outdoors. Winters can be harsh but so can the summers. Its not for everyone but its definitely a lucrative career.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"A typical day at work consists of alot of people chit chatting while customers are on hold for help and non professional. I've learned that in order to be taken serious you need to actually use the ""open door policy"" to tell your boss your there to stay. Management changes rules to make life easier for themselves or to better their pockets. A handful of employees will actually show up to take care of their job properly. The most enjoyable part of the job is to feel the satisfaction of making a customers' day by relating to them and giving great customer service."
bad,"Tier 1 agents handle absolutely anything and everything with so many metrics there's no way you meet all of them. You are on the phone for 8 hours a day. Not allowed to hang up on customers ever even if they use derogatory language towards you. Co-workers are cool, you'll go through training for 8 weeks and hit the floor and feel like you learned nothing at all. the most enjoyable part is when you clock out and can enjoy the free tv at home. hardest part is meeting all of the metrics and not a flexible schedule whatsoever."
bad,"Typical call center environment, weekly quotas, customer facing goals, sales driven, high stress environment, consistent inconsistencies with practices and procedures"
bad,"Typical day is having customers come in to disconnect service. its more of a customer service based job, not a sales job. management is slim to none. little to no training. Company gives customers the run around and it is all then taken out on the rep in the store."
bad,i worked there for 10 years in the field i turned 52 i was also degraded by management due to my having FMLA then i was fired i did file with unemployment and they sided with me saying management could not tell the truth
bad,"I really can't say many positive things about the working environment for this company, with the exception of the training programs and benefits.  The Sales culture is very cut-throat, unethical, and very political.  I found many in the sales department, including management, to be conniving and back stabbing.  Management is not very supportive or motivational when it came to sales account resolution and account protection.  Sales reps would openly steal accounts and take credit for orders that someone else would bring to the company.  Management would just look the other way.  Not a healthy working environment at all for sales, perhaps other departments are not this dysfunctional, not sure."
bad,Company is being sold.  Management appears to care but when the time comes they will turn and not help their employees.   I would not recommend this employer. Not from past experience or with the company being sold and shifting ownership.
bad,work granted job flexible busy day lot of calls and research per day co workers are friendly no room to grow pay is not good hardest part of the job is rude customers
bad,"I honestly can't say very many good things about my time here. 98% of the calls are from people who want to tell you how much they hate Time Warner & how awful the service is. It's very hard to try and stay positive in a place like this where you are surrounded by negativity all day long. The schedule is awful, you have to work every weekend (depending on which shift you get put on) and can only get a better schedule after enduring 6 awful months on your original schedule. Even then, you may or may not be eligible to transfer to a better schedule. You have to do really well with sales, and other things that they judge you on daily. Every single call that you are on IS being recorded and will be listened to at some point. You literally have to walk on egg shells. I've never been more stressed in my life with a job. Now on the upside, you do get free cable & internet as well as good health benefits.......BUT, as far as I am concerned those things are not as important to me as my sanity is. My personal advice, don't do it. Find a job somewhere else."
bad,"No time with family "
bad,This is a terrible company to work for the hours are terrible the pay is terrible but the health care is good. But it does not make up for the amount of BS you have to deal with and the BS they put you through. You have to be a real callused  to work for time warner cable because if you can stand being yelled at all day everyday and constantly being insulted then this is the best job in the world other wise I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Hardships are coming from upper management. Unable to enjoy work there.
bad,It was hard for me to advance within the company when in fact I was interviewed on numerous occasions as well as had second interviews.I am college educated and I witness numerous people that were promoted due to popularity was dumb as a wit.
bad,"I worked particularly for ""Time Warner Cable Business Class"". The benefits were good,however, the management was very poor. They didn't really know what they are doing and didn't really understand their positions and/or responsibilities. They always wanted us to handle our own issues for example; if a business owner was unhappy with a scheduled appointment for their installation and asked to speak with a supervisor they would do anything to avoid taking the call, asking us to ""own the call"". This was a typical day to day issue working for them Im really not sure why management was there. They claimed to be there to help us and make our jobs easier when in fact it was the total opposite, to making their jobs easier for themselves. My co-workers would complain about the same things but rather than voicing their opinions would sit there and simply take it. Other than trying to find ways to write you up, management would micro-manage day to day sitting there listing to your calls and at time focusing only on one person to get them written up and/or fired. I really dislike the fact that they lied to the new hirees, they would be lied to about their position they were being trained to do for example; being trained for order entry then told they had to working in the scheduling department answering calls all day long. People would be forced to move to other positions they didn't desire to work in. They would put us on mandatory over time even weekends and send emails with only a few hours notice even on the weekends!!"
bad,Hachette book group purchased this company and fired 30 life time technical employees in one day and outsourced to Tata.  I saw grown men cry.  One of the most despicable cold hearted corporate mentalities I ever witnessed.  It was a life changing event.  The lowest of the low.
bad,I have learned alot of new skills with charter bad side the customers can be very rude
bad,"Answer phones nonstop. Have every call audited. Have supervisors listen to your calls sitting next to you.  Make 2 sales attempts on every call, even if the customer is screaming at you or canceling.  They tell you to take only 30 calls per day, despite working 8 hours, having the average call last only 6-10 minutes, and not having a way to take break between calls. Honestly this job is horrible. There is a reason they are always hiring."
bad,no reasonable path for advancement. Low pay. You are just treated like a number and are replaceable.
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work here unless you are just desperate for a job. All I will say is that it is not uncommon for an ambulance to be called to the call center several times a week for employees having various stress related events.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Management there seems to care only about themselves, and it is apparent. There is no sense of helping others, and stress is through the roof because their horrible customer service practices pit you against the customer. The only benefit is that they give discounted services to employees."
bad,these people are just like Comcast don't work for them please i urge you go to school or learn a trade these jobs are bad
bad,"To sum it all up and not be to wordy."
bad,we are required to write some thing. Time Warner as a Company is a great company to work for unfortunately where I work at its special.
bad,Management is a complete mess as well as HR. Most fellow employees are incompetent and lazy.
bad,managment need to be cross trainned. You dont have to much help from your dispatch department
bad,Worked there for 12 months. It was a terrible experience and a terrible environment. Awful managers and supervisors and a repetitive and tedious work experience.
bad,Extremely stressful environment to work in. Terrible management. Compares to slave ship. I would never be so cruel as to pass along anyone's resume to HR. No one deserves such punishment.
bad,"It is unfortunate senior leadership has failed to develop and communication a clear vision for the business. The new CEO has brought his buddies from Cablevision who have replicated the business model they were familiar with, not what is needed for Charter. There is a lack of respect for employees and absolutely no collaboration between management and employees. Every functional area operates in silos and the management style is by intimidation."
bad,Entered the company as a CCA (Customer Care Associate) and promised that money would be fast and easy to make. Interviewers will lie to anyone applying just to get you in the door and the promises so far have never come true for anyone...
bad,"The field service position is treated like a production job with a set amount of points you must get each day to earn your keep.If you do a quality job at each stop then you will not reach your total points for the day and they find a way to fire you.Time warner cable does not care about your house, they only care about how many jobs they can close each day.I know because i worked there."
bad,"Fire and burglar alarms, wiring and programmed alarm panels for commercial and residential accounts."
bad,Horrible experience lower management is inconsistent and very rude .
bad,"This is by far the worst job I ever worked. I don't know why I worked it so long. We were required to stay on the phones 98% of our shifts, granted we were given 2 fifteen minute breaks. You can't go to use the bathroom or anything in between time because it messes with your productivity, and they will write you up if it is under the target 98%. SALES IS A REQUIREMENT!! If you don't hit their sales goals (mind you this is for the CSR, not sales positions), you might as well fire yourself! It never happened to me, but I seen it happen to many people! They don't care about your longevity in this company, they will still FIRE you! Management is really just there for show. No matter what you go to them with, the issue is rarely solved. There are a few really good supervisors, but for the most part they don't care about trying to help you. You sink or swim on your own. The co-workers are friendly, which surprised me because it is such a horrible workplace. There were no enjoyable parts of the job, and the hardest part of the job was getting up everyday just to go there. I wouldn't recommend this position to my worst enemy!! I lost so much weight working there because of the stress, and because the job is just completely UNREASONABLE!!"
bad,"great benefits , but they ask so much of you but cant give you answers when wanting to know something very important"
bad,Worked for this company for 5 years was great until new management took over. Turn over rate is horrible management is horrible. Not a career. Very stressful work place
bad,"Training is cut short because of understaffed teams. turnover is extremely high.  Micro managed to extremes. Once you find a groove they change everything on you. Policy changes about once a month.  Told to work safely, but when you see a issue management just says Get it done however you need to. Even if the pole is not safe to climb. you get 45 min to do a job that takes 3 hours. they add more things for you to do on each job to stay in compliance but don't offer any more time to do them. get used to being at the bottom. everything funnels down onto your shoulders. customer service reps, and routers can break rules and keep you out 3+ hours after shift end."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,The training is terrible and inconsistent.  They don’t protect their employees in the sense you have to take verbal abuse.  It is so stressful there that they made a quiet room for employee breaks.
bad,"Spectrum is a high stress, unflexible working environment.  You can only take your breaks and lunches at a specific time (breaks 2 hrs and 7hrs in, lunch right in the middle 4 hours in, no variations).  Only 10% of staff was allowed to take vacation on a single day, which for my team (we worked early AM shift) was one person a day.  If someone was already off and you couldn't get anyone to cover your shift, you were screwed.  And if you take sick time, if it shows any kind of pattern, you get documentation (whether you've accrued it or not).  The work environment made you feel like you were chained to your desk and that at a stroke of a hat you could be gone.  Turn over was outrageous.  The department next to mine had to have a specific HR rep assigned and stationed there due to the altercations (sometimes physical) and yelling matches happening between employees.  I tried moving up 10 times in the last 3 years I was with the company after demonstrating I wanted additional responsibility by taking on special projections.  After getting nowhere, I decided my time there was done and moved on.  At my exit interview, they told me ""my time was coming.""  After 10 times, I highly doubted it."
bad,Company has very poor priorities  making money for the company is priority number one   Managers have only one job to produce numbers   No advancements ever from wit
bad,"TEAM-Together Everybody Achieves More. That's what the Spectrum Video Repair Call Center lacks. I started to realize that this wasn't a place I wanted to work at after I completed training. First day on the floor and supervisors were very hostile and not so helpful and rude about helping new employees. From my previous Sales Trainer and Management experience I knew this was wrong. Those new employees depend on their supervisors to guide them when they need help. This wasn't the case at Spectrum. There was an occurrence where a coworker asked a Supervisor a question in regard to call that she was on. This supervisor told her to ask someone else while she was eating behind her desk (mind you she was not on lunch). This wasn't her direct supervisor but that doesn't matter. If I were this supervisor, I would've stopped what I was doing (in this case eating) and helped my colleagues’ employee with her issue. Supervisor should be able to depend on other supervisors when they're not around. This is what that TEAM workplace mentality is about. When a supervisor shuts down an employee they feel like they can't go to them. That's only one of the occurrences that I saw which made me think twice about Spectrum.  Secondly, some of the leads need to get off their high horse and do their job without making employees feel like they're a bother. I as a Rep disliked using the AAT tool when specific individuals were working as leads. Only because they were so rude about helping their peers. Third, Mangers! It'd be nice to visit your teams every once and awhile. It lets your team members know that"
bad,"Management shows favoritism and only cares for those in their inner circle. Everyone else is expendable. Job security is non-existent now. The culture in the call center is Every man for himself.  Every week, atleast 3 to 4 people in my department were fired. Management team up with HR to harass you and force you to quit."
bad,"Work life balance was a challenge. Advancements in company are based on who you know."
bad,Horrible customers that are always angry that their promotion expired  terrible lazy management and leadership  many employees have nervous breakdowns  ITS TRULY THAT BAD
bad,"Spectrum is a very greedy company when it comes to a dollar. The commission pay out is unfair for the front store representatives, and now they have start mobile service the commission pay out is a joke. If you set up a customer with mobile and they may have 4 lines of business you will on get credit for one line, and your sales goal is so high."
bad,"I do not recommend anyone ever work here. The managers and supervisors want you off the phones in 10mins or less, and are using the metrics constantly looking for ways to fire you. The information they give at meetings is largely unhelpful. The computers are garbage, the customers are entitled. The only good thing I would say are the benefits. Other than that, if you have a college degree and certifications, avoid this place at all cost."
bad,Management are extremely unprofessional and lack basic human understanding. They care more about your performance than your well-being. The only way to promote within the bias system is to be friends with people in power. Employees are subject to harassment and continually put in positions to either quit or get fired in call center settings.
bad,"This place is a joke! You will notice Spectrum always has job postings. Why? The turnover rate is insane! 90 percent of the attrition is from attendance. Per management if you call in sick on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday, you go straight to final written. You are expected to report to work regardless of how sick you might be. Go in and get your co-workers sick so they can get sick and call in and get fired. Management is STUPID!"
bad,"I advanced to lead Billing specialist for residential properties in 3 months. The amount of call ratio to leads is extremely high. You’re forced to sit at your chair all day and de-escalate situations wether it be an irate customer due to billing discrepancies or because the agent who escalated the call to the lead made them angry. All in all management does not care about leads just metrics(handle time). Most times sups agents and managers often complain about leads but that is because they get angry that we pass the call forward when the customer is still irate. This will be first and last call center for me. And for being my first and advancing quickly, I regret. Shoulda stayed as a regular agent."
bad,"Used to be, back in about 2017, Spectrum would train you up on the newest billing updates, what to say and how to approach those angry customers on the phone. Then, the charges would raise on the bills with a month of advance warning and little-to-no acknowledgement outside of that initial ""hey, more angry customers are on the way, hope you can hold onto your sanity!"""
bad,"Extremely unorganized  "
bad,Time Warner Cable was a warm friendly work environment which promoted individuals growth. Spectrum is  numbers driven company and worries more about the business needs versus the employees which should have a healthy balance. The newest VP of Customer Install Support clearly state this on his first day.
bad,"This company's pay is very well, but for the stressful environment, it should be. The company teaches from the beginning that it is company driven, not customer oriented. Saving the customers money is the least that they expect of the ""customer service""."
bad,"My experience with them is limited, however their policy of working from a central location to where the department is located is short sighted.   Their policies caused a loss of a large pool of talent, and the current policy keeps rotating contract employees in and out, without doing any real effort to retain them. The strict work policies has left employees miserable, and the tension is evident from the atmosphere in several work environments.   They appear to be bending on their policies, but my overall impression, is that they were a small company trying to run a major company with small company rules, and are just starting to figure out that they have to change."
bad,Nobody cares at all about anything or anyone as a human. It is numbers only with micro micro micro management with your every move. Employees get no say and its all negative treatment and negative motivation tactics. Pure evil leadership.
bad,"Nobody is responsible for anything. The common response is, ""not in my swim lane."" The issue with that is the forward facing technician has to get everything working for the customer but restrictions to how we do are job are ridiculous. Once calling in for help on coding issues or things outside of the norm, you are met with no help. Travel distance between jobs are way too far. The hourtimeframes are unrealistic... A very stressful working environment. are"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,They work you to death. I work 3 weeks worth of hours in 2 weeks. We work 6 days a week and probably would be 7 if the store wasn't closed on Sundays. Dont know if its illegal or not but when I gets busy they take your lunch. Very under staff so you do double the work and the money is decent only because of how much over time you work. Listen when I tell you dont work for this company. I REPEAT DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY.
bad,Not interested in divulging I just simply did not enjoy working there. I was not there long enough vut the department I worked in was struggling and they were losing people left to right.
bad,"Charter(Spectrum) purchased Time Warner Cable. We had 1200 employees in the area. You either had to relocate to Denver or Charlotte or were Rif'd. They expected 40% of workers to agree to uproot their families. When only 5 % seemed willing to do this, they became very belligerent and quit caring about the old TWC employees."
bad,"I used to think the management of the call center had my back. "
bad,"Pay is amazing!!! Management, job secutity, realistic expectations, flexibility with time off, even the commissions are all falling well below what they used to be.  If you don't mind verbal and mental abuse and working for a company that no longer believes in their employees or their mission then work for spectrum.  I won't lie they will pay you well but its not worth the stuff you have to put up with on a daily basis."
bad,"Horrible company to work for, lied about position I was hired for and had unrealistic sales goals. My manager didn’t care and had a horrible attitude."
bad,"It was a very stressful work environment that included disjointed middle management that was forced to implement unrealistic and delusional expectations on the employees regarding project planning deadlines and project launches. There was no life-work balance. No opportunities for career advancement unless on the rare opportunity you were willing to relocate to another part of the country. The senior management team is working off of an old, outdated business and workplace model from the early 2000’s so they are way behind the current innovative working environments of top companies. And, employees could not trust what they were told by senior management regarding any subject or topic."
bad,The environment is toxic and will certainly impact your home/family and your health. Spectrum does not want to hear your work is impacting your health. HR will support Management but cares nothing about you.
bad,"They rip you off on commission. Micro-manage the dsr force. You do not have enough leads to make a good income."
bad,"can i give them a half star? dont go there, dont go there,very poor supervision very poor management.they dont care how much they overload you with work, and they could care less about your family"
bad,This is a horrible place to work. The pay is less then you can make in the fast food industry and the environment is just terrible. Everyone I have ever spoke with about working here is no longer working here and would never consider going back.
bad,"Customers complained their bills were increasing every month.  The equipment would need to be swapped out every couple of weeks and programming stations would drop sound/picture.  Some services were removed from packages and billing remained the same."
bad,"If you thrive in an environment where you are not allowed to make decisions and enjoy micromanagement this is the place for you. The ""Executive leadership"" makes all of the decisions as they strive to retain the management approach from the pre-merger Charter model. Unfortunately it is not a sustainable model and the employees are paying the price for the narrow minded direction."
bad,"Aside from the normal stress of a call center, expect to have all organization problems based on ""the merger"" and the buck passed to the customer. The misuse and constant reorganization of their tools and the changing of the tech support to a customer service position has ensured a steady dip in the quality of employee and service across the board. Maitland is also consistently ranked as the lowest performing of all call centers."
bad,"The job itself was challenging but well worth the investment and efforts. Having a supportive management team helps to bear and maintain the load. Because the primary motive of the company and its management focuses on finding the flaws and faults in it's people versus finding the flaws in the system, proves to keep the company from truly being the future in innovation. When a company believes and strives to empower it's employees (strengthening the areas of weakness versus punishment), those same employees strive to work harder and pass that exact care to the customers. With the focus on ""punish them for being human” and “why pay them $13/hr (after 5 annual pay raises, mind you) when we can keep firing and hiring people to pay only $10” leaves the employees who have livelihoods to maintain and/or families to provide for, weary, fearful and focused on surviving versus thriving. The attitude and forward thinking culture is snuffed out and smothered from having all brainpower and energy diverted to and kept on ‘sustain-mode.’ Once the tools are set in place to frame a new practice of thriving, there would be nothing this company and its staff can not do! But until then, turning and burning the customers will be the mindset of the employees as the management turns and burns its employees."
bad,"This was absolutely a great place to work when I first started back in October 2017. Was a relaxed environment and the calls weren't so bad. Yet as our call volume grew it became very hectic and stressful. Due to the much higher call volume upper management suffered greatly and became very unorganized. As a result of a much higher call volume, upper management forced us to take calls that were out of our scope as well as getting rid of those specialized departments all together that would of handled them. We were then forced to take those calls. We were also poorly trained yet excepted to perform our new roles. They had long hours, short breaks, and an hour long lunch. Worked 9hrs a day with an hour lunch. The location is far and hidden. Had no regards for those with disabilities. Constantly being monitored, forced to get back into ready without consideration for our notes or any other work needed to be done before the next call. Constantly given the run around when it came to finding the correct answer to any questions or problems. There was plenty of favoritism, not much room for  growth due to using an inadaquate system for our stats. Some stats had nothing to do with our performance, only opinions of the technician sent out. Did not listen to employees ideas, even when used by others as a go to. Also fired others that were on medical leave which is highly illegal. You've been forewarned."
bad,They always have a high call volume for good reason. They are a terrible company and customers have many issues with them. Not a company you want to take calls for. They are very strict and dont care about family circumstances. Each employee is just another number to them. Definitely recomend to run the other way and take any other option.
bad,I have worked for Spectrum (charter) for 4 years and contracted for 2 years prior to working directly with the company now. I have seen it all! To be frank this job is terrible now. When I came in you made around 12.50/hr with experience but now as of the last couple of months they start you out at 15. Thats fine and all but the people that have been here longer did not receive any pay bump to compensate for the raised starting pay. So naturally you have employees that are Ft3 (field tech level 3) that make barely $16 thats worked their way up from lower wages that are barely making more than new employees that havent seen cable before. I am one of the youngest senior technicians in my region. You can no longer progress just from experience and time in the field with good numbers. Now you are required to take online college like classes that have little to nothing to do with anything technicians work with or possibly will ever be in a position to do. These classes are very long and take up much time to do and is very hard for any adult with a family that also sometimes gets home past 9pm after starting your day at 8am to do. Now scorecards are the worst. They change just about every year and only get more ridiculous each year. Now as it stands you are expected to make 90% of your production of a 120 point qouta. This is weighted 40% of each months scorecard. It doesn't sound that hard until you try doing it and making sure you dont get a repeat( cust calls in within 30 days of you being there). Repeats are weighted at 50% of your scorecard. You would think its easy since its
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"you get a total of 8 weeks of training 4 in a class and 4on the phone and soon as you get on the phone the stress starts because they have business rules and even when you follow them you still end up in the office. Customers will call to get they bill lower and even if they are able to get a promo your sup will still tell you don't give them one. Its so money driven even if the customer tells you they can't afford they're bill they still want you to continue upselling. Then you have the sales department just adding phone and streaming to people account even though the customer has told them over and over that they don't want it, and when they call to have it removed. spectrum wants you to try to save a service that was automatically added and they never wanted it in the first place. The money was good but now if you miss 3 days (even if you have a legit reason and excuse) they take a percentage of your commission. currently looking for a new job"
bad,"Although I learned a lot there, the company's culture is very toxic.   It is not a company who takes care of their customers or their employees. Management rewards manipulative and deceiving leaders. Very conservative and old fashioned, they still work like they are in the 70s. They pay well and benefits are okay, but it is not worth the time you invest as they don't care about your career."
bad,This job is low tier based on not having the employees best interest at heart. Co-workers has dedicated a lot of time with no signs of advancing in the workplace. Spectrum has a lack of leadership which you can sense once you step a foot at the job.
bad,I found that in this position there limited ability to find a work life balance. In other positions within the company I found there was more stability and there was more support in daily operations.
bad,"Formerly a Time Warner Cable employee acquired by Charter Spectrum and saw everything around me fall apart via poor management and fear tactics. HR always sided with management disregarding EEOC and ADA legal requirements."
bad,"only good benefit is free services, otherwise a terrible place to work.  Management sucks, you can ask 3 different people the same question and get 3 different answers.  Customers are terrible and you're just expected to sit there and take it."
bad,"I will never work for Charter Communications again. There is no leadership and the management is awful. I was hired as a contractor and let go 3 months into a 6 month project due to ""funding"". I resigned from a good job to work at Charter/Spectrum and they left me in a bind."
bad,May be the worst place for customer service representatives that I have ever encountered. No communication or care for their employess at all. They also work in a buddy system type of atomosphere where if you come to actually work and not socialize you will have trouble advancing in your career.
bad,"The Greenville site has taken many hits lately and is NOT going to fare well. The site leaders are fine, but Corporate leaders don't have a clue. They don't WANT to get to know the employee base, all they want you to do is sell by any means. When they get caught doing something unethical, the company defends itself by saying they didn't teach us that way and that we just went rogue. This is completely false. There are so many inconsistencies that it is laughable. You can make a lot of money there only if you are one of the chosen ones. Otherwise you'll collect your hourly rate. The benefits are good but confusing."
bad,"You make a small mistake and you pay with your carreer, they dont care about you or how long you been their or what u have sacrificed for the company they will fire you if they dont like you or have been there longer then they feel you should be."
bad,"Spectrum is a high call volume, calls do not stop from the time to you clock in for work & the time you leave.. calls come back to back non stop! customers are also rude but theres no way spectrum give any existing customer a deal, so you have no choice but to be cussed out & called all types of names"
bad,not a great place to work its very stressful you have only a certain amount of time to help the customers and if you don't do a good job you get graded on your performance and you only get a small brake in between phone calls not worth it
bad,Very stressful work environment. More luck than skill to make good commission. Company discourages assisting customers with any issues. Managers not willing or able to support employee or customer issues.
bad,"Retail Store Location: Day after day of irate customers complaining about service issues, rate increases, and programming changes. Way more customers are disconnecting than adding services. Commission is based on customers adding services...guess what no or low commission pay. Revolving door of managers and employees with high turnover. Stay away ...customers hate this company and take it out on the store reps. Even the IRS is more well liked than Spectrum."
bad,"The pay and benefits plus free services at Spectrum was the only good thing about working there. Management is unprofessional and two faced, telling you one thing and doing completely the opposite. Telling you your job is secure then booting you to hire personal friends and family in your place."
bad,"They have such a huge turn around because people can’t take the work. Physically, it’s nothing. Sitting at a desk all day. But mentally, you have to be dead inside. To sit there and listen to this elderly lady who can’t afford to watch her tv when it’s literally all she has and spectrum decides to raise her bill $20 basically for no reason, is ridiculous. I can’t fix her problem. I can’t make it any lower to help her. All I can do is express empathy and explain how awesome the service is to make her feel like it’s worth the increase. It’s exhausting. No time between calls, if someone hangs up on you, the next call is right there. No time to breathe. I don’t suggest working here if you can’t handle being yelled at constantly by customers and getting cussed out multiple times a day. Don’t take it home with you, because you won’t last long."
bad,"impossible metrics, no time to do work correctly impossible routing new company doses not care about its employees management is no help one department does not know the jobs of the next"
bad,It's all about sales or you're a nobody with a kick to the door... Seriously this won't approve unless I keep talking about this company that doesn't care about its employees and only cares about sales.
bad,"This is an excellent first job, but beyond that, not much to offer. Noisy, chaotic, toxic, hostile, these are words that come to mind. Again, great first job, but I would not recommend it for a career."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,culture awful. management not trained awful experience. was lied to about position. sales goals unattainable. dreaded coming to work everyday. department needs to be closed
bad,"The Greenville site has taken many hits lately and is NOT going to fare well. The site leaders are fine, but Corporate leaders don't have a clue.

There are so many inconsistencies that it is laughable. You can make a lot of money there only if you are one of the chosen ones. Otherwise you'll collect your hourly rate. The benefits are good but confusing."
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone.  I have worked as a cable service technician for 18 years and spectrum took over timewarner that's how I got stuck working for them.  They don't let you work near your house and give you more work than can ever be done in a normal day.  Almost every day I will be stuck working late or through lunch or both.  Corporate is making decisions for us services technicians telling us what we have to do at every job and they obviously haven't been out in the field a day of their life.
bad,Lack of employee engagement.  Very stressfull environment. Employees are not empowered.  Employees has to be subject to customers using derogative language on the phones
bad,"When I started with Charter the way to succeed was to create RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND BUILD A NETWORK THROUGH REFERRALS.  Then the company decided to completely abandon current customers, giving us no incentive to help them and restricting the areas we were allowed to sell during a month."
bad,"If you are not ""liked"" by the management then they will set you up to fail and they won't care about how it will affect your home life or your family at all."
bad,spectrum is a place that doesn't care about it's employees. horrible place with no regard to your mental well being. if you enjoy being talked down to then apply now.
bad,"Very poor moral ... Most people do not like their job .. Very loud and uncomfortable work environment. Employees opinions do not matter.."
bad,"Not a good experience, very micro- managed.  I found the work environment to be extremely stressful than the previous cable companies prior.  This company needs to improve morale, it's very low with this workforce."
bad,"I do not recommend working for Spectrum. This is not the place to work at. This company has a high turnover rate. The company was better to work for when they were Time Warner, but not anymore. They do not give money incentives if you do good anymore. All they give out is snacks. The tools that use are always having issues. The services that we sell are actually bad. I do not believe in what we are selling."
bad,"This place ranks among the worst I Have ever worked at.  The training is a joke, where you sit in a classroom for 4 looong weeks, only to be totally unprepared for what's about to slap you in the face once you hit the floor,  Your job is threatened on a daily basis, unless you sell Triple Play Gold packages.  Supervisors creep all of your phone calls, often sending instant messages while you attempt to converse with customers on the line, telling you what to say.  It's unnerving.  MANY people are promoted to supervisors, without a clue of how to supervise.  Lord help, if you need a sup to take a call, because most won't do it."
bad,"Pays well, but the hours are bad and the training is terrible. You're being monitored everyday and there's a constant fear of being fired. Everyone, including the customers, are always in bad moods."
bad,Time Warner cable at least paid us for all the work we did. spectrum cut the base pay in half. raised the commission structure that sure if you can sell 30 triples a month youre doing ok but if you sell less then that its going to cost you money to drive to your pre-selected turf .
bad,"We pay our frontline staff $12/hr to get verbally assaulted all day long while we pay our CEO 98 million a year - that sums us up as a company.  Poor training, high stress, tied to your desk."
bad,"To start when I put my 2 weeks in i was treated awful! HR lady was absolutely awful to me, any questions I had were answered with attitude as well as just down right rude. Management is awful give leads to favorite employees as well as only review people they do not like, the people they like can do basically anything they want to get a deal. They also are currently trying not to pay me for my last two weeks of work, even though i put my 2 weeks in, and have email to prove i did not just quit. Only good thing about this job is the benefits..... Flexible schedule is an absolute lie, 11-7 or 11-9 during summer, meetings at 10 am everyday. Now GPS tracked as well. If you take this job good luck being micro-managed to the MAX!!!"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Highly stressful place to work with little or no help from management or executives to ease the pain of the every day job. So many changes that one cannot get used to set policies.
bad,"Used to be a career, now its just a job/gig. Currently has 1800 unionized technicians on strike for 10 months over pension and benefits. Not interested in negotiating. Only want to bust the union. Don't do it to yourself. Look elsewhere."
bad,"You never know when it's your last day, they are very cut throat. The pay was decent but never get too comfortable with employment there. A very unethical place to work."
bad,"im still currently a dispatcher or as they now call it a RSC too much work for little pay they stopped the raises continue to lie that its going to come back its been over 7 months i been her. and our pay is 13.48 the supervisors are rude, dont know what they are even doing they are steady hiring because no one wants to put up with the b.s that comes with this job. the other dispatchers are the only good thing about this job. i would not suggest anyone come to spectrum im currently looking for a better job now"
bad,Over worked and under paid!!! Not given proper work utentials for the job needed to perform the nessacary job. Supervisors act like there workers are way beneath them and not as coworkers.
bad,"They recently changed the metrics to peer balanced, however, the numbers are statistically incorrect/skewed because you have several reps that only take calls a few times a week (trainers, for examples).  Management is very uninvolved in the reps' daily activities and some supervisors are not trained to use the systems we use.  If you ask for assistance, you're told to call the Lead Line, which makes your customer irate as the hold times are usually greater than 10 minutes for a simple question.  The turnover is the fastest of any place I have ever worked!  In fact, it's an on-going betting game to see who the next person is to leave.  (Out of a training class of 18 that started mid-year, there are 5 people left!)  But seriously the worst part of the job is that there is no time between calls.  It's much like slave labor, other than you're being paid.  You WILL suffer a serious case of dehydration and will spend a lot of time being sick.  We desk share also, so there are no private workspaces.  Just about every bad thing you can say about a job, this job has it.  Oh, and don't forget about the self-entitled customers who feel it's okay to go off on you about a bill which you have no control over.  The billing department has no promotional rates, so you're rarely able to actually help a customer.  The other departments in the company treat the billing department like it's customer service, so we are dumped all sorts of calls which we have no business answering.  What happens then?  You have to transfer them AND that affects your transfer rate!  Unrealistic, unhealthy, and low"
bad,The atmosphere is good. The pay isn’t worth the work. The manager is okay and the people there are good. I would not advise anyone to work there as temp.
bad,"Spectrum was once Time Warner Cable. When the merge happened when charter communication came into the picture they offered severences and pay A lot less now and make it a very stressful environment. With the new pay structures you never know what your gonna make and took away bonuses and incentives. The workplace was nice and the other co workers are nice as well, but way to much negativity there and just need a change."
bad,"Everything sucked! There's a reason why Spectrum is ranked as having one of the worse customer service.  We're not allowed to spend more than 15 min on the phones with customers or we get in trouble. The pay is terrible for what you do, overworked and underpaid. Within a year while I was there my workload more than doubled. When Charter took over we lost our monthly and yearly bonuses. My raise for the entire year was 13 cents and I was one of the top performers. The attendance policy changed basically there is no policy. It's at the supervisors discretion, even calling off one day can get you wrote up.  Benefits stink. and it's WAY to micromanaged there is constantly a Team Lead, Supervisor, or manager over your shoulder. The billing system is broken. You will get calls constantly from customer with disconnects/orders/service calls not going thru.... There's better options that pay better or the same.  They did offer free cable/phone/internet, but didn't work half the time. Vacation time was good. 4 days personal time, accrued about 3 hrs of sick time for every 40 hrs worked and 80 hrs of vacation time, but the problem with that was no time available. They only allow so many hours per day to take off. I left with having 62 hrs of unused time off, because it was like pulling teeth to get a day off."
bad,"The management at this company are not concerned in the least, with employees.  They don't pay attention, lose track of work items, are generally disorganized, and blame others for everything that goes wrong on the team."
bad,"It was time warner when I worked there, Management stunk, absolutely hated job, no matter what you did never good enough and you were told that if you didn't like the way it was you could b replaced"
bad,"this company is not employee friendly and is a cut throat company. I worked for them 21 years and was let go. Management I believe found a way to get rid of me because I wouldn""t transfer to another office and my wage was higher than they wanted to pay"
bad,Charter Spectrum is not employee friendly.  They lie to thier employees as well as customers and expect you to be like minded. I enjoyed the job I eas doing and the people I worked with.
bad,Open and close retail store.  Customer Service; Sales; Cash Management; Constant monitoring of your daily work; Very micromanaged at all times. Very negative and unpleasant work environment;
bad,That's all you heard on the phones w Charter. The services offered to customers were poor and we had to hear it. nonstop. for hours. That is really just the tip of the iceberg. The management team is atrocious and the disconnect between management and subordinate is visceral. There is no communication on any changes. There is utter lack of direction.. It is a mess. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for work.
bad,"Productive. At times very challenging. Poorly managed. The most difficult part of my job was having to constantly look over my back. The most enjoyable copart was meeting and working with people that put the customer 1st, completing a difficult assignment."
bad,I started with Time Warner Cable then while employed Spectrum bought out the company. Spectrum is not a good company to work for. The pressure that the sales reps experience to reach reach sales goals is ridiculous. The company odes not respect & embrace individuality everyone looks cookie cutter. No work life balance which cause stress on the job. STAY AWAY FROM SECTRIUM
bad,"Due to a discord between Union employees and Management, the company has become an increasingly difficult place to work.  The marginalized view of the Union employees by Management, has created an environment where an over emphasis is placed on meeting unrealistic goals.  The company's focus has been to corner the TelCom market, fueling a monopoly driven business model, above the quality of technical craftsmanship."
bad,"Compensation plan changes any time success is met which is not encouraging and leads to bad morale, dishonest and unethical behavior and favoritism in management. Product and services weak and technology lags behind competitors. Customer service terrible.Do not accept a position here."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"horrible company to work for, they don't care about the customer. The cut a lot of stuff wages, commission, breaks/lunch time, bonuses, insurance, sick time and cable services. They cut a lot of corners to try to save money but most of them cost them customers, but they don't care about losing customers. Phone reps can say anything to a customer and the company seems ok with that. The computer system you use everyday has tons of errors and management doesn't know how to fix it and doesn't care. We had issues that would make it so one couldn't put in new orders for new customers and no one seemed to care. Our supervisors couldn't do our job and if we ever had issues couldn't tell us how to fix it or who to talk to."
bad,"Our call center started off as time warner cable, since the merger, chaos emerged. none of the supervisors are on the same age anymore, and there's way too many new procedures that employees are not properly trained on"
bad,"Benefits were good until, they took away health insurance."
bad,stressful work place no job security micro managed will look for any reason to get ride of someone no manager support or room to grow with in the company
bad,"A typical day is 8-10 hours"
bad,Terrible work life balance...managed in a silo. Grueling hours and deadlines. The general attitude since the acquisition of TWC and Brighthouse is very poor in the office
bad,"inhave been working or this company for 12 years. Spectrums new policy is the stock holder first. They have made the work environment very hostile, they promise ""career progression"" through tests once eligible. What they are not saying is your eiligibility is based on a flawed metric system that punishes the technician for things out of their control. If you can keep ""good numbers"" it will take you two years to be eligible for your first test to get a raise, an additional four years to be eligible for your second test, managements approval for you to progress farther. It ill take you this long because you enter the comany at tech 3 and you will not get a raise until you pass the courses of techs 1&2 .The company that provides the courses  for the career progression is not an impartial company, some of spectrum's management sits on the board of directors for this company. A huge confict of interest. The management of the feild techs is horrible and unreliable with little regard for technicians safety (after a cable box malfunctioned and a part exploded in a techs face, he was ordered by his supervisor to drive back to the base and hand over the malfunctioning cable box. No supervisors came to the technician's location or even called an ambulance). Technicians That have made top pay are bing asked to reapply for a lower position and lower pay or be layed off. The benefit are bad especially if ypu have a family."
bad,I had a manager who was more interested in arranging her wedding than doing her job and coaching her team to meet the company goals.  The company switched the teams around and I then had a great manager who cared about his team and was a great coach to work with.
bad,Your training is five weeks.  By the end of week two and almost every day after you take calls.  I was literally told that we would learn to limit fluid so we won't need bathroom time. You cannot do anything but take calls during your shift.  Everyone and their mother listens to your calls. The turnover is very high.  You'd think they would look at why people leave...
bad,"Promotions given by who you know not what you know. Your experience, skills, understanding of the responsibilities of the job did not matter to the hiring manager in corporate because they had little to no knowledge of the responsibilities of the department/group."
bad,I do not recommend this place to my worst enemy they put too much pressure on their employees and the communication is awful. I would suggest that no one work for this company
bad,"When hired, only half of the actual position was described.  The other half was given as it came up. "
bad,"Management lies, not trustworthy unethical business and sales practices on all levels. No job security falsified information no real development or career advancement. If you lie and cheat no consequences if you are honest and have morals you are as good as fired."
bad,"New CEO brought company from the best to the worst, only cares about himself. Benefits are outstanding, but quickly diminishing.  The quality of the product is also diminishing because they don't have control of themselves because CEO is trying to sell company."
bad,"This place is probably one place I would never recommend anyone to ever work for.  Let me start with management. The town I'm based out of doesn't have a manager to help with problems. The closest one is a hour and a half away and only comes up once or twice a week for about 3 hours, so there's no one to turn to with issues. The second is pay. For all the B.S that we have to deal with, from upper management is ridiculous.  They expect so much out of one person it's way to overwhelming then get mad when you're score card isn't up to par with there expectations. but hey when it is good we get to pick a snack out of a drawer in the manager's office (they have a limit of $1.25 to spend). that's all you'll see for having good scores oh except for the yearly 2% raise you may get. Also the vehicles they offer, pretty much expect to be broke down somewhere once a month.  You may get lucky when you start out and get a nicer one. Basically don't work here unless you are looking for something to barely get bye. You'll hate life. I guarantee It."
bad,I was a field tech with extremelu long days due to the fact the manager never shut quota down and would make you work your off days. All he cared about was looking good for the higher ups. Pay was ok but not worth the work load and stress. I wasnt on call and still getting called out at 8 p.m. to jobs so the manager didnt have to deal with it. Co workers had a bad attitude and never helped each other but would call and cry about each other to management...worse job i ever had!!!!!
bad,"The pay sucks, the management, at least in my office was almost nonexistent. The equipment they give you to work with is sub par at best, the training is a joke, if you get hurt, its automatically your fault. The only good thing about working there was the free cable."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"All I can say about this company is you're just a number, you will be replaced if you face any hard times. All management do is lie to the supervisors and reps to meet numbers. They secretly have meeting on who to fire. Don't waste your time!"
bad,"Time Warner doesn't care about their customers or their employees. All they want is to get as much money out of customers at all costs. When Insight Communications was the company, it was a great place to work. They paid employees handsomely with unmatched benefits and many, many 'thank you' gifts just for working for them. Time Warner made it a place to loathe to work at. Firings are frequent if employees don't con enough sales out of unsuspecting customers. Bullying by upper management is frequent, especially towards aging employees. Compensation was excellent, but that was because Insight had established the pay scale before the company was bought."
bad,"Low job security and overall company does not care about its employees, if you just want to be a number then this is the place for you"
bad,"The company does not take care of the customer let alone their employees.  They allow the customer to cuss at, scream and and degrade their employees.  When you bring this up all you're told is that you need to toughen up.  After 4 months straight of said behavior it breaks you, it does not 'toughen' up.  Management is non existent.  You're told to escalate every small thing to a manager, well that is because they do nothing in response to the request.  I guess they figure the customer will let it go.  When the customers are caught acting in a demeaning manner, then the employee is chastised in front of the customers"
bad,no job security and many other issues that shouldn't be discussed over the web. just know that there isnt one entry level worker (customer service rep) that can honestly say they enjoy their job and love it. the company doesnt care for the customer and expect for the rep to make up for issues that we cant control
bad,"I am a former employee of 7 years.THE GOOD ! REVIEWS about Bright House are wrong.."
bad,"Director of Sales was a horrible person who screamed at employees, degraded people daily, insulted your intelligence and made work life horrible.  No one wanted to be in the office when he was there - everyone chose to work from home or stay in the field to avoid him.  Direct Manager was wonderful, she didn't start until i was already leaving, she helped make work life bearable again.  Still wouldn't go back, management is constantly changing and is unstable.  Every employee there is at risk of losing their job daily which adds constant worry."
bad,"Whoever reads this please do yourself a favor and dont waste your time working here. TWC will lie to you and belive me upper mangement  does not like you. I unfortunately wasted six years of my life there that I will never get back. I was a tech and basically they only care about numbers as a matter of fact the NEW POLICY is your bounus is now based on their metric system not to mention the hugh amount of work they give to you in an 8 hour day. Try and find a parking spot in NYC and try and gain access into the building to do your work while their is twenty other contractors in front of you waiting to use the one elevator in the whole building, then you get that dreadfull call from your dispatcher trying to find out where you are. Also the long hours that you put in everyday means nothing to upper managment. THE best thing to happen to Twc is Comcast takes over and FIRES all upper managment cause it cannot get any worse."
bad,"Amateurs pretending to be major players. Sweatshop environment for ethical sales people. Greedy beyond comprehension. Poor customer support for even their largest customers. ""Rules of Engagement"" that are supposed to protect Sales People's accounts are worthless and mostly unenforced by sales leadership. Their sales force is partially comprised of unethical cutthroat used car / vacuum cleaner salesman types who are rewarded by middle management for their bad deeds. Upper management generally concerned with closing sales and don't really care whether or not services are installed. Free for all culture best suited for pirates or plunderers. Human Resources fully aware of environment and do nothing to help remedy the situation. Human Resources only helps cover-up and spawn the culture. Beware, if you resign or are terminated from your position, you'll not be paid any commissions that you earned and good luck getting a correct final paycheck. You're only a number at this company and completely disposable. There are many reasons why this company has such a high attrition rate and don't own any of the Fortune 1000 customers. I've only touched on a few of them. I feel sorry for the minority of fearful good people that still remain. The only hope for current employees getting any relief, is through Comcast's purchase of the company which will be brutally ugly. This company has a bad reputation in the telecommunications industry. If you haven't worked for this company, don't do it my friend, don't do it!!!"
bad,Never enjoyed this position due to management. Opportunities were always dangled in front of prospective employees but always taken from outside.
bad,its one of the worst company's to wok for. every day you go in and dont hit your numbers you will be fired
bad,The job provided a great income but not enough positive tools to enhance performance on the job.  Poor infrastructure(company needs a facelift badly). Management needs to be trained appropriately to coach reps effectively
bad,"Back to back phone calls. If customer demanded to speak to a supervisor only allowed to email sup for a callback within 24-48 hrs. All supervisors in our department would leave for break together, so no help was available until they returned. Management only cared about numbers not about customers or employees."
bad,"after working in alexander city for 29 yrs. then let go because, my cell phone went dead at the closing of an outage. I was told part of my job was to keep my phone charged I was let go."
bad,the work can be fun depending on the weather and the amount of work they are giving you.  management is beyond terrible and is a do as i say not as i do environment.  its a step up from fast food but not a big one.
bad,"stressful"
bad,"Fast paced environment that focuses on customer relations and sales. You must be self motivated, organized, efficient, and prepared for a high call volume. There are sale incentives available and monthly quotas to be made. When working with the customers you must be attentive and a good listener. Some of the best perks include working with a diverse group of co-workers who are a second family. The most challenging part of the job is retaining customers who had a bad experience prior. The most rewarding experience is when a customer thanks you for listening and helps them resolve their previous issue. "
bad,High pressure job with no potential for growth. Constantly laying off people.
bad,"Worked for Time Warner Cable for almost a year. In that Year I was not able to advance my skillset.There is NO upward mobility at all.  The pay is decent.  The environment is overly stressful. You feel like you are walking on eggshells the whole day, and that you are one step away from termination at any moment. Their attendance policy is absurd. Every absence is unexcused regardless of reason. For example if you miss a day because you had a car wreck and totaled your car and brought in a police report as proof, it still goes against you. the offer ""sick time"" however it has to be approved in advance. That's like saying to them ""I'm going to have the flu"" on next Tuesday.  In summary Time Warner Cable is a company that has Cold-hearted, ruthless management that cares NOTHING for its employees.

good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Lowballed my salary offer by about $10,000, but I needed the job. Free cable & internet (but charged equipment fees, of course!), benefits, great training (by the technical group from Colorado) and your coworkers are helpful but once you're on the job, brace yourself. 1,000 emails a day (not an exaggeration). Newbies get 3rd shift, it's fun work that quickly turns into 14 hour nights/days (no comp or overtime) when you're tending to 1st shift technician problems who aren't even supposed to be calling the engineering group in the first place -- but you get the call because your coworkers forget to log into the phones. Hard work and problems solved go completely unnoticed. Everything you achieve is immediately downplayed, almost like you re-invented the wheel or something. I spotted some major issues (things like a totally screwed up user interface or pornography non-adult channels) that I never got credit for catching. Supervisors spy on your conference calls and berate you via instant message or text message (on my own personal cell mind you...company lines don't make it to the bottom of the totem pole). Not to mention other groups' errors AND EVEN SCREW-UPS BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS are *always* your fault. Weekly team meetings discussing performance and current issues were scheduled on my day off with no attempt to fill me in. Their policy is such that one step in the wrong direction and you're halfway out the door. Two...well, you do the math. I was told before being let go that I was ""of no value to the shift"". Immediately went to HR with that comment, where I was able to hold"
bad,"I applied for a position in their Business Class department. I had a fantastic interview with one of the supervisors and their manager and was really hoping to get the job, however, when I was hired I was placed on a different team. I was hired after a training class had started so my training was very difficult. Training was very informal, not very structured and only taught you examples of how to enter ""clean"", non problematic orders. However, once you got on the floor almost every order was problematic. You became the go-between for unethical sales reps and techs who didn't complete orders and gave no details as to why the orders weren't done. My supervisor barely spoke to me and never told me what the plan was for my training. Never went over my goals or hours or never even introduced me to my teammates. It was a very ""kindergarten"" type atmosphere where if you didn't perform well reports were sent out during the day with a red circle around your numbers and if you were the worst performer of the day something was placed on your desk the next day for everyone to see. I was included in all of this nonsense starting my first week on the floor, while I was still learning the processes. All of this only took place under my supervisor, on my team. I've always been a very hard worker who excelled in my jobs but I was set up for failure from the getgo with this supervisor. I never took my allotted 15 minute breaks because I wanted to get my numbers. My system profile was set up incorrectly and I was unable to access the program divisions where most of the work was, which also hindered"
bad,hired by a recruiter job desc sent to me interviewed at hotel by HR
bad,"Overtime everyday, management was the worst I have ever seen. The BBT sup. was the main reason I left along with 4 others. He doesn't care about making you feel like dirt he walks on. Pay is terrible (raises are a joke $0.08 after my first year)."
bad,"Charter Communications is not a caring company, they claim to be family friendly but they care more about money than employees and family."
bad,"Not a good recommendation to work for TIME WARNER CABLE. This job is not for everyone!!! TWC believes in politics within the company, It's all about more money for the big wigs. Management does not allow you to give the customer 100% customer service satisfaction without you getting a low numbers on your work performance. You are on a 8 min call to complete all the customers concerns, technical support, billing questions/payments. If you spend more than 8 minutes on that call you are then dinged on a downward spiral towards work performance. No union, no job security. Not enough salary for the amount of rules, regulations and politics you have to follow."
bad,"I did not enjoy working in this call center. It felt as if I were in high school again with all the juvenille gossip. The management staff is so unprofessional and are not very supportive unless you are a ""favorite"". Would not recommend anyone to work for Time Warner Cable Call Center in Irving, TX"
bad,"My remarks are reserved solely for Bay News 9, the news division of Bright House Networks. It started out to be a great experience, but that honeymoon ended quickly, like within about three months. Many journalists are desperate in a down market, but this is not the place to be. Communication is very poor, management types are (for the most part) not willing to accept their own mistakes, and decision making is often a joke. Employee review process is lopsided. The worst part of working there is having to sign a 3-year contract...even entry-level jobs. That's ridiculous. If you want your career to go down in flames, this is a terrible work environment that will make you wish you actually did live in Hades."
bad,"After nearly three years I'm finally free of Time Warner Cables, low pay, clueless supervisors, endless stats, every six months shift bids, working holidays, comically low commisions, Floor Walkers and Resolutionist Specialist who try to avoid you instead of help you, ever changing rules and guidelines and nonstop profanities and abuse from Subscribers who services constantly go out due to defective equipment and ancient cable lines."
bad,Spectrum changes their policies everyday as they see fit and you have no choice but to roll with the punches. The only thing consistent there is their inconsistency.
bad,"Sometimes it feels like you know more than your supervisor, or maybe it’s just because your supervisor doesn’t want to help. Forced nine hour days with hour lunch..."
bad,First off they make you feel like your special by saying that you got through tons of people that wanted this job really??!! my class had 12 people a small class from what I heard secondly they say they are going to make the job fun no you get yelled at by people who can’t get back on the internet it’s hard to let it go in one ear and out the other thirdly the job description is internet/Phone tech you don’t train on phones until you’ve been there for 6 months if there is enough people to train
bad,"I feel like the best way to explain my time here would be toxic. Higher-ups lied directly to employees, they route calls specifically to places depending on the prompts they use ( but claim they don't send new customers to employees.) My first few months I preformed well and made decent money. As soon as your quality changes there ( which happened fast when management couldn't explain how the commission system worked) I began to receive way more ""bad"" calls. EVERYONE spoke about how they wanted to leave and how that place was toxic."
bad,"Absolutely horrid management with a subversive, plantation mentality.  Success contingent upon ""being liked"" by management and not performance or skillset.  No structure with extremely high turnover rate in all areas of the business, mostly voluntary."
bad,The company has wiped out any and all sense of care for the customer and their employees. They have Centralized and consolidated all jobs to a few different states.
bad,I had a very hard time working for Spectrum. You are responsible to retain a customer however it is hard to get behind a company where their prices keep going up and the service and equipment never get upgrades. How are you supposed to support a company when you do not believe in their product or service?
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Managers here do not care about your well being. They ask us to knock on doors that are guarded by locked gates with signs of guns and beware of dog signs all over it. They constantly change the metrics weekly of the position. They contradict themselves in the same breath all the time. They donharasss you if your sick and call out. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy who would need a job.
bad,"the company does not care about employees, unrealistic goals, full of stress. they dont care, dont follow simple policys. employees in different departments need to learn."
bad,"My coworkers were the only ones to encourage and motivate me. The supervisor on the other hand did not care about you because she was too obsessed at trying to get to management and if you as a worker did not deliver and if she wind up at the bottom, her coaching was more of threats than words of encouragement and motivation and if you did not deliver she would get you fired."
bad,"Warning, Customers are CONSTANTLY frustrated and they take it out on you. You don't feel connected, you're judged negatively without a supporting growth mindset. "
bad,Spectrum call center in Charlotte was the worst. Nobody knows what they’re doing and promotion is based on who you know and not what you know. Find something else only good thing is the free cable and WiFi but my sanity was worth more.
bad,"Working for Charter Communications, the parent company of the Spectrum brand was frustrating to say the least. Charter's focus is on the bottom line, neither employee nor customer matters. The emphasis on ""efficiency"" comes at the customer's expense. The morale is extremely low with a high turnover rate. Front-line management takes the brunt of the pressure from upper management to enforce efficiency guidelines in the form of weekly supervision to critique calls. There is a threat of the job being on the line if a representative deviated from the ""script."" I would not recommend employment at Charter Communications. Charter's company culture is hostile. It is a far-cry from the Time Warner Cable culture that believed employee care translated into customer care."
bad,"My last supervisor was incompetent and was very unprofessional. Most managers were great but the leads and supervisors, not so much. Very stressful work place. A lot of favoritism."
bad,The training is faced paced leaving you not knowing their systems well enough before working with customers. Role involves high volume of hostile customers. Very fast paced and high stress environment.
bad,"Typical day, help customers non stop, angry customers, poor management from top to bottom,no help, people quitting  pushing out the older senior reps."
bad,"Started as one of the best if not the best job I had ever had, then after one management change  after the next we were left to realize this company has no idea what they're doing and you as a technician will pay for it. You risk your life in the field (climbing over 30 feet at times around high voltage, crawling under houses full of hanta virus) and you can say goodbye to family time."
bad,"I've worked in cable for a decade and worked for basically all the big companies and I've never experienced a culture like I have at spectrum. The pay is on the low end which is insulting coming from a company that has the highest trade price in the entire industry. The tools provided are bottom of the barrel. Completely used up and out of spec. I can't speak for upper corporate management, and maybe it comes from the top, but as far as middle management (field ops director on down) they should really look into some major changes. The area I work, which includes several metro areas, has lost nearly 20 employees that I know of in the last year and a half. With that kind of turnover you would think they would start looking at the top, but the director, managers, and supervisors constantly pass the buck and blame employees. Current supervisors even go as far as badmouthing employees to customers. I can't say a lot of good about the company, and I try not to be negative. The schedule is decent if you stay in the right position, though they absolutely will try to monopolize your time if you allow it. For a beginner in the industry it's a good start only insofar as they will literally hire anybody, but if you're interested in learning or advancing in this field I recommend you look elsewhere. All the other companies pay more and also invest more time in helping you excel."
bad,Run away its all amazing then you are thrown to the wolves. Ypu arent trained properly and you cant meet your numbers. Pay is ok of you dont care if you succeed.
bad,Beware do not work here Very stressful management will accuse you of anything you cannot make any management happy. Not allowed bathroom breaks and get fired over absences.
bad,In my personal experience I hated working here. I wouldn’t go back at all. The pay was ok. The best part was the free cable. I worked in sales and I hated every bit of it. Not for everyone and the shifts and hours suck.
bad,"Management was very kind and pleasant during the hiring process. It’s kind of a cumbersome process but the recruiter and everyone else were very happy to help you along."
bad,"Very stressful job, metrics, back to back calls, upset customers not enough support due to leadership getting terminated all the time. Dr's excuses are not valid if you don't have sick hrs or vacation time. Honestly, looking for another job."
bad,"I’ve been at spectrum for 2years now. I now take anxiety and migraine medication. Lazy management and supervisors.  HR does not help with any issue. There is no chance for reps who meet there numbers every month to move up to a higher position. Every new supervisor, trainer, or manager come from a different state and some have never even worked for spectrum to understand the calls and Concerns that us representatives have. When you ask a supervisor for help they look at you and keep moving don’t even stop to ask if they can get you any help. When you message a manager about the situation of not being helped they ignore it. Most of the supervisors since they have only been there for such a short amount of time can’t even help when you need assistance with a customer’s account.  the agents know more than the supervisors. All the supervisors have different answers to one question so you never know if you doing something wrong or right."
bad,"I worked here when it was Time Warner Cable and really loved my job.  There were ups and downs, but once Spectrum took over, the place went downhill and fast. They have fantastic benefits, but that's it. I gave up many years of seniority to get out of there, but it was then that I found out an illness that I just couldn't get rid of, left me.  It was so stressful there, that I was constantly sick.  Micromanaging, giving ridiculous goals that could be reached if you didn't care about customers.  Terrible place to work and I would never ever tell someone to check it out."
bad,"No support from sups and managers. it's a money first enterprise and they change requirements weekly. The stress of being afraid you will be written up or fired, is insane. Tools don't work, but don't let that affect your stats! Most unorganized company I have ever worked for."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Negative workplace culture, poor work/life balance, unreliable equipment, micromanaging, low pay for amount of work to be done, poorly structured work schedule, etc"
bad,The management doesnt care about work life balance. Several times my job was threatened due to being a single parent and not being able to locate child care.
bad,Constantly shift in priorities rather than give any one direction just let them go. And now I here  That the contractors who were let go have been back filled by Eastern Indian H1B visa holders.
bad,"I worked there for 2 years, they have a great building, Rec room cafeteria, little places you can walk or hide out for your break. Biggest thing to me was interviewing trying to move up in the company but never given a chance. It seemed every interview I went to for advancement I was always passed by someone else. I wouldn't mind being passed but when a new hire comes in and right out of training gets the position I interviewed for when according to company policy you had to be there for a minimum on the floor for 6 months to be considered it just shows what type of company it is. Even tech positions for call center agents who troubleshoot and take care of problems internally everyday they over look them and hire outside the company. I had a great manager great supervisor great team but when you sit and want to move up and you get overlooked its hard to even stay motivated. I left back in 2017 i look back and yes i miss my team and everyone i mentioned but to go back to that stress is not worth the pay they give"
bad,Unfairly rated its technicians. Scorecard is not balanced to reflect work. Would not advise anyone to waste your time there. Dispatch routes jobs that often is too late which in turn affects your pay.
bad,Good pay great benefits but management and work-life are horrible you're never home when you need to be management expects you to do things that are just not possible
bad,"The company gives you 5 weeks training... But to be honest you do not learn anything during training... The very basics is what is given to you before they throw you to the wolves!!!! Their best quote... ""We know your still new... So we understand if your metrics arent where they should be""... Which is a bunch of lies... Once your put on a team... Your pretty much on your own... Leads and supervisors are not approachable... You have to depend on other team members... But they also have a job to do... So pretty much if your metrics are low .. Then your a threat to the supervisors stats...And we all  know what that means... They find a reason to let you go... Soooo many people are constantly absent... Late or leave early... They dont say anything... But if your working your butt off to really do your job and struggle... Then they fire you... They find an excuse to let you go!!!! The company makes things look good by their bbq and incentives but in reality its all for show... Majority of the supervisors are always late... Leaving early... And when they are there they are too busy shopping online... Watching Netflix or at other supervisors cubicles flirting... Poor management skills!!!!"
bad,"The hype is unreal surrounding this position. Trainers repeat all day “LIFE CHANGING MONEY.” Listen it’s 2019, and cable is not the tea honey. There’s HULU, Netflix, fire sticks! Nobody wants cable. But they can’t comprehend this and tell you you’re not good enough because you can’t sell people these high packages (that increase by $20 every year). Supervisors threaten your job daily. Managers are too involvedd in your personal life. Don’t investigate before firing hardworking people. Run."
bad,3 to 4  weeks of training on the last week they will slap a van in your hand and make you feel like a trained certified tec   When really your not lol. I felt like just a number in the slaughter house. They change  work schedules at will no reguards for workers .Prey and hope you get a good supervisor spend a lot of time teaching my self and tell me how they start customer service off more then tecs techs
bad,"Job is easy, however moving up is very difficult. They really sell the job when you land the interview or right when you get hired that ""you'll move up within a year no problem!"" The benefits are amazing and there are lots of PTO."
bad,Improper Training... then through you out on the floor and when you ask for help most of the time it takes forever to get a response.  The hours suck ... They offer VTO but you never get it only the same people do over and over
bad,"Hours suck no life, pay is horrible & the goals are ridiculous! Spectrum doesn’t care about their employees, it only cares that you make money for them every day!"
bad,"If you want to work for a company that has to incentive employees to come to work due to the miserable work environment then I recommend applying. No culture, management doesn’t care and loves pointing the finger elsewhere with issues. They really need to look in the mirror. You get paid to not take calls in a call center. The more calls you take the less you make. Pay used to be great, now it’s not even worth coming in most days."
bad,"Charter went through a merger a little over 2 years ago and still has not recovered from the large amount of change. Because of this leadership can be volatile and lay-offs/re-orgs are quite common. "
bad,"The overall manager of the call center is unapproachable he sends out rude emails and told us he did not care about driving bans in severe weather. Also, the service is not good and you have to handle more complaints about service then anything else. A lot of outages causes call volume to be heavy and there is no resolution to give the customer you have to tell them to wait. Everyone is charged different rates for the same services. Management is careless. It takes a very long time to get help if you need on a call. The environment is not very professional. The expectation is way over compensation. Insurance is expensive for what is offered. You are going to work nights and weekends. It takes a long time to get to day shift."
bad,"Poor management , micromanage, they lie to you over and over very high turnover rate high sales goals that keeps increasing, angry customers that threaten your life and they do nothing.  Management to busy to help  because lack of managers or they are incompetent and don’t follow  through. They are fire happy. Your fired your fired everybody’s fired....ten people in last week.  Pay is not worth the work you do or what you go through"
bad,Spectrum acts like they care for their employees but they don't. The training is minimal and they want you to bend over backwards for the company without the company having your back in return.
bad,"what I can't deal with is a manager talking to you like you're literally stupid.. she'd stand by you as your talking to a customer and always have to put her two cents In, and will say something to make you feel about 2 feet tall. No wonder why they have such a huge turn around, at least at this location. No grown adult likes to be talked to like they're 5, especially with customers witnessing it. .so embarrassing. When they say a manager can make or break the environment of the work place....they aren't lying."
bad,Only good thing was the free services. They only care about there money. So much different from BHN where they care about there employees an there customers.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,You are always wrong in everything you do. I would not recommend that you go to work for spectrum. The management is awful they do not back their employees.
bad,"At the hiring process, Spectrum makes it sound like they want to keep you on long term. But they will literally fire people left and right without a blink of an eye. Its really sad. On top of that, they fail to provide adequate training and adequate support on the floor. The only things making this job worth it is they give you free internet and cable and the benefits are nice but they take a fortune out of your paycheck for it. This place is a joke with heartless snakes for supervisors, managers, and HR. They act like they will have sympathy but will fire you or issue corrective actions regardless of your personal situation. "
bad,"This place is horrible to work for. The money can be great, but even that hasnt been since Spectrum took over. They dont care about their employees. They expect you to sit on the phone for the full 8 hrs without getting up to go to the bathroom.  Sales goals are unrealistic, and they purposely do that so they dont have to pay you the full payout. They screen every one of your calls live and send you messages telling you what to say. Very stressful environment. Every employee I know is miserable and looking to leave. RUN FAST!"
bad,Supervisors outside of one were all awesome. There was guys who came in after long tenured guys and made more money. So basically teaching new people who make more then you to do your job. Communication was terrible from dispatch to the techs. They preach progression within the company but you have to do it non paid. Time Warner gave better raises. They dont believe in taking care of the people who provide the metrics that gives them their big CORPORATE BONUSES at the end of the year.
bad,"unless you like to kiss a-s-s for customers, this is the job for you. other than that don't waste your  time in going through the employment process. little career advancement, no work-life  balance. you literally have to stay here for a good 2 months to get a ""better schedule"""
bad,"Charter communications purchased Time Warner cable. They have been heavily running down its technical operations into the ground and into the stone age. Bonus pay has significantly decreased, quota has increased, They constantly add further micromanaged policy's that significantly make technicians suffer. mailmen, university custodians, make more money then technicians at 4 years make. They are constantly looking for ways to lower your scores and avoid paying you out your bonus. Don't work here. Your better off cleaning toilets for the same pay."
bad,Products and services are not delivered and maintained as promised. Horrible customer service skills. Management treats employees and customers unfairly.
bad,If you enjoy being a salesman to angry customers go for it. The benefits are pretty amazing between tv internet and phone. This job is basically a stepping stone for something better.
bad,"Spectrum is by far the worst place to work. The company itself is always doing things to hurt the customer, which in turn blows up in your face. I've never seen such a strict work environment where you cant do anything but take call. I can remember all the night sitting around waiting for a call and not being able to look at my phone the computer or the tv. The only time you mean anything in that company is when your a lead anyone under that your just a number. Spectrum also has the worst system to tell how you are in the phones. They mostly base your scores off of the customers. The biggest thing if your having issues a lot a current job and need some where new do not apply to spectrum your wanting your time. Spectrum has one of the highest turn around time ever. Out of all the people I knew who worked there or that were trained at the same time as me are gone for the same reasons."
bad,"Toxic work environment, everyone is unhappy and doesn't want to work there. Sales lies to customers to get the sale not caring how they make the company look after lying to them about pricing, install fees, or packaging at a price that is a bold face lie."
bad,Family is not first. There is no compassion for people. People are not friendly. All of upper management stay in their offices and don't socialize and check on staff.
bad,"you work an 8 hour shift and have to divide 20 minutes into breaks between. there was always an hour lunch break between every 4 hours. The environment was nice. However,  the management at the time was very bad."
bad,When it was called TWC everything was great but when Charter bought the place the ship sunken. We lost our roles and eventually our jobs. Its not a good place to work at.
bad,"You better not need an accomodation.  Drug dealers galore!  Just pass your first drug test, then no more testing.  It is great that you can pick your own schedule, kind of.  Most of the other employees are amazing but watch for those sups who act like they care, then stab you in the back."
bad,"Personally, I went into the company with a very positive attitude. That changed very quickly when I saw how the techs are rated on performance. They set ridiculous standards for their techs. For example, a job could be scheduled to swap a remote, but if another (called TQA) tech comes behind you to check your work, they will fail you for missing a bad connector or anything unrelated to the job. They give the techs horrible equipment, none of our troubleshooting tools work as they should. Forced to ""choose"" what holidays we work on. Don't waste your time here. Trust me, it's bad."
bad,Being degraded by customers daily. Management would not help. Other CSR’s would not help if you needed it. Each team had their own little click. Was not happy.
bad,The company has several lawsuits against it for discrimination.  There was no opportunity for growth for me even after i finished my bachelor and further my education to obtain a masters degree i was still not considered for entry level openings in Human Resource department.
bad,Hands down the worst company on this entire planet of Earth. Terrible management. training is ineffective. The training is woefully inadequate. agent support is overwhelmed. Turnover is extremely high. Most people are fired or finde another jobwithin the first year.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Spectrum has a great pay, benefit, and all the greatness for you and your family WITH THE UNION. However, management is horrific and does not know how to run the company. They are unfair, make new rules as often as they’d like, they will fire you at will, and very inconsiderate with their subscribers and employees. You must be prepared at all times to look for another job. Heartless employers, and it should have remained TimeWarner Cable."
bad,"Biased cable company with hidden agendas.  Some employees receive all the recognition while some deserving employees receive none.  Mostly like working in a sweat shop.  Dirty working environment with no regard for accountability.  Less than minimum management onsite (ie Supervisors, managers, etc).  Peer ""leads"" left with management responsibilities and may or may not be able to help in an efficient manner.  Being able to use technical education and experience with customer service a plus.  Ability to engage with needy customers and fix Internet/phone issues."
bad,"I have worked with Spectrum for 2 years now and I would not recommended anyone to work here. There is no work life balance and we were given mandatory overtime for 3 months straight. If you're a student, forget it! They promote their tuition reimbersment but will not work with your school schedule. There is 1 decent supervisor and 3 decent managers. Everyone else does not respect you and will only speak to you life you're a human being if you're surpassing their sales goals. Spectrum now offers mobile and we were given a 1 day training and expected to sell 2 lines per day. If you cellphone sales experience you understand how this is unrealistic. No one can explain the commission structure so don't even bother asking. Avoid this company if you're looking for career advancement and job security."
bad,"There is no flexibility at Spectrum... there is no procedure updates , reivew or procedures at all. There are so many gaps, my gap analysis was 3 pages long."
bad,Dont work here its not worth it. Sure you get a free ride to work and a free cable. but the company has no direction and you basically just a pawn for the company.
bad,"I don’t reccoment this place to anyone. They could care less about the customer and even less about the employees. If you like someone breathing down your neck, literally walking around with a computer ensuring that you are selling even second of the 8 hours you’re there then this is the place for you. You go into personal to take a 2 minute bathroom break and you have people messaging you wondering why you’re not taking calls. You make the company on average $12-$15k in revenue/month and they compensate you by only giving you a $1000 comp check which a few months ago would have been over $5k. You have no control what calls come through your line but are held accountable for them and lose money when it’s not a sales call. You raise concerns to management and no one ever corrects issuesor even cares for that matter. Employees know we screw over our customer and there is zero care in the world. Most people quit before they are out of training once they realize what they got themselves into."
bad,"I was an account executive.   I would like to hope upper management was not aware of what was going on at our office.  Our manager frequently asked us to lie to customers about current promotions, when they ended, how fast internet speeds were, our phone systems, why internet was down, and many other aspects of our product and services.  Our sales goals were unrealistic and the market was saturated with sales people.  I would suggest someone interested in working for this company do some research into the local office youre going to work for.  The company doesnt seem to care about its customers or its employees.  They only care about the bottom line."
bad,"Time Warner was a wonderful place to work.  Job advancement opportunities, good benefits, and an overall good environment.  After the merger/buyout,  it became one of the worst places I've ever worked."
bad,"Executive leadership in this company is scatterbrained at best.  No cohesive direction, and extreme management by fear. VP's routinely roast their directors in meetings.  They have an excessively high turnover rate.  Employees constanly express their dislike of the Spectrum/Charter buyout of Time Warner and frequently express that they hate their job.  People who agreed to move to Denver can't wait until their moving expenses agreement expires so they can leave this company. There's a reason they always have a lot of open positions and it's not because of growth. Don't take a career setback with this horrible organization."
bad,"Training length has been cut in half as well as pay being 38% lower than companies. They recently lowered the pay increase for completing technician 3,4,5 paths which takes 40hours each on your own time to next to nothing. routing department is now a mess and takes upwards for 45min on hold, which means your standing in the customers house and falling behind. "
bad,Terrible and unprofessional company. lots of favoritism and double standards. Poor pay with no raises. Absolutely nothing good about working there. Beware
bad,"Stressful,system issues and micro managed daily. Does not inform employees on direction of department only rumors. Unfriendly atmosphere, hard to advanace. Hard to schedule time off."
bad,there is no room for advancement too much bs and office politics.  you never sit in the same place too long so you never feel like you belong there and management isn't much better.
bad,This is not something you want to do for more than A year it gets really hard with all the mandatory change. Some of those changes have no effect on job besides in a negative way
bad,"Spectrum management team has a false and misleading agenda consistently. They do not appreciate their employees, especially low level managers. They also only show appreciation to employees who excel and spend little time on others. If someone is not 100% on target then they are harassed and ultimately fired."
bad,"Although I do enjoy customer service, working at spectrum was beyond stressful... the company only cares for statistic, they don't value their useful employs who sacrifice alot spiritually by having such job... the only thing good are the benefits."
bad,The company as a whole has not quite found its footing since the merger in 2016. The training timeframe that you are told during your interview can easily change to half or a quarter of the time frame previous employees are given. The attrition rate for most representatives is about 70 percent.
bad,"typical day consists of filtering calls that rang anywhere from a lost technician, billing questions,unserviceable area, possible new customer, another department needing assistance completing orders, our call time versus sales and calls taken hugely affect commission and rank however even if our Supervisor is aware that other departments are calling for help, we as Sales Agents are basically hit with those calls, however even on a productive, positive Sales call we are expected to cut the call short as long calls are unacceptable even if our customer needs more information and explanation."
bad,"Spectrum as a whole is very confused. They have new managers, supervisors, leads & employees happening all at once and they honestly are a mess. "
bad,"customers are cutting the cable.  this industry is changing and Spectrum's technology is sub par.  We are encouraged to sell to poorer communities.  We are expected to work in impoverished neighborhoods..feeding on the desperate individuals who have very little and are so bored, poor and tired that they will put the cable in their children's names in order to get services.   Direct sales is already hard enough.  complete cold calling, assigned addresses are recycled 3-6 months, you have 30 days to sell/close sale - or no commissions.  Referrals do not get paid on.  commission checks are paid on once a month.  and you must wait 2 months prior to your start date to see your first check.  90 day wait period for medical / dental / vision benefits.  Leadership is ego driven and meetings are time wasters.  very little effective sales training.  hours of video compliance trainings.  Compensation plan looks decent, if you can get all your sales orders completed by 30 days.  too many hands to see the orders and a lot can go wrong.    "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Overall employee is just a number. Once they were done you were let go.  No work life balance as though could not bring a personal picture. Employees have no seat that is there’s also always told what is wrong.
bad,Working for this company was the worst 4 months of my entire life i seriously dont even know why i even tried it it was so horrible i seriously went back to my original job which pays less then spectrum i will never ever apply here again the way they treat their employees is unfair and its not a positive environment to work in please dont waste your own time you can do better
bad,"Worst company ever to work at. Time warner cable was better in my opinion, I wish charter communications never would have purchased time warner. Spectrum is the worst place ever to work!!!!"
bad,"The lack of leadership in Fond du Lac's Spectrum office is alarming, driving dozens of employees to seek other jobs. Common knowledge of job duties & company values are non-existent all across management."
bad,This is a company who has no respect for their employees. The management are all out for their own success and make it very difficult for anyone else to succeed. They handled the M&A with poor disregard for all employees from both companies.
bad,The staff where horrible they treat you like you are in high school. the employees act like it is high school more office drama then I have ever seen in my life. The management only care about your sales they don't care if you harassed  verbally attacked or if your dog dies. only good thing good about spectrum is there benefits. you do not have job security there at all you are just a number and you are replaceable and they tell you that every day.
bad,It is a very difficult place to work. Advancement is based on the number of calls you take and if a customer calls back. The customers call back numerous times to get a different outcome which would be more beneficial to them.
bad,"Charter bought Time Warner. Legacy Charter management were all replaced with Time Warner VPs, who are running it like it was at Time Warner. This was a great company to work for before this happened. Now, we are bogged down in micromanagement and processes that flat out do not work. The customers will be the end losers once this all plays out. HeII is a place without any reason, and Time Warner is dragging Charter there, slowly but surely."
bad,After being in the cable industry for 25 years and 7 name changes and 7 relocation's the worse happened they sold out to Charter Communications who than re branded them self as Spectrum.
bad,"Poor training, poor management and poor equipment made for a very stressful environment. Technicians held responsible for issues completely beyond their control."
bad,"I was tasked to sell cable packages door to door. I walked down an assigned turf and knocked on my assigned doors to tried to get sales. I learned how to manage time, and meet with clients. the most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom I had managing my own business."
bad,"If there is a mistake created by any department the responsibility ultimately falls to the Technicians. Dispatch misses assigning a job, the Technician will be forced to work overtime to fix their mistake. Guide issues created by the department, the Technicians are punished for low numbers. Technicians are the ones carrying all of the weight and get screwed over the most. Working in terrible and unsafe working conditions. Sometimes working till 10-11pm, but management doesn't care cause they are home before 5pm."
bad,"A typical day at work will involve listening to a neighbor agent give mis-information to help boost their stats. You will have managers and supervisors inform you of different ways to lie to a customer. You will be told there is transparency, and listen to lie after lie from a manager. The best part of the job is getting to know your neighbors. You will get to speak with all the people that live in your area and have a chance to help them.  There is nothing better working with people to get to a resolution, and learning about the importance of tv and internet in their lives."
bad,"I've been there for 2 years.  For a non college graduate the place is probably one of the better paying jobs in the area.  The peopl over all is nice but the job is terrible.  "
bad,"Typical money hungry, deceptive, judgmental employees."
bad,"The department I worked in was not open to innovation, or change.  I was singled out and reprimanded by local management, for the attitude that was recognized for a company wide award by leaders in business partner roles.   Every attempt to make my area more efficient was shot down by local supervisors and management, but was encouraged by Spectrum's parent company, Charter.  Since I left my position locally, Charter has decided to ""restructure"" the department, and moved all jobs to Ohio."
bad,"This company wants right to work employees with no future and no benefits to a career. Discriminates against unions. Creates a hostile environment. Offers limited benefits you have to pay into. No pension. Limited 401k. No personnel time off, limited holiday time and acu sick time. Mandatory overtime with company discretion."
bad,"Been with Time Warner Cable for 17 years. This company cared for its employees by having trips to Great Adventure, Holiday parties, and giving out bonuses a few weeks before Christmas. Time Warner Cable was consumed by Spectrum (Charter), and all of those perks are gone."
bad,"Only real way for advancement here is by who you know. The field techs are the face and last to know anything, but first to take the brunt. You will be the most under paid in your field out of any other company in the area, yet more work will be dumped on you. It has become increasingly impossible to get your bonus. There is no time to take care of one customer at a time because you will be stacked with work in every time frame. You will have to force the company to give you a lunch and as a result miss a time frame. Over all the stress and headaches of this place make it not worth even applying."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Given way too many jobs, especially installs, which can take up to 6 hours each, some have to be rescheduled to the next day because we are no longer using contractors to run outlets and drops.  Middle management is almost a joke."
bad,"This company is about making money and that is it. It does not take into consideration its employees nor that of there customers. I was asked to do things to customers that were against my morals. Such as hiding certain fees, promotion roll off dates and bill increases. This is not a company that I would recommend to family or friends."
bad,Not very happy with the management at spectrum and the fact they promised a certain thing and it was not honored. It was a very stressful environment to work in.
bad,"Trust me you don't want to. To be honest When I first started I had no plans of staying. I started making good money because everyone in the company was shady. we would use fake names, ss even phone numbers to get accounts. management knew about it and did nothing. they were happy as long as you get the sale and don't get caught by upper management. I was bringing about 7-8k in commission alone so of course I was happy. I always thought to myself we couldn't keep this up for long. Then one day the company the company was bought over and eventually sales got harder to come by. Everyone had to make legit sales and put in the time. we all started quitting and that was that. I saw this coming a mile away. nine out of ten if you were a top rep you were doing the wrong thing and management knew about it. when some reps would get let go they would throw their supervisors under the bus"
bad,"i use to be a field tech for the company, very stressful doesnt pay good for what you do at all, management sucks and doesnt keep you in the loop, supposedly there is a program in place to move up (each market is different) but they didnt have the pay increase in order at all just title names and made us have a off site meeting about it an hour before our shift just to tell us the names and not even the pay, was only there for another 5 months and still heard nothing about pay. now i work doing buisness class in hospitals, no attics its freezing cold in there and conduit is pre ran so wall fishes are cake! and making 4 more dollars an hour!"
bad,"Be prepared to work in extreme weather and don't expect a reward."
bad,"Spectrum was always questionable in my eyes. They are a reactive company versus proactive, and that was before the merger with Charter. Since then things have only gotten worse. Charter brought their small-minded business thinking to a huge corporation and refused to listen to reason. There is always complete disarray across the platform within the company. For Spectrum to be a communications company they fail miserably in that department."
bad,"Time Warner as a company was fantastic. Amazing benefits, pay and management. When Time Warner was bought by Charter Communications, all of that changed. We went to capped commission with high goals making it impossible for some people to hit. I personally always exceeded goals 200% and more but the cap was at 200% and was told my management to not do anything more once I hit that goal so there were no advancements because I was told not to show my full potential. They eventually started hiring in people for less hourly and less commission so they got rid of all of the top sales people. "
bad,"There was very Poor management. Also,  Too many changes without proper training. No career advancement. Almost impossible to meet quota. Management requires large amounts of meetings that are not as efficient as desired"
bad,Spectrum is not a good company they are trying to make it not a good job anymore it was a good job but they are gonna take everything away from us and in return they will not have good employees you get what you pay for
bad,"Only care about business, not focused on employees or customers.  Are not open to work from home, as TWC was.  No flexibility, not nearly as concerned about providing a good work environment.  TWC would have early summer hours, lots of company events to show employee appreciation, more perks, Charter does not offer anything over and beyond what they must give you, and its alot less than what TWC gave."
bad,Worst place I ever worked. I was never treated so poorly in my life. There was no moving forward in the company. There was home life working there. I would not recommend anyone to go work there.
bad,"Horrible company, you vs the company vs the customer.  Will throw you under the bus to save face.  Departments talks negatively about other departments and the Company. One hand doesn't know what the other is doing. Customer service use to be what made them great as Bright House networks. As Spectrum they have done a complete 180• in policy."
bad,"The company is actually Charter Communications.  The brand is called Spectrum.  Although the company pays well, they do not treat their employees/customers well at all. I previously worked for Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Charter bought TWC out.  I enjoyed working for TWC but did not enjoy working for Charter at all.   I would not recommend Charter to anyone."
bad,"The area that i work in has no advancement opportunities, I am not fully trained and i have been with the company for a few years now. The old timers get away with quite a bit and management does nothing to uphold them."
bad,"The company changed drastically while I was there. What started as an amazing opportunity changed into a hostage situation. The pay was great, but support was minimal. I have no issue with changes, but there was never enough time and not all teams were on the same page. Communications in a communications company should be top priority."
bad,"After working there for almost a year, I've come to realize that the most important thing to the company is that. The company. I first joined the company for selfish reasons, free cable and internet. I came to enjoy the job, who I worked with, and who called in. There was always a customer during the day who bothered me, however you're bound to see those no matter what, but all in all I enjoyed helping. However, since the Spectrum take over, there has been no leniency to help customers. You are advised that there is no way AT ALL to help the customer lower there bill and they have to be happy with what they have. If you are scored poorly because the customer is unhappy and you cannot do anything for them, you get in trouble. If you transfer them to another department to solve the issue that you cannot solve, you get in trouble. If you credit an account more than a few cents, you get in trouble. If you advise them of alternative ways to lower your bill because there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to lower it with us, you get in trouble. There is NO winning for the rep, and there is definitely no winning for a subscriber."
bad,"The customers are great. The setup of the company as a whole, processes and all, clearly have total disregard for their employees. It is a heartless company to work for. If you have never worked in corporate America, you may not have the same experience. However, if you have, you'll see from day one exactly what I mean. A quiet, unfriendly atmosphere where your supervisor is not your help but often your hindrance."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"When I first started in 2014, this was an amazing company to work for very organized and driven. Once charter came into play the whole atmosphere and moral went to down with little direction an organization mishap through out the company"
bad,"Inbound call center. Taking sales calls from start to end of shift. Training program did not accurately prepare me for when I would start taking live calls. There were situations and products that in training I was told not to worry about it it would never come up, but when it does I revive no help from supervisor. There is not much support from supervisors mostly told to ask peers for help and look up articles in the interoffice system."
bad,"Its great at first. However, your life becomes horrible. supervisors threaten your job everyday if you don't produce. They do not care for Current customers. Makes you sell or jack up peoples bill when they clearly dont want or need it. they no longer pay well. you will hate your job everyday."
bad,"i really hated job, it was not suitable for me. The management were nothing but robots by just caring about the numbers instead of customers."
bad,"This company ""Charter"" has no forward thinking.  Their mentality is we have done it this was and it has worked so far.  But now, more than doubling in size, processes which marginally work, will break down and cause more problems.  However, upper management is continuing to be a top down organization and is deaf to any ""suggestions""."
bad,They are very strict and don't understand that no one's perfect. The people you work with are great but management could use a little help.
bad,"The job only lasted a couple of months before the company gave the entire division the axe and moved it to another location out of state, "
bad,They want you to work 12 hour days and they only pass you for 30 hours a week so that means your not getting no pay for half the time you put in your first three months worth of checks will look great but after you will barley be able to make ends meat horrible management who doesnt understand stand a family emergency if you dont sale then yout fired even if nobody talks to you
bad,"ales\Customer Service\Rentention Lead(SME)"
bad,"Great Pay and benefits. Have savings account and stash money. There is a turnover problem for a reason. Pray you don't get injured either bc not only will you be hurt, you will be jobless. They do not take care of employees. Their motto is you are easily replaceable. only reason management got two stars is bc my direct sup was the only one who cared about his team members."
bad,"answering a 100 calls per day, being degraded by customers on daily basis for things you cant control, very stressful job with managment who doesnt care, metrics that have to be met that are obsurd"
bad,I'll start by saying 2 years of hard work and effort gone down the drain! Turned in my resignation and not one manager or supervisor even questioned why. My mind was made up but I atleast wanted to say why. The management in this department was so unprofessional that all I got was thanks enjoy your life in those exact words. The manager had snuck out the door said nothing to me for two weeks. I finished my shift and left. That's how TWC thanks you for coming to work!
bad,For the Pacific Northwest region this is the most logistically challenging career I've ever had. Commute can be nearly 500 miles a day. No help from Management and weekly hours worked can be close to 70-80 hours a week. Over-worked and under-paid.
bad,"Managers do not listen when you have problems behind your control.  They only care about themselves and not their employees. We bust out backs doing the job and getting it done well and there is no appreciation.  Pay sucks,  not competitive to other warehouse jobs out there."
bad,horrible place to work. if you aren't in sales making the company huge amounts of money you are treated like something less than excrement.  The only thing good about the job was the benefits.
bad,I worked at time warner for almost 2 years and I can say it wasn't an enjoyable experience. Everyone in the company from Managers down to the agents on the floor have no sense of professionalism and there is absolutely no room for growth unless you know someone who knows someone.
bad,Actually one of the worst places I have worked. The pay is good but that's about it. In nesting the mentors talk about u behind your back like your incompetent. They talk to you like u been working there years like they don't want to help you. Management is iffy. Your basically lying to the customers. Every customer that call is almost livid but they expect for you to be off the call in a timely matter but you can't resolve the issue. They hire anybody so everybody confused. I could go on for days. Be careful working here.
bad,They have a high turnover because they do not seem to care about their agents. Managers will walk right by their agents and will not speak.   Their benefits are wonderful though.
bad,"When I first got the job they said its a 90 day waiting period to become union, then 2 weeks into being employed they say oh sorry its now 180 days. Training was supposed to be 6 weeks, I got only 2 weeks. I was fine with the fact I was employed, but I did not like that ""oh by the way- switch up, i might not have taken that particular job, as I had other options at the time."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"The pay and compensation was a bit above average for the field, if you perform well in sales and take the commission into consideration."
bad,The expectation is that you work 6 12 hours days a week.  The Director has stated he's not concerned about your work life balanece
bad,very stressful job. training is easy but o the floor is totally different. the management only cares bout u when your sales are up. and you have meetings about the same info all the time. customers on calls are very rude sometimes
bad,"I should've known what I was getting myself into, applying for a call center job. the pay kind of blinds everyone. its good pay but not for the stuff and less than polite people that you have to put up with. you cant take unpaid time off. they lie to you in the interview saying there's an 85% chance you'll get 2 days off in a row, then in training learn there's an 85% chance you will get split days off. my friend's great grandmother passed away, and they refused to let her have the day off for her funeral because they decided she wasn't close enough family. I have nothing good to say about this company."
bad,I was there for almost 5 years which was considered a veteran there. People are fired and quit everyday there. TWC is always training new people due to the turn around. The supervisors are the worst a customer asks for a supervisor and they refuse to talk to the customer and ask you to lie you to them. Oh and they love to rip off there customer's. Not a honest place to work.
bad,Start the day off taking sales calls then later in the day customers who are canceling will call in. Calls are based off of position but always get calls that we do not handle as a team which affect our commission pay out. Commission goes up and down depending on type of calls. High Expectations without any help
bad,"A typical day at this workplace, is stressful. While i love to bonus an be financially stable, I love to be happy and enjoy happy people. I enjoy meeting new people and being able to help while not having to decide between my lively hood an being human. The money can be great when they allow you to make it. I recommend the job for people who do not have small children or children in sports."
bad,"The Company doesn't care about customers or its employees, it doesn't care about what you have to do the job, its only focus is numbers and money. This is by far the most unorganized, unethical company i have ever worked for."
bad,"BHN was a great place to work 2 years ago when I started, alas the culture has changed. "
bad,"Management by intimidation, High pressure Sales, Low Morale, High Turnover, Quotas set so high only about 1% of the Account Executives made them. Focus on ""Get the contract"" without any concern for the customer experience. Account Executives rarely took  any vacation since their quotas never went on vacation. You are just a number on a spreadsheet. Your value to Managment is based on yesterday's sales. No job security due to constant threat of firing if you don't make quota, and the pending merger with Comcast."
bad,"long work hours "
bad,"Field work isn't as bad as office work, but you still have to deal with overly incompetent management.  Working in the office adds to this with management playing favorites and the politics get quite out of hand.  The work isn't hard, and you'll find some people there know what they're doing, but for the most part you'll find yourself doing the same mind-numbing work over and over; surrounded by people that can't handle the easiest of tasks.  Notorious for hiring ""warm-bodies"" while pushing those who speak up to the side or out the door.  Don't ever mention the evil ""U"" word or you'll find yourself in the unemployment line."
bad,The benefits are awesome but the pay is trash. They aren't reliable cable isn't a necessity and it will soon end.
bad,"***  After 7 years my whole department was laid off on 05/01/2013. We had a meeting at the Marriott hotel in St Petersburg at 1030am. At 1031am, we were told the department was closed. Our super were let go earlier. Changes to be relocated, forget about it. It is all about numbers. all of our talent,training,etc gone !!.   So,all is just plain B.S.  all that ""HELLO friend"", well where were you old friend. But got money for BIG commercials and poor equipment, signal,internet dropping more that rain..  We all are just plain numbers,no loyalty from them or anybody in corporate America......  YES !! we were laid off from Bright House !!"
bad,"As a former leader I tried desperately to make a difference but if you report anything or try to bring anything to light you will be crushed! The employees don't come in to work wanting to be told ""you suck"" but that's what you will get in Inbound Sales and not just as an agent. If you are a Supervisor be prepared to give your life up. The holidays and the perks everyone else receives don't exist for you, The department operates by their own rules. You better laugh at their jokes, like what they like and don't be different. My advice save yourself a  whole lot of stress and go work somewhere else TWC isn't worth it any more! The stories about the EMS showing up is true. If you are qualified for this position think about this would you want to work for a place that had 100% attrition last year. As a leader we know people leave jobs for 1 reason their horrible bosses!  As for the rest of TWC disappointed they haven't come to the rescue with this group. TWC can do better than bosses that say you suck and freak out over the use of one word over another. Get over it Mad Men and just treat people right!"
bad,"I LOVE my co-workers and the benefits....These are the ONLY good things about the job. The job is stressful and the pay does NOT compensate for the stress. Management allows customers to yell at you, belittle you and curse at you and there is nothing you can do like release the call or contact a SUP."
bad,"Customer Service has been a career I have been involved in for over 10 years and have never worked in a place where the word ""Customer Service"" was so far from the definition. I have to believe in the product I am selling and I just couldn't find 1 thing position about it. Missed appointments for service calls and installs after WE missed the appointment (without even a call) we then throw the PAYING customer to the back of the line for another week or more, then more likely than not, for another missed appointment. "
bad,"outbound calling kept lowering money and leads, management very negative in this department."
bad,"I worked for Charter as a Direct Sales Rep doing door to door sales. I started out with one manager who told us the honest way of doing business. My first day out of training, he left the company. 3 months later we got another manager from Comcast who had completely different ethics. After I learned of an embezzlement scheme that him and 3 other employees were doing I reported it through a ""confidential"" 3rd party. Over the course of 2 months they defrauded the company of more than 100k in commissions on false sales agreements. 2 weeks after I reported it I was terminated and I am still  in a legal battle with them for my last paycheck. They provided an electronic copy of my check stub to me, but withheld it from the bank and then attempted to falsify my time records. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Great benefits and great pay. Horrible management that doesn't care about the employees well being. 
bad,"A typical day at work was sitting at the computer for a full shift and assisting customers with any issues that they had with their internet, cable or home phone service. We learned how to properly troubleshoot our devices to ensure that we were able to satisfy the customer 100%. My co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of the job was being written up after I had to leave work early, because I thought I was miscarrying my child. They knew the situation and I'm surprised that after this happened, and it was something that was uncontrollable, that they would not have written me up. I had to threaten legal action in order for them to realize that they can not write up a woman if she has to leave to go to the emergency room when she is miscarrying her child! Nothing was enjoyable after this experience."
bad,"Take inbound calls all day. 90% of the calls are unhappy customers with ongoing issues with their cable equipment. Some customers have went through 3 converter boxes within the past month. On top of that you are expected to make a sales transition which is impossible. BHN has a sales department, so I could not understand the pressure of meeting a sales quota every month within customer care department. Supervisors are unable to help you out with simple issues and will interrupt another CSR on the floor to find the answer for you. Very stressful environment but my Coworkers were great. We supported one another greatly with anything. The most enjoyable part of the jobe was speaking with friendly customers and talking about their favortie TV programs and upgrading the internet speed to meet the quotas. BHN has excellent people in higher positions in management, but overall I would not recommend working here unless you can sell prescription glasses to a blind person!"
bad,"I managed 7 cable office that covered Southeast TN, North Ga and a fee systems in AL. I was over all aspects of the business which include but not limited to, training, public and government relations, marketing, human recourses, FCC compliance, saftey and budgets. I managed over 120,000 customers and 120 employees"
bad,"I got a bad vibe the first day on the job. They weren't aware I was starting and were very unprepared (my computer and phone were not set up). I was ignored for the first week and the only reason I learned anything about my job is by taking initiative and asking questions until I finally was fed up and took it upon myself to jump in and get to work. There were too many bad signs about this company to keep ignoring. I quickly found out the high turnover rate and witnessed in my first two weeks as one quit and the other broke down crying on the job. It's a very odd company culture that doesn't value hard work or intelligence but whether or not you ""fit in."" Definite favoritism and a very hostile environment where people curse, say vulgar comments, and talk down to employees. Most of the sales people were very immature and there were a lot of petty attempts at bullying. A very unprofessional work environment that was near impossible to get anything done. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work here. I quit because I could no longer waste my time with a company with those values. The money is not worth it."
bad,TWC pays very well but it is very stressful. The calls are constantly in a queue and there is no time for an outside life. Your schedule changes every 3-6 months. Most of my co-workers were always scared of being fired.
bad,"TWC - Things Will Change - idiots in corporate - justifying their paychecks, evidently, change company policy CONSTANTLY. They'll even get in arguments via email in front of the sales force because they're too mentally lazy to hit ""reply"" instead of ""reply all"". Local head guy is an empty suit who hires people with NO EXPERIENCE in doing the call center sales job as Supervisors! How is someone who knows NOTHING about a job going to ""coach"" you or help you when they've NEVER done the job themselves?"
bad,"I helped Bright House Media Strategies formerly known as Bright House Advertising become a multi-million dollar powerhouse by Producing creative, award winning commercials that worked. When the great recession hit middle age Video Producers were let go after giving BHN the best years of their lives. We were basically thrown away."
bad,This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. Charter does not care one single bit about their employees. They try to give away all these free prizes to make up for being the worst ran company ever. I don't ever recommend working there.
bad,I would not suggest Time Warner Cable of San Diego for employment. The company has gone down hill since a significant portion of Adelphia was purchased after that company had been run into bankruptcy.
bad,"After working for Time Warner Cable of NYC for 27 years andmaking then Millions of dollars, they outsourced my job to California at the age of 55 yrs old. My entire department and most departments are gone. This is all because of the 3 regional presidents that now run the company."
bad,employee sales quota is to high. health benifets are good.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
bad,"The interview process is a time when you get to know the company better and they certainly get to know you. The interview was weak at best on the company's' behalf. They ask little questions and then you're rushed out (so they can get to the next 20 applicants) not knowing much more than when you walked in. The interview should be a time when an applicant should be able to ask questions in order to make a responsible choice. They assume everyone needs a job and treat it as an assembly line. The only point that was very clear is they want you to work 6 days a week to meet quotas. It tells me management is under a quota crunch (which is normal) and is unable to satisfy their goals, leading to a quantity of applicants not quality. It looked to me that there was no time for them to listen. It has to make you wonder how much worse it could be if you were to work there with the same people. If they hired quality in the fist place and set a standards, they would not have a massive hiring frenzy and loss of employees & customers. In conclusion you could leave a potentially decent job and walk into a new job blindsided by unrealistic expectations and a promise of a base salary, and can't go back to your old job. The interview took less than 20 minutes. You be the judge!"
bad,I worked for the company for over 5 years and I can honestly say I did love my job and I enjoyed going to work every day I was scheduled some days were trying but not often.
bad,"there is no typical day at spectrum one day it can be fast paced and the next it will be going slow, spectrum mobile is fairly new so there is a few things that can be better lack of help."
bad,Most of the calls I received were for customers who had no internet or called about a product Spectrum did not make or provide. I struggled to help customers and stay within the time limit of assisting the customer.
bad,"Management often experimented with their rapid and random decisions to results methodology. Due to underdeveloped managers, this often lead to poor employee engagement and catering to favorites."
bad,"I started when I had just found out I was pregnant, once the job found out certain people Up the chain would be little me. I had scheduled bathroom breaks which were always when the bathroom was being cleaned so I would have to walk to a different building. This lead to my adherence never being able to be fixed. I had a doctors note for longer or more bathroom breaks which they just shortened the ones I had and expected me to be able to be done in 7 minutes. Work force would constantly belittle me and lie on me. Once my child was born. I was told 12 minutes should be more than enough to set up in the nursing room, pump, clean the items, use the bathroom and get back to my desk on the opposite side of the building. I was told by HR that how his wife pumped only took a few minutes but she was a stay at home mom so I should be just fine. I tried to report a hostile work environment but the people I were reporting were brought into the office with me(intimidation). Everything I ever reported they seemed to not have any record of it or would just tell me it must be a miscommunication. So I gave up and quit."
bad,"If you love being overbooked and under staffed, constantly behind schedule, mandatory overtime almost every night and have to work on days off and holladays, threat of being written up for any little thing, being secretly spied on and photographed (yes, it's true), a monthly report card that grades you on some things that are completely out of your control, installing inferior equipment,  this is the job for you."
bad,"Work life balance was terrible, management seemed like they were always trying to catch you messing up. The pay and overtime was nice, but I would probably only recommend this job to people who were already cable professionals"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"never ever ever never work for spectrum the upper managment will quickly turn on you and throw you under the bus just to set an example, doesnt matter how long you worked for them"
bad,The company as bright house was one of the. Best companys I've ever worked for. I felt valued and appreciated. After charter took over it orogresivkey became clear they dont care about there customers or employees. Me as a employee likes to feel valued like I'm a part of the team.
bad,"- no advancement"
bad,"Became stressful then they laid us off. So not to many great things to say! When we were brighthouse you can tell the company genuinely cared about there employees, once spectrum took over we all became just a number. Policies were implemented which pretty much had to make us bad customer service reps we would find ourselves forced to have to say no pretty much for everything a customer may ask such as can i get your bill down big fat no! So of course customers would hate us because we are on the front line!"
bad,Its too stressful to work somewhere where everytime you answer the phone the customer is yelling and berating you. And no matter how rude they are spectrum policy is you cant hang up on them. Spectrum took over an already failing internet cable system from time Warner and they immediately started offering speeds that the company isn't capable of. So the internet was down alot.
bad,"The company is a good company, the employees don't care about much besides their role, willing to do anything to keep there jobs. Would i apply again. never"
bad,Company doesn’t care about employees changes things constantly as well as rules and lies about bonuses to there employees if you want a job where you call the same customers over and over and get hung up on all day this is the place for you
bad,"The tasks and jobs are forever changing. Very fast paced with barely any time in between calls. Customers can be stressful but the company itself is constantly applying pressure. Micromanagement. Little to no concern about the mental health of agents while working here. You are treated like a machine, and the slightest drop on your scorecard is frowned upon despite high scores in other areas."
bad,"The work is not hard, management regularly takes away tools and resources needed to accomplish your tasks, management does not listen to feedback from technicians, company regularly lies to customers and the technicians are the ones who have to tell them they were lied to and that nothing can be done about it."
bad,"Good benefits and free cable. But stressful, hard work, working alone, 7-9 jobs a day to do. Equipment isn't good, customer always mad at company. Only 1 hour to do a job where you should be getting 2 hours"
bad,"The training is excellent. The job is incredibly stressful and metric based. Felt pretty important on the job, until they literally started hiring people off the street. The customers were mostly restless and relentless, so be prepared. I met some wonderful people and it paid the bills well, but when a hard fall down the stairs is a blessing, its time to switch careers."
bad,Summerville manager is aweful doesnt care for his tech. No recognition always talks about if you dont listen he will write you up. Fantastic employees
bad,Horrible management.  If you are a good person who puts customers first run as fast as you can...They fire people quickly who put customers first.  it’s base plus commissions they  keep making your sales goals higher and higher so commissions is hard to get.  Spectrum took every thing that was good about time warner away.  It used to be you couldn’t get into spectrum to get a job because everyone stayed for years now the turn over rate is insane. Good luck trying to get management to help you with anything there on conference calls and meetings so they never have time to help do there job or get things fixed or take care of things that is beyond a sales reps control and your lucky if you can find one because they fire them so quickly.  . I had acts I was working on four or five months to get there services or credits fixed because management wouldn’t follow through.    Good luck finding out your commissions. The system is down half the time.  Oh and you never have enough help in the stores because they can’t keep anyone.  They fire good employees.  Not to mention they don’t fire the unethical people who put cable or other services on peoples acts who never wanted them... which is illegal.  If you turn those people in then watch out your going to get fired.  Don’t stay more than  a few years because if you do your getting paid to much and they fire you.  They lie to you over and over.  I was told that all the extra time I put in for when they had digital switch over from analog to digital where everyone had to get a box would weigh heavily on our review and it didn’t even though
bad,Management lacks skills to work with people.  Having a personality should be a requirement for all managers.  They have big egos and lack the skills to work in a truly professional environment.
bad,"Managers are very hypocritical and rude, treat you like a number & will talk bad about other employees right next to you while you are trying to take phone calls. You are forced to work OT since they have such a high turn over rate & can not keep people. The 6 week training does not prepare you for the calls you will take whatsoever so you’re forced to ask questions and annoy the supervisors who will not help. Rules change with every supervisor you speak to so there isn’t a set answer to most questions. You have to plan your time off, even if it is sick time or else management will yell at you & tell you that you weren’t sick & work is more important... then in turn your manager will call in sick for an entire week & everything is fine...... Plus customers are only calling to cancel service & are very upset so you are being yelled at all day... only benefit to this place is pay, so if you can deal with that for good money this is good for you."
bad,"This is probably one of the most stressful jobs already dealing with customers, but when you get no support from your management, and hiring of unqualified personnel just to fill the seats, it makes your job that much more difficult. Fights break out, folks are rude to the customers, and the favoritism management shows to various employees makes you feel unwanted. They claim open door policy, but HR or management could care less about concerns you have. The benefits are great which is the only reason for working there, but ever since Charter has taken over, quality has been less of a concern. Policies make resolving customer issues difficult, and your supervisor is no help. It's hard to maintain when you're getting cussed out 30 to 40 times a day, only to be told ""Hey, you're not meeting your numbers"" for the month, which by the way, change to whatever management decided is the Hot Stat of the quarter. Not a place i would ever suggest someone works at. The free cable (well discounted now that Charter has taken over) isn't worth it."
bad,"I was a CSS at Time Warner Cable and then Spectrum for over ten years. Calls were non-stop, back-to-back all day, and the overwhelming majority of them were escalated customer complaints, especially when our call center was relegated to billing. Many callers would take pains to clarify they weren't angry with the company and not me, but many others were offensive and abusive, if not actually threatening. Prepare to have your intelligence, honesty or sexual orientation questioned on a regular basis. Management is aware but provides only token sympathy; but every second of your day is scrutinized with every conceivable metric, most importantly and ironically customer satisfaction, after other employees' negligence and a system that makes mistakes easy and rectification difficult have caused serious issues with the customer's service and account. The company philosophy is that the customer can afford more than what they'll admit, and customer complaints mean job security. Management can ignore the customer resentment, their market turf is staked out; it's up to you to weather the abuse and maintain your professionalism. The employees who socialize instead of applying themselves to the work and tune the office televisions (intended for use in trouble-shooting when the call center handled  technical customer issues) to entertainment channels, and then raise the volume (in a customer call center!) are the ones who get promoted. The benefits are good, as they must be to persuade anyone to remain in that pressure-cooker."
bad,Everyday is a struggle. Learned a lot.Management sucks.Too much stress for little pay. Being cussed out and yelled at all day.highlight is going home.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Giant soulless corporation with inept local management that gives you free internet.  There are some cool people on staff, don't get me wrong, but everyone is replaceable and knows it."
bad,"A day in the life of a Charter (Spectrum) employee goes as such; go in and try to find a desk near your team (good luck), log in, get yelled at by customers for a few hours, take a 15 minute break, go back and get yelled at for a few hours, take your lunch, go back and get yelled at again until the end of your shift. Rinse and repeat 5 times a week."
bad,management talks down and treats employees like trash. coworkers are good people. they give you free internet cable and phone. but if management doesn't like you they let it be known. they set high goals but all the customer service and tech support calls come to sales when they are not supposed to and they count it against you.
bad,"Working at Spectrum will leave you stressed and very depressed. There is NO stability  whats so ever. They try to make you feel like they care. This company will replace you so quickly, and hire just as quick. You have to keep up with the  metrics that a small percentage of the call center is making, If you have a lot of responsibilities this job isn't for you, and the parking lot downstairs from the building SUCKS smh."
bad,"I didn't even make it through my 6 week training. I went in under the impression that it was a customer service job. I come to find out that customer service agents have to deal with Technical Support issues, billing and sales. It seemed as if cs agents do everything the other departments don't want to. Agents are micromanaged, encouraged not to take any break between calls, and treated like school children. I had a wake to attend and had to prove that I attended. The benefits are good, but honestly it's not worth it."
bad,"Most people in upper management came up through the ranks at Charter.  They seem to be set in their ways and not open new ideas or suggestions.  If you are going to work here, you most likely will have to buy into their way of doing things if you want to last."
bad,its an ok place to work. Not very family friendly. Very strict when it comes to hours. Not much backup on the phones.Ok pay nothing fgor the amount of work you do
bad,"NO Tools or training, was assigned projects with no product or process training. Very unorganized.  More work than hours in the day. No flexibility and micromanaged."
bad,Worked for 3 years great reviews and performance got sick company changed over from Time Warner and Charter implementation of new policies is not clear without communication and no proper out boarding if they terminate you. No HR communication I'm currently in process of lawsuit. Charter is extremely inconsistent and unprofessional.
bad,This job is just okay. I would say it was nothing special and I wouldn't recommend anyone to get comfortable because this job can be very stressful. They listen to everything you say and do. Its always something that can be done better. TWC would never be satisfied.
bad,"If you don't mind pushing the envelope of questionable morals and ethics, this is the place for you.  Supervisors, managers, and upper management seem to be promoted by years of service vs. being good at the job."
bad,"I find it hatd to work for a company that does not treat employees like humans. Supervisors are always trying to threaten employess, there is no moral and they are unwilling to help. The supervisors could care less about all employees"
bad,"job is a numbers game. your whole performance is based on metrics if you are 1% off your metrics you get wrote up. continue being 1% or more off your metrics they will fire you. the metric numbers and how its all calculated is impossible to figure out, and twc has tighten the numbers up so much it is difficult for people to reach the high goals that are set"
bad,"horrible horrible place, you have a diff supervisor every month, rules are never consistent. Minimum assistance from senior members most of the time. Especially the cocky ones who have no clue on what they are doing."
bad,"Its a decent job to have if you're in the cool crowd. Don't speak any negative truth about the politics or you will be cut. I was there for 15 years as a tech in various departments and they loved me until I told an indirect supervisor not to raise his voice at me, I'm not his child. Next thing I knew, fired. Never an incident over the entire 15 years. If someone wants you gone, you're gone. Statistically only 5% of their employees get to actually retire from there, and that's probably only executives and the people they forgot to cut prior."
bad,If you like to be micromanaged and like the setting of highschool this is the job for you. This job is about who you know and how much they like you.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Great middle and entry level employees who work hard everyday but  recent changes to senior and executive level management has produced a toxic culture. This new management team seem to have no direction and lay blame at the feet of lower directors and managers instead of taking responsibility for actions they solely own.
bad,"I prefer to work with a company that is organized, and that communicates with their employees, and knows how to train their employees the correct way, instead of sending them out into the field setup for failure. But I did learn about the cable industry and I do appreciate the leads that helped along the way to make sure that I understood what I was working with and how to troubleshoot the proper way so that the subscriber's service can be within specification."
bad,"high call volumhe, time warner cable has customer service reprsentatives  has to do everything from troubleshooting, billing inquiries and make sales"
bad,A typical work day is to much work. The management is on the negative side employees opinions.
bad,"Miserable... everyone in the place is miserable!  People hate coming to work and hate the management.  very cady, clique-y, highly emotionally unstable little girls working there."
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for, and I will never work for them again!  In a typical day as a Customer Service Rep, you are to clock in and log into your phone and immediately take calls, failing to immediately log in to the phone will get you a coaching session with your supervisor, when you need help or have a question you will not get an answer... supervisors leave on personal errands for hours, and tell you to look the answer up online... Taking bathroom breaks is something that is timed and if you do so you will get an instant message or email about it, this counts against you.   Although this is not a SALES position you will constantly be pushed to up sell callers when they are calling in because they are MAD about a bill or the service.  Failure to keep up with quotas will get your coached then terminated... I was ""laid off"" because I did not work for them a full year, I was with them 11 months and 3 weeks... so I did not QUALIFY for FMLA! I had my son at only 25 weeks, and he was in the NICU, they( TWC) refused to let me have time off because I was not with them a full year, and told me I could re-apply when I am ready to work again! Sadly my son passed at only 10 days old... TWC does not care about the entry level workers, and 6 out of 10 members on management are related in the Middletown NY Call Center!"
bad,"Was only there 7 months. Restructured things 3 times, fired my boss and his boss and then reassigned my job to a different city 40 miles from the office I was hired in at. (so they wouldn't have to pay mileage)"
bad,No need for a review...run from this place! The sales comp used to be very good but changed and became mediocre.
bad,"They pay was good as long as you worked very hard. I didnt like that no one was ever on the same page. One supervisor would tell you one thing and it wouldnt be correct. Job security isnt good either. The turn over rate is very bad there. The customers arent that bad or rude. Its a very stressful environment to work in due to the amount of calls that come in and the shortage of representatives. O yeah and they wont give you any warnings if you mess up, even if its minor, they will just fire you. I guess its cheaper to just do that lol."
bad,This should have been a career position instead of a job but because of self serving middle managers and over paid executives this was just a job for 6 years.
bad,"This is a very stressful place to work. Besides dealing with angry customers on a daily basis, they have very strict guidelines that I feel do not have anything to do with customer service. We cannot just be customer care, we have to be sales agents, collections and technicians when they do have specific departments that are to handle these situations. We are graded by our customers, fellow agents and management. We are put on probation for low sales, not high enough customer compliments, not enough calls handled, if we take too much time handling customer concerns, etc. We have 1 month and if we cannot improve per Time Warner standards, we are fired. We work on a day to day basis. No job security. Also we are only allowed 5 minutes a day to use the restroom"
bad,"I had lots of perks at the time, I had free cable and internet which was nice. But once spectrum bought time warner then the problem really started. Everyone felt that spectrum was just cutting corners trying to make back the money they lost buying out the company (lower quality tools, splitters, and cable boxes) at the customers expense because prices stayed the same."
bad,"As Time Warner Cable, they had strived to make sure we were as happy as the customers we took care of. Now we would be lucky to get a pizza part for the teams if stats were good."
bad,"Needing an improvement for the training process, keeping the floor on the same page to avoid the high turn over and stressful and irritating environment."
bad,"Take is from someone that work with this company's biggest competitor, spectrum does not take care of their employees."
bad,"It’s not customer service, it’s just about getting people off the phones. Responsibilities are tossed back and forth. All departments are separate. No communication. Systems are in operable most the time. You’ll be in the middle of a call and have to restart all you programs then get told you take too long on calls. They don’t train you how to deal with situations or their coding system. You are expected to do billin, troubleshoot, dispatch, and more.Most of the training process involved making posters and putting on skits instead of actually learning what you use on the floor."
bad,"Several flaws in the day to day operation from office to field techs causing improper reports to be filed in many spread sheets with direct data errors. The process on data printed out did not always match up with technical procedures that were completed at the job. Most supervisors would be reluctant to correct the information which could cause an issue with timely promotions or put you in a speedy probationary process at know fault of your own, do to data discrepancies."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"This is the most despicable company that I have ever worked for.  The turnover rate is 70% in 6 months, yet they are constantly threatening the jobs of those individuals that stay."
bad,"All processes have been normalized for all regions and locations that Spectrum services despite the varying challenges each market may have. Everything is micro managed and requires layers of approval regardless of tenure or experience. Technicians are held responsible for factors outside of their control, even when said factors can be explained and demonstrated."
bad,I would not recommend spectrum to my worst enemy. The company policy itself is very harsh on the customers and it was a headache everyday to have to basically get over on customers because of company policy.
bad,This job does not care about its employees the management team is terrible no one communicates supervisors are not knowledgeable and they wear their best employees out
bad,"I started with Spectrum in Florence KY when it was a billing call center. It was a tough job, but nothing too unexpected when dealing with angry customers and their bills. The culture, co-workers and management more than made up for the unfortunate but unavoidable parts of the job. It was genuinely like a work family and everyone cared about everyone else. Then we switched to outbound sales and everything changed. It all went downhill from there. The culture is awful and everyone is miserable. The management is awful. They don't care about their employees anymore, you're just treated like a number. Things change daily and these changes aren't always communicated but of course you're still expected to know and implement them. If you ask a question, you'll get different answers from everyone because nobody is ever on the same page. There's no room for advancement because they hire outside the company. The job itself is awful, you're just cold calling the same people over and over again and asking them to buy our products and getting cussed out most of the time because they've been called by us so often. The pay is not worth the stress and commission checks are always screwed up and you can't count on getting them corrected. You don't have the right tools or resources to make enough sales and little to no coaching is provided but you're still expected to improve and meet your goals. If you're not meeting them, management is very degrading. It took me a while to leave the company but once I did, I couldn't name one reason to stay. "
bad,"The best part of coming in everyday was my work Mates, however a lot of issues came from higher ups high demands for productivity that made it hard to even breathe. Ffinally if you have any issues with any higher up going and seeking concil is ridiculous. Nothing is done and you are seen as an outcast from most managers. The location is fine however the overall staff is sad."
bad,This job was beyond stressful. They care more about making money then making sure their employees are happy and are in a professional work environment. The company itself is cheating customers out of thousands of dollars a year by over charging them.
bad,Spectrum has killed the Outside Sales Rep. Postion. You have no referrals so if you know anyone who wants cable or get a call you cant sale them. Only the leads they give you. And half of those leads are vacant houses or condemned trailers. Base pay is poor and the Management expects you to go to customers houses at 8pm to 9pm or else. They dont care about your safety.         all. If
bad,very stressful.  everything is always changing   very unhappy customers customers or employees ideas are never taken into consideration. pulling back support for the employees
bad,Working for Time Warner Cable was great until Spectrum bought them and changed everything for the worse. Got rid of important jobs. Didn't take care of employees. Made it easier for the company to make money and harder for the employees to earn.
bad,Spectrum in Harlingen is all about numbers . Your numbers have to be exact according to rules made up quarterly. You can’t be perfect and you can’t under perform either.
bad,"Management at the Greensboro, NC location is horrible. They expect you to manage the store while they sit in the office and avoid helping you at all costs. Then they say we’re inefficient because we have to help each other, when all of the staff has less than a yr with the company and new employees are literally thrown to the wolves with no training of the systems that we use for 90% of our transactions. We have no choice but to help each other because our leadership refuses to do so. Then we’re expected to sell sell sell with customer wait times of over an hour and a half. My advise in any job search is to check the locations turnover rate. If it’s high, like this store, it’s most likely a horrible place to work especially when the income potential there is high."
bad,Thougt the company would be great since I had 5 yrs experience. But after the training I was sent to an area far from where i lived and system wasnt up to date with training I recieved. Also management would stalk you on your jobs and gos trackers were on everything. They also didnt care about your input as an installer and job safety.
bad,"This was a wonderful job before charter merger. The commission was amazing. The benefits were outrageous. The teamwork was amazing. Charter took over and the commission structure changed, the benefits were worse, and they wanted us to lie to our customers...The integrity is totally questionable. I know longer recommend working there I hate to say."
bad,"Company was better off with Time Warner.  Benefits are good, Unless you are a member of the good ol'boy network you have no chance of promotions.  Good for Starting out your a career but not a place to stay and retire from"
bad,"You are assigned 500 residential leads per month. You have to go door-to-door to these residences and listen, diagnose and prescribe the proper spectrum residential services."
bad,"Rules and code of conduct in place however it is very much a make it up as you go environemnt by management. If you like micromanagement, this is the place for you. Want to give you assigned break times and lunch times. There is no quality in place however managers try to act as if they are quality analyst. If you are outperforming sales metrics, you are automatically under the radar. Currently on a paid suspension from the company because I used my head and sold within guidelines and apparently stepped on some toes."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"The pay was excellent. ... that's really the only good thing I can say about this company."
bad,When I worked there the culture they perpetuated was competitive and sharp. They would create things they said were band-aids and they never pulled them back to their proper positions when the band-aid should have fallen off.
bad,very stressful. Not much future for career. Employees are graded on a unrealistic bean count system and stacked ranked against each other from multiple departments.
bad,I was at spectrum for a year no write ups or anything i had to reassign in july due to personal reasons i recently reapplied was scheduled for a interview which i went to find out that they did not have any results from when i did it which didnt make sense because i was scheduled for one i then called to speak to a recruiter about the status of my application to find out i wasnt considered for the postion they felt there were other candidates qualified which doesnt make any sense being that ive worked here all i can say for rehires is be careful because this company is shady and if the supervisor didnt like or dosent like you they can disqualify you from moving foward when you did a great job or just not put your interview answers in the system like they did me discrimination all the way 😡
bad,"The call center environment was bad enough with the customers screaming at us over things that were out of our control, but then to have impossible metrics to live up to made it unbearable."
bad,"I was traveling for the company to different locations they didn't factor in my sales from my home store to the stores I was traveling from, store goals are set way to high, and they cant be met so goals for the store are unreasonable."
bad,"Not recommended if looking for a steady work schedule, benefits are nice but don't make up for the constant stress of having to beat out other co workers for top spots to keep your shift"
bad,"Your training will not remotely equip you for your responisibilities.  They are lying when they say you'll get all the support you need.  You'll be riduculed and told ""you know this.""  You will not be warned that the customers are furious about being continuously lied to  about their bills.  Run for your life.  Work anywhere else."
bad,"Time Warner was a very good place to work that valued employees and rewarded good performance,Charter (Spectrum) on the other hand was performance driven only gave employees poor work management no tools to fix problems. The sales department continued to misquote customers with rates and internet speeds and never did anything to correct customers being lied too with gross neglegent  fraud even after documentation to support claim"
bad,It is a great place to work unfortunately it is just to much of a long drive. Where I work it was a great staff and supervisor.  But it is very hard to get a certain date off.
bad,UNION BUSTERS!!! Managements leads with a boot on neck mentality. Only cares about metrics customers come last. Flawed metric system and nobody cares they just want numbers which are inflated.
bad,"When starting at Spectrum, I was very happy, I had a great team, great coworkers, and great benefits. However after a couple months the stress of the job and the environment came to play. Granted all jobs have stress, and hardships. But when working at Spectrum it was very hard to find a day that wasn't filled with stress. Not to mention the unorganized teams that it comes with. You spend your entire day being yelled at, attempting to assist a customer, as well as meet company standards in certain scored areas."
bad,very stressful environment you have to make your quota in three months or you are out and they count your training time into the three months. services never worked angry customers can completely ruin your numbers and it will be put on you not the companies terrible service. you only have two 15 minute break and your lunch hour so bring your water to your desk and hold your bladder till your break. The management and supervisors are fine even great but the company for both customers and employees is terrible also if you just get hired make sure you look through all the consent forms they have a document that automatically signs for you when you first start stated you will not sue the company and will handle all issues with the companies legal team.
bad,"TWC was an amazing place to work - I should know, I was there over 20 years.  When Charter bought them, it went downhill over night.  Very poor corporate culture and non-existent values.  They value no one below the SVP level."
bad,"The worst part was the horrible micro managing and the unrealistic expectations that management has for the technicians . Thebest part working for spectrum was that it was a union shop. Everything we had was thanks to the union. Pay , benefits, life insurance, time off."
bad,I currently work here and i honestly don't care for this job at all. Like this job is so stressful and you are always under pressure to impress supervisors.
bad,Dysfunctional.  Way too many changes with policies and procedures. Lousy training.  Unless you were her favorite pet she did not have your back.  Would not recommend company on any level.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,As a dsr this company has made it near impossible to make a big check. It can happen if you learn some shady tricks or get lucky. For the most case though they swamp a area with too many reps that annoy every house on the block each and every month if not every other month with the same never changing deal 89.97 for all 3 services. You can not sell anything other than triple plays and a very few double plays. If you sell a single such as a high demand internet only sale it is free money to the company. you only get 400 addresses a month to sell too in that month there is no referral plan meaning if your customer has a friend down the street that isn't on your list they can get service from you but you don't get paid on it. So growing your business is not a option. also technicians have at first seem very lazy and some are but you find charter has strict rules for the techs so it ends up being a a lot of cancellations due to technicians. once you exhaust your blind 40 leads which some of which already have internet so that eliminates a chance at a triple play then you are suppose to restart on the same leads and if any old customers call you back after their long thought process then your again not getting paid. Charter is genius for making such a system because it shows you money that's possible sounding until you start and see the flaws in the system for the actual sales person. If you are use to this kind of job and making great money doing this job apply elsewhere. This will be a huge disappointment to you. Unless your a shady rep then go for it but the micro managing will
bad,Things Will Change. Great Benefits. Management in some departments not so great. Over all Morale has gotten low over the years. New comers would have to see for themselves.
bad,Upper Management created a toxic work environment with constant threats of termination if results were not exceeded.
bad,"Company paid well but you were required to work 24/7/365 and had to be better then prefect if you were not one of privileged workers, if not look out."
bad,"Worst experience in a very toxic environment, lack of direction from leadership and no room for advancement. The time I was there the upper management spent all their energy on selling the company."
bad,"After company was spun off from Time Warner there were too many corporate restructures, just about every two years, showing no real functional commitment to employees who were involved in operations. Lack of plan, direction and leadership from upper management, to the point of no valuable or substantial communication."
bad,"My time at Time Warner Cable was nice but it is time for me to explore better options, more comfortable environment and better compensation and benefits."
bad,"Assist Customers over the phone in a call center setting."
bad,"Great company to work for but customer care is a horrible horrible job. U will get the worst shift to begin with and have no life work balance. U will only get basic training but not with how the job really is. U are told to lie to customers and just give them credit for all you can while they scream and cuss at you for hours on end with back to back calls!  The pay is low for mental abuse u have to endure. It is a good company as far as benefits and bonuses...free lunch a lot, but u can not even go to the bathroom without it causing you to be penalized. If you can handle a very stressful job then go for it. It will take u six months to be able to get out of the call center if u do mot have a stroke in the mean time. I hated it!"
bad,"Product is not all that great, so the majority of calls are angry customers. You are required to sell products to angry customers. Dress code policy is more about seniority than the actual rule book. "
bad,You are expected to come to work and be silent regarding any challenges that may arise. Direct conflicts between the mission of each department resulting in poor customer service and even worse moral.
bad,After a long and disnguised career a separation from Time Warner Inc meant the death nail for those with experience and devotion to the company.
bad,"First let me tell you, I loved my job. I woke up every single morning happily getting to work early by as much as two hours and absolutely loved being there. I enjoyed my coworkers and loved learning the ins and outs of my job. Having said that please remember it's a competitive business. I made one small mishap and that turned into the worst mistake of my life.  They fired me immediately even after deeming it a simple mistake. Now I'm unemployed and spending christmas homeless. Thank you for absolutely destroying my life spectrum."
bad,"I felt forced out by the constant micromanaging and working there was making me physically ill and heightened my anxiety and depression. They do offer generous benefits, if you’re able to stay. Had 26 people in my training class. A year later, only 4 of us remained working there. Expect to be micromanaged and constantly harassed about call metrics you will have very little to no control over."
bad,"its everyman or woman for his or her self, you have to generate your own leads, and quota is king, and with the high price of cable advertising its a tough sell."
bad,The policies constantly changed which caused angry customers. very money hungry company. stressful to work there. Management didn't agree with changes either which caused everyone to struggle with wording things to customers because the company is just cheap.
bad,"Poor corporate leadership, in house mangers and supervisors have no authority. HR dictates everything, you walk on eggshells everyday. Rules and regulations constantly changing. The worst place I've worked."
bad,"The management is horrible at this company. The good ol' boy system plays in a big factor here and the only way you can get promoted is by sucking up to someone. If your current manager is not fond of you, then do not be alarmed if they reach out to the person that is looking to interview you for role and provide negative feedback. The raises are decent, expect 2.7-3% raise, no matter how hard you work. Work-Life balance is bad here and expect to always work on weekends. Even if you're hired for a  M-F 8-5 job like I was, I still was told I had to work on weekends. I think the worst part of this company is I went out on an approved leave of absence and they terminated my employment while I was out."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Terrible management..the   job its self was fun meeting new people but the dispatch routing and management communication was terrible .. my shift changed three times in the the year and half i was there
bad,"If you enjoy being screamed at on a daily basis then by all means, work for Spectrum; I personally couldn't deal with the stress and anxiety that came along with this position. The pay is fair, if you work overnights you're paid $1.50 extra on top of the $15.00 an hour - insurance benefits are all up to which package you decide to pick. In general, this job is just too stressful and really tests your character on how many insults you can handle every day."
bad,"You're treated like child, kinda like middle school."
bad,Closed call center because we are just numbers. Co-workers are excellent as well as supervisors and managers but the powers that be decided our outstanding performance did not warrant keeping us
bad,"I stated working at Spectrum right before a lot of changes. At first they were wonderfully helpful management wise but as the department changed, everything went out the window. They are unreasonable when it comes to time being missed for doctor excused absences and the policies are lacking at best. They need a lot of work to recover their exceptionalities in my eyes."
bad,If you want to work in a job that financially pays well but leaves you feeling like you may not have a job the next day or never saying “job well done”-just making a mountain out of a molehill or pointing out every flaw about you then this is the place for you! Make sure you only ask the very few NICE managers questions while on the call floor because they are the only ones that will reply with an answer and an explanation of it....not look at you like you are dumber than a box of rocks or give you some passive aggressive answer and walk away in mid sentence as if you are invisible to them.
bad,Left due to lack of knowledge by managers.  Everything is micromanaged.  Cant do your job properly for the time frames and  being afraid of getting written up for poor performance when most of the issues are caused by previous techs
bad,"Where do I start?"
bad,i worked for spectrum for 2 years after the buy out and only saw myself be treated as a number instead of an employee. they kept adding more tasked which increased stress but then removed all stress relieve from the job
bad,"I worked for Time Warner for many years before Charter bought them. They have unrealistic, impossible goals and most of the employees now walk around completely stressed and anxious.  It's sad that it has to be with way with them.  At times, we looked forward to work."
bad,"As far as my experience goes at corporate call centers this is the lowest on my list. From the first day that  I walk through the doors of spectrum there was a lack of competency, from the staffing the is not sure whether there is a meeting at five or not to the lack of managerial assistance resulting in one or two coaching sessions in a two month period. Though it is nice to not have to pay for the internet it is not worth the malestrom of stress and confusion that this company has sweeping through its halls."
bad,Benefits at the job is great. There's no written policies it's a play it by ear. If you get the job here just pray on a hard working supervisor who stays on task and pushes team numbers. Also who will find out the answers if situations occur. If not then it's a whole circus all the rules in the air not a job stability environment. The pay is ok if you have additional incomes at home. The work and social life balances itself out. Most calls are angry because equipment doesn't work or service. If you have great coworkers it's not hard.
bad,Enjoyable teams and excellent benefits.  The lack of management and in excess of six months to access necessary systems or front door badge made the jobs difficult to complete.
bad,"Lack of Leadership opportunities"
bad,"this company had bad hours, bad managers, some good ones, great training, great safety goals, I would not recommend this job to anybody due to hours and pay"
bad,"I have been on strike for almost a year. Spectrum refuses to pay us health insurance, pension, and 401k..Leaving 1800"
bad,"Charter went old school and required teams to relocate based on function. No one does this any more, thus they got stuck with people that could not find jobs locally (i.e. low quality)."
bad,Company needs a clear visions and needs to compensate employees betters.  Company needs to invest more into its product and really bring people who know what they are doing.
bad,"Constant issues between management and union makes for a stressful work environment. At present, the new ownership of the old Time Warner Cable (Spectrum) has decided to take away the union workers benefits and pension. They (Spectrum Corporate Management) refuse to bargain in good faith. The Union has been on strike since March 28th of 2017. It is no longer a career building workplace. Just a revolving door. I cannot describe anything hard about the job, because I loved what I done for a living. Before the strike, I enjoyed working alongside my Union co workers which would be the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,union busters. not a happy work place. management is always someone new. the are too busy trying to reinvent the wheel and micromanage. it is a depressing place at times
bad,Best part was the team and flexibility.  My manager allowed a lot of freedom and was open for new ideas and suggestions.  Ive learned a great deal from my manager.
bad,"Great benefits but like any call center the work is hard because cable services are a luxury item.  If you are an experienced sales person then this is not the position for you because they molly coddle you, play loud music and withhold your stats,"
bad,This job had its fun points in the beginning. After we had a lot of pressure put on us the stress began. It is poorly managed supervisors who worry about their own sales and no time to help you with locations and marketing advise.
bad,TWBC is in a transition phase at the moment. Most of the company is waiting to see what will happen with the Comcast merger before any major changes will happen.
bad,"Key Interview Questions:"
bad,"I was hired on in the Vancouver, WA facility as a billing representative.  The interview process was great, informed me of everything I needed to know about what kind of schedule I would be working."
bad,undecided. i really dont have anything good or bad to say about the company
bad,No support from management . The company could do more to care about employees. They cut our pay to pay for bonuses and they are not share with lower level employees.
bad,"Ok company, you get free cable that’s something, advancing takes a while depending how fast or can take classes and pass test  a minimum of four classes and exams"
bad,"The stress given from management  is the worst part. Working here has given me more anxiety than any other job. The management team wants you to be high on scorecard and performance is pushed really hard which is expected and fair, the downside is that it’s extremely difficult to be efficient and effective at the same time. If you slip up in either you get harassed by management."
bad,The job was stressful things change without notice no room for advancement desk shearing chained to the desk all day repetitive great benifits will burn you out quickly
bad,Will state that at first it was all great. Then within 2 monthly job turned sour quickly. They started 10 hour shifts in which I had to meet metrics within range to even be considered and I was only there for 2 weeks. Yet brand new hires got those shifts. Then the clean desk policy came into affect. I got written up for drawing a circle on a piece of paper. I was told we have to have all our focus on the customer. I was not on a call. Then came the fact on holidays people who worked tell 11pm could put in for 6 months in which includes Christmas so the early shift barely had any chance to apply for it. The final straw for me was when it was Christmas and seriously I got written up again for folding paper in which I didn't have a call for almost 6 hours. It was Christmas. This job is not for people with families either. The pay is great. The benefits are awesome and so is the free/reduced cable and internet packages. Other than that unless your good with being called every name under the sun and everything is your fault. You can't hang up on a customer who is completely obscene. I had to sit with a customer who keep screaming and swearing at me for a full hour. That was the end for me. I had complained about these policies and asked for them to be revised and reviewed several times. This company sees you as a number not a person.
bad,"There are a lot of painful policies to follow that will leave you and your co workers frustrated. Many people quit due to stress. If goals were aligned with other departments, things would improve."
bad,There’s only a few that should really be there very unprofessional and they only help or really care if you suck up to certain people there. For it being one of the only decent paying jobs they will still never keep people due to mangers
bad,I've worked for time Warner cable I got sick had to quite was told I could come back once I got well been getting interviews but not hired for a job never been in trouble and got top producer award and picture on the wall but still no interview. I don't understand why
bad,The management demands you do every job in one hour while also telling you to make sure your the last person to roll out to a job. You can have a job with 7 lines and they are all sun dried and water damaged. They will expect you to make that persons house perfect before you leave. A job like that could take 3-4 depending on the size of the house and then when you do everything perfect they will yell at you for being there more than 1 hour. even if you left it that way they would have complained that it wasn't done properly so its a lose-lose environment. the pay is great and the shifts are four days a week 10 hours a day
bad,it was a great place to work a couple years ago. now they only care about numbers. high turn over rate with most of the senior techs gone. mostly new guys working.
bad,"I worked for a fairly isolated team at Spectrum, but the responsibilities discussed in interview process varied wildly from reality. I assume this team eventually adjusted to hiring the talent level actually needed, as everyone I started with left within a year, but the team leader was originally hiring people who were completely overqualified despite the fact he didn't have any work ready for their skillset. My final interview was about R and SQL, then when I was brought in I was asked to design a team mascot using Microsoft's Paint tool. Excellent task for my brother, a graphic designer (though he doesn't use Paint), maybe not the best task to hire me to complete. Very strange experience."
bad,"Worst. Job. Ever. I suggest working anywhere else, even if you get paid a few dollars less per hour. The main focus for all departments is to get things done fast. No focus on quality. This means you’re always fixing other peoples mistakes. When you ask for help, you get belittled. The services are over priced and often don’t work well. Many shady, unethical practices."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,tried to push me out the door because of future military orders.. denied but it was their true intentions.. also all they care about is numbers...feel like a robot.
bad,Working here the managers weren’t about having the backs of their workers whether you be sick get reported by a angry customer etc. their main concern was income as long as they had a steady income customer complaints meant nothing as far as pricing they took agent reporting seriously even if it wasn’t an accurate complaint
bad,Money is great and hours are not so bad.  I'm glad I left when I did and have others that have followed do to ridiculous outlook that the company has.
bad,I have been with this company a few years and it has taught me a lot however it’s lots of MICRO MANAGEMENT they tell you what time you go to the bathroom and take your breaks they only hire managers and supervisors who have micro management experience and no technical or customer service experience they like to fire people around the holidays for being one minute late calls are always back to back it’s HORRIBLE if you need a job please apply they hire anyone but just have a plan b I get up every morning hating my job but all means if you have a family to feed or NO OTHER OPTIONS apply with a way out
bad,Only able to sell triple bundle to make commission. Must sell 10 triple bundles to make commission. Can only sell leads provided. What they dont state is several leads are duplicates or no-exsiting customer addresses or former customers. If you sell a self lead you won't be paid commision must a lead provided by the company. In addition the company will call numbers of your leads and sell them. So when you go there sell you look like a moron. Company doesn't even give you the courtesy of telling you a lead was sold over the phone. They dont just screw over the customers they screw over the employees as well.
bad,"dont have much to say about the company. managers made it a hostile environment to work in, but my peers were delightful. They definitely made it worth coming in, other than the need to work of course."
bad,"I loved my job - I was hired onto a volatile situation. My co=workers didn't want another Sales person and the  Manager didn't support me while there at all."
bad,"Of course this job comes with it's fair of upset customers calling you on the phone, but the worst part was the management constantly pushing you to lie to customers in an effort to sell them services. They have big posters in the office touting ""Integrity"" as a chief value, but constantly push you to lie to customers and if you don't, you can be fired. Eventually I left because I refused to do so."
bad,Everyone was laid off.  Our company had survived many buy outs and ownership changes but Spectrum was the first to shut us down.  Severance package not sufficientl
bad,"Just a sad company, with sad and poor CEO and management, greedy and unfair and abusive. need to follow Labor departments ......................................................................."
bad,"As a customer, Spectrum is amazing. As an employee it was stressful and miserable. I was pressured into meeting a handful of metrics that all contradicted each other and even though customer leave great reviews and surveys for the employees, if you didn't meet all the metrics you were yelled at, belittled, and fear tactics were used to keep you in line. On top of that, the favoritism was unbelievable and there was no way to move up unless you were willing to participate in unethical practices."
bad,"Not a positive work environment. Do not agree with their customer service mission, nor do I like the lack of support and lack of sense of urgency. Sales Process is convoluted."
bad,Management doesn't care about the abusive calls that the call center takes throughout the day.  We get told to be empathetic to people calling us every name in the book .
bad,this job is nope for every one not at all this is hands done the werst job iv ever had not because of the company but because the people that call in !
bad,Job paid very well had paid time off as well as sick time. How ever as soon as Spectrum took over it became more and more stressful to work there. I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,It was actually okay i worked there for years however i wasn't okay with the attendance policy some managers as well we even had a manager get arrested at the job place. smh
bad,"They expect you to do alot for just 12 an hour. You take abuse from customers because of raggedy equipment, u take alot of calls a day as well. The metrics are not hard to obtain but its alot of metrics that you have to meet. Im a counselor, motivational speaker, math teacher, etc., at this job. I guess its true, the less u get paid, the more you work. It is alot of miscommunication going on between the customers and agents. Most agents are not trained well. Its alot of on the job training and learn as you go. This job is stressful to me because my job is to help the customers but when the equipment is not working properly or the customers are getting ripped off, its hard to enjoy working for a company like this. Its just a job, im going to work it until i find something better and more lucrative. Pray for me that i do lol. Please pray."
bad,Horrible place to work. They don't care about their workers. Inconsistent information. The training doesn't not prepare you for being on the floor. Management sucks
bad,"You're compensated well if you can reach the highest commission ""bucket"". However, they often change the metrics on what is most important to prevent that from happening. I was encouraged to lie to customers to increase revenue for the company."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Was excellent until charter came and consistently changed things for the worse. It's as if they care less for how things affect the lives of the field technicians. From the day they took over they have put more and more on the technicians as well as changed rules to hinder us not to mention changed schedules and benifits that have all made the job much less desirable. Many techs are leaving and many more will follow this trend will continue unless upper management stops its insane policies. Since charter came ever two weeks at our tech meeting they literally changed at least one rule that negatively effected us at our job even our supervisors had a look of disgust on there face when they tried to force feed the information to us. Basically if you want to be a field tech and all you have is a high school diploma it's not a bad job but they will want you to work 12-9 but typically you will leave around 10:30-11 and work be home around 10-10:30 if you have a family I would doubt that is acceptable as it is not for me. Also climbing telephone polls and working with all the hazards alone at night in the dark in the rain with high winds is really awesome. Thanks charter your the best!!!
bad,"Management was also concerned about selling to customers who might couldn't afford the product"
bad,"The job was changing with the corporation take over.  The job in my opinion became more about getting the customer to stay in the highest price no matter the issues they were having.  They had to threaten to leave the company before we were allowed to help them. We only had 7 minutes to get them to either accept or close account. I didn't feel like it was customer service any longer just a name on my screen."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of taking anywhere between 40-60 calls a day if not more while trying to meet about 10-12 different metrics that contradict each other. At first glance the company seems like a dream come true but management treats the employees like they are worthless, unwanted and expendable so there is no motivation to do a good job on top of getting yelled at by customers for 8-10 hours a day because their services don't work. As an employee you get yelled at if you are on the phone too long, you get yelled at if you don't fix the customer's issue on the phone when they call in (but when being rushed off the phone you can't take the time needed to fix everything), management wants the call worded specifically but most customers don't understand the technical lingo they want you to use and get marked down and yelled at if you don't use the lingo, if the customers call back within 2 weeks with another issue or same issue then you get yelled at again but with Charter being #1 in outages because the CEO won't update the technology an average employee can never have a decent day."
bad,"Number driven company with a lot of integrity issues among co-works, with lack of supervisor and management support. More like a carrot before a work horse."
bad,The management presents themselves as people who care and people who will bend over backwards to help employees be successful; untruthful.
bad,I would rather not comment about the company.  I am just not destined to be on a phone leash and ask permission for the restroom.
bad,"The company is switching providers, And is working on different score cards for repersentives to meet and exceed. I work customers in a fast pase cernter, with sales , trouble shooting, billing , logging"
bad,You really don't want to work for spectrum some of.the people are ok and of the ones are backstabbing luring they will tell you one and do something else behind your back
bad,It was a horrible company to work for.. It did not care for its customers nors its employees.
bad,"horrible company, lots of favoritism, low wage for amount of work you do. Look for another job...........they fire people left and right..."
bad,"Policies changed weekly, stressful but the position itself was a wonderful position."
bad,"Management is not fair, favoritism is a huge thing. Management is quick to be in the drama. The respect that the management team has for the agents below them is non existing.  You are micro managed. The training is awful and you will be clueless when the training is complete."
bad,"The job is not difficult to grasp and decent training, but the customers calling are angry and difficult. Expect to be yelled at and cussed at. Expect to have to argue with people all day, professionally with a positive tone, sometimes for an hour at a time. You can’t hang up on them unless they threaten you."
bad,"Loved every aspect of my daily job requirements. Servicing customers cable and internet is some of the most rewarding work I've ever done. Especially with so many techs not interested in doing their job, you get appreciated deeply by your customers when you actually fix their issue. Was planing on making a long career out of Charter Communications and was excited to do so."
bad,Manager are not available or approahale. Supervisor never in there office. Poor training on new products or new equipment in the office Fellow employees very helpful
bad,I would not recommend working for spectrum to anyone. It was the most awful place to work. However they did have amazing benefits. you get free cable if you work for them.
bad,Services never work and they expect you to pick up their down falls you have to basically be insulted for things you can’t control and be expected to be ok
bad,"Bright House had a policy that was better, and when took over, it was just a matter of time before we were unemployed. It's very unfair and cut throat"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"As a professional I understand that there will be changes throughout the company, but with spectrum unprofessionalism and mistreatment to there employee feelings, I can’t really say charter was a very comfortable place to work."
bad,"Good pay, good benefits, good coworkers."
bad,as a direct sales rep you are a door to door salsesman and you are trying to sell something people do not want and if they do want it its not even guaranteed you can get it for them and if you do get it for them you cant guarantee it all be installed properly and then they get their bill and what you promised them is not what they get in the end
bad,"time Warner cable was a great company but after the merger with charter, the company became very stressful and not a good environment to work at and I do not recommend anybody work there."
bad,"High turnover rate for a reason, even if your free hours are available you can't take them unless you get it approved.also some managers do not support their employees"
bad,"I installed high speed internet, phone, and cable, I would run cable chord from outside the house at the the telephone pole to the back or side of the house or building. I would then run the line through the walls of the house to the desired location."
bad,The was a fun atmosphere... Really good commission pay...Horrible job security.
bad,Red tape and unrealistic expectations. Good benefits are how they keep people.
bad,I would literally work 60 sometimes 70 hours a week! My paychecks were over 100 hours; I was left in the location alone on multiple occasions where someone didn’t show up because the location was extremely understaffed with no support. The worst!
bad,"This is a horrible company to work for.  I worked for Time Warner Cable for years and Spectrum/Charter Communications bought the company out a few years and ago and everything has went downhill since then.  Spectrum does not treat any of their employees with respect, you are only a number.  I would never recommend working for this company."
bad,They literally dumped my position while I was on disability for a broken back and wouldn’t let me come back to work. Evil. Managers will be fine then once you get a new one they will constantly try to correct what your doing.
bad,This company is a sham and I wondered how charter communications stayed afloat with their poor products and their deceiving  claims and false advertising
bad,"The supervisor will throw you under the bus to save themselves. The routers will load you up will job and alot of the times, will double book you. The way they grade you is a complete joke"
bad,Best job I had as a field tech until the weekly changes and increased workload. Blanket management is making it harder for techs to do job with integrity and pride.
bad,"Spectrum is not the job for older individuals 40plus"
bad,Do you think company decent company to work for however there's too much favoritism nepotism and it's repetitive mundane boring you stay stuck in your seat saying the same thing all day everyday only to get yelled at cussed out and berated by customers and supervisors pretty much teach you how to lie to customers in a nice way
bad,"You're evaluated off performance, unrealistic metrics you must meet or you will get written up. Cant have to many call backs, have to keep calls under 300 seconds even though calls are complicated and your fixing other people mistakes, customers have to give you a good survey after call or youll get written up etc....Set breaks and if you use the restroom outside of your breaks you negatively impact your adherence and you will get written up. The managers get bonuses and if you dont meet your adherence you get in trouble. Slow systems and back to back calls for 9 hours no time between calls. The company takes on to many regions and the call volume is always code red customers are on hold for long duration and are already mad. Very stressful and high paced so if you like stress this place for you. People quit everyday very high overturn rate."
bad,The pay and benefits is great BUT THATS IT! Sales absolutely sucks they hit you with “ great commissions “ but barley. They immediately start off with you working the latest shift possible that’s why they can not keep anyone and they want you to work that shift for a very long time. Sales is only great in the morning. These customers HATE spectrum. Spectrum is their ONLY option that’s why they deal with them but if they had a choice or better option they’d go there in a heartbeat. So attempting to sell more only frustrates them because they already passionately hate it I know absolutely nobody that enjoys spectrum. Time Warner needs to come back spectrum is rock bottom and hands down horrible.
bad,"How could people continue to work for an organization that has not problem lying to their customers, forcing them to pay for services not provided if they want any kind of service. They know no one else offers same services, and they barely do so themselves so hands are tied. This company does not carry about what the homeowners say, do or think, as long as they can continue to monopolize the market they leave few , if any, options. There should be regulation, such as Consumer Affairs, Better Business Bureau, FCC, to step in and solve these problems."
bad,"The training program was great. Employees and management was great. Quality assessments sucked because you weren't hitting the right ""words"" when talking to customers. Events were awesome. Things started changing and they did not want to let you hang up on customers yelling and swearing at you, you were to get them to a senior agent that took 10+ minutes to get to you. After I left employees told me thing really started getting tense and harder to deal with."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Management is poor and HR does not care about employees. Expectations are ridiculous for the work you are expected to do and the compensation you receive
bad,"Absolutely miserable the construction dept. is a powder keg waiting for the right spark. Upper management has no clue on construction.  They have everyone covered up in Bs paperwork the contractor are doing what ever they want. Cable is to be buried at 36"" deep. We have found it at 1 1/2. On one project a dryer vent hose was used to provide a 90 degree turn for fiber going into a building. I would recommend staying away from Spectrum."
bad,"If you enjoy sitting at a desk with no windows all day, getting back to back calls of customers yelling at you over a luxury item--this is the job for you. The constant negativity surrounding me with these customers got to me and really made it hard to go to work. My hours were awful--unable to see my husband during the week. Only had 1 weekend day off. The benefits and pay are great--but no pay is worth my health declining due to stress. Some people thrive in these environments, especially those who just don't care what customers have to say, but unfortunately this work isn't cut out for me personally. The 6 weeks of training is really nice but sugar coats the way calls are which made the transition on to the floor very difficult. You're told from the beginning how much support you have with your peers and supervisors, but it definitely didn't feel that way. I was kind of told- 'hey figure it out.' Could just be an isolated incident, but the nonetheless affected my work."
bad,The only good thing about working for spectrum is the benefits. They start immediately once you are hired. Their is no room for growth in the company because you will always get beat out by an external applicate.  If you are not a brown noser do not expect to get anywhere.  You work around a lot of unmotivated people. Raises are based around who sucks up to mgmt. Calls are waiting from the moment you clock in to the moment you clock out.
bad,I hated this place! Super stressful. A zillion different systems to learn. No supervisors available to help when needed and didnt pay my shift differencial after fighting for 90 days to get it changed.
bad,Working at Spectrum is stressful. They constantly changing and it's for the worse. They give you time off and dont want you to use it. You dont have a life outside of work and I see why most employees are on FMLA or some type of leave. They dont care about not getting paid they need a mental break.
bad,"Don't even accept an offer they give you. It's not worth it with the horrible pay. I was promised full commission during my training and never got it. False promises. Managers at the store were horrible. Always micromanaging. Never did anything they just roamed the mall eating all day and left the store alone. They never orientated me on anything. The only thing they were good at was making you feel bad because everything you do is never good enough. Morning huddles were like morning military screams, consistent yelling about how poor of a job we all did not meeting goals. Spectrum mobile is all they want to sell now. IF you don't sell mobile, prepare for a sit down and possibly losing your job. Even higher end was out to get you. Stay away completely not worth the things you have to deal with."
bad,"Comapny claims they beta test TS tools before launching them , bereavement sucks so don't let anyone you care about to die , also gave my Dads Death Cert to a floor Employee , Management sucks and trainers don't like you if have knowledgeable exp"
bad,"Am sure some are okay with working in a modern day sweatshop while their CEOS/Corporates get $1.5+ million salaries; but this job was a nightmare. "
bad,The changes put in place once the company turned into spectrum made it almost impossible to get bonuses. They also expanded the work zones so much that it is at times impossible to make time frames.  Especially you have a job every hour and they tell the customers that I am going to be there for two hours..  My supervisor was great and I honestly do feel bad letting him down.  I think he understands though.
bad,"So I worked here for about 2 years, and I got let go for testing dirty, but I don’t smoke. I do this for anxiety reason at night to be able to sleep. I had been having back and neck pain at work. I went and told my supervisor. She took me to their dr and forced me to do a drug test. They fired me for that so they would not be responsible for the neck injury . The manager was a micromanager horrible"
bad,"N/a"
bad,"Spectrum isn't exactly the easiest job in the world. Answering the phones and being nice to people is a no-brainer, but you also have to be proficient with their software. If you struggle to learn somewhat complicated things, this may not be the best role for you. However, you go through thorough training, and most people are prepared for when they have to start doing their job. We had a training group of 12 people, and only one of them didn't make it to the end (but this is because he stopped showing up altogether in the second to final week, not because he failed the tests). "
bad,Management leaves a little to be desired  A manager there was complained about many times and HR did nothing to correct the situation  Free cable ti good   But other than that  it is not a good company
bad,"No comment, not sure what you would like for me to say but I don't have anything nice which is why I choose not to say anything at all. I'll let other people decide for themselves if they like Spectrum or not."
bad,The upper deck of management was very unprofessional and did not want to experience growth in the workers. Would find any excuse to not help and give you the necessary tools to succeed.
bad,"I worked for this company for 15 years, and over those years I saw the company become more money hungry and less concerned with their employees or their family lives.  To have techs in the field 7 days a week 365 days a year is GREEDY.  Back in the day there was an on-call tech on holidays to run on service calls if a person's service was out......not anymore....you can schedule a trouble call or an install any day, including Thanksgiving Day and Christmas day.  Also, having techs out in the field til 9pm 7 days a week even in the dead of winter, in the dark, no matter how cold it is, is just wrong."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,LOTS OF DRAMA. Also they tell you one thing at the interview and when you start working its totally different. The CEO works at the office but he can't even tell you about being fired not even your so called team lead. Even if your working as hard as you can they just tell you if you don't hit this your gone. My experience was horrible.
bad,"I give this 1 star because I have too select at least one. This place was awesome when it was Time Warner Cable. Spectrum (Charter) is completely different. You have to meet certain metrics that are unattainable in most cases. These metrics only cause your commission to go down while Charters bank roll goes up. Working in the sales department for time Warner, you would get sales related calls. When it became Charter, you got calls that were everything else related such as tech support, billing etc... And these calls count against you."
bad,"The job was stressful, nonstop calls and tools never worked properly during last year and a half and counting which made doing the job infinitely harder than it needed to be. Chairs were not comfortable. People literally were so stressed out that they would quit in droves or literally die on the floor, that was insane and sad. People also liked to microwave fish in the break rooms so the building smelled a lot. Company does not value anyone hired. Everyone was expendable."
bad,When I worked here it was Charter Communications. The employees were generally negative and the supervisors were always pushing metrics. Its a great job if you like being yelled at constantly by customers because their service is always in a blackout.
bad,ever since spectrum took over they have made several changes making our job more stressfull and difficult. the most recent change is a pay chang which resulted in a significant pay cut meking it far too difficult to make money.
bad,Should not be forced to write review that is personal and aggressive. This experience has a been a first and a last of a call center environment. I have never been with a company so long that was super unorganized and stressful.
bad,The worst company I have worked for.  You could not get assistance when needed. Still had to sell their products when customers calling in irate about products that are not working
bad,"Time Warner Cable was good to its employees. Charter came in and everything began to change for the worse including pay and benefits. Atmosphere went from a fun sales environment to a place where no one wanted to show up. Upper management had a ""just get it done"" type of attitude towards supervisors and agents. After years of dedication and loyalty Charter executives literally showed up and closed shop and laid off 200+ employees."
bad,One of the best companies I have ever worked.  Great people to work with.  I also love the technology that we implemented.  Very successful company and still is.
bad,Major issues with Union and company ruined a perfectly good job. It's impossible to not be caught in the middle. No one has your best interest at heart.
bad,This company is okay if you are looking for a temporary job but I wouldn't plan on staying there for very long. It's stressful to deal with people who will curse and scream at you for 40 min when you are on the phone with them. I personally think this job is good for people who can take that kind of verbal abuse from customers but if you can't this job is not for you.
bad,"Very difficult environment to work in.  Priorities constantly changing, management is in micro manage mode.  Was much better when was Time Warner Cable."
bad,Most individuals are not interested in direct sales and do not want to be bothered and use the online and phone services to transfer and/or obtain services.
bad,I was taking inbound calls from upset customers that were getting screwed over and I knew it. Its hard for me morally to work for a company like that. I understood their frustration. It wasnt the job for me.
bad,Reimbursements were never on time or filed correctly. Entire payroll was mishandled company wide due to merger. Constant job related expenses with delayed reimbursements.
bad,"I loved working for a large corporation but when it came down to it you are just an employee ID to charter. They care about the bottom line only and the amount of people they have put out of work since their ""merger"" with Time Warner is ridiculous."
bad,"process return check items, process uapplied ach, run reports, research missing payments, process credit card refunds  and monitor the escalation email box"
bad,The day is very bad you spend time either getting yelled at or being told you don't make the quote. Not the best place if you are looking to grow. Arent so helpful
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I would not recommend Charter Communications on any level.  Terrible culture, terrible leadership.  The  senior leadership team micro manages every decision.  There is no empowerment on any level."
bad,The most stressful job I have ever had. The expectations can be unmanageable depending on the customer you get over the phone. Most calling in are extremely upset and cursing.
bad,"Give us your opinion about a typical day at work, what you learned, management, your co-works.  The hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,really enjoyed my time with the company .don't mind working  for them again . I love the customers and I love working for people
bad,A typical work day at charter was a fast pace taking over 30 calls a day. My Co-worker were friendly an my supersvisor was very helpful the hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers and the most enjoyable park was the money.
bad,District manager micro managed. products offered were not up to par and employees were treated poorly. Company basically self competed itself out of relevance.
bad,The internet service is one of the best.  It was and probably still is the cash cow for Time Warner.  I assume the competition in cable television is still fierce and hope this next merger bodes well.
bad,not the best work experience. very unorganized. the doctor is not very friendly. advancement does not work go based off of your work place ethic. very click-ish atmosphere.
bad,"Sales and lots of them to get ahead; goal oriented; quotas set on a daily basis; good, clean working environment; good tutoring from management"
bad,"Time warner is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. Management is terrible. Most of them have hardly any experience with the job at hand, The company has a hard time following their own policies, and having a hard time compensating their employees correctly."
bad,Great benefits and team members are great. Pay is terrible and customers treat employees horribly. Co workers are most enjoyable part of job.
bad,worked 10-12 hour shifts up to 6 nights a week. They were not concerned for their employees.I was managing about 30 technicians and doing administration work as well
bad,"Long Hours, no positive initiatives"
bad,My day at works stars by checking my bucket truck then log into my work and then go off to fix problems within the cable plant
bad,"It was a retail position.,... Standard retail job...theres nothing more to tell...Different hours, different days off...customer service position"
bad,"If you are single then its a great place. If you have a family, well then you might as well not even apply. They have a high turnover rate, and in my opinion they do not pay enough for what the expect out of their employees. The only good thing is that the manager did seem to at least try to make things a little more fair for everyone. But at the same time it was one of the worst places I have ever worked."
bad,"Learned to work in call center answering phones, management puts a lot of stress on employees."
bad,"Time Warner Cable is a great technology company, working there was very challenging and satisfying.  If you enjoy working in a every-changing environment this is the place for you! "
bad,"The only people at the call center who got promoted are kissers. I am glad I left the co. after getting my proper certification to get out of there.  They rather hire their friends from the past or co worker buddys from the past when it comes to a promotion. Got something better if you do not move up....it is better to work there until you find something better. I would leave this call center job anyday for a McDonalds job cleaning up every dirty bathroom in any city.  We have to act like we care about customers by saying things like ""I hear a baby crying"" or stupid things like ""oh I hear you are driving"" or we will get a bad garded call and we have to do sales as well....Part of the ""hello friend"" culture I guess.  There are supervisors always looking at what you are doing and will find ways to get you fired as well.  Get your certs. and go to school while working and quit when you can... The.""Hello Friend"" culture is a way to get people fired in Maitland because who will try to start up a friendly conversation to an upset customer who is calling about hidden fees and cable service that does work???"
bad,This a a very bad place to work. They will smile in your face but as soon as they get behind your back they will be plotting against you on how to get rid of you
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"You go in at your sched time, sign on and work. I learned tech repairs. Management was not very good. Hardest part of my job was dealing with all the change is requirements and them not showing you how to do things."
bad,"Low pay, extremely long and hard days. Management hovers over your every move."
bad,"Other than a big shot coming in and laying everyone off that had been there less than 2 years, it was great! I loved helping the customers and the work itself."
bad,"How bad do you need the money? Pay/benefits are great, but the job sucks. You get to deal with upset customers, and then answer 15 emails about every aspect of your day. Micromanagement is getting out of hand. Higher ups have no idea how to do cable, they just know what their paper work tells them. Could be a great job if they just let you do your work"
bad,The call center was great when I got there. Call volume was ok somedays and others back to back.I learned the billing system in about a month. The best part of the job is getting to help the customers.
bad,You will not have a work life balance. Your schedule will change ever 6 months based on what ever metrics they choose. You just have to decide if the money is worth it.
bad,This job was very difficult. You are penalized for every account you cannot save. Even if a customer is cancelling due to a death in the family. It seemed at times as though the system was set up against you.
bad,"Training can be quite stressful if you aren’t 100% versed in Networking. I would recommend anyone who was just hired on to just go home and refresh on general Networking basics on YouTube. "
bad,"A typical day of work consists of monitoring and troubleshooting the automation system for various news channels from New York State to the Midwest states. You are responsible for making sure that live-to-tape and live programming are executed properly, checking routes and making sure that commercial breaks are carried out properly. I learned how to use broadcast automation software, switchers, telex and other equipment in Master Control. My supervisor was excellent, but I felt like he was overworked having to work a day shift, and handle sick calls and other technical emergencies during overnight hours. I feel like HR doesn't care about it's employees ever since the TWC merger into Charter. Charter doesn't want to keep employees who ask for help. Workplace culture is very toxic. Most people in Master Control aren't nice people. They constantly make fun of employees who they don't like and make it impossible for certain employees until they had enough and quit. Many people in Master Control don't take the job seriously and thus many people get fired for many serious things like screwing up routes and signing off on commercial breaks that didn't make it to air. The worst part about the job is that if somebody screws up when you're also there, you can get anything from probation to termination. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my supervisor, who helped me through many of the struggles I had with in MC."
bad,Constantly threatened us with closing the center over stats our center always made 1-3 place the closed our center anyways due to a “business decision”
bad,at charter i drove a 350 van and also had to maintain a ladder with a tool bag the ladder was used to climb cable lines to disconnect and reconnect cable lines
bad,"I was only at this place for a month and I quit and I did not have another job lined up. That is how bad this was. We were supposed to have three to four weeks of training. We ended up getting five days. My role was to do billing. But I was cross trained for sales and customer service in only 5 days but was only paid for doing a billing job. Do not let those free services fool you. They are not worth it. Everything here is very inconsistent and unorganized. They pretty much threw us on the floor for the wolves because they had business needs since their turnover rate is so high. No one in my class felt comfortable or knew how to work these old systems. The only way to get assistance is through a chat and you have to fill out a tedious template to ask a question. There are only four people able to help you and there are a total of 59 people in the chat. So obviously it can take them a very long time to get to you for assistance. On top of that I have never in my life heard representative speak to these business owners in such a way. They are very  rude  and impatient . Spectrum is more concerned about their stats so they basically Rush people off the phone without helping them. Their stats are very unrealistic. The calls are back-to-back and you only have seven minutes per call. You get dinged if it's longer than 7 minutes, if the customer chooses to call back within a week, if you transfer a call, or if you put them on hold. The supervisors will refuse to take the calls. I absolutely hated this position. I started on April 20th and I quit on May 24th. My training class started"
bad,"Spectrum treats their field techs poorly with no regard for work life balance. You are constantly over booked, not given the time to do quality work. Field techs get the blame and are score carded for the short comings of routing and customer service. My local office supervisors do everything they can to help the field techs but Spectrum has tied their hands so much that their isn't much they can do anymore. Time Warner Cable was a great place to work before Charter bought them and changed the brand to Spectrum, they have killed all the joy that techs had in doing the work that they do."
bad,New management doesn’t understand the needs of New York. Before Charter took over the company was more responsive to the employees and their customers.
bad,"Since the merger of time warner and spectrum the company I once loved to work for quickly became the nightmare job you hated getting out of bed for. The benefits went from great to ehh not bad, and what I didn't understand is how could health insurance go down hill like that when the #3 and #2 companies merge together like that. "
bad,"company is on strike and im looking for work smh. great benefits while it lasted. managers have no idea how cable works but dictate to you, how to do your job"
bad,"As an inbound sales rep, your position is indispensable, however if you must be gone from work for a personal reason (ex: personal leave)-don't expect to have a secure position upon your return."
bad,the best experience from this job is that I learn how to have more compassion for mentally challenge adults and there needs. great asset to learn.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"People were great to work with, everyone was willing to help lend a helping hand. Had meetings about new products/services and any procedure/policy changes and the tools we used."
bad,Time Warner is a good company to work for with great benefits.
bad,"Training was very inconsistent.  Everything was computer based but there was not a lot of hands on learning.  Trainer constantly left the class for a smoke break, which equaled to about 7-8 per day if you were not a smoker you stayed and make notes for reference.  Once you are in nesting you have floor support which was great but once are out of training you feel like you are left to wolves and basically left to fend for yourself as support was minimal. "
bad,Its not a bad place to work but for working local you can work from 7 am untill they say you are ok to go home could be midnight could be 7pm no assistance no managment unless you mess up than managment will finally step up just to chew you out long hours no benifits for being out late lack of communication somtimes no communication
bad,I’ll give them credit they do pay fairly well. But as far as co workers go I have never in my life encountered a bigger group of mooches. And the customers take cable TV WAY too seriously.
bad,Spectrum is pushing customers to do self install kits even if the home has not had service before. Then they will make a trouble call for a tech to come out  install the equipment and shorting the tech on the pay since we cannot bill a Trouble call as a full install. we are losing about $25-75 on a job because of this and it obvious they are doing this intentionally and they will not compensate the amount that should be owed and paid. This started about 3 weeks ago and they should be sued for lost wages and shady business practices.
bad,Spectrum is a ad company to work for they do not hold value in the workers. they are not very good at relaying information that they are wanting done and hold the employee accountable for things that are out of there control.
bad,"It seems like a fair, happy, clean place to be off first glance. When I started this job I was plainly lied to.Not only lied to about FMLA and how to apply for it but I was written up multiple times while extremely ill (they DO NOT accept doctors notes!!!!) I’d you have a disability or a child with disability be prepared to have your job on the line! They may seem like an inclusive workplace but that’s only until you actually have an issue. Zero support from staff. Everyone is very two faced and they will always protect their job before yours. This job is not worth 16 an hour. You can make that in retail for less stress. This entire job is a big no thank you."
bad,Charter had to show a profit to investors and did so on the backs of it's employees.  The culture shift was swift and unforgiving.  It often felt like someone always had their foot on a VP's throat and this practiced rolled on down the line to the front line.
bad,"Just my opinion. My experience with the Raleigh office wasn’t the best. After attempting to meet the sales quota, they limited our ability to sale by saying that we can only sale in certain territories. As if we’re not already competing with Netflix, Hulu and Sling."
bad,The management of the IT teams is so bad that there have been MASS exodus' from the org.  there is a culture of clicquish behaviour and an inability for upper management to reign in those responsible because of the loss of personnel.  There has also been abuse of the H1B employees and outright lying to them to get them in the seats for positions they were NOT applying for.
bad,"spectrum offers employment opportunities to diverse cultures various shifts, educational opportunities and consistent product knowledge in changes and updates in products and services."
bad,this place will make you miserable. being made to sit in a chair for 8-10 hours a day while customers are yelling at you about either their bill or the faulty equipment they had been provided by Spectrum.  The pay isn't worth the aggravation you have to go through on a daily basis.
bad,"unless you really good at meeting deadline sales, this probably wouldnt be the job for you ."
bad,"You can and should find better.  Typical day involves getting yelled at by customers for not being able to lower their bill when it's not possible.  Also, call are never transferred to the correct department or transferred back into billing when the customer's problem is not billing related.  The online resources used to help customers are not organized in a way that makes it easy to find the info quickly."
bad,"The job is okay, You get bored of it easily. They way over pay you for what you do. The customers can get stressful, but if you can let that stuff go then you'll be fine."
bad,"Poor morale. Management is way too restrictive and not understanding. Here, you are treated like a number rather than a person. They do not take the time to properly train."
bad,this company has poor communication starting with upper management and down. I would not recommend this company. The commission is not good the benefits are not good.
bad,"They tell you that you can make your own hours but, really tell you to come to work. you walk all day and all night knocking at doors begging people to get cable."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Just like cust feel like twc does not care about them, they do not care about employees either. I see why everyone hates twc. Managers don't have your back!"
bad,TWC no longer cares to pay sales properly for referral business and constantly changes the rules. There is no even playing field.
bad,Bureaucratic management.  Management was hypocritical in the message they delivered and the actions they expected from the staff
bad,"learn how to install cable tv,internet and also phone, they were very good on the saftey part of the job and company van to take home every night"
bad,All they are worried about is making sales. They do not care about their employees. Customer issues are never resolved in a timely manner.
bad,I dont have to much to say about this job no one wants to aruge with customers all day every day about a bill. this job gets old very quickly and answering the phone back to back is nerve wrecking
bad,"Over 300 emails a day, multiple people wanting you in meetings everyday.  Hostile environment of mostly people that are fight to make the big impression to new management, (truly dog eat dog)."
bad,The goals and expectations the employer puts on the employee are unattainable.  The work schedules are difficult.
bad,"No job security, management is horrible, HR department doesn't know basic policies, you are chained to your chain don't take longer than two minutes to go to the bathroom or they will come looking for you, always an issue with the services"
bad,"Charter Communications is perhaps the worst company I've ever worked for.  In the Irwindale California facility, there was a total disregard for worker safety.  Mandatory overtime: employees were forced to work six days straight, or 12 hour days.  Management was very incompetent and predatory, their incompetence led to long hours and confusion."
bad,It is a good transitional job but not a career as the majority of locations are franchised owned.
bad,"Is a call center so is expected to take calls all day, you learn a deal however the tools provided were hard to work and assist clients.  We learned to be repetitive for any answer to any problem.  Co-workers was in most part the source of knowledge and we help each other’s immensely.  The ambiance was full of stress and managers never did much to help us to be happy during the hard times.  "
bad,I was a temp. I an not a technical person and was not really happy there. The customers get really angry when there cable does not work
bad,"Management gives you monthly goals for sales.  If you don’t make it you don’t get a commission check that month.  Seems normal, but they make the goals unattainable.  They stretch out the goals to get as many customers as they can while paying you as little as they can.  Everyone is “cutting the cord” and moving to streaming tv service.  However this company doesn’t recognize that and they still raise the goals 5-10% every year."
bad,"If you aren't friends with managers, you're not going anywhere. Management is a complete joke. Where do they find them, and I was taking calls from irate customers, with a bachelor degree. I did not last long. Everyone was miserable who worked there. One coworker left her badge on her desk and walked out. Customers were horrible."
bad,To some degree this company is all about share holder and not the employees. Feel as though you are just a number and not a valued employee. Very little teaming and lots of individual goals.
bad,A decent place to work. Opportunity to work on cutting edge technology projects is limited. More contracting positions than full time positions with relatively few conversions to FTE-especially in the Project Management area.
bad,The training is pretty poor. They teach you to “talk with a smile” for 4 weeks as if you’ve never worked customer service in your life then throw you on the floor with absolutely no knowledge on how the system works.
bad,Management is never consistently available I’ve had 2 full time managers and 3 intern managers in my time with the company. Always short staffed with high volume store. Coworkers don’t like to work they take longer breaks then given. Some at worksite have worked from 2-20 years and have not been promoted so shows you how much opportunities there is for growth. You have to have tough skin people who come to the store are never usually happy and most of the time leave unhappy. My advice don’t trust anyone.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Management will promise safety and promotions all the time yet little to no support in field and you still get nagged for never doing enough. Some supervisors were understanding, but overall it's very double face from corporate and management. Don't trust HR saw lots of new guys lose jobs for speaking up."
bad,"The company was is going through changes with all the mergers. It’s a big company now and sadly they have such poor communication between all the various departments and management it’s unbelievable. The company is really only focused on numbers and answering to the stock holders. Unrealistic numbers and expectations to say the least. Employees would work the system to just get sales even though I was instructed not to do so and it was then looked the other way.  I had management come through stores that had no clue on what it was really like to work as a store associate. One minute things would be one way then the next it would be different. Poor management to say the least! I could go on and on. "
bad,"Very bad area. They expect more from you and do care less. They want you to sell up to eight (8) video sales in other to make commission. Not for everyone. Even if you sale,the Tech will go and screw your sale up making you to get nothing."
bad,"At 1st You would work in nearby cities and after they started making You work 50-70 miles farther out. Management were a joke! 1st supervisor would critique the new guys and make them the butt of their jokes a lot. 2nd one came from New york and was always putting California down and You had better like His choices for the president,etc. It was hard enough to make and keep your sales with all kinds of sharks working against        Then Charter/Spectrum  started letting their installers take the Direct sales jobs and make it harder for the rest of Us to make Our numbers(Since They had their friends still in Installs getting their jobs done 1st! When I was a Contractor the Sales part was a lot easier to do! The New Spectrum is hard working Sales rep unfriendly!"
bad,"Such a waste of time. You put in hard work and get nowhere unless you get into the right cliche. If you are looking for a place to go to work, do your job, get crapped on daily, have unrealistic expectations put upon you then this is the place for you. It felt like they purposely set you up for failure so you won't get a raise or able to change jobs. They give you sick days and punish you for using them. "
bad,There are so many intangibles with this job. You have to hit a certain quota in order to get paid commission and you are micromanaged to the teeth. Would not recommend.
bad,"There is very little effort to make employees feel fulfillment, and little attention is paid to morale or employee satisfaction.  A start date was given, and so once I gave notice to resign to previous employer I was left without income for 3 weeks as they missed the start date."
bad,Terrible management and ever changing rules. At one point they had us all working 7 days a week. The manager had never even done an outside sales job in his life. The message was basically keep working harder and harder and expectations were never attainable. Awful culture.
bad,"It's a call center and pay is not good. The usual. It was tech support and I didn't care for it. My supervisor was cool, I guess. But not very professional. No advancement opportunity. Training was a joke."
bad,"The benefits are not beneficial.  I haven't been able to take a vacation day in well over a year.  The only way to get time off is to call in sick.  Of course, too many of those will get you fired.  The pay is low, too low for what you do.  The job ad says video repair but you can pretty much plan on dealing with billing problems.  Your new title will change every 4-6 months.  The environment is competitive in a very unhealthy way.  This office against that office, one employee against the other.  Plan on being micro managed.  About the only good thing is free service.  The only other saving grace is your peers.  It is kind of a ""survivors"" situation.  Like people in a lifeboat."
bad,"Charter communications (Spectrum) is a fast paced, often non-stop, working environment.  They continuously try to move you from the hours you select to the hours they want.  They are, or were, heavily micro-managed.  They are a call center (unless you work in a dispatch or smaller satellite office), and so are large open rooms with rows of computers."
bad,"The workplace is a pretty relaxed environment, although it is very disorganized and unprofessional. The management was extremely poor as well as the moral. The best part about my position was assisting customers w/ technica issues and leaving them satisfied. The hardest part was trying to explain bills to customers that never made any sense, hard to read, and that is obviously incorrect and still have to say that it's correct."
bad,"Terrible management. They don't care for your work progression just there turn-over rates. Meaning you get replaced they get paid. If you don't mind being treated fairly or don't mind working around favoritism then this may be the job for you. Don't take my word for it. Fine. Do your research, look into the recent news. They clearly have/had a recent strike. Besides do the math they don't constantly hire and have a union for the fun of it....POOR MANAGEMENT especially northern Manhattan."
bad,"there was a time when your hard work paid off at this company, but since 2010 its been downhill. tech tracking, unattainable metrics, and constant micro management have made this job more of an aggravation than anything. trying to advance is now like pulling teeth, they will find anyway to keep you from receiving the books you need to advance. the metrics are constantly shifting, so having good metrics consistently is impossible, people have been fired for not taking pictures for the tech tracker even though they could just use the picture from your id."
bad,"Commission decreased a lot, if you don't hit at least 75% of quota which is set extremely high to begin with, you do not get paid out commission at all period."
bad,Great place but misleading environment.   High turnover due to confusing company service areas that you can't support.
bad,Management is terrible. Rules are placed as they come up in their minds. Never been so stressed in a work place. This place is forever a revolving door.
bad,"Horrible management when it came to employees.  I feel that the structure was fine, but the enforcement, or enabling of the structure to be used was bad."
bad,"Outside all the time in all types of weather."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Just like their customer service, the employees were treated equally as bad as the customers. Being a publicly owned company, employees were just another number on the balance sheet for shareholders"
bad,"Brighthouse has gone through multiple management changes and have changed since I started working there. Agents are cogs in a corporate wheel. I have learned that if you are satisfied with a dead end job that will not lead to anything, you will be happy here."
bad,Any ans every chance the cmpany has to screw over the employee it does.
bad,This is a great job for college or high school kids but adults its not for you if you have a family car note's etc.. this is not for you there are to many changes on a everyday process and objections are put in your way daily to make sure you dont hit goals and make money on commission
bad,If you don't want to advance this is the company for you otherwise move on.
bad,"They tell you sales aren't important and that its a technical help. But your constantly reprimanded for like of sales numbers. They are looking for sheep. Not strong workers. Constantly say theyve never fired someone for lack of sales, while this may be true. They will find another way to move you. Advancement opportunities are at a minimum. Time systems are archaic and brutish at best. A plus is the free cable and 1 hour lunch. But hardly outweighs the moral declined received by working there."
bad,"After 10 years experience, bankruptcy and all manner of service issues. My advise would be to Run."
bad,"Not very impressed with this company. Management didn't really care about employees, just about numbers. Daily work was always routine, nothing really exciting, no incentives."
bad,"The job was a place you wanted to work for then new upper Management started to care only about employee's making more sales then dealing with customer issue's. This made all the employee's worried about keeping their job's,which made it very stressful. The people I worked with started to stabe each other in the back to steel a sale, which hurt productivity for all. No time for family life. The most enjoyable part was dealing with everyday people like me and making them happy."
bad,The Company is a great Company but the Environment at the Hollywood Call Center was the Worst Work Environment Ive ever worked in everyone is more concerned with everyone ele other then with the job theres is a lot of drama no matter how you try to avoid it its there and the pay is horrible for all that you have to put up with
bad,Don’t get me wrong you can make a good amount of money here...with that being said you will need to work way more than the allotted hours they tell you. The morality of the company is also suspect they don’t exactly tell you to lie to people but they do tell you to withhold certain info in order to complete a sale. Overall I can’t wait to leave the company..the base pay is terrible and it almost had the feel of a pyramid scheme...the longer I’m there the more I see I don’t like.
bad,This company is  Embezzling money from the workers also lieing on workers to forceful get them terminated. Also management was not knowledgeable about our system and was no help at all. Getting overly worked and nothing to show for it. Plus being racist towards black workers and allowing customers to put their hands on employees and not doing anything about it. Last but not least forcing workers to quit because of overwhelming demand but no support.
bad,Job responsibilities changed dramatically over the short time I was with company and pay to work ratio very much out of line. Bad training. Bad moral and high turnover
bad,"Not a fun place to work treat you with too much supervision. Breaks and lunches done on their terms. They tell you at the last moment about the change. The training was fun but, the floor was not what they met it to be."
bad,"The call center leadership has embraced a deteriorating, toxic culture."
bad,"The job itself is very straight forward, customer service and technical support. The team leads were very helpful. The only real struggle was trying to change your schedule. There was no real shift bid process. Only once people left or changed positions did their schedule become available to bid on. It was very rare that the scheduled time and days off you wanted became available and even rarer to get it. You will not even know the shift you will have until after training which is very inconvenient. I was not given the job offer until days before the start day, allowing no time to put in a two week notice at any current job. Very unprofessional staffing crew did not care that I would not have enough time to let my current employer know I would be leaving. She said a 3 day notice is better than nothing. There is a team lead that can be a bully, so beware. Reporting him gets nowhere. Very corporate environment did not feel very welcoming as they are only focused on numbers. They will pull your calls in team meetings to use as examples. The type of calls you will be taking can be very stressful and you are expected to not take any time between calls for anything. As far as call centers go it's not the worst by far, but they still have a lot to improve before they can retain good employees and prevent high turnover."
bad,the job is ok just a bunch of metrics that dont tell the true story of a tech many techs manipulate the systems and get rewarded while techs that do there job get all the work written up and fired because of flawed metrics and poor management
bad,Bad management little work life balance. Company keeps inventing new ways to decrease pay by changing commission structure and increasing goals to unattainable heights
bad,I would never go back to or refer anyone to work for this company. The management amd owners are extremely disrespectful and selfish people. The work and hours were very conflicting with family.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,One of those jobs you get when you're desperate. Expect to be overworked and underpaid. It's an uphill battle fighting the public's perception of a major cable company .
bad,As the company grew they cared less and less not just about employees but customers. No one cares if customers are lied to in order to make sales - it’s actually encouraged. There is no work/life balance. The benefits are great but free internet is not worth the constant stress from managers that don’t know what they are doing. You are told you will be making six figures but you will be lucky to get a commission check at all with how poorly run the sales department is.
bad,"I loved this company and the job when I started.  2017 it all went down hill.  You are a worker bee, that's it.  Corporate doesn't care about you. irregular shifts, multiple responsibilities per service call with unrealistic time limits, and metrics that are total guess work(tier 5, the best, one month and tier 1, the worst, the next.  No change in work ethic, drive, or quality).  You are responsible for taking online classes on your own time to get any raises.  Each promotion takes 3-5 classes that take weeks or months to complete each class. You do get heavily discounted services and a vehicle to drive home.  But, that is the extent of the pros of this job."
bad,Severely underpaid with unprofessionals for managers! Not a good place to work. They lie about the frequency with which they will give pay increases and the have cut the Christmas bonuses out
bad,"Before Time Warner Cable became Spectrum, pay and benefits were great. There were monthly prizes and bonuses, and the commission was phenomenal. After the merger, all of these things dwindled. Upper management thrived while virtually ignoring the average worker. I loved my team, and while the stress brought us closer together, watching your pay go down while the demands of the company went up year after year was enough to convince me to leave."
bad,"This company COULD be fantastic,  yet they underdevelop their people,  creating a revolving door of employees and management. This commission structure is ever changing and it's a lot of pressure from higher ups. Instead of actually training they'd rather hire a new crop of people."
bad,"All management cares about is sells. Management is paid based on commission. Management will overlook and turn a blind eye to  unethical methods so reps can get commission, because if the rep makes a sale all managers get a piece of the pie. The equipment is refurbished and they constantly pressure employees to convince customers they need cable and home phone service on every customer contact. Very stressful. High turnover. People get the job but few stay. I watched in horror as long time employees were forced out because they couldn't meet the unattainable goals. Moral sucks. Nobody is here because they love it. There is no growth opportunities and you can hardly find an employee that will tell you they love it here. No one is here because they love the job. It pays the bills. Stressful and no appreciation."
bad,"No support from management. Fast-paced employee is always wrong, workplace culture is poor everyone is always looking for a better job to get out of there."
bad,It’s more like working a production line. Get the customer off the phone ASAP. Training is absolutely useless. They expect you to know everything within the 4 weeks of training. If you like being yelled at on a daily basis and are not worried about the 8 min time restrictions to fix a problem. Then this is the place for you. Just remember it’s not about helping co summers it’s about your metrics
bad,Spectrum fails to hire true leadership. Current leadership makes irrational decisions that do not align with the companies mission further more they care more about their money then they do about the employees or the customers.
bad,Inbound sales was a pretty lucrative department. Management had poor leadership and communication skills. The culture was driven in fear instead of motivation and encouragement.
bad,"Immediate supervisor was horrible. Lazy, yet demanding, not willing to help but also condescending. He never helped out, but wanted things done his way, even though we all knew a quicker better way to do our jobs. He was also an extreme bully."
bad,"Started as Time Warner cable, extremely high (up to six figures) and very enjoyable atmosphere.  Once taken over by charter spectrum, advancement from within became almost impossible, commissions decreased significantly, and work environment became more about taking calls transferred from other departments and many non sales related rather and lost focus on sales."
bad,First of all when you get hired they make it seem like this job is fun since you have your own schedule technically and that the pay is amazing. What they don't tell you is after you've been here for 2 months your base salary goes way down. I was making $800 without commission to $500 if even that. They never tell you that it's just a hiring bonus. Management sucks cause they think just cause their a supervisor that they know way more than you do.
bad,"Worst place I EVER worked! Equipment is old. Software is basically shareware. Management would rather find a reason to enforce discipline than take the opportunity to teach. There is no concrete or definitive answer to anything. Speeds are throttled down, work stations are shared-filthy, applications are rolled out at 70% functionality, customer equipment is usually refurbished and everything we said to customer was usually a lie.High turnover. It may have a new name but it's still Insight Cable quality."
bad,"a typical day = stressful"
bad,"Culuture was not up to par, and management was not well together or on same page about many things. Not very many opportunities for Advancement were available."
bad,"Most of the time I could not get an answer from management or HR or they gave me incorrect information. Their training is too short, systems too confusing."
bad,"They call you for interview, they are the nicest people around, then when they decide to not move forward with you they simply don't call, they update their website and good luck to you. Honestly for a company this big a little more professionalism is expected but if as a potential employee I'm treated like this I honestly have no interest working for them, Truly disrespecful and extremely dissapointing."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Spectrum went downhill since the merger. Does not treat employees well at least in the sales division. It was a good company to work for when it was TWC.
bad,Very hard to balance family and work. Lack of support from upper management because they are busy dealing with what is mandated from their superiors. Lack of support
bad,"When it was Time Warner Cable it was great, I never had any complaints we all were making a decent commission we had fun, It all changed once Charter took over they cut the commission and raised the quotas to impossible to reach so they didn't have to pay commission."
bad,"Not much to say about Spectrum. We had high hopes in the beginning, but we are not sure now. Leadership seems to be confused on our direction so it makes it hard to be motivated."
bad,Work in heat or rain.  Run cable through attics with temperature up to 130 degrees.  Run cable under houses with dirt and dead rats and animals.  Hard strain on your body. Pushed to work fast with no errors.
bad,Horrible work life balance.  Poor management with little to no support.  High management turnover.  Company sees no value in veteran employees.  Had 2 forced relocations in 3 years.
bad,Wasn’t very fond of the job after about 3 months of being employed with spectrum I realized that it was not the job that I thought I was initially applied for I was told about opportunities that weren’t attainable
bad,The merger between Spectrum and TWC left a hole in what we could offer to our customers caused senior TWC Sales Reps to start looking for other opportunities.
bad,Some parts of the company are very territorial and many of the managers are micromanagers while of course claiming to not be.  Managers seem more intent on never missing even an artificial deadline and try to push other groups into the same mode.  No flexibility is allowed in those groups.  This isn’t true in all groups but in many.
bad,Management is important to the experience you receive. I believe Charter as a company is fine but the management in which I worked with was ineffective and more concerned with office politics than anything else.
bad,"I worked for TWC when Spectrum took over, when all was said and done we ended up making less money. We also worked more hours. The culture changed for the worst. The training for new system was lacking. We were expected to figure the new system out on our own. The office hours were extended."
bad,"i love what I do so its not a job to me its a career. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the people. I don't consider them customers."
bad,The merger with Charter from time Warner has been the worst I've experienced in all of my 10 years with Time Warner. I would not refer this company in the future to anyone until the structure and culture of the company changes.
bad,"The days were very busy, always a fast paced environment, management was not very helpful, micromanaged often by supervisors that had no experience in position, no room for growth, no advancement from within."
bad,"The job itself isn't bad, but management sucks it seems like they don't care about their people, they put anyone into supervisor role very high turn over rate"
bad,Once Charter merged with TWC and trimmed the staff to a barely operational limit the workload became unmanageable with no help in sight.  Not certain that Sr. Management has the best interest of their workers.
bad,hard to move up with in the company as far as hours. Once your hours are 4pm to 1am you might as well call that your permenent schedule. The numbers they want you to reach are almost impossible upsell every call you get calls are unfiltered.
bad,"The pay is low and they want you to take on a new job with pay raises. The rules are blanket rules that change.  It's not a good place to work, No integrity."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Spectrum Brands Holdings, a member of the Russell 2000 Index, is a global and diversified consumer products company and a leading supplier of consumer batteries, residential locksets, residential builders’ hardware, plumbing and accessories, shaving and grooming products, personal care products, small household appliances, specialty pet supplies, lawn and garden and home pest control products, personal insect repellents, and auto care products"
bad,"Charter was good at the start, but then you get 3-6 months down the line, job is super repetitive, management is not supportive, only thing you can rely on is your team mates, and even then thats if you are put on a good team."
bad,"The pay was good, a lot of new changes being made. If you like bad hours and little social life this jobs for you. Cant really say more. Customers are angry, coworkers are bad"
bad,"Lots of cold calling."
bad,"Not meant for people with outside obligations, or children"
bad,"This company only cares about growing it's bottom-line profit and not the quality of its service. A typical day consists of driving into the office to get told by management that we weren't doing enough as technicians to grow the brand. We would then wait in line for about an hour to get our refurbished equipment to install for our jobs for the day. After that, you would run whatever route the dispatch team gives you. Each job was worth a point value and you were expected to have a certain amount of points each day. Throughout your day the jobs would change in your queue, your supervisor would randomly show up to ""help you"" (really just take a reading and talk your ear off) and you would get threatened for shutting off service by deadbeat customers that don't pay their bills. It is a labor intensive position; you climb poles, through attics, under houses, on roofs, on large ladders to check for issues with signal. Customers know that they get refurbished modems and cable boxes and bite your head off even though it's not y our fault. Then to make it worse when you are done for the day your supervisor will call you and hit you up to work more because some slacker only got two jobs done. For the $14 an hour, it is definitely NOT worth the aggravation. I hear AT&T and even DirectTV treat their technicians better."
bad,Would not recommend this employer to anyone who is looking for long term employment.  The average length of employment from hire to quit or fire was appprox. 5 months.
bad,"Horrible structure to retain business. Lie and overcharge rates, clean up later and cycle to the next. Horrible software and support and poor management. One time I was asked to write proprietary information down and I refused due to customers privacy and got scorned for it, so I resigned. I would rather protect people than place them in harm for a dollar bill. Horrible as mentioned"
bad,"Worked here for over six years. Good compensation. But work required was way over the top of normal. It was expected to see patients and then chart until midnight or 2 am without overtime. This was the ONLY way you could not fall behind. If you were not related to someone or of Filipino descent, you were destined to stay exactly where you were. If you spoke up about things that were unethical, you would get written up, or told it wasn't your business. Often asked to forge documents and backdate things. They pay well, but it is NOT worth it. All areas of your life will suffer. And they will string you along and mesmerize you making you believe you are like ""family"" and they are there for you and will protect you. But if you play with snakes, you should expect to be bitten."
bad,This job was fast paced requiring multi-tasking and experience in advertising and cable was critical.  Co workers are great.
bad,would not recommend job to people who are creative or enjoy flexibility
bad,"A typical day is heading to your desk, where you are not allowed to have any personal belongings, not even a photo of your family.  They are overly critical about getting the customer off the phone instead of making sure they have been assisted fully."
bad,"They did not care what you had to say or how you felt. You just do the work and go home whenever you finish your jobs. Management is terrible. Supervisors will stick up for themselves and whoever is in the good ol boys club, if you were not one of them then you were put under the bus. "
bad,"For the five years that I worked at Charter things changed as regularly as our CEO's. The company lacks vision and treats its employees as though they are automatons. Recently, Charter elected to implement policies that were anti-customer and anti-employee. I would not recommend this employer until there is steady, consistent management and a shift in corporate culture."
bad,"Very poor management. Company paid the last CEO to run the company into the ground and bankrupt, then paid millions more to bring us out of the mess he created. Company lacks morals. During those bad weather events, Charter demands you risk your life, regardless, for call center work? My direct manger asked a co-worker if his 8 and 4 year olds can stay home by themselves so he could come into work. That's a fact. Co-workers are great, even under heavy daily queue of 100+ calls waiting. Forget about doing your job, they have it written into your acceptance letter, that they can add work, or change your job at will. Oh, and the extra work, they pay nothing more, yearly raises, 35 cents or less. Advancement? Not likely. Very clicky, and racist environment. HR? Forget about it, they are there to keep the company from getting sued, nothing more. Insurance? Yeah that's ran by Charter, and they are hard at work, to see to it you don't use a cent. If you or a loved one gets cancer, if it cost too much, they will simply deny the claim and you will die, period. Many CEO's have used Charter as a jumping off point and left the company for better ones, look into it. If a CEO will not say, what does that say about the company?"
bad,You are a number. The same way the customers are treated. All about greed.
bad,"Lack of help, training, support. No accountability for mistakes, Over scheduled."
bad,Working As A Team Retention Leader Was A Good Postion Because It Allowed Me To Save The Customer And Offer Incentives For Them To Remain With Charter....
bad,Constant support line queue always led for long and strenuous days. Management is always pushy. Team leads do not work well with others and always put down those below them. Co-workers were fantanstic when you were able to sit back and talk with them outside during breaks. This company worries more about sales then helping customers with the issues they originally called in for.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"timed your bathroom breaks, raises were no more than 20% a year IF your stats were excellent. Management was never around to help or playing video games all day. Discrimination was awful. Fired people for the stupidest reason ans somebody is always being written up in HR, also they say one of their benefits is sick time, you accrue sick hours, but if you're sick even with a drs note? you get an occurence, if you get so many in a year you get a write up. If you have a write up you cannot transfer or do anything for 6 months. HR staff is the worst! They lie to all of their employees"
bad,"if you under 30 this is your job you will be promoted for just showing up, if your over 40 be prepared to work hard all day since you will do the teams job.. the under 30 will be in sp all day flitting around the 35 -40 will be doing other projects the over 40 will be taking all the calls don't try to fix anything just make the sales. they told me that's how they can tell if you're doing your job.they cut commission when ever they feel like it. Every supervisor was replaced by someone under 40."
bad,"There has got to be something this company can do to make it less aggravating. No matter how many free pizzas and candy they gave out, I hated coming in to work each day. That and my supervisor was extremely unprofessional."
bad,They want a robot that will read the script and answer the flow chart questions. I have many years as a tech and I was always going outside the script.
bad,"Let's get this out of the way first: Answering phones all day is the most mentally draining thing I've done in my entire life. It is definitely not for everyone, but I wanted to stick it out for the possibility to make very good commission. "
bad,Management for most part is a joke. The one's that set the goals have never been in the field. Micromanagement at it's finest. Horrible company to work for.
bad,"This used to be a really great place to work but quickly started to go downhill after the Charter merger. Employees were overworked and underappreciated. Very unorganized and inconsistent with policies and procedures. Things that come down from higher up are never clear or presented in the correct form. Policies change over night without notice. Policies and procedures changes are literately given out days before they start or even AFTER they have already started. A lot of Favoritism and unfairness when it comes to every day activities. EVERYTHING is based on seniority so always expect to work a terrible shift, have zero life balance, or ever spend a Thanksgiving or Christmas vacation with your family unless you been with the company for years already. Employee attrition is at its worst which is why the department is understaffed. Rather than hire more talent, the current employees and forced to work harder. Bonuses taken away. Events taken away. Schedules are inconsistent. Business hours are inconsistent. Not enough technicians for residential customers but worse for business customers. Very little team work. A lot of broken promises and let downs on a regular basis."
bad,"Back to back calls from miserable customers about the dumbest things they can find out without calling by simply looking at the bill. A million metrics that are crazy! Not allowed to use hold, have to watch how much you transfer calls, must use empathy, you get a bad number if a customer calls back 🙄"
bad,"First, benefits are wonderful and start right away.  The base salary is pitiful and a slap to any professional.  Although the promise is it's made up in commissions. also not true.  hours are long.  Products are meh. Customer service is dreadful and needs revamp.  Infrastructure stinks at best.  After working for Comcast,  spectrum makes Comcast/NBC look awesome."
bad,This company will use you like a working dog till they wear you out. Very high turnover. I have only stayed here as long as I did because I was paid almost double what they start people out at.
bad,This company is solely concerned with making money. Sales goals are a huge part of the how they factor your compensation and are not always easy to achieve. Management has shown time and time again that numbers are all that matter and integrity is no longer a value for hey are concerned with. Misleading customers is done regularly by theirs trying to keep their commission.
bad,"They hounded me to apply and I did because the job I really wanted fell through. It was unprofessional, chaotic and disorganized from the moment I began training. I was verbally abused by one Supervisor and gaslighted by the last one until I left the company. They blocked me getting unemployment even though they gave me no choice but to quit after laying off my department."
bad,"The culture ""inadvertantly"" rewards and compensates those who are performing at the expense of the client.  There is a balance to be had where the business can be supported as well as the client which would lead to a healthier long term relationship between the 2 entities.  "
bad,"Promotions are based more on who you know and not what you know.  In almost 5 years, I've been passed up for promotions because other people who were less qualified were more popular than I was."
bad,"The company did not appreciate hard-work, honest, integrity and use of best practices. People were promoted based on favoritism and nepotism; unable to get clear answers from Management on policies and procedures."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I don’t remember because it was a while ago and I no longer work there "
bad,"Horrible management with, a certain micro managing supervisor that likes to bully and make up his own rules. Doesnt matter how many years you work there you may never get a shift change. Very unfair place to work. They do not care about their employees at all. The charter spectrum moto is work them until they quit. Unrealistic expectations."
bad,"When Spectrum was still Charter, they actually cared about you as an employee. Now, I’m just a number in the corporate system. Everything is being monitored by low level executives, which now requires more time per job to send in the proper paperwork so they can justify their existence. Moral is at an all-time low and turnover an all-time high. Look elsewhere!"
bad,"I was making close to $30.00/hour because I took all of the technical classes (in other words I worked my butt of for 15 plus years) Every year I got an above average review then one day out of the blue they forced me into another department which was filled with unqualified managers which got me fired...."
bad,Company is cut throat and has no work life balance. they have a good vision but upper management lie to you and back stabbing culture is seen weeks after working there.
bad,"I cannot warn people away fast enough, Charter Spectrum is a nightmare to work for. If you have any sort of personal health issues that will require any sort of accommodations, including family care, just walk away. They constantly push stats, making it very clear that if you cannot perform, you do not belong with them. The workplace is constantly changing (I had over 6 supervisors in the course of 1 year) and the good benefits don't make up for the total lack of proper management and constant stress."
bad,"No work ethic among the majority of coworkers"
bad,"Spectrum is an awesome place to make money. Long as you can keep up wtih your sale goals you will thrive, the moment you can not you probably have to many friends at your work environment."
bad,"Spectrum sucks right now. I have been with the company for over 10yrs so know what Time Warner was about. Charter came in and we became Spectrum. Charter does not care about their employees. Management will walk by you in the office and not even say hello...not good morning...NOTHING. They will look at your desk thought to see if you have your phone out to give them an opportunity for a negative interaction. Its sad, the employees are just numbers to them, they don't see faces.We can't have trash cans at our desk, no snacks (this position is not via phone) and as my position expired, Management had a meeting and decoded to tell us 5 days before the last day (no time to seek other options). However, the Director's assistant accidentally sent the leadership notes to the entire building to which we were called into a meeting and advised there is no severance so you can go into a phone repair queue. However, ""You are a valuable asset but we understand that you need to do what is best for your household"""
bad,"Charter Communications offers you free cable and internet which is cool, but you'll never use when you devote your life to this company.  The hardest part of the job is balance."
bad,I worked for spectrum for 2 1/2 years there is consistent turnover due to training being a month long..the hours when you first start is 11-7 the hours will change if you become a high performing rep. The sales goals have become very hard to obtain with little to no help from the company to give customers an incentive to buy high price packages. There is no career advancement. I am glad I’m no longer working for this company
bad,Prejudiced when it comes to older employees. They do not follow up or properly train new personnel. Had to repeatedly ask for passwords to do a proper job.
bad,"very understaffed and high turnover. The amount of work every person has to do is beyond ridiculous. "
bad,"During training everything seemed wonderful, but it was all an illusion. You are just a number there. All they care about is getting those sales at any cost and if you have an issue with their methods then you are not welcomed."
bad,"Management, team leadership, team lead assistance, could have been better. There was some growth needed in the new leadership in the departments. Chain of command and communication needs growth."
bad,"They dont want to solve problems, they want issues passed to another department. Managers only care about what their bosses want to see, and will cut ethical corners to get there."
bad,there was too many calls that took a half hour at times half hour before your scheduled to actually work. had to drive your personal car mileage system is a joke so i didn’t get money back when you were driving
bad,"Bait and switch — started out fun and rewarding through classroom training and OJT — once you’re on the call center floor, there’s no more sense of teamwork, and you become a number to Management. All they care about is handle time and “productive” time — not much for quality and the overall customer experience. Morale is bad, turnover high, and Management doesn’t have a clue. Do yourself a favor and work anywhere but here."
bad,"A merger of three companies with entrenched management/engineering staff with varying levels arrogance and stupidity.  Huge re-orgs, infighting, and kingdom-building with all of the associated Machiavellian'esq process to make sure the problem is always the worker instead of the excruciatingly detailed procedures employees are expected to memorize for day to day work or ""do as I say, not as I do"" management style.  Management has unrealistic expectations when the process flow they demand is coupled with the work to be completed.  ""More"" is not always ""better""."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"When you accept a job with Spectrum as a Field Technician it becomes your whole life. My day would start as early as 6:30am to prepare my van for the next days work which suppose to begin when only on sight of my first customers home at 8am. Sometimes, I would have to drive as far as a hour and a half away, to get to that first job by clock in time. So drive time at Spectrum is a constant loosing battle accounting for just a portion of the problems many technicians face. Spectrum expects 8 jobs to be performed a day through nightmarish drivetimes and scaling workloads ranging from installs to trouble calls; Technicians want know the gravity of what their facing until they are on site, further making it harder for technicians to adhere to tight time frames and on time arrivals. Communication you would think would be great for technicians, but many find themselves on hold on phone calls for hours unable to get jobs moved, unable to close jobs, unable to even get a hold of supervisors.But, Spectrum does promise the opportunity to advance, but after working a ten hour shift to get home as late as 8pm sometimes later, the last thing I want to do is be on a computer for hours, further separating myself from any kind a life outside of cable. Frustrations, of over booked work, and tight timeframes all technicians will come to know in one way or another. Tech's will here it in the voice of everyone they call, from routing to tech support and your supervisors. It all in the end, slowly eats at you the longer you are employed not ever able to get the responsive help you need as an employee"
bad,"Poor management, did not allow freedom to make independent problem solving decisions and did not make accommodations for days off requesting consecutively"
bad,"There was no direction when it came to trying to get a specific answer. If you ask two completely different managers or supervisors the same question you would get two completely different answers. There was no continuity in how the floor was run. Some people were allowed to wear different clothes than others. The metrics were difficult to reach. The expectation to help the customer vs get them off the phone was inhumane. If your call goes over a set time period you would have someone hanging over your shoulder telling you to get the customer off the phone.  Passing the buck off to technicians instead of taking ownership of problems and solving it right then and there. If helping an older customer who moved slower or couldn't see well, supervisors would tell you to send a tech instead of helping them because it took too long and lowered your stats. Parking is horrible, it feels like no one cares."
bad,"Front line employees and managers are not supported and their development is not prioritized. Most leadership positions are filled externally. The pay is fine, but the opportunities to grow into new roles are limited."
bad,"I worked for Spectrum for 7 months. It felt like I was under a microscope, the threat of being written up for whatever statistic management was monitoring at the time loomed over our heads daily. As tech support agents, we supported several products and they were adding more."
bad,"After IPO, everything went down hill. All career advancement opportunities were removed. The company concentrated on cutting costs and subsequently phased out their higher paid technicians in favor of entry lower paid reps. The sales and quality expectations were high and not inline with salary levels."
bad,It has changed in culture. There are too many unprofessional agents on the floor which takes away the professionalism of your overall work experience. It is looked over because the only focus is numbers.
bad,Could be better. They put way too much pressure on sales goals and that’s why the have a high turnover rate. It’s crazy what some of the agents have to do to meet goals.
bad,"To start off the work culture is sugar coated to seem like its the best place around town.  Upper management will tell you anything to make you believe its the best job .  In-turn, you tell the customers anything to make them believe they have the best services.  At the end, you must remember it's a luxury service.   Not for everyone.  If you can sit- down 8 hours plus daily for 5 days go for it."
bad,"pay going down with job difficulty going up. save yourself and your family the headache and find something else. Managers are lazy and make your pay go down down and theirs go up while they sit behind a computer or phone. If you're of color, at least in my office i worked out of....stay away, all i got to say about that."
bad,The corporate life lives here. The old gang that has been here for the past 20-30 years are treated totally different compared to fairly new hires. I've been there a few years and I am treated like a child. If you like to be micro-managed this is the place for you. I'm a grown man with 19 years experience. I show up to work every day 30 minutes prior to my actual start time. You would think they would trust me by now. They track your vehicles and have fired people for being at their home at 4:00pm. Smart people plan their day so they will be home at the end of their day. This is especially true since they are not allowing for overtime. They take away minutes that you have worked. I believe this is an illegal practice but no one has brought it to the appropriate people for fear of being fired. Stay far away. I do think it could be a great place for a high school graduate that can't afford to pay for school. The training for the Tech Ops guys is better than for my group. Happy job searching!
bad,"At first glance, lots of money and all around great company. Very unorganized and no room for advancement unless your cool with management. The commission structure sets you up to fail, and your money decreases with no explanation. The ideal of of selling cable was great cause I love watching TV myself. Company does not have any compassion towards there employees everyday lives..ie..medical issues, doctor's notes.. life happens. I don't have an attendance issue, but I've seen co-workers that has been terminated for issues that could have been excused. I've always prided myself throughout the years of caring and building a rapport with my customers and selling based on their needs, also selling them based on benefit and not just trying to make them go in debt by not being to pay.. They want you to sell regardless of the customer being on a fixed income or 80 year old."
bad,"it was a job.  the fringe benefits of the free services are what made me stay as long as i did.  there was a total disconnect between all departments, especially after the merge where spectrum was created."
bad,"It was a great company when it was Bright House."
bad,"Spectrum said all the right things to me to make me want to accept the job, Rotating Saturday’s 9-5,"
bad,"Low pay for what we do, it is hard to get by and make ends meet. Other companies in the area pay a lot higher and respect their employees for their hard work. Current people are looking for other jobs due to the low pay while others have already quit. We lost really good people already due to the low pay."
bad,Working for Spectrum was a negative experience. Due to the fact that you were expected to do a lot more then other companies in the same profession and for a lot less pay. The management wasn't very  positive.
bad,"Now she is the Director of Sales!!! What a joke! Major lack of help on anything technical. Had to go to engineer who was covering 3 teams and couldn't handle the workload. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I went from residential tech support, then to business tech support and then to business billing. After fighting my way each time, I got stuck. I addressed issues with the treatment of employees via management and they found other ways to get back at me. I ended up hating my job and where I worked and I would never recommend it to anyone. They make you degrade yourselves through how customers treat the employees and how management never enforces the current policies and procedures."
bad,In the beginning I enjoyed working during my training because of the trainer and my colleagues in the training class. After awhile I felt like the perks of working there were not the same as the perks they said we would have. I also did not think it was fair that people who do not live in areas that have spectrum could not receive any of the discounts or services that those who lived in the area did.
bad,"This company is for employees-who is still in high School or just completing High School, who need the job experience of working as a customer service in a call-center. The management, team , and team leaders need skills on how to relate to the employees at CMI Group, which is the 3rd party of spectrum. Their attendance at CMI Group definitely need to be look at and examine overly. Let me give you an example: If a employees missed a day from work than that employee has to make-up 10 hours for each day that is miss."
bad,Setting up cable and internet services at peoples home was quite enjoyable challenging work. However you weren't given enough time t o properly complete the job without being late to the next job. Instead of being given one job at a time you are given a list of appointments in the morning each an hour apart.
bad,"Working at Spectrum Requires a lot of multitasking, strong communication & negotiating skills. Stressful environment & very fast paced. You need to have a thick skin for dealing with angry customers. You are expected to sell on every call even if they're not a sales related call."
bad,Worked for acquired TWC for 16 years. The last 2 were the worst Management couldnt care less for employee growth or happiness. I thought i would be there until retirement yet the mismanagement of  ttime and skills were unprecedented. I thorougly enjoyed working for working for TWC.  Employees are unappreciated and overworked. Micro-managed and belittled. I threw in the towel as the stress levels reached unlivable levels.
bad,"Managers and supervisors have negative, and brittle attitudes. Have un-achievable goals. Hire management incapable of training staff to meet goals. Require employees to work 6 days a week and long hours. Strict on rules and create new rules constantly. Unstable work environment."
bad,"This job did not have a work life balance. The pay was low for all the work that we did. You got hired for one thing but then end up doing another job. The hours were unreasonable and no consideration if you have kids or other things going on in your life. Once the schedule is set, its in stone. They took away the big shift bids.They only have the mini shift bids and that goes by seniority. Then you have to wait for 90 days to even be eligible.  If you want your schedule changed you have to jump through a bunch of hoops.I was so stressed out by the time I left there. Angry customers, yelling , screaming and name calling. Not to mention, my off days were Tuesday and Wednesday. No time to spend with kids. The company is misleading to their customers especially when they transitioned to Spectrum. On a positive note I had a great supervisor"
bad,"The company makes UNREALISTIC goals to their technicians as far as metrics and performances. The companies health care reform plan has cost more headaches than good if you were to use it, especially if ever out of injuries as agreed with current and former employees. The company tends to consistently fix whats not broken and ignore their employees on issues that needs some attention."
bad,"Management is a joke and have no idea on how to lead a business department, only care about residential. They only care about Legacy Charter employees"
bad,You are not acknowledged for a great job you are acknowledged by how much management likes whether or not you have the knowledge of the job. The only people who advance in this company are those who suck up to the bosses not those who learn and have advanced knowledge. There is a huge lack in support for front end agents.
bad,My company was bought out by this company. Ever since then it has been a stressful environment filled with pointing fingers and letting the bad things roll down hill from management. No one stands up for the little man. Pay is completely screwed up. Starting positions make more than higher up positions. After a couple of years you can make more than some of the 15-20 year veterans and still stay in the starting position. Overtime was cut back due to shifts added. The different shifts made some of the 10 year veterans have to start working weekends again.
bad,"I worked for spectrum before they bought time warner cable; back when they were still charter communications. When i first started my job i loved it, but as charter expanded we became more and more busy, every single day we were back to back to calls. management is very strict, you aren't even allowed to go to the bathroom if you need to unless you were on break. no opportunities for growth, unless of course you're butt buddies with the managers."
bad,Acquisition changed the company. I did not work there long so I can not tell you the history and I came at a time when everyone was being laid off. So I am unsure if it was better
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Not prepared to make the jump from being #4 to being #2."
bad,"Charter Communications (Spectrum) took over Time Warner Cable in late 2016.  The year leading up to, and since the merger was chaotic with new Charter mangement uninvolved and unresponsive.  This made for a horrible customer and employee experience."
bad,"Working for Time Warner Cable it was my first time dipping my toes in the waters of the sharks. Very competitive atmosphere. Found out I was better at sales than I thought but it wasn't my cup of tea at the time. So, the supervisor had me write a letter of resignation on her computer. You have to be a shark to work there."
bad,Charter is a virus that is spreading itself through the countries cable systems . All the want it yes men and they dont care if you have a family . Stay away !
bad,constant change and uncertainty causes uneven accountability on lower level staff all while having 0 accountability to management. no one ever knows what is going on. difficult to gain a direct or efficient answer to the changes that will affect the compensation or scheduling. sales leads are sparse and inconsistent. constant push on outdated products.
bad,"I love the job as a counselor but I'm never called in the other pier Diem is always called in I'm guessing because he is a male don't know, and when I'm called in it's at the last minute with supervisor knowing that I have another job. I am a certified counselor and love assisting people and I would love to show spectrum how good of a job that I can do."
bad,"This place requires you to do a lot of work for scrub pay. Then after you help the customer within the next 24 hours they receive a survey call... you never know who is going to answer the call and even if the person says ""this is not about the agent"" it will still count against you!!"
bad,"I've worked here for a few months and I'm second top rep in my office. You're forced to work in any weather condition may it be snow, heat, rain, etc "
bad,Time Warner Cable used to be a nice place to work. As a sales rep we were well compensated and the environment was light and fun with incentives each month. Charter bought the company and everything went sour. No more incentives. Decreased pay. The schedules changed and made it impossible for most of the 500 employees to work even somewhat normal hours unless you were lucky enough to get a Monday-Friday. Customer support was no longer as important and taking as many calls as you could was the only way to make a higher commission.
bad,This company is horrible to work for.  They don't care for their employees at all.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to be placed on short term disability.  A month after they called me to tell me my position had been released and I would have to apply with them after my disability was over or they would not pay for my medical bills.  They put on a good front but when it comes down to it they have no empathy.
bad,"Very poor transition from Time Warner Cable to Spectrum, low morale, poor training and communication and lack of respect from management and higher to employees. Major pay cut in transition."
bad,The good thing about one touch is the hours.. they're real lienient on hours.. if you have an unexpected emergency they understand 100%. They make it as fun as they can.. some people take advantage. The pay is horrible and you have to keep track of the sales you make or else they will not give you your earned money
bad,Runner up for worst company to work at only because we made to vote for the worst company during work hours. I wouldn't work here if you abide by any standards
bad,Once again time Warner cable does not care about it's employees. As stated by user management there's always someone else to hire and take your spot. Never going back
bad,Worked an avg. 80 hours per week with 40+ installers. Little support from management and piece work pay. Management wouldn't address contractors concerns. Sub contact for Bright House through Kablelink LLC.
bad,"No matter how desperate you are for a job, keep scrolling.  There is a zero job/life balance when you work here and they don't care about you as an employee at all.  Management knows nothing about anything.  You can be a consistent performer but if you don't belong in the right 'clique' they look for reasons to make you miserable daily.  And that is just management and work atmosphere.  You handle upset customers regularly and yet get reprimanded if you haven't sold them anything and you have a very scripted dialogue you must follow with every customer.  You are not allowed to think for yourself and they would love to have robots without minds of their own.  Promotions are only for their favorites and not based on your work experience past or present."
bad,Supervisor was micro managing department and did not provide training as we were going through department consolidations.
bad,"Manage service delivery orders. Work as a liasion with customers/field operations.Most days are full of regrets and apologies to customers for missed appointments.  No worklife balance, micro managed environment, low pay and no incentives and promotion opportunties.Heavy use of time clock for disciplinary purposes. Not a nice place to work if you are career minded, customer focused with a family."
bad,"A typical day at work is receiving a route with addresses and you have to go check them for illegal connections. Sounds easy right? Well it is, the only problem I had with this company was the management team. They're extremely unorganized, the supervisor will tell you to do something one way, and you do it, then the manager will give you a hard time because you didn't do it the ""right way."" They're constantly not on the same page. Another thing I was working there for 3 month before I received my uniform, I had to ask one of my coworkers to prevent any chance of me getting written up. Anytime you need something you need to remind your supervisor multiple times before you receive it weeks later. The pay is terrible here, Charter pays its employees the least out of all the other cable companies, they don't even want to supply the audit department with new vehicles after they all break down weekly. When the vehicles break down they hurt your production, you could imagine how much they would slow us down when they break down weekly. Management will constantly give you a hard time anytime the vehicles break down. Not everything was negative there, the employees that worked there were all good people."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,The wages paid by TWC were too low for the responsibility and knowledge required. TWC= Things Will Change and they did daily and usually we on the phones were the last to know. The turnover is extremely high with good reason.
bad,job used to be good.  they continue to take away benefits and resources that allow u to complete your job.  and expect more to be done.  and no respect for personal time.  management is a joke.  no advancement unless u want to take 3 steps backwards to take 1 forward
bad,"Pay close attention if you interview. There was a consensus in my group that the sales part of the job was not  mentioned much, but everything that you do is centered around it. Watch out for others taking yours sales as well. Calling the job customer service is a complete bait and switch. Sales are way more important than the customer service. If you don't sell you are not going to last very long. The billing is extremely hard to explain and you can see no more than the customers see on their bill. Fixing problems? There is a 50/50 chance. And don't count on management support either way. If you like helping people this is not the position you want."
bad,All ways changes. Limited training. They route any calls to you and expect t to sell to angry customer.  The management plays favorittism.
bad,"I enjoyed all my co-workers and customers each day. I was very skilled at repair and installation of cable tv, phone, and internet/wifi services. Hardest part was in wintertime working in brutal cold weather. I loved going to customers homes  each day and meeting so many wonderful folks in our area. It was a rewarding experience to meet customers and to take care of their telecommunications needs. thank you."
bad,software of there own don't do updates on equipment themselves pay an other company to do updates to  equipment and operations change back and forth one month we move forward the next month we go back to what wasn't working at first.
bad,"You have to wait 6 months to get anywhere there and actually getting promoted is a feat in itself after that . They rely too much on point systems .The pay sucked. If you don't walk in the door for the job you actually want then its not worth working there at all .Filled with drama and unsavory characters but there are pockets of decent people and decent jobs ,just really do your research before applying."
bad,"Used to be a great company. However, don't even think about advancing here, once you come in, unless you know someone, you are stuck. Period."
bad,"Great starter job , but the  climate is oppressive  and unsupportive"
bad,"Must be on-time everyday at your work station ready to start your shift on the phones, Average day about 50-70 calls, Your dealing with all type of people complaining about there bills and services. You have Supv and QA listening to your calls on your shift. Must sell products. Must meet company requirements every month or will be written up and after three write ups.....Bye Bye Bye."
bad,"This company has gone through a lot of changes, not all where to the benefit of the employees.  Sometimes at a detriment to team work. The biggest issue is not having pertinent information in a timely manner in order to perform essential job functions"
bad,A typical day at work is long and more there is no excitement management doesn't interact with you unless it is necessary. All of my co workers are looking for other work
bad,"the job was ok, the pay could have been better and management sucked this was a third party company."
bad,"I deal with upset customers all day long that are upset for a battery of reasons. Those reasons being things like poor customer service, technical issues, billing and pricing issues among other things. My job is to diffuse the situation and show the customer the value in their service and prevent cancellation. This can sometime be difficult to do especially when the customer has become verbally abusive, but it is my job to stay calm, keep a clear head, and always remain professional."
bad,The main things at the job that were very positive was the pay amount and that you were able to have your own desk. The not so good things were having to work from 1:30pm to 10pm and the two days off not being together split throughout the week.
bad,"I worked for the company for many years! For the first 4 years I was there, they paid great hourly with decent commissions! You used to have your own desk, that you could decorate how you liked.. it made it an easier day! Going in to year 5, they took assigned desks away and treated every like a heard of cows.. you are moved around every day. The management is horrible. You are not treated like a valuable part of the company.. more like a number, someone who is there to get CHARTER as much money as possible. Every 6 months is a shift bid... so whether you want to or not, you have no choice but to get a new schedule... which makes home life REALLY hard... especially if you have children. There are so much inner politics, its disgusting. The customers are rude, spoiled people. "
bad,The company doesn't offer much room for growth nor advancement. Favortism was shown within management.
bad,"-The retention department was the department of last resort for a customer with a billing and/or service issue. Most days required an exceptionally high level of customer service and problem resolution to keep a customer from cancelling their subscription. Many situations were static and common solutions for these existed. However, some situations were quite dynamic and required quick and sometimes out-of-the-box thinking. The job itself consists of a 40 hours work week. The timing of these 40 hours changes periodically with a shift bid and top choices go to the representatives with the best statistics for things such as average handle time, call model, quality, revenue retention, and disconnect rate."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Everyone in this company talk about everyone. Talk about two faced. They smile at each other but the minute you walk away they are talking about you. I made a poor decision to work for them with no experience of this position. I was told I would be trained yet I quickly learned I was lead to fail.
bad,Currently hours are 12 3 days and then 4 the next week.  24/7 operation with 9 employees in the department not each shift.  Promises for 2 years that the hours are temporary.  Coworkers are the only reason that I have lasted the 2 years.
bad,"A typical day for me would consist of about 30 calls in a 8 hour period. Customers called in to basically disconnect services with us about 9 times out of 10. It was my job to save them as a customer with incentives, prorates/discounts, or plain good customer service. Our management was a little unorganized with not too good resources but their direction was respectable. The coworkers seemed to be a little more on the young side so sometimes their was young issues on the floor but nothing i couldnt manage myself. The hardest part about the job was trying everything to save the customer and they still wanted to disconnect and being ok with it. The thing i loved most about the job was when a customer informed me i have made them happy they are still with Time Warner Cable."
bad,Less focused on customers and the employees anymore.  Have reduced compensation for employees
bad,My experience with this company was just Okay. At the time Time Warner was just a mini project within another building and then it quickly folded. I wasn't there very long at all. But i had a really great trainer.
bad,Although TIme warner cable may have some opportunities to grow it is a very stressful place to work. You have to worry on a constant basis if your going to still have a job the next day with the unrealistic expectations they have with there stats. They don't care about resolving customer issues they only care about how much money they can make from the customer.
bad,"During our training, what we've heard about the company was too good to be true. Compensation, employment duties, advancement and recognition. Near the end of our training, we we're made aware that the scope of the position that we've applied to has changed and it was extremely stressful from the very first call. There were constant issues with the products and services. New customers were not fully told about their first month's bill and installation charges. The difficult part of the job was dealing with the customer's, but the most difficult was management. If you didn't meet your sales goals or quality assessment goals where were ever changing you were written up. Management was constantly on your back.If you have a chronic health issue, Management was unsympathetic. Out of my training class of 16 eight months ago, as of 07/20, 2 remain. Some have found other employment, some have walked out, some were terminated. The stress of the position lead to a mass exodus. Yet management does not care"
bad,The training class was very unproductive at times there were hours with no training or guidance. I feel that the job would have been more exciting had there been more interaction and on job training. The environment was very negative with co-workers. The worst part of the job was the fact that the leadership team was un-organized and the training material was dated.
bad,Ability to learn new concepts and gain knowledge of PC troubleshooting while helping everyday working people with their internet and phone issues.Great place!
bad,If you are looking for a way to ha dle life and bills this is the place. The pay compensates for the irritation of the job. The management needs a lot of assistance on how to manager and provide a stress free environment.
bad,"First of all, this is my experience working in the eastern North Carolina market.  I would hope it's not like this everywhere at Spectrum. In a typical 10 hour shift about 3-4 hours will be driving in a van.  Job routing was not efficient at all.  Depending on where the first and last job location was at, 14 hour days were not uncommon as well as an exceptional 16 hour day. Watch out for paid time off discrepancy issues.  Technicians are given 80 hours of vacation at the start of the year but you still have to accrue those hours. For example, when I left the company in June 2019, I had 49 hours of unused PTO. My last check only paid out around 7 hours of PTO because although I had 49 hours of PTO, I had only ""earned"" 7 that would pay out.  I also lost over 100 hours of sick time but I knew I would lose that.  Moral of the story, use your PTO! Pros: free cable and internet, transportation to drive home.  Cons: inefficient routing, very long hours, negative culture within the field operations, difficulty procuring the proper equipment for your job."
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company, locally anyways.  Management treats you as disposable and more often than not with a lack of reciprocal respect.  Working for this company was a great experience the first half of my career and after a shift in management, it only went downhill.  As a result, over time, the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction I once had from going to work completely"
bad,As core staff you get paid less than agency ... after 5 years i got no motivation they asked for overtime but paid as flat rate in the same time when agency get 1 1/2 for working Les then you ... They are trying to get people in by any means but forgot about their staff they are stressed that agency are leaving after 5-10 days . they need to change management or there be just management and office working there.
bad,You can do your job and get certificates and everything but at the end of the day it doesn't matter when your supervisor favors others. Also pretty racist so I had to go.
bad,"just like the commercial ok is not ok. They pay decent if you do not take into consideration the threatment ( not a typo)  from the corporate policy changes,the customers and the directives being pushed by management. I have never been in a place where so many suffer from stress related illness."
bad,"As a residential sales agent we underwent 8 weeks of training learning the products of Internet, Cable TV, Home Phone and Mobile Services. For the most part training was a positive experience for everyone involved in the class.  As we went through the training, commission payout structure was brought up several times, however it was ALWAYS dodged and pushed aside, yet this was a huge part of our pay structure.  Why is it not being explained to us?  Out of the 8 solid weeks of training, we got a quick 30 minute crash course of commissions, which ultimately made absolutely no sense.  Once I get out to my new team and start taking calls I find that most of my calls that come in are NOT even sales calls, but rather service calls, unhappy customer calls, customer wanting to lower their bills, etc.  At this rate it's nearly impossible to make the quotas, especially since agents will cancel orders that other agents put in so they can ""steal"" the sale.  In a call center that mandates overtime into our schedule with no say-so from us, we are supposed to find time to go through all our cancelled order and dispute the ones that were stolen.  This is nearly impossible when we are in a call queue that is receiving back to back calls throughout the entire day.  This company promised way more than it is actually delivering.  Very disappointing."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Company wants to control all aspects of your personal life when you are off work! Always have an attorney on hand . The HR department are out to serve themselves and will not support you in any way shape or form. They will fire you for not just cause and will consort with unemployment services to deny you any unemployment benefits due to you after you are let go from the company. Always have an attorney!!!
bad,"Charter needs to  clean house  the different departments do whatever they want. Make there own policies, have clicks  and if your not in one your on the watch list to be let go its awful"
bad,"I love the people I work with. However, no job stability. Only focused on numbers and not overall performance. No matter how hard people strive to to better, there will always be another issue to lower work standards"
bad,My team is comprised of smart dependable caring folks and I push them hard to be their best and perform with excellence.  I hire smart experienced professionals and I'd like to allow them to do their jobs.
bad,Your just meat there and can easily be replaced . So they will fire over every little thing. They have alot of supervisors that micromanage even though you know what your doing.
bad,"I was hired on as inside sales. I have been in sales and sales management for many years (~10) I originally applied online when I seen there was a Sales supervisor position available. The next day I was contacted by the recruiter who started off questioning me about my sales background. I explained at that point that I am interested in being a supervisor and training sales employees as that is what I am known to be great at. Off the bat the recruiter told me that supervisors are hired from within and that they only post on indeed because they have to and that she will turn my resume over to the hiring manager. "
bad,"your body will pay for this job."
bad,"Reserve the right to not comment but if I must, the environment wasn't overly pleasurable and could have been better but great technology and tools to work with."
bad,This place is not a good work environment. There is way too much work that is not automated. Upper management doesn’t listen to the employees below them especially if the employee has been at the company less time than the manager. I understand you have more tenure but that doesn’t not mean you know my day to day job details and what would work best for anyone. This is a corporate environment and the way people dress leaves a bad taste in your mouth. They dress like they are going to a bar after work and it’s 8am Monday morning. Save yourself the time and energy. Work elsewhere!who is doing this job.
bad,The management and supervisors staff was very inconsistent with daily duties and job requirements. There is no ongoing training as promised and terrible customer support
bad,Its a good place to work just not the best place be prepared to get hit on and deal with constant change and pressure its a typical call center just placed into a more business casual format
bad,"Training was long but still missed key information. They say it is a fun place to work, but the fun only seems to be had by the management staff. The systems used to complete orders is confusing for many and crashes frequently. The phone system has many flaws, which is terrible for an inbound call center. Trying to get assistance when problems arise is a chore in itself. It can take anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes to get help; they run away after ""solving"" the first issue but don't stick around to make sure it is the right fix or that it even works. They are very strict on their requirements for job performance and are not afraid to chastise you if you don't meet expectations."
bad,I worked there a year and a half and was let go of because my doctor placed MJ e on medical leave and even though I went through all necessary steps and it was approved they said I missed to many days of work.
bad,How would you like to work for a company that puts you through this. I sold a customer a internet and phone package. The installation took longer than expected and finalized after I left the company. I went back in  a few months later and the owner yelled and screamed at me for all of the problems they have had with Spectrum. We were instructed NOT to get involved with installs but we also had no leverage with the installation technicians who did not get paid for overtime. Only about 45% of our orders got installed for several reasons. Our manager had a severe drug problem and lied to management and denied the reality. All the salespeople I was hired with had quit in less than a year. We had a meeting at 8am and at 5pm daily. They would expect you to be on the call no matter where you were and many times we were in our cars heading to the field to make calls or heading home. Using a cell phone will driving is illegal in most states unless handsfree. Management continually lied to the salesforce. Arguably the most unethical and demanding company I had ever worked for in over 30 years.
bad,"Have never been si disappointed with a job.  Treated like kids, rules change at anytime.  Management not on same page. Great co workers help u get thru the day."
bad,If you have other options ... take them. I would like to find a new position. Management does not care about work/life balance. Also a revolving door because of goals.
bad,Nothing to write about. they have a lot going on at the same time. Some really good and knowledgeable people on my team. Beware of the Job descriptions
bad,"This place do not about the customers nor there employees, they will work you until you become sick the phones are always busy , Managers are scared to speak up"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,The only thing I actually like working at Spectrum is my coworkers and benefits. The management is overbearing and the sales goals unrealistic so you barely ever make sales goal
bad,"Great benefits: "
bad,"Things change constantly."
bad,Little pay for long hours constant yelling at you over the phone by the customers management was terrible never there when they were there just didn’t do anything to help you everyone quitting on a daily basis would never recommend working here
bad,You can work for the company but progression is non existent. They willonly hire you for one job and to move up in the company is almost impossible. Look elsewhere.
bad,"This is just for my area but not much room for movement and having multiple supervisors telling you different ""ways to do it "". They want to make work 1st then family. the job portion is great but being micromanaged every step makes it impossible to do a good professional job."
bad,"Until Spectrum was rumored to buying Bright House, the company ran like most. It had good benefits, people, and policies that had room for improvement but some were not bad."
bad,"The biggest problem with WORKING for this company is the fact they think they have the RIGHT to take over your life and basically if you don’t like it tough....I have always and will always believe a job is simply a necessary EVIL and therefore I work BUT I refuse to let it take over my life, I believe in a set schedule and if the work makes you stay late OCCASIONALLY that’s fine but then expecting you to work 1:30 late several times a week is NOT ACCEPTABLE especially for the amount of money you make. Crawling under houses with snakes and spiders or going into an attic that is 109 degrees for $15/hr  isn’t worth it"
bad,"Worked for this company for five years, 3 of those years as top sales manager in my region.  This company is primarily focused on ""diversity"" hires and projecting a fostering and compassionate work environment.  The pay and benefits are good.  The work / life balance is non existent.  The management team is all talk and fake.  It is a cut-throat company.  Cover your back, and document EVERYTHING as they will throw everything at you at will."
bad,"If it was not for me moving I probably would have stayed. Although by my year mark if I was unable to change departments I would have resigned regardless. The company is going through many changes and they give no slack for the workers. Call volume is high and this usually makes many of the employees leave. You get marked for everything you do transfer rate, call time, customer service, adherence, personal time, I mean I could go on. Your score card dictates if you are able to progress in the company. Keeping my score card at a 4 was almost impossible. Hopefully they change this and the call volume goes down."
bad,"Meetings all day, a very controlled micro manged culture. The hardest part of the job is trying to break away from the 1980's mentality where the everyone is afraid of the CEO or to take risk for fear of making a mistake."
bad,"You'll have complete freedom to choose your own projects, but you will be judged for not picking a project that management wants you to work on, even though management will provide zero guidance when picking your projects."
bad,"company went downhill after they bought out time warner cable, dispatchers are hard to reach. and customer service drops the ball when signing up people for service too often leaving the field techs with a headache of a job and angry customers"
bad,working for a cable company in central Florida was exceptionally toxic however its hard to separate that from working exclusively with men from the southern US.  Environment as exclusive to everyone that was not straight white male.  promotion were even more exclusive.  Racism is rampant and in fact encouraged by field leadership.
bad,lied to from the beginning about how much all my coworkers made. Saying everyone met there goals of 20 sales a month. in a group of 6 sale persons 2 might hit 20 once a year if there was a new build out area. average sales per month with everyone was 11 sales a month if you didnt get 10 sales  you got no commission pay .
bad,Overall a good environment. Training was provided on a regular basis. Long term employees and a clean environment. Recognizes great perform and dedication from their employees.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"The pros of this company are the pay and benefits are good and for a short term job you could not do better.  However if you plan to make a career of this company be warned this company feels very corporate and job performance alone will not allow opportunity for advancement.  You have to play the political game and campaign and brown nose to grow and advance with Spectrum.  Also seniority is just not respected this company is just too corporate and you feel expendable and nothing more than a number / body,  Management was very unprofessional and sexual / vulgar comments were commonplace. I loved the actual work I did for the company and it was satisfying providing excellent customer service however the workplace environment was just extremely toxic and Eventually I became miserable and dreaded going to work everyday.  Overall not a good company to work for.  As I said the actual work can be satisfying and the pay and benefits are awesome however that is the only good thing I can say for Spectrum."
bad,"Culture changed when Charter bought them out. Now you feel like a number. The management isn't professional and have a buddy system. If you run in their crowds then you will have a great work experience. But if you don't, you feel left out and they do nothing to make you feel included"
bad,"I took this job as a cable technician when I was pretty young, and they took the opportunity to severely underpay me. There's a reason they don't want people discussing salaries. I remember when I went to training in LaGrange, this like weird roving band of ""trainers"" came in and tried to act like cable rockstars or something. Just the whole culture of the company felt awkward and scummy I dunno. I have a little perspective now and realize this was not a good company to work for."
bad,This job needs better training and management in order to be successful.  My experience with Time warner cable was you basically would need to solve the problems yourself
bad,"Although the pay is good and benefits are decent, it's just another stressful call center job and not because of it's customers.. First the tools to troubleshoot don't always work. constant issues with equipment that customers have come to hate. It's almost impossible to get a schedule change, yet they don't pay adequately for the shift differential. For me this is a temporary job as I don't see myself very long here. Pointless business dress code makes no sense either. But it's a job for now. Management, please work on a better work/life balance, and get rid of the dress code. Turn over rate will be alot less too."
bad,did not like working for them.  As time went on the management was obviously had favoritism and unwilling to help employees with any work or family issues
bad,"Spectrum started off as a great work place.  However it has become a stressful place to work, with no job security and heavy micro-managing.  I started at this location when it was still Time Warner Cable and sadly the majority of the reasons I took the position were taken away in mere months.  This location gives off the feeling that they would like to clean house to offer new employees a lower commission payout that most long term employees can not live off of.  There is a huge lack of consistency and has become very dreadful place to work."
bad,"When the company was TWC it was SO much better, TWC took care of their employee to the point the employee wanted to do any and everything the company ask but now that specturm bought out TWC  specturm doesnt care about its employee or customer. They find reason for you not to make money. They claim all this earning potential  but make it difficult for you to achieve them. You cant make  any money until you have at least made the company $800 to $ 1000 FIRST! We wear so many hats and our hourly pay is $8.60.  We do get heavily discounted product, thats a plus. Health care sucks!"
bad,Typical day is stressful you can't sell properly because management who never sold a penny is telling how to sell in theory. The hardest part are the shift bids.
bad,"As a telemarketer here, it was really hard. The hours you call between are unrealistic, no wonder people were angry all the time. The company had the telemarketing department in what they called the ""dungeon"" (basically the basement). Sales goals were very unrealistic."
bad,I was there for over 6 years the pay was low and there was no room to advance to another position. Poor management they just cared about themselves and no one else.
bad,"this company is horrible and management does a horrible job with leadership, the commission structure is awful and you only get paid if you hit 75% of your goal and if you don't hit 100% you will get in trouble"
bad,Management needed a lot of improvement. Treat employees daily and not by favoritism. I have seen leads there who have worked there for years and never moved up.
bad,I no longer work for Spectrum. I was laid off due to a reduction in force when Time Warner Cable became Spectrum. I was with Time Warner Cable for nearly 8 years and enjoyed my job working closely with customers in Business and Residential services.
bad,Ever since they bought Brighthouse nobody seems to care anymore. Management doesn't seem to care about their employees. They don't give you time to do your job correctly. Always give you to much work so you are forced to work overtime. Then they will get on you for working overtime and then send out emails saying they need people to work overtime. It's a very unorganized company to work for.
bad,"What the company offered you was great- full benefits and a decent rate. However, some of the supervisors did not care about their work or their employees. They would let them struggle and fail, as long as the rest of his' her team was doing good. There isnt any flexibility to help your teammates or other coworkers because ""it is not your job."" Some associates were okay to wear hats and jeans and sneakers, but others weren't, even though it was against company policy. The favoritism within the floor was immense and quite frustrating."
bad,"For those seeking work straight out of high school with minimal skills, this is a great place to start. Cable , health and 401 k benefits are wonderful. If you are looking for a fast paced environment you have found the right place"
bad,"Over all Spectrum Company have a rapport world wild and offer great products, Its just  in my opinion they don't pay there employees enough. They Have all these high standards and don't live up to them. Poor management due to this."
bad,"Company is too large and has way too many people with far too much time on their hands that allows them to come up with the most ridiculous and unattainable system metrics, percentages and evaluations. FAR TOO MUCH big brother involvement and complete lack of communication within the company. There is such thing as a company being too big and this is it, you are simply an instantly replaceable number to them. You are not a human being. Almost treated as though unless you intend to completely give up a personal life you will not go far."
bad,This place will stress you out and make your hair fall out. They are eliminating jobs left and right looking for any excuse to fire you. Work there if you want low income and a stressful work environment.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Hardest part of the job is not fully being able to help customers. Management is good, but needs work on expectations and metrics for employees. Does not correlate with how call flows actually are. I learneed that only way to actually help customers is to be as honest as you can with them."
bad,You constantly have to cover yourself and worry about what others can cause.  Its a job you can lose by someone else causing the problem. Don't recommend.
bad,The salary is a nice part of the job but half your coworkers will make double what you make because they started with Time Warner Cable. Flexible hours are nice.
bad,I loved helping and serving customers while offering the best services in the industry. 
bad,typical day is having customers rant and yell at representatives and persons who are supposed to answer questions yell at you for asking not being able to find answers and answers not being consistent  very frustrating
bad,"The management tends to be overbearing and applies too much oversight and control in even mundane tasks.  The culture is one of fear and frustration that you're constantly being watched and judged.  Impossible timelines are placed on projects by leadership who have no idea of the scope and/or level of complexity required to deliver requested solutions; hence why most projects never come close to meeting mandated schedules."
bad,"If you're single with no kids and a pet that can survive off of minimal attention - then this is the PERFECT job for you!"
bad,"I worked for Charter Communications prior to Spectrum merger not a bad place to work, Management at the local level was ok but the senior management was often counter productive. but after the Spectrum merger you were just another number."
bad,"The workplace culture with Time Warner Cable was good, as soon as Spectrum took over the work culture went down, the manager lack good management skills, they come across as a company that don't care about their employees and they the training is horrible."
bad,Typical work day would involved picking up my assigned service truck and go out on the field doing service calls. The work included going to people houses or apartments and fixing their cable TV service .
bad,"Time warner Cable was great. Since Spectrum takerover they've take away our former salaries, holidays, and benefits. Basically making us work harder for less and that's a tough pill to swallow"
bad,Micro managed on every level. Problems that are addressed are ignored. Solutions to said problems are laughed at. Not enough time to properly diagnose problems and consult with customer.
bad,"this company pays based on the sales quota set by administration.   weather conditions in Indio, CA was bad (100+ degrees daly!).  Quota kept changing every other week as well as amount of doors knocked and sales made."
bad,"U get hired for billing, brace yourself. Spectrum puts you in a lose-lose situation. Customers rate you from a survey that is next to impossible pass."
bad,"At one point Charter was a great place to work. However, since they bought out TWC, Charter (Spectrum) is now more concerned with running the business based on reports, rather than the needs of the customer or the employees. All levels of management appear to see the problems, but don't take any action to make improvements based on the feedback of the employees."
bad,"The Manager had no clue how to operate a business."
bad,"Company wasn't what I had hoped for. They tell you one thing, but it is completely the opposite. The money isn't good and you're bound to get paid more somewhere else. The Charter/TWC takeover is a joke. The company likes to roll out procedures before they are properly tested and employees are never properly trained. The company is regressing, not progressing when it comes to procedures and culture. I have to question who hired these managers and executives..."
bad,I don't really have anything to say about working there other than that it is strict and corporate and not for someone like me. If its for you go for it.
bad,"Over all P&L duties; however, no support from upper management of the group. Had to downsize several full-time employees. In charge of CSRs ... Installers ... Tech types. Handled all major complaints from local government and customers."
bad,I was inadequately trained and expected to do things I wasn't taught how to do. You are expected to work quickly and if you cant work fast enough you loose money
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"An average day of work consists of assisting callers nationally via inbound calls with troubleshooting tv, digital phone, high speed Internet and billing concerns. The lessons learned span from building rapport with a myriad of personalities and backgrounds to constantly evolving telecommunications function in an average household. Management and workplace culture is what you make it based on maturity level, work experience and personal drive. The hardest part of the job is complacency. If you are ambitious and self motivated but don't see career movement within a year move on. The most enjoyable part is helping someone resolve a problem whether it be a customer, peer or leader."
bad,"When the company change ownership it went down hill......The whole feel of the company changed. I Had health issue and HR was no help, after the fact the would tell you the policy changed. You would get written up, which it would leave  multiple occurrence."
bad,Stressful work environment. Very face pace poor management. Definitely dose not value its work force . The only thing I can say everybody is expendable from management all the way down to the janitor. No one is safe. Spectrum pride themselves on being an at will work environment thats willing to put change salary and positions at the drop of a dime without you knowing. For anyone working there I would encourage them to learn what they can make your money and get out before its to late.
bad,"in 11.5 years at working in the same building, I have only been able to advice in one direction.  I have skills that can take me in other, more beneficial directions.  I feel I have been looked over more times than I want.  I am looking for something more suited to my skills.  It is a stressful environment, lack of drive to make things better, and treatment leads me to want to look for something else."
bad,"Spectrum, from the outside, seems to be a really nice company to work for considering it employs some great people. However, for the kind of work we're doing and the way the company treats it's employees, the pay is terrible. The starting wage should be $15-19/hourly minimum. The upper management is out of touch with what the front line is dealing with and they act as if they're gods looking down on the peasant class when interacting with everyone else. With a absurd dress code and ""no personalizing work spaces"" rule it seems as if they're trying to squash any sort of originality the awesome people who work here bring to the table. Ever since Spectrum bought TWC, the place has crumbled and it's no longer a rewarding work environment. There is no incentive to stay here. The ONLY positive is there are a ton of people currently looking for employment elsewhere so you'll definitely get hired."
bad,The work itself could be daunting and difficult at times.The work hours are long and you never know when you are gonna go home at the end of the day..
bad,"Working in the field enables you to interact with the public,which is quite enjoyable. .Company does not want to negotiate with there union.New company sucks"
bad,"Not bad but the hours and lack of PTO especially on holidays is a deal breaker for me.  "
bad,"While comprised of many talented individuals and groups, the overall strategic focus of the company is not clearly defined. Overall guidance to drive revenue and penetration is overshadowed by a lack of innovation and an inability to cooperate as a single unit. Departmental lines are generally drawn within silos and left to operate autonomously, resulting in nearly constant confusion, pushback and delays when cross-department cooperation is required."
bad,It's good if you want to be micro managed and live in a high stress environment that offers no advancement but decent benefits. It's just not what I had expected in a sales position
bad,Spectrum outsourced it's entire Supply Chain Ops across the company and thousands of employees will/are losing their jobs. Stay Away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,last in line to bring new technology to the market place. tools given to reps are old.  offers to compete with competition is non-existent.  six day mandatory work week.
bad,Managers make it difficult and do not provide the proper equipment to do our jobs efficiently.  They use bogus performance system to write technicians up and eventually terminate them.
bad,"As a Direct Sales Representative, I was assigned 500 random addresses each Month and required to produce a minimum of 10 sales of the most expensive product option available.  Many of the addresses were non-marketable or vacant homes and the Marketing campaign via mail and telephone contacts took potential sales from the addresses that i could not deviate from for any reason.  The company also offered a money back guarantee and removed credit for installed sales who canceled all or some of the services sold, negating the commission for the sales generated, after the fact."
bad,Communication is extremely poor. Even when concerns are escalated and validated there are never any true resolutions. This all may not be true of the entire company but it is of the department I had the opportunity to be in. Pay is not bad - but even with that being a plus most decide to walk.
bad,I actually miss time warner cable. ever since spectrum my store has went down hill. I get along with my co workers but a lot changed in our store that has made me want to leave..
bad,"This company cares nothing for it's customers or employees. It only wants money. The cable service is very poor. The rates for tv, internet and phone are extremely high."
bad,"As an agent in the emergency response call center there wasn't much to look forward to on the job except working with other agents tryings to make a living. "
bad,Upper management cares for bottom line. changed the commission structure to get rid of seasoned sales representative to bring in new labor cheaper. upper management has lost touch with what works in the field. need them to step out of there air conditioned offices and see what the rest of the outside sales rep has to deal with day to day. they care nothing for the reps.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Worse place I have ever seen, Managers push you around if you get a referral which is a way of life in sales you can't have it. If you get bad turf you have to live with it for a month. Very unethical also. Also there is the buddy buddy  system"
bad,"Since merger so many things are going wrong not even with just equipment, the billing structures and employee knowledge and the way sales can say what ever just to get the sale. all i have to say is triple check your sales and technician reps"
bad,"Rigid culture, not very progressive for employees.  Great growth potential and opportunities available to the company.  The structure is likely to undergo some additional changes to the market challenges."
bad,"After the merge between Time Warner Cable, Charter Communications and Brighthouse Networks which created Spectrum, all aspects of the business became uncertain. In my career of almost 15 years, I completely enjoyed all the challenges and successes with Time Warner Cable. The company before the merge was progressive and set the precedents in the cable industry. After the merge, a less than successful company (Charter Communications) acquired Time Warner and Brighthouse, and immediately took the companies a decade back in time. By returning to outdated processes, procedures and technologies. The running joke throughout the Time Warner side of the business was that Spectrum would probably do away with e-mail and go back to inter-office communication; just as an example. I am not bitter; I do want to make that clear, I am a dedicated and loyal company driven person. I loved my career at Time Warner and I am just disappointed to see that the technology that was created, the processes and procedures that were implemented; that were tops in the cable industry, were just done away with as the Charter footprint was adapted. A very disappointing end to an otherwise outstanding, and satisfying career with Time Warner Cable."
bad,"Upon arrival, you have about 25 systems to log into to begin your day.  You are timed when you go to the bathroom.  Several of the applications you support, you do not get trained on them.  Therefore, the customer is frustrated and you are stressed.  "
bad,"So many changes. Keeps your head spinning and off balance. So Cal Directors have agendas that you better be on. Very much a buddy system that pigeonholes you into not knowing who to trust or go to for help. HR does help much and generally only causes more stress. Good job for entry level, but middle management and up is no life balance."
bad,"Call on existing fiber customers to upgrade, renew contract, or sell additional service. Have face to face meetings with owner, decision makers to close business. Continue to follow up and manage accounts in database. Cold call on new business."
bad,The worst thing a supervisor can do is rake over an employee with a customer.  The second worst thing a supervisor can do is not help a customer and tell the first call employee they spent too much time on the problem with the customer's issue.
bad,While company was TWC employees had opportunity to earn incentives by how well their call metrics were for the month. After charter took over there is no longer opportunity to earn decent money even if you perform well.
bad,the company as a whole is a great place to work but management is poor and highly self-serving.  I will say that the best part of the job is being able to work around your schedule.
bad,I don't approve of the direction the company has been headed in.  Inbound sales has always been emotionally draining and stressful.  New company management (charter) has compounded the issue by cutting pay and increasing expected call volume.
bad,I enjoy helping people therefore sales is not for me. I loved my co-workers. It is a very large company so at times getting small needs taken care of could be a real headache.
bad,Time warner was a great company until the merger went through with Charter. time warner was a good company to work for always had incentives and promotions.
bad,Coworkers are great. Not as many resources as needed in a timely fashion. Minimal reimbursement. Sometimes expecations set aren't realistic and don't factor in regular road blocks
bad,good days fast day i like to go to work i learn how to cook the meat and how not to cook it management was good too as long as nothing went wrong co-workers never had a problem with anybody hard part of job was being fast enjoy just there working
bad,"Very challenging work, but it pays off on your paycheck. Not so easy to grow. Not flexible with hours, hard to communicate with anybody above your boss. They bring some good nice food and have wonderful prizes to win."
bad,"Work long hours for customers that would rather see you beaten with a baseball bat than pay their bill. Management will ask everything of you but give you nothing in return, other than more work and back talk. The only thing enjoyable about Charter is the grunts to your left and right that are out in the muck everyday with you. The hardest part of the job is having to enter strangers house alone in the worst part of the city. People sometimes suck."
bad,An every man for himself environment where things like integrity and honesty get in the way of everything management cares about. They micromanaged to the extent it bordered on harrassment
bad,"Training is a short phase. They say you will make a lot of money but you don't.  While your in training your only offered a guarantee pay. This is whats happening since the merge.  You don't get an exact answer as to when you will start making actual money with sales.  Along with the fact that most calls are billing not actual sales. For $11.00 per hour its not worth it. This company has an extreme high turn around. On the  positive note, the trainers are very helpful but you can see they rather do other things then be on the phones.  The main reason I think people are there is for free cable and medical plan, but that too doesn't look so good now."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Time Warner Cable is an interesting company with great benefits. Company includes internal sales and direct sales positions. The Direct Sales position is an interesting work environment that includes flexible work hours, and nice job for those with aggressive sales skills."
bad,"The merger has been a very interesting time for those of us on the legacy TWC side. The culture shock has been pretty staggering. "
bad,"This was a horrible place to work. The metrics were horrible, the company doesn't seem to care about its employees. The pay is low, The company panders to the customer even when the customer is completely in the wrong. The company sets up a culture of a sales dept that does whatever it can to get the sale, including lie to or not fully inform the customer of all information. The billing department is just as bad, call metrics that require you help the customer with billing issues, inform them of a surplus of information all within 5 mins. All the lines the company requires you say takes up at least 3 mins of the call, how is that good customer service. There is a reason the call center in Vancouver cant keep employees and is understaffed, the treatment they received is horrible. I recommend only working here if you are desperate for work until you find a decent job."
bad,I started as a repair agent and once I got to be a Lead there was nowhere else to go. There are occasional supervisor positions that become available for the night shift but that's pretty much it.There is no opportunity for growth.
bad,Company sucks management  sucks  revolving  door for most successful  you will  not like trust  me  no raise  if you're  not making  impossible  metric numbers supervision  watch TV allday  and have terrible  attitudes  dispatch  has attitudes  customers have  attitudes  and you  are supposed  to  maintain  got attitude  place sucks forreal
bad,"By far this is the worst job at BrightHouse. After your probation period, you will get 7.21 a hour plus commission that's if you get any sales. You have to also drive your own car plus provide the gas to drive around going door to door. You will have to be able too work in all types of weather. Be on notice that you will get (charge backs) if a customer cancel within a 105 days. That will be subtracted from your pay check. The most terrible job in the world."
bad,"big corporation with to many rules and regulations, does not look out for the employees. Pay is decent, benefits good, management not so good."
bad,"I knew within my first hour over at Charter (working in their IT PMO) that it was not a quality company. Very high turnover, almost all contractors, overcrowded office without enough desk space for all employees and little to no direction on projects. Basically you're given a binder with some company info and generic PM fundamentals and set loose. You can make some money here but I recommend you get out quickly and move on to greener pastures because Charter is certainly not it!"
bad,co workers are the best but the managment sucks. they dont have your back at all. will throw you to the wolves. will dog you if you are a hard worker
bad,"If you're on the phones,  this is a completely horrific place to work.  You are  metaphorically chained to your desk unless you're on your designated break.  If you have to use the bathroom,  have fun  explaining that to your supervisor,  who will be  watching every second you're not talking to a customer.  "
bad,"A typical day was to field calls and troubleshoot customer problems and resolve."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of answering 45-55 calls on average. In answering these calls I learned how to be very patient in dealing with very irate customers. My co-workers and I tried to make the best of a very stressful job."
bad,"Typical day was trying to sale services, take in payments, issue and receive equipment from/for customer's, answer billing questions, schedule truck rolls for down/out services.  I did learn a lot as far as television and internet technologies go and my co-workers were fantastic (for the most part).  The hardest part of my day was trying to make un-achievable sales goals for the month to customer's who did not want to add more services to their bill as the billing for the services were too high.  The best part of the job was the pleasant co-workers and the customer's."
bad,My experience with Charter was terrible! the sales goals are ridiculous and the management was horrible. the pay was great but the stress of the job on top of the stress from managers not wanting to help made for a stressful life. I would not recommend charter as a workplace especially if you're a csr on the phone.
bad,"I don't want to get into details but I was promised things and denied them. Passed over for promotions and raises although I had exceptional performance and passed all testing. Was required to make the company my life on and off the clock, made to work continuous overtime and then complained at about too much OT. Referred other workers to me by supervisor for technical help but never offered a higher position to make use of my knowledge. Just an overall bad place to work. Overworked and under paid. Benefits aren't bad but you will give your life for them. The techs are the face of the company but paid and treated the worst. They are also known to railroad people out with bogus excuses when termination not fitting."
bad,"They do not work with there employees."
bad,Time Warner limits the income of their sales people. I made over 70k in my first year. After that the management team came to me and said I made to much money and raised my quota 98% and lowered my commission 38%. They do not want to pay more than 52k-55k per year to their sales people and openly told me that. The daily stress and demands of the job don't justify what they pay.
bad,Never get a compliment from above and its always something else they want from you and the pay is no where what it should be for what you have to know.
bad,"·         Handle customer inquiries, complaints, billing questions and payment extensions and service request"
bad,Worst cable company ever they don't even care for the customers . there's issues in there cable system  that cause intermittent  connections and  they know about it but don't wanna fix it. I worked in the business department and there it's even more bad service then the  home service. They lie and make sure u read the contract u don't get wat u pay for.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"The only real great detail about TWC is the benefits.  From health to employee packages."
bad,"time warner is a descent place to work, pay is fair, benefits are desent,management is all about numbers, Don't plan on working hard and going anyware, wont happen."
bad,I did not like Charter Communications. They don't take care of their employees.
bad,A great temporary part-time position for students looking to work flexible off hour shifts.
bad,"The benefits are great but the atmosphere is horrible.  The management team focuses more on scare tactics to get you to do well, rather then appropriately training staff.  It's either get it done or get written up, which leads to being fired.  Since the announcement of the merger to Comcast, the management and directors are a bit paranoid.  With this being sad, they change a lot of the performance requirements in the last year, making it impossible for the staff to keep up.  They are trying to keep a revolving door policy by firing and hiring.  The job is easy and it can be so much better if the management takes the time and give proper training to new changes and have a better policy for achieving better performance.  I would wait until Comcast finishes the buy out Time Warner before applying: this place is not guaranteed employment for the long term at the moment."
bad,Networking. The company sold after doing the best they have ever done profit wise because they got rid of over half of its department. No job security
bad,"Always productive place with things to do. I worked there for 2 years I was a piece Worker. "
bad,I found the job and my manager very number oriented only. Manager had his own agenda to be number at any cost. I would not work there again unless there was a big change in all management.
bad,The company is going through a lot of transition and not very stable.
bad,Mangers are really only about the bottom line. They don't care about employees or their growth. Lacks structure and high turn over rate
bad,"Always on edge because you never know how long youll be working, Hard to balance life and work."
bad,The company stopped thinking about its employees long ago.
bad,"A typical day at work would start off with the call cue at 100+. Dealing with irate customers,issues that could probably be avoided if the person put in the correct information before you. Management that doesnt care about quality of service just focused on sales. One of the worst working experiences"
bad,"if you like getting yelled at then this is the job for you, the people that work there are cool but management is pretty bad there nice people but the skills need work. they really dont care about you at all advancement sucks and your under paid for what you do. they have a bonus system that they keep changing so you dont max out"
bad,Time Warner Cares nothing about it Sales Force they just want Them to sell more and make less. They retain there employees with great benefits nothing else.
bad,"When i first started working there they made it seem like it was a great place to work. I was excited full of life, looking forward to going to my fun new job. (I was in training) the once I got on the phones and had to do some real work I felt like I was working for the devil. You are allowed to use a additional 5 minutes off the phone a week if you have to use the bathroom or whatever you have to do if your a woman that may be a problem. You have to change shifts every 6 months and the are constantly changing the bonus structure to make it harder for employees to get a quarterly bonus. I could go on and on with the cons. If you decide to work there I wish you the best of luck."
bad,Very rude customers and no direction in how to deescalate customer complaints. I learned that a call center is not the right career move for me. Management wasn't very helpful in listening to issues with irate customers. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help solve customer issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a gym to help relieve stress.
bad,Little opportunity for advancement. High stress for low pay. Company cares more about numbers than employees.
bad,The division I worked in is no longer in existence but the management was less than functional.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I'd never work here again, i dont have anything else to say about this company"
bad,"A typical day for inbound sales is to be chained to a desk, timed personal so go the bathroom fast, constant monitoring and forced to rip people off. If you can sell your grandma full price cable instead of"
bad,"When I first started working here, I loved the work and the commission. It seem like the longest I have been with this company it started to go downhill...New director, getting rid all of the old employees, lowering pay, changing commission. I would not definitely refer anyone to go back to this company."
bad,"This was a great company to work for when i started, we had Christmas parties, Summer picinics,incentives ..etc... now everything is gone, because they just don't care about the employees anymore, nor about the customers....how many times i have heard from customers how rude our collections department employees were to them...that they cannot get through to us on the phone, hold times are typically 60 minutes or more....i have been unhappy for some time now."
bad,"TWC doesn't really value their employees. Everything is based on numbers and it doesn't matter how you get them. Employees are horribly under-trained. Departments don't know the policies of the other but will tell them whatever just to get them off of the phone. Have a friend that was on the phone for 4+ hours dealing with a screw up after someone stated she could put individual services on seasonal disconnect. You can't. She was transferred 6 different times and after texting me (after I was fired because of medical reasons), I told her she wasn't able to do what she was looking for. I told her to ask for credit to make up for some of the difference and the hassle. She was offered a $10 credit. They don't work to improve their employees because TWC is pretty much a monopoly. When a customer leaves, it's just a drop missing from a bucket. It'll get filled. As long as you sell, you'll be fine. They don't care if you lie, don't disclose all information, etc. If you have integrity, this isn't the best company to work for as the policies breed dishonest practices. Also, your job lies HEAVILY on the immediate supervisor you have. I've had some great ones and they made it worth it. But certain managers have bad reputations but since the company is heavily based on favoritism, regular employees are expendable. Revolving door employment. Out of a training class of 22, only 3 were left when I left... and that was only after a year. Other than that, the extremely discounted services are nice... when they work."
bad,"Company doesn't care about it's employees, will out right lie to discharge them. Keeps everyone woried about their jobs. Stressful place to work."
bad,This place has issues. Locally they have a high turnover and talk the talk to get the turnover rate down yet after I left this company the turnover rate has not gone down and because they are constatnly hiring people.
bad,"I am a dispatcher with this company. I work here because right now jobs are tight. I was very disappointed with the wages, when i accepted the position, i was led to believe raises would be more generous. But, after a year and a half, I recieved a whopping quarter. It got worse the next year. This is a company that could really use a union. When people quit, they ususally don't give notice, and I have not worked for a company before where my co-workers seem unhappy all the time. The plus side, is that my manager never leaves her office , so I don't ever see her. If I do something wrong, occasionally she will send me an email, but never face to face. Very poorly run company. I hope to leave soon."
bad,"Great place to gain a few skills, but don't attempt to stay long or take any initiative without having your hand slapped. Lacks any real feeling of enpowerment. No opportunities for advancement whatsoever. Review process is poor, lack any kind of insight to what has been accomplished over entire year, while only focussing on few uneducated notes. Do not expect to hear any positive comments during a normal workday. Lack of any real strategy. There are a few directors who will remind you quickly who you are and what their title is. No consideration to background or merits. Very little communication for day to day sales and operations. Don't expect any major pay raises. The employees who do well are those that know how to brown nose. Morale is very low, especially in operations, billing, and administration."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of answering phones and working with customers who want to install/deactivate cable,internet and phone services, having issues with service and or want to upgrade service. It is a fast paced environment that consists of customer service and sales. Selling to irate customers is the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable is when a really nice customer calls in and you can build a nice report with them. My co-workers and managment pretty much stay to themselves. The one thing i have learned or should i say enhanced is my customer service skills."
bad,Benefits are outstanding.
bad,"Small office setting is good. Management keeps everyone on pins and needles though. Employees concerns for family issues and needing time off for these issues are frowned upon. Company lacks consistency of expectations. Love working on the computer doing the day to day task that are the job itself. Working for the public is a challenge and can be threatening to the environment at times. Posibilities for advancement do not exists and salary has room for improvement. Overall, I liked working at Charter but management needs improvement."
bad,Charter Communications provides performance based yearly raises and great benefits however the company is constantly changing policies and procedures and is a revolving door.
bad,"When i starter working for twc 9years ago i thought i have a career but time passed by and i realized they promote and keep thoses people who don't like to work and have no talent but to BE the managers, supervisors pet.VERY SAD.....In twc you learn alot specially how to treat the public, but sad to say managers don't care about customers, all they care about is sales, sales, sales, and abusing of their title to do things they shouldn't be doing. to move up in this company sad to said but they have to really like you, you habe to put up with all their nonsense. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE, ONLY GOOD ABOUT WORKING FOR TWC I MET MY HUSBAND."
bad,Company does not reward good workers. Raises are not very good. Company is more about kissing up to the boss if you want to advance.
bad,The benefits are amazing but the expectations are astronomical as a sales specialist.  Spectrum policy is the way of life with the company its their way only or no way
bad,the will fire you before they loose a customer if a customer complain the believe the customer and will make it right with them and replace you I gave the company almost 2 1/2 years and I was told from previous employees that’ they were that way but I had to find out the hard way that they were telling the truth beware!!
bad,"The pay is low for the abundance of work they throw at you on an average day. You could be responsible for routing 100 + techs, taking incoming calls from 5,000 + techs and taking incoming calls from customers. Raises , if any, are extremely low. When the company drops a bombshell of more work or a new untested program on you they tend to purchase lunch or advertise free food to get it to wash over in hopes you'll turn a blind eye. They mandate 3 holidays a year instead of doing it based off of seniority. If you have a family that includes children, they are not flexible with a schedule. The schedules mimic the technicians in the field and range from 8am to 11pm. They rarely do shift bids and when they do they basically draw a name out of a hat."
bad,Spectrum is not the beat place to work. very high turn over with management and employees. No opportunity for advancement. It is a high school environment.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Ok if you not in sales. From what I know sales pays but if you don’t meet certain numbers they will fire you right away. Billing department or tech support was terrible. Not appreciative of its employees and problematic when changed from time warner to spectrum.
bad,They pay you $550 base pay every two weeks and expect you to work 7 days a week and you're not allowed to sell two people who who wants Spectrum Services you are only allowed to sale to homes that are assigned  to your neighborhoods so you lose out on opportunity making more money
bad,"I wouldn't.  It's a Kafkaesque dystopian nightmare.  Broke an ankle during my first 6 months and was let got for missing 3 days (1 in the hospital)."
bad,"When you apply, forget supervisors that have your back. If anything happens to the supervisor he throws the team under the bus and this why people quit. Also they would be better off with work at home because they are not flexible with time and work/life doesn't exist if you run out of time before Jan of the next year. The job is stressful enough without the dictators(sups) that run rampant through the company."
bad,Increased work load at the expense of quality of work.  Under paid and under valued as an employee.  Poor job routing and not enough time allotted for jobs.  Techs are perpetually behind.
bad,At this point in time Spectrum has few values and/or positive traits. It seems like company profit is and has been the main focus since rebranding from Charter Comm.
bad,"Old School ""entitlement attitude"", Do and say anything to keep Sr. Leadership bonus' rolling in...,    Backstabbing, petty, inexperience team that would sell there Mother's to get ahead.    "
bad,"If you enjoy dealing with ridiculously frustrated people for 8 hours straight about the same issues months on end, spectrum customer service is for you. Like most call centers, there's food, coffee and ping pong/pool. Promotions and moving up is promised, don't believe the hype/lies."
bad,A typical day at work was getting on the phone and taking one call after another without a break until you break. I learned that the internet and phone customers like to yell and curse you are when you are not the one causing the problem. It was fun when they had the availability for us to put up things in our cubicle and had special events going on.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to help the customer with the problem and having to tell them you would have to send a tech and the tech would not be able to get there for a few days. What I learned was how to help the customers with their internet and phone problems over the phone and get them back up and running more time than having to send a tech out.
bad,Easy work made stressful by unnecessary policies you do not want to work in an environment where you feel unappreciated and undervalued I would never work here again
bad,"I worked for Time Warner and when Spectrum took over, the culture immediately changed for the worse. The management does not care about the employees, their only concern is a number for wall street. You have almost no autonomy and you are micro-managed. "
bad,"I was more of a Time Warner Cable employee than for Spectrum but for the time I was working for Spectrum I can honestly say, it's a different company altogether. Unfortunately, I didn't have too much time there to really write a review. At the time of my departure, Spectrum was still getting their ""processes"" together."
bad,"I was not happy with my on-boarding at all. My trainer was leaving at the end of the month and let all the new hires know she was looking at the exit door. My on site manager gave me faulty equipment and told me that it would be handled, but 3 weeks on the job and still no soltion. I was sent into a territory of vacation homes so there were not many potential customers to sell to. My supervisor gave me great support and confirmed that my territory should have been researched better. My manager was fired not too long after I left the company."
bad,I enjoyed what I was doing for spectrum but my supervisor didn't like me at all.  He made every work day a very bad day as soon as I would walk in and he didn't listen to me when I had questions.
bad,If you need good money and don’t care about getting over on people then this is the pace for you. You can make a it of money working here. The job can become very stressful.
bad,"Looking to be stressed out to the max daily, while still being responsible for strenuous physical labor and calculating equations in your head. APPLY WITHIN"
bad,"they do not care about their employees at all, they make it very clear you’re not a valuable asset and can easily be replaced, their benefits are good"
bad,"Management does not care about you as a person. You are nothing but a number and way for THEM to meet THEIR goals so they get paid. Benefits and free services are awesome, but working 60+ hours a week is not. I was a floater and traveled 256 days out of the year in 2018. I made okay money, but you are NOT appreciated at all. I gave my everything to that company. Nothing was even done for my 1 year anniversary, my manager didn't care even though I was a top sales person in the region. They just care about numbers and sales. You are not even allowed to show compassion or be honest to the customers. You're pretty much treated as nasty as the company treats their customers."
bad,"Overloaded and overwhelming "
bad,"Big company politics Big company culture. Technology is behind the curve. Regional managers at the best are poorly trained. Reginal Vp is old school and treats others with limited support.  Company has an extreme turn over and continues to eliminate more and more positions. Crummy treatment. A lot of change happening and a lot of layoffs.  Spectrum Reach has eliminated hundreds of people in the last two years and most likely will continue. By not changing the culture in the mid-north division they continue to not make money and lose more and more staff.  The culture is bad under the MN, WI, and MI area. The long term upper management does not follow the current company policies and make their own policies."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Upper management had no experience how to handle employees.  Very Poor in passing information to you. Expected to learn new things by reading e-learnings that are not clear.
bad,The Company does not care about its employees only about a dollar its not a fun place to work for they took away  all things from employees and the customer
bad,This company on paper looks great. However my experience working there was horrible. I was thrown into the wolves way too fast. I had little training and the training I did receive was bland.
bad,"Worked for the call center environment and left once position was eliminated and offered a different position. The call center environment is not for everyone so do your due diligence to learn what it entails and what a typical work day, week is like. Some trainees leave shortly after training when they realize they are not cut out for this type of environment."
bad,"Typically, a work day would be dealing with non-stop calls from customers upset about bill increases. Classes were specifically taught about not escalating to management and them not being able to do anything."
bad,Bad place to work. No quality leadership or mentoring. Constant stress. Goals are unrealistic to achieve. Almost 2 decades in the cable sales industry and it has never been worse!
bad,warehouse jobs and drive to pick up materials or deliver to other company stores also return what didnt work also give the comtumers there parts they will go put cable i will give them what they need everymorning i would stovk and restock parts where they belong
bad,I dont have anything to say other than the job is stressful for the pay.  The company really doesn't care much about the employees. The Manager I had was a good guy.
bad,"Routing is in need of improvement, management fails to provide resources necessary for to be productive on your shift.  Supervisor feedback is on a reaction only basis."
bad,Spectrum does not care about their employees or their families.  Having people up root their families to a new location and then having them move right back to the same office less than 6 months later.
bad,"The usual call-center environment, stressful, competitive, overwhelming. poor management, verbally and emotionally abusive. no concern for family or health issues."
bad,Management is unstructured. No  advancement opportunities especially if you do a good job. They block you from moving to other roles. Expected to work 50 plus hours a week.
bad,Daily door to door solicitation by going to customers home from the provided leads in your territory. You’re expected to sale a certain amount every month to get paid your commission. If the number isn’t achieved you don’t get paid.
bad,"Log in to take incoming sales calls. No chance for any time off the phone, stay available all day long. No chance to learn new material, management is sometimes available"
bad,Senior leadership is only focused on sales numbers with very little focus on the overall customer experience. It's a very clique culture where friends advance and others do the work. Would not recommend working in a Spectrum retail store.
bad,The hours are horrible. They lie and say you'll have a chance to change shifts but that all depends on your numbers so they best way to get a good work life balance is to quit.
bad,"The only good thing about Spectrum is the benefits and wages.  We had no assigned seats, so at times we had to sit at a station that was new to our logins - this forced us to arrive early and have our tools pulled up in order to clock in - working off the clock"
bad,A retail environment focused on the retention of business was complex. It was a means to an end to complete my education in an unrelated field and profession.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Pay is good at expense of health and happiness.  Co needs to treat employees like customers.  They continually do business with customers with charged off or bad debt accounts letting that customer reopen accounts under their and all their friends leading to a very bad business model.
bad,great place to learn changes are made daily as to what is required for the code depending on what area you are working. You can make some decent money in exchange for all of your time.
bad,Stressful Job at times constant changing from company usually the change  makes job harder as far as field technician goes.  I do like that your on your own
bad,"They lie to dayum much at this company, no one has your back. They lie and say we are family, however they assume things and never get the full truth before making a life altering decision. Do not work for this company and yes the are racially bias even though they will always deny it. I am currently suing them."
bad,"A lack of training and support from the company as a whole."
bad,"The company is more about image than training properly, two weeks of training and little to no side by side, remembering what they crammed in little time was horrible, the instructors said, "" by the time you hit the floor you won't remember anything you learned"". That was 100% true, then they give a 4 day training class to move up and expect you to remember facts and relay to the customer. Oh and they pick favorites, I had a supervisor hit my car in the parking lot and was hidden by the other supervisors, they allowed the individual to switch their hours of work to not get in troubled with police, it was a terrible move by the company."
bad,"I complete trouble calls, reduce repeat trouble calls, and support other technicians"
bad,"Promotions within the company are based on the buddy system. The sales department is stressful with trying to meet numbers and pressure to sales unwanted products. Sales Support department pushes online sales and rescheduling of job orders that have been missed by techs or have an unwanted upgrade. The dispatch department has no consistent structure on how to do the job. Each sup dictates how an area is run and no sips run an area the same. Few shift changes which are good if you like the schedule you get. The managers run the department unfairly, treating those who are their friends with special privileges others can't have. Management lacks control and doesn't run the department based on ethics but favoritism."
bad,"Training was good, options for shift work not so good, hardest part of the job was having to not go to the bathroom except on breaks, nobody can schedule when you have to go to the bathroom, enjoyed having luncheons. Management that I had contact with were great. Rotating shifts should be offered so everyone will not have to work every weekend."
bad,It used to be a great company to work for but it seems they just wanted to accomplish #1 position in the market after which they dont seems to value the marketing/sales force much.
bad,"However, the goals are not easy to complete if you are in a territory where the service is and has been substandard customers are not open to a sale.  this happened to me for 2 months and this was not good for my career."
bad,a typical day of work:  scare and under pressure.i learned to be scared at work.management needed to learned more from the employee if they do not have the experience.the work culture was great.
bad,Charter ways of life have been forced down legacy employees and so many have lost their jobs due to the lack of being able to move to where the company wanted them to. The company has lost Millions of hours of experience due to the removal of those employees and replaced with people that have experience but not in the companies sector which has place many projects and initiatives behind schedule or failed completely.
bad,"would be nice for more improvement in advance career opportunities and dress down work attire due to no onsite customers."
bad,"Difficult, lack of Management support and knowledge. Pressure, no account assignment planning for Employees. Negative Customer experiences addressed. Lack of caring."
bad,"All of us feet on the street agree that Charter Communications is a terrible company.  Before they came in there was an amazing culture at Time Warner.  Here's why not one person in my office was happy and the employee turnover was approx 3 months  "
bad,"It gives no job security because if you don't meet your numbers you get fired, even if your really trying to they don't care. They still write you up. I worked there for 6 years and they were the most stressful time of my life and my health deteriorated. I left the place with problems"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"needs to be more understanding in the work they get, everyone doing their jobs and knowing what is needed to be done to get jobs done in a timely fashion."
bad,"The lower lev supervisors are great, the higher lev people have lost touch with reality. They insist that you follow a set of rules but don't apply it to all of the call centers."
bad,Before spectrum it was Time warner cable. I loved working there when it was time warner. once it became spectrum the company focused more on money then appreciating its employees and customers
bad,"Management and HR were the worst. I'm pretty sure most of their policies & procedures are illegal. Calling in sick or needing time off was nearly impossible. The level of micromanaging was insane, and nobody was really appreciated."
bad,Might be an ok place to work if they fixed the hours. They need to think about people with kids. Because you leave at 6am an never know when you are going to go home could be 4 pm or 10pm.
bad,Management does not care about employees. They make critical changes without consulting those that will be affected. Policies and procedures change daily but are never communicated. Used to be a fun place to work before Charter took over.
bad,Been on Strike since March 28th of 2017 due to Unfair Labor Practices.The company has not engaged in good faith bargaining or negotiations in the last 5 months
bad,Being a call center job it fallows many of the common rule VERY strict time management and tough to get a daytime shift.  Since you are customer services many of the working time slots are evening and weekend. The pay is not competitive at all but the benefits are actually really good. Local management was great but corporate management has no idea what is going on and puts out very blanket changes without looking at the consequence's.
bad,"They tell you 100k is attainable and others are getting it.  NOT TRUE. Much more likely to get 30k until they find a way to let you go.  Only one person is hitting that level, everyone else struggles as do the direct supervisors.  Revolving door of sales people and supervisors.  They will hire anyone interested in the position because they are always having to refill the positions.  During the six months I have been there, they have gone through about 30-40 sales people, 3 supervisors, 1 department manager.  People that had been there before me, told me it was about the same for them."
bad,With the selling of Brighthouse the company changed its whole outlook on taking care of their employees. They would treat you like a number and not care if you left the company or not.
bad,"Its very simple to describe. When the company merged right away all commission for most positions.We had alot of job responsibilties already and they kept wanting more,and more for less. The management that was brought in was simply stated horrible, and very unethical."
bad,"This job was based on keeping customers with services such as TV, Internet and phone. Be prepared to get yelled at by customers and supervisors because your staying on the phone with the customer too long to assist the correct way. They changed policies weekly about who take what calls and how they are handled."
bad,Spectrum has a very high turn over rate they do not keep employees long term and they don't usually promote from with in. It seems that all the employees are under pressure.
bad,Spectrum is a fast paced environment with great benefits and endless opportunities for advancement. My department was recently shut down so I am exhausting all options in and out the company.
bad,"The management is atrocious! The place has had high turnover ever since roles were changed in TCC. Not a supportive or fun environment. Low pay. No incentives at all. No longer have work at home option for top performers. No holidays off. Open 365 days. No commission on upgrades, no designated seat for agents (be prepared for germs and getting sick...and searching for a new desk every single day), business dress …"
bad,Spectrum is a company built on fear as a motivator rather than a culture. High demand to improve yet no one qualified to teach will help. Your on your own...Lie to your customers if you want to succeed here.
bad,has bad hours and a lound work environment spectrum managers does not like to help when needed their is not enough floor support while working if you need help.  the train needs to improve
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Environment was fun and fast paced, very competitive. Became Corporate warehouse. Great employees, lack of direction throughout all levels of managment"
bad,"Leadership believes its 1993 and that if they say so, its technically possible to achieve in the time allotted without consulting the SMEs.  Good pay, but burn out, high churn, low experience environment."
bad,Time Warner was very hard to sell into a market becuase tthere network was not built out. Very limited area that you could really sell into. Most of the time the business could not afford to sell into a network for build reasons.
bad,"the job was messed up from the beginning from the merger with time warner the culture changed, management dint care about employees and the bottom line was the stock price tat was the driving factor of ALL decisions."
bad,it is a long exhausting days the management some are helpful but some are very vengeful the culture is like high school gossipy and spiteful benefits are great if you have true health problems you will be penalized for them it will also control career advancement and job scheduling if you are a single parent this is not a good career choice you will definitely sacrifice time with them
bad,"Company operates like a local mom and pop and treats most employees with scrutiny. Micromanagement, fear and control at the top are the norms and poor leaders push that philosophy down. No visions or 3-year, 5-year plans which is why the company is playing catch up on the product side.  A top down led company with people at top often making decisions way below pay grade or outside their skillset/expertise. Many employees are quite talented, hard-working and smart individuals. Investments in good technology for the employees is nice to see. There are isolated pockets of good leaders. Ensure you are in a group with solid leadership that goes up a few rungs."
bad,very stressful place to work need to meet standards even if they are not your fault your still responsible. always giving you more work duties but no pay.  bad communication between management and corporate no communication between departments
bad,"low base/hourly pay, but potential for decent commissions (when it was TWC)."
bad,Too much personal vehicle driving. A regular agent drives 150 miles on their POV each day. & days a week with no reimbursement. Contravt kept being reduced to provise less money for agents.
bad,"I wouldn't really recommend working for them. I don't have time to fill this out. You need a job, they will probably hire you. Some jobs are good some are not. Do not do sales with them."
bad,"The atmosphere was toxic at times, Other than a select few mostly the people in charge where out for themselves. My experience there was bitter sweet."
bad,I am not here to talk about my previous employer i think that this end of the application to is dumb and has nothing to do with charter communications
bad,Customer Service was an okay place to work but is now handled out of another state. The calls were back to back every single day. There were lots of measurements to make sure you are performing.
bad,Management didn't care that my people were overworked just demanded more. We were short on people but executive managers refused to get more people or make moves to keep remote people.
bad,"I hated working here, the job itself was stressful, and management was not alright. My hours were split up between morning and night, so I would work 4 hours in the morning and 4 at night. They didn't care how sick you were or even if you came in with a dr note, unless you'd basically been shot, you'd better be there or you'd be written up."
bad,Very stressful.  The management team did not communicate well.  Compensation was fair and the benefits were really good.  There were a lot of stressful things about this position.
bad,"Things have changed with not a lot of opportunity, they cut a lot of departments out and forced those wishing to stay to pull  a route of visiting 5 to 8 homes and businesses a day. Great learning experience, but after no advancement options time to move on."
bad,"Unorganized and lack of good Management, the culture there is low par and employee could care less if they did a good job. Not much positive on this company."
bad,"Worked here when it was Time Warner and was able to grow and move up, now that it is Charter I have been laid off with no opportunity for advancement in NY."
bad,If you plan on being a cave guy the rest of your life apply here.  They want you to take their online classes that only benefit this type of work if you plan on doing anything else don't work here.  Managers and supervisors here don't care about you as a person they only care about your productivity you're only a cog in the machine.  Work here is inconsistent the dispatchers drop jobs on you while you're not even halfway done giving you no time to catch your breath you can be doing an install that will take you 3 hours but they expect you to finish in an hour or less while putting more jobs on your route.  Sometimes you wait half an hour to an hour to even get a job and guess what that is impacting your scorecard you are to meet 110 pts a day but with no work you can't reach it and it only makes you look bad.  If you like to be stressed out constantly while risking your life on poles for $14 hour then this is the job for you.  If you like a stressful work environment where all you are is a robot then this is the job for you.  If you like to be lied to by your supervisor caring about you but I  fact us only looking out for himself this is the job for you.  I wouldn't recommend this job to none unless cable is what you want to do and love to do if you want this job to fill in while you study or look for something else don't even bother you will be miserable.  You work 4 10 your shifts days can be long but 3 days off is nice.  You take your van home and you get free cable that's the only good thing about it.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,They had become a micro managing company and took the power to make decisions away from the employees.  They wanted everyone where they could watch them everyday and did not want them to make any decisions without letting them know.  why hire someone if you are going to micro manage them.  Do the job yourself.
bad,"Training programs changed several times while i was employed there, employees were pressured to work overtime and on days off, no support from management."
bad,Spectrum Direct sales is a good job but not a career and the leader ship is not consistent.It is not the worst place to work but that is about all I can say.
bad,Like all communications companies it based on your numbers and nothing else.  If you are a producer you will succeed and if your numbers are low they typically weed you out.
bad,"Took the job based upon a Monday-Friday schedule.  It turned out that was only for training and when I was put on a schedule it was Wednesday-Saturday.  My hourly was supposed to be 8:00-6:00, however, I was usually not off until 8 PM or later.  I was told that I was supposed to be responsible for a job every two hours, however, even when I ended up averaging over eight jobs per day, I would still end up with extra jobs added onto my schedule.  They added jobs to everyone's schedule until all the jobs in the pool were done, even when other technicians had only completed three jobs per day and were not pulling their weight."
bad,"a Typical day as a case manager is fast paced in a community that is sick mentally and physically. The hardest part of the job is helping with continuum of care - there just isn't enough beds available in aftercare programs. The best part of the job is when you are able to help somebody succeed in their recovery or at least plant a seed of recovery."
bad,"Was a great place to work until, we got understaffed and new policies starting coming in. Advancement opportunities are very limited. Was great before merger."
bad,"Some departments are very political, and there is a lot of infighting for a position instead of completing useful work. All projects are moving at glacial pace."
bad,"Loved working with customers however did not like the lack of support from leadership. Their business rules caused customers to be even more irate because the company is money focused not customer focused. Those rules made it extremely difficult to save customers and the metrics they want you to meet are unrealistic. The company was better as Time Warner Cable, now with Charter they've gone downhill. If you ever get sick or have a family emergency make sure you get excuses because there are more who don't understand that the job does not come first."
bad,"Working at Spectrum is leaves you to be your own resource of information. There are entirely too many hands in the pot, so much that no one really know who does what, and that can be very frustrating, so I honestly empathize with the customers who are just needing a simple install or question answered."
bad,Very unorganized assignments are not being followed so this may the call volume sky high because people that should be on the phones are doing nothing. Management stays in the office until it's time to go home. We have no floor support unless so rely on each other (dispatchers) Can never go home on time I mean occasionally is ok but all the time. Especially if that 15 minutes matter because your ETA home is 1 hour 15 mins instead of 37 mins.
bad,"Passive aggressive, and everything is a fire drill.  Needs to be more clarity to the direction of the technical pieces and less of ""you should know this by now""...."
bad,"If it wasn't for the supervisor I had, it would've been dreadful staying there. Management are not very good at what they're doing. Left because it was too stressful and the environment was like a highschool and childish, with a lot of drama."
bad,"highly stressful with the customers cursing you and mgmt not being behind you, the management and the upper management do not care about your health nor your working conditions as long as you  meet the quotas of calls in the amount of time given for 8 minutes per call and no callbacks by the same person within a week,"
bad,"	Developed policies and procedures for remote access to user computers.  This enabled us to resolve software issues without having to travel, which improved our efficiency.  "
bad,It had some good points. Just wasn't my scene. Advancement changed when Spectrum took over. To much devoted to everything other than employees. Its ok for a first job.
bad,"I never worked for spectrum, I worked for Charter, then Suddenlink, but this won't let me move on until I write a review with actual sentences and wording."
bad,I have worked in the customer service industry for as long as I can remember. Time Warner in Cleveland Oh was all about the numbers and not about the customers. Coming from Time Warner in Jackson Ms was very different. They actually cared about the customer. I loved working for Time Warner in Jackson Ms.
bad,NO room for advancement. Got stuck in 'the black hole' with no hope of getting out. Once you are within a certain area it is hard to move out. Horrible shifts for single mothers. No real incentives and the work life culture was terrible
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"you go to work, get screamed at by customers, management tells you to deal with it. then you go home. then you wake up the next day to start it all over again."
bad,"VERY high pressure sales may suit some people however, with all the constant changing requirements goals (lowering average call time) and write up for minor infractions such as going over lunch/break by 1 minute (literally-no exasperation), it doesn’t work for time.  Even though, there’re some wonderful Supervisors and Managers, I felt I was a number and expendable.  Keep in mind, there must be a reason why there’re constantly hiring.  They have a culture of weeding out people."
bad,You better have sales in your veins. Overly competitive atmosphere. Barely have time to breathe. I regret working here completely. Sales is not for me.
bad,"Charter Spectrum is an all boys club, I never witnessed any minority in upper level management.  For people of color, you'll be stagnant at your position, and your rise is still at a supervisory or low level management."
bad,I had 4+ weeks of paid time off accrued over the 13+ years at Charter.  It was next to impossible to get a straight answer about whether I could use any of it.  You can't book a vacation and get an answer of yes or no the day your flight leaves.  It doesn't help to ask 6 months in advance.  After the hedge fund guys bought the company it went to hades.
bad,During my time here the cable industry was changing literally overnight with mergers and buy outs so no job security or career growth at that time. Poor management in a lot of areas.
bad,"back to back calls mostly complaints"
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is people.  I love people!  I love assisting my customers and coworkers.  My only issue is that people cuss at us and we are not allowed to let them know that we are here to help them but that their language usage is not ok.  Customer service is a wonderful industry and I love it but human standards need apply.
bad,"Customer Sales and Service Representative, October 1998-November 2011"
bad,A typical day was answering calls and solving customer issue. Also required to sell products and services. Management gave plenty of feedback on employee performance and skills.
bad,I worked here for just under a year for the center that handled Charter. Im supprised they didnt have something filed with the BBB they treat their customer terribly.
bad,"I started working there 02/17, hourly wages are low but you can make commission, however, 3 months into the job they phased out my position and we have to take a less paying posiiton or laid off."
bad,"I hate to be too hard on the management  that was directly over me because I know they are only following their bosses orders. I made very good money for a service tech at Spectrum Business but it came at a price of being very stressful. We had support BUT..... not very supportive. Put it like this, everything looks good on paper and through a managers eyes but it was a very hateful environment. The best thing I can say about working there is I had some very nice and decent Co workers. I retired earlier than I wanted to and because I could afford to do so. Sometimes making decent money is just not worth it for your health and well being. I am very thankful that I could leave and I will never look back. I am not saying this to get back at the company, they really could care less. If you get hired in the Tampa area in a field tech position, you will find out what I am talking about."
bad,one of the few perks is that they offered employees free cable. Management only cared about quotas and made it very uncomfortable if you had your own opinion.
bad,The transition from TWC to Charter is a declining one.  The commercials tell customers what is being done to improve when the truth is the leadership is dismantling a good company (TWC) down to  the Charter level.  The senior leadership does not review best practices but prefers to use antiquated methods thus killing a working culture.
bad,Smaller company (charter) taking over larger company (time warner cable) has proven to be difficult challange for charter and has impacted the progress in technology that twc was striving for
bad,"never used this service before, so I do not have much to say.  I am just trying to figure out this system, do what I need to do and to go on.  Just trying to find a job"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Great benefits. Very limited to growth or advancement. Management styles  vary and there is very little consistency. If you know the right people in the right places that would be your only chance at advancing. It is not performance base advancement but you are paid commission base on your overall performance.
bad,Since Charter acquired Time Warner Cable it has been an interesting change. A lot of our top agents and management have left Spectrum for a few reasons. We have all seen a very large change in pay as well as consistency with our schedules. Also our benefits have increased in price as well
bad,"Training did not represent what is to be done as a direct sales rep, In the position you will be working 6 days a week,The supervisor try get you to work 7 days, You work from 10 or 11 in the morning until 8 at night and at time longer,They tell you to get in the home to make the sale, They do not teach any safety precautions, you are actually working the street in the complete dark knocking on doors, Going to the same doors for 30 days straight, After your probation you are making nothing if you do no sell Some supervisor give tips and go out with the employees in the field and others don't"
bad,"Great job ok benefits minimum pay raises not enough fair manager"
bad,I feel like there is a great deal of change in schedule and employees constantly that made it hard with family life at the beginning of employment. There wasn't much room for advancement.
bad,Great company before the merger with Charter. Things have gone down hill quickly. Corporate leadership has no idea what is going on in the field. They just send down task and hide.
bad,"I worked for TWC for 2 years. Once we merged with Charter, everything that was cool and fun about working for TWC disappeared. I would of rated TWC 5 star workplace back then. But only two stars for Spectrum."
bad,"I know they tried but because of the business of the office, management was limited and not in tune to employees. Training was minimum and insufficient."
bad,"Customer service work, i speak with customer daily explaining the policies and procedures of the company. Walk customers through troubleshooting steps and explain the billing process."
bad,I took calls from agents that had escalations and also assisted the agents in taking the sup calls. Also I was assisting the new hire classes with learning the system and learning with the R-3 process.
bad,I enjoyed working at TWC when I did. I enjoyed certain groups of people that I worked best with. Management changed a lot so I was never able to get comfortable with anyone enough to describe a better example.
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone who is attempting to move up within a company. This company is a great stepping stone for a young adult but there is no long term benefits with staying in the company. The turn over rate is horrible.
bad,You have to be able to sit at your desk for 8 hours a day. Taking in more then 20 calls a day. You have to be very patient and handle people being harsh.
bad,Worked with some great people but upper management was horrible. Working 55-60 hours a week for not much money. work till 8pm start day at 9am. constant turn over of reps
bad,"Worst job I have ever worked. Raises are low, you can advance but pay still low. Insurance is good. Medical and prescription insurance good. Environment and management is not good. Turnover rate is huge."
bad,"a typical day at work can be very stressful. sometimes dispatchers are hard to communicate with, most of the foreman are hard to reach when needed. the job has a lot of headaches no one should have to deal with but nevertheless the experience has grown my knowledge"
bad,"Charter Communications employment SUCKS, they DO NOT accommodate with your personal life, NO SCHOOL/CHIDCARE. But they will force you to sign up for OVERTIME/ the supervisors don't care for you! They will tell you to come to them for anything and when you show them actual proof they still don't accept it. Your answering about 60 calls on a good day and on a bad day about 80 and they have this one stat where the customer grade your performance but if the customers are not happy with your services they will purposely give you a bad grade and it's still counted for. THEIR trainers are VERY UNPROFESSIONAL and they don't even care when you escalate it to HR. Just think twice about applying, I left them because it was just to much!"
bad,Fun place a lot of money and oppurtunity not too understanding and felt targeted. Many different thoughts. Feel like they could have been a little better with life issues
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Very unethical sales preactices. I have a coworker who has stolen my sales and also steals the sales of other coworkers. The name of the game is to exceed quota at all cost. I wouldn't charter as a good place to work. The HR department is non existing. Company cut the sales commissions for direct sales with no care for the employees on a moments notice."
bad,"Training was not up to par for the job task required, Work hours varied depending on the volume of calls that came in, equipment did not always work. Part time workers were not given any benefits or sick leave"
bad,This was my entry level to the cable industry good compensation bad hours of work and no down time.   management was good to work for lack of communication at times between upper and middle management other than that it was a good place to start in the industry to get my basic install skill set
bad,The environment was difficult to work in. The hours were long and not great. When they had too many people working a position you had to volunteer to take time off so you could work the rest of your schedule. You could sit there and not get paid for several hours before they needed you again.
bad,Workplace was very stressful. You have to clock in and if you are 1 minute late you get what they call occurences. Who wants to be under stress about being 1 minute late. Immediate supervisors were great but overall company policies made you feel that you were just a body because they did not care about their employees.
bad,"working with customers regarding technical service issue regarding cable, phone and internet service."
bad,"Sales and customer service so an acquired taste to begin with. Benefits package and free cable is very nice. Lots of prizes, giveaways and incentives throughout the day. Free food on occasions and nice facilities as far as lunch room, coffee, break rooms, bathrooms etc. Management can nice but not always available and depending on who you go to they may or may not be able to, or even want to help you. There is however floor support which is usually quick and helpful. Pay CAN be nice but the base pay isn't enough for the job in itself. There is bonuses and a commission check based on performance but that pay scale changes and was never truly explained. Often disputes on scorecard and actual payout. Preach integrity but want you to lie to customers or not tell full truth. It is retention so a lot of customers are very upset to start. So much of your pay is based off the scorecard and how much money you generate or can keep from losing, many customers are upset because of dishonest behavior from your peers in order to increase their own scorecard."
bad,didnt like how it was ran or the management. they never worked with your or your schedule. it was a horrible place to work for.
bad,The moral is extremely low due to constant changes to policy (daily) that affect every aspect of the job. The management is clueless and there is no merit system for any recognition or awards.
bad,"TWC is a very unorganized company that doesn't communicate well with the employees. They expect their employees to fallow their protocol, yet they fail to train employees properly. TWC tries to make the job experience a ""fun environment"" however I would say it's a major FAIL. I worked for the company for a few years and what I got from this is experience was that they do not care for their employees as much as they care for meeting their quotas. They will hire anyone because they have a really high turn over rate due to all the stress and pressure they put on you. DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS JOB to anyone unless you need someone who will hire you fast because your unemployment is running out."
bad,A typical work day at Charter is very fast paced. Things tend to change on a regular basis which means that you have to stay educated on different products and services to stay up-to-date with product knowledge. The people that are on my team are a great group to be around. The hardest part of the job is being away from my family so much even though i do enjoy the compensation and benieits
bad,"Centurylink is a changing organization. If you like a lot of change, then this may be a good fit. Hardest part of the job is keeping customers happy with staff that may not be up to their work tasks."
bad,"A typcial work day is seening what meetings that you have and making sure that the data you have gotten the week before adds up so there is no wrong communcation given.I learned that this job that it was fast paced and that people are stuck in there ways of doing things, There is some team work but only if it benifts the person that you are workin with.The hardest part of the job is getting everyone on the same page and seeing that we have a common goal. I enjoyed the job because it challenged my paitence and help me develope commputer skill and ask the question that i would need to ask just to get what i was looking for and not just settle for what someone just gives me,"
bad,"Company is in the process of being sold."
bad,"A day at work consist of processing customer's request, participating  on daily scheduled conference calls to discuss customer's pending orders, special projects etc."
bad,"I was recruited to help retain customers, in a (2) Second Tier escalation department for a cable company.  I learned to listen to customers complaints, provide them with understanding and then offer them a solution to the complaint.  The hardest part of this job was that our department had 5 managers and each had they own process on finding the best solution, which became very confusing.  In the end, the company ended up shutting the department down."
bad,"Typical day was boring because the place they sent us didn't want cable or didn't have money . I didn't really learn anything while I was there. There was no benefits, no insurance for us and no retirement plan. the hardest part of the job is that no one really help you at that site"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"decent place to work. I would recommend it, management is decent, co workers are ok. Up selling is the hardest part. Free cable is the most important part of the job"
bad,"Great training and supervisors.  Very supportive supervisor during a time of constant change and income fluctuation. Awesome co-workers, but not an environment that allows or supports camaraderie.  Awesome perks."
bad,"Recently, a typical day at work is that another person quits and my supervisor says, "" I need to hire more people""."
bad,Worked with the general public on a daily basis. Was very challenging when on service or repairs.
bad,Not for their customers and employees. They are only business-goaled and they do not put their customer's needs first or at all.
bad,"The people at Charter are as varied as the community, so you have both good and bad co-workers. The pay,free services, and insurance are good,but the environment is tough to stay in for long. The shifts change every 6 months or less, and if you aren't a top performer, you don't get a lot of choice on your days/hours. Teams change all the time, since people (including management) leave all the time, so people have to be shifted around. I would say a vast majority of employees aren't happy, but are there for the good pay."
bad,"compensation is unfair, poor healthcare, poor company culture. Free cable and internet services."
bad,"Taking inbound calls selling our products and services, troubleshooting cable boxes, and providing the steps needed to active and pair remote controls."
bad,"i was an installer. I would arive at work at 8am and install, perform service calls, and disconnet services. the hardest part of the job was trying to route the jobs so i could complete all of them."
bad,I did not enjoy my time at Time Warner but I did learn how to connect my cable to my TV. I also learned how to fix the internet connections for customers.
bad,"Direct Sales Representative,"
bad,A lot of demand and work for little compensation. Benefits are great
bad,"The management says they are there to help but several times help was requested it was not given, its apart of their procedure to give you help when you have passed your 90 days and are in jeopardy of losing your job.  You have 90 days to make minimum 55 PSU;s and if you don't make that your 4th month you get a final warning, then your out the door.  You are micromanaged like you are a little kid.  Even if you do make 55 sales if the technicians mess up and you lose that sale then it goes against your 55, your minimums are 32 a month.  There are people who do great at the job, let me be the one to tell you.  If you are not good at selling do not take this job.  The company is good, the way they treat the people in this position is not all that great, very high turnover rate."
bad,charter is a nice place to work. although it is very stressful and you have to put up with alot of nonsense if you dont meet in something they will threaten your job everytime you turn around your job is being threatened thats not way to work. its a lose lose situation at that job.
bad,"A typical day at work was answering calls and questions about billing, services, and trying to save customer's from downgrading and disconnecting."
bad,No opportunity for any growth if you are not a sales man. The technology and software are way behind.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I use to love the company until it change to a new managment, Charter use to be a place where you enjoyed coming to work. Now the managment look at you as a number, he even made the comment they do bu they dont care about the employees. Not saying everyone should be best friends but how can you expect your employees to do for you when you dont care about them. I had an employee who's husband had a stroke and they wanted her to come to work the next day."
bad,"A typical day involves responding to business problems that require answers yesterday. "
bad,"When you go to work in a call center, you obviously aren't expecting it to be amazing, but working at this call center was so stressful I eventually had to quit due to being concerned about my own health. Pay is decent, but just after I left, everyone took a pay-cut and commissions were all but eliminated for my department."
bad,Call center.  Fast pace.  Managers usually on call.  Benefits department not onsite. 
bad,I learned the job in a good amount of time to be on my own and it was good
bad,No opportunity to advance unless you knew someone that work in the department you applied for. Little to no hours and compensation lacked big time
bad,Some very good people and some very bad people. I was happiest once I left the company.
bad,"I manage mult-million dollar fiber network installations for governmental, educational and medical facilities. This is a high-paced environment where attention to detail is extremely important."
bad,A typical day might include the following:
bad,"I have been with the company for 3 years and if you want to work somewhere where you dread coming to everyday, then TWC is the place for you. The joke around here is TWC=Things Will Change, but the only thing that doesn't change is the work environment and the pay. When you walk into the call center everything is outdated. Lighting fixtures that need repair, desks with years of dust accumulation, Stone Age computers, and low pay are among some of the setbacks to working for this multibillion dollar cable giant. I guess they're too busy spending money on negotiations with networks to invest in making the work environment decent for their employees. Free cable is a plus but like everything else here there is a catch. You still have to pay for equipment, phone, and internet. They do have affordable benefits but the life-work balance is awful. They expect you to eat, sleep and live for TWC. Management is un-informed and un-involved. It's laughable when you think about how big this company is. Not to mention the pay is laughable compared with similar positions in the area. I would rather pay for cable and work somewhere where I am valued as an employee and compensated for the work I do vs. working somewhere just to get free cable, but struggle to make ends meet on every other household bill because I'm only making what equates to just above minimum wage after taxes and benefits. If you need a job, then it will do if you are single, a college student, or Desperate Housewife. You have to work atleast one day every weekend so forget about spending time with your family, vacations, etc."
bad,I worked for Charter Communications and was in middle management for over 22 years. I was downsized by them and I was told that I could always apply to get back in the company . I have applied for over a dozen jobs including this one. I have the experience and qualifications to do the job but I feel that my age is why they will not call me for a interview or hire me.
bad,"Outside sales is absolutely horrendous for this company. There was a schedule of Tuesday thru Saturday 11am-8pm and a new director came into town just to make the schedule 6 days a week Monday-Saturday still working until 8pm each night. They preach a family lifestyle but I saw my family for maybe an hour a day before it was time for bed. As a door to door job there needs to be motivation of some sort and there was absolutely NONE from immediate supervisors to their supervisors and beyond. There is absolutely no camaraderie anymore because supervisors discourage each rep away from communicating with each other. Benefits were pretty decent and this is the only thing that will be missed about working for this company. they will tell you potential of 6 figure incomes a year and you will NEVER see that...you will be making minimum wage with a very rare chance at earning a monthly commission check. The company is going south and at a rapid pace and as a former employee that has friends still employed with Charter, they have more people about to leave the company because of the overwhelming negative values that Charter possesses. I WARN EVERYONE!!!"
bad,The first year was great until the people in Tampa moved in. It was all downhill after that.
bad,"I was basically forced to resign due to a sales quota that was instituted, I could not keep up with their daily requirement"
bad,demanding job with little respect for the employees. discoraging environment
bad,"This job is ok for someone that is great at working under the eye of those who don't care for their well being as an employee. I've learned that you can't depened on management to follow through with what they should. This is a great company in terms of benefits (i.e. discounted cable and insurance) but in terms of stability or for those that want to go to school or those that want a part time job, I wouldn't recommend it. The hardest part of this job is not knowing if you're going to have a job when you come in if you miss a metric for the month due to a computer malfunction or someone failing to collect accurate data on your statistics as a rep. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help someone out if they call you with an issue and you're actually able to fix it for them."
bad,"a backwards company that is stuck in the 80's, lead wasn't, they don't care about the end user. do not want to gain knowledge"
bad,Managment is not very involved with employees. Organizing skills were not the greatest.
bad,the pay races wor very low.
bad,"Charter pays fairly well, but doesn't put much effort into ensuring customer service is grade A+, instead focusing on upselling. This is a horrible business model in the long term, even if it increases short term income."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,This large company struggles to stay current and competitive. The poor customer service from its parent company lends to constant re-education of its clients. They have a typical bureaucracy structure of a publically owned company; layer upon layer separating the customer from the head decision makers.
bad,Good starter job. Don't stay there. Customers are overwhelming sometimes. Best for those who don't have a family. High stress job. No chance to work remotely.
bad,I log in and pull up my screens and see if I have tickets or phones or both for the day and start to call customers or talk to tech's or just sit waiting for something to do when work is slow . My job was not always like this I use to be a router job was moved to a different location out of state
bad,"Employees and customers take a back seat to shareholders. All employees are tracked by GPS and if you are sitting too long in one place, you are hounded by supervisor. If I didn't use my off time to take care of new customer problems, nobody would"
bad,"Not consistent with job dutys/ schedule/ and tools,constantly changing what they want you to do and change meters and proceder and didn't explain the new equipment."
bad,"Management priorities shifting, leading to loss in productivity. Frequent changes to tools used for reporting purposes, providing challenges to build consistent reporting platform."
bad,"Spectrum is still in the process of finding out its identity at the retail level. Although there are some good people there, Spectrum does not do an effective job of balancing promotion from within with recruitment from outside of the company. As a result many of the store managers are hired from outside of the company and are frequently unfamiliar with the systems and procedures which leads to a dynamic where the manager is typically less experienced than the people they manage. This can lead to a frustrating work environment.  Additionally, the continual rejection of experienced employees seeking promotion creates an environment that appears to lack opportunity. With the number of new hires in the company one would expect a very robust training program but sadly, this is not the case.  The training is almost entirely online and is insufficient for the amount and type of information that needs to be taught to equip an employee to perform adequately. Lack of proper training, less than optimal compensation and fluctuating work schedules result in frequent turnover.  Many people leave the company within 6 months-1 year which is an expensive problem that leads to a lack of continuity and an unstable work environment. Spectrum has the makings of a good company but they are not there by any means."
bad,"Hopefully I'm a rare exception but I walked out after being told to give bad information to a customer. I didnt realize it at the time and once I tried escalating it, it was brushed off. Now I wonder how many times this had happened. Also, my supervisor cancelled most of my coachings or one on ones so I felt very much like I was on my own"
bad,"They hire you with the goal to make commission.  Give you a territory with 500 leads, you close and sell however there is not proper cabling for hook ups so you do not get to make your commission as the customer cannot be hooked up and there will be a delay most likely until the following spring.  They are very very shady."
bad,a huge work load with very little respect for getting it done. Low paying job that whats you to work long hours and every other Saturday. Don't get any actknowledge for trying to do everything correctly.
bad,"The start-up Spectrum Enterprise division is poorly managed and dysfunctional. Top execs and supporting associates have been laid off. There is no one steering the ship. It is very hierarchical -- with no one paying attention to anyone more than one level below them, and execs do not understand what is causing the dysfunction so continue to mismanage and make poor decisions."
bad,"From my experience I had to drive 80 minutes to another state to perform my duties, when I finished my last job which would normally be around 8:00pm I was required to drive back 80 minutes off the clock, my last week there I was required to do it four days straight, which in return I would not make it home until 9:20pm. There was no balance of work and life outside of work. Very stressful day"
bad,Don't do it! You will truly regret working here. No communication. This place is ran like a slave ship. Get excited about promises and then reality set in. Remember I tried to tell you. I know many people who work here and they are miserable. To many leaders with no experience!
bad,"OTM is a stressful job. Sales isn't for everyone. Especially those who don't want to be micromanaged, lied to or have a life outside of work ie kids or family members who need your assistance. It's very disorganized and unprofessional. They refuse to update the software to make the job less stressful. Dont get me wrong quite a few people have had nice commission's checks but the majority don't."
bad,Decent job if you dont mind being the hardest working person in the building while being led by sub par management.   Little to no recognition. Bellow average compensation and a terrible employee morale.
bad,"Great benefits and compensation but the pros end there. The culture went down hill over the past few years. There is was no employee moral, the management team did not care about the employees just the numbers. The turn over is the highest I’ve seen in any job I’ve worked with a lot of people barely completing training before they quit. Friends in other departments didn’t have this same outlook so these may only be retention issue."
bad,This is a terrible place to work due to poor management and high expectations without the proper tools. Training is terrible and it is difficult for advancements
bad,Fast pace with not enough time to do your job the standers set before you.  If the call center messes up what you are to do they make you look like a low production worker.  Keeps add steps required for a job with out adding time to work load.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Low morale within this employer. Rules are only enforced for those that management personally does not like. More than 30% of the workforce has unplanned absences any given work day.
bad,"Senior Director of Offensive Security is totally obsessed with workflow management, of which there is a team, but all other teams suffer with while they get all the focus and resources to do their job.  Sr. Dir is also a complete micro-manager at one point requiring everyone to request approval to talk to any other team for any reason.  Ridiculous.  "
bad,"The benefits are great! The leadership not so much. No growth potential. Store leadership doesn't get support from senior leadership. No store direction, or effective communication."
bad,"Great people who care about the customer. Management does not care about you or the customer, just quota.  They keep finding ways to reduce compensation and if you do too well, they don't want. you to stay."
bad,Used to be good before Spectrum bought birghthouse. Downhill ever since. More responsibility with no pay increase. They focus on the number more then the customers or the employees.
bad,"Spectrum is a good foot-in-the-door job but little else. There is almost no upward movement and the leadership are no well compensated, nor the entry level."
bad,"Customer service is extremely important to succeeding here. It all sounds good during the hiring process, but as soon as you get on the floor it's a whole different story. The work is stressful and emotionally draining and management/ supervision is mediocre. Its all about the numbers even though they say it's not. 6 months is all I could handle, good luck to anyone willing to continue employment beyond 6 months to a year."
bad,"okay managment, the training was very quick. the teacher went on vacation in the middle of training. great benefits. a lot of discounts at great restaurants."
bad,They pay you above average to deal with a severe lack of processes and leadership capabilities which lead to toxic behaviors and fear mongering tactics.
bad,"If you are looking for a job with a very regimented environment, then Spectrum may be for you. At least at the billing call center in Vancouver, Wa.  There is no margin for error here. Unless you are perfect always,expect to be made to feel like you're a sub par employee. There are of course metrics that you are judged on, things like the amount of time you spend on each call, the time it takes for you to take another call after finishing up the prior call and what the customers opinion of your interaction with them was. If you cannot give the customer what they want, no matter how nice you are, they can be vindictive and score you low, which affects your metric score. And that score counts, even if it is an unfair opinion. The supervisors are great,for the most part, but the managers are clueless and could care less about the well being of the employees. All they care about is numbers. You're expected to tolerate some of the most horrible verbal attacks and threats from customers, and still do your job without pause.  Their go to statement is always ""Don't take it personally"", but unless your an emotionless robot, it takes a toll. If you don't fall into their performance standards,they're all over you,nothing is overlooked. But if you have a concern, whether it be professional or personal, forget it.  They do have an answer for everything, and it's always in favor of "" The needs of the business"". There's a rule for everything, and you had better just shut up, sit down and take another call."
bad,They dont care anything about the employees. They write you up for just about anything and the pay sucks bad. Mcdonalds empoyees get paid more than spectrum employees.
bad,"HR is not for the people They are for the company and don’t protect the employees. I was terminated for taking care of my employees. There’s no loyalty to the employees and no compassion. I loved the people I worked with, but the upper management weren’t great AT ALL!"
bad,"The only good thing I am say about working for Spectrum is that they pay well. The hourly is decent, but the commissions is uncapped and paid out monthly. Other than that, the work/life balance is horrible. They require mandatory overtime sometimes which is non negotiable. They micromanage you and you’re working under stressful conditions worrying about what’s the next commission change or schedule change that may occur often. They do have rewards for perfect attendance etc. but with the culture of the company being so poor, those are rarely attained. They also will take 25% of your commission if you’re not at work a certain percentage of the month regardless of FMLA, Vacation or personal sicknesses. If you want a check this is a great company but it has a high turn over rate and the environment is very high school like. Not to mention, speaking with 50-60 angry customers with 90% of them complaining about services or rates being increased. The customers and the employees are dissatisfied with the company."
bad,"A typical day would be to drive to the office, pick up orders/equipment, perform all work needed and drive home.  I learned how to take care of customers and install cable TV.  Management was marginal at best.  Poor from top to bottom.  The workplace culture was laid-back and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was poor management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
bad,Was a great place to work until Spectrum took over and everything became about money. Commission was slashed and sales numbers increased. basically work harder for less money.
bad,Other areas of the company may be great but Enterprise IT data centers is not.  The culture is almost toxic in most areas due to management's inability to realize they are 2 decades behind the rest of the IT world.
bad,"New customer equipment is not properly tested and fails when in the home; techs are held accountable. Customers are angry and again techs are held accountable. Immediate Supervisors are powerless and cannot support their team. Pay is terrible for the type of work required.  Bonuses are based on metrics system which includes customer feedback and rework which is often beyond the technicians control. Advancement is based on metrics,which is again mostly out of the techs control. Customers and service technicians are not valued. 7 paid holidays but you are often pressured to work them."
bad,"Spectrum direct sales is a difficult job because as a DSR you cannot control the areas you work.  Sometimes you will work in wealthy locations and other times you will work in extremely poor areas.  They do not give you the tools to defend yourself from hostile people and loose wild dogs.  You have to take the area no matter the situation.  Even if your life is in danger.  Management does not care about its employees, to them you are a number.  How many sales did you get?  How many doors did you knock?  How many contacts did you get?  How many presentation did you do?  How many hours did you work in the field?  Its thunder storming outside you need to knock doors more doors.  It's cold outside you need to dress warm.  Theres a flood in your area, make sure you wear rainboots. This company is a prime example of a disconnect between upper management and employees.  It has an extremely high turnover rate and supervisor complain all the time about how over worked they are."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I enjoyed my stay here however there was a lot of work politics that at times became to cumbersome to bare. However, with that said I learnt alot while."
bad,"I love the work, but it has become to many checks and balances. Not leaving enough time to fix cable. The added ""scheduled hours"" take time away from family. And the lack of appreciation from upper management has made it what it is to me now."
bad,Left because VA appointments were continually challenged for validity and I was harassed about leaving work to go to them regardless of how much advance warning I gave
bad,"Training fast overview of everything, not able to see on screens, exercises did not work. No possible way to remember, everything micromanaged and published for all to see.Very discouraging, demoralizing."
bad,Before the merge with Spectrum Bright House was a fun exciting place to work. When the merge took place Spectrum came in and laid off practically all of the Bright House employees
bad,"The job wouldn't be as bad if the company was better managed. But the focus being put entirely on the customers and not at all on the employees makes it difficult for employees to really deal with difficult callers. "
bad,This is a job where you knock on doors trying to sell spectrum services off of a pre checked list. Some addresses are fake addresses which gives less addresses to sell from making the job harder. This job also requires you to use a personal vehicle which in the long run will destroy your vehicle. Also the hours require you to knock on doors until 8 pm which makes it very hard to have a family work lifestyle. The best part of the job is having the ability to talk to a wide range of people.
bad,"Great benefits,  demanding atatmosphere.  Calls can be very stressful but rewarding.  Great place to work but must be able to handle criticism from customers."
bad,"Spectrum cares more about centralizing employees than quality of employees.  Key areas are made to relocate or be laid off, where Time Warner Cable cared more about the quality of their employees than where they were located.  Lack of vision is apparent."
bad,"I am a long-time employee going back to the pre-merger days. Since the merger there have been a number of thing that the new company has done to change us from an enjoyable place to work into a ""Well, at least the check clears"" environment."
bad,"My typical day of work consisted of assisting customer issues with their video equipment, as well as working to resolve those issues. If I was unable to resolve over the phone I would set up trouble calls. I also assisted in some minor billing issues and setting up appointments."
bad,Culture of the work environment needs to change. No loyalty and no development plan for employees. Upper management has no clue but implements task that have no relevance to what is done on a day to day basis.
bad,hardest part of the job is the lack of support from whats suppposed to be your tier 2 and routers. most enjoyable part of the job is that sense of helping someone who is completely reliant on the services you provide. management is great although their reach for helping is very limited. I learned that no matter how simple something may be or appear to be there are others who think it is a foreign language.
bad,This company use to be Time Warner Cable which was an awesome company to work for. This new company Charter Communications is horrible to work for “. We had over 10 techs quit within the first year they took over!
bad,"i was a door to door sales representative and they expect you to work from sun up to midnight everyday and not be able to takes breaks to do personal things. also they offer commission but make it difficult to get above certain numbers. they micromanage every moment of your day. they want to know what door you knocked on, who you talked to and what was said every 30 seconds. they monitor your location and your 'door knocks per hour' and sales per day have to meet their daily requirements or you don't get your commission."
bad,"I wouldn’t go back if I didn’t have to. There is a shift bid every year, so the shift you start off with you most likely will never have again. You also change supervisors every year. Basically the only constant at Spectrum is change!"
bad,"I enjoyed working for Time warner "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Coworkers are great and the work environment is pretty relaxed, then you have your supervisors down your throat (Micromanaging) because they're too scared of the manager of the building whose expectations are beyond reality, then being penalized and scolded for not making the unrealistic stats that the company themselves cant even understand. The company is VERY unorganized and needs to work on their core values with their employees before expecting what they're not willing to pay the employees to accomplish.The benefits are NOW overpriced and not worth going through the company for dental, health and vision. There are NO bonuses anymore, NO commission, and the company has changed everyone's job title three times within one year and trained on a number of things that were once done by employees who got paid significantly more, with no pay raise."
bad,The leadership team is all coming from cable vision for the most part.  Same culture as there so my question would be if Cablevision could not grow with the current executive team then how is the new Spectrum brand going to grow?  I would like to have seen more executive leaders in place from Timewarner.
bad,"Worked there for 1 yr training is way to fast they do not prepare you fir what actually happens on the floor. No floor support if you have to wait fir a lead could take up 10 min . Offer shift slides if you are not a brown noser do not expect to get a better shift . Spectrum dies not care about long standing customers "
bad,"This is THE MOST stressful place to work. Yes, they compensate well, but that's because its the only way to keep employees. This place compensates extremely well. But the stress, micromanagement, disorganization, cluster, and clique's are enough to push anybody out. The expectations are ridiculous and impossible to fulfill. MOST of the supervisors are great, but they are micromanaged to the point of breaking. Basic representatives are kept out of the loop on information necessary for their jobs and then deemed incompetent. This place has a serious communication failure between departments.A little cross training in departments could be helpful. Most everybody does their best to ""put the customer first"", but the task is easier said than don. The allowance of ""taking 5"" could also be a useful tool working here."
bad,"the work wasn't hard they just don't wanna promote anyone or hire them on to get the benefits as an employee, everyone is stuck as a temporary worker no one was hired really. lot of people were there 1-3 years and still not hired on."
bad,"When I applied to this job I was extremely excited to work here since I thought I’d be working with a big company that already had their ducks in a row. The six weeks of training to be a cable support was pretty straight forward some things took a little explaining. But the day you are out of training and you talk to a real customer you realize that majority of the problems you encounter you did not learn about in training, and yeah there will be support there to help, sometimes, other times you could wait 20 minutes meanwhile your getting cursed out about something you have no idea about. But after working there for 6 months everything’s comes to you much easier but by that time you realize how unorganized the company is and how you alway get a customer that’s been transferred multiple times because the previous agent had no idea how to fix the problem or they were too lazy to fix. And between the store representatives, the field technicians, and the agents in the call center there is absolutely no means of communication, so how will you ever get to the bottom of a problem that some else made, the answer to that question is, you just guess until you maybe find the answer or your answer is good enough to get your customer off the phone. Also I came to the company to grow and move up, but what they don’t tell you is that for you to move up you have to abide by their unfair expectations that cannot be met if you are actually doing your job and actually getting problems solve while telling people the truth. You are also give these “tools” that are supposed to help you do your job"
bad,They don’t train you right or pay you right or tell you the stuff you should know and they change things at the last minute and your pay checks are never the same from pay check to pay check and their benefits are not the best
bad,"I worked at this company for 6 years. I started off as a CSR and 2 years late became a Help Desk Lead. I was there when the company was bought out by Charter Communications and became Spectrum."
bad,"While the company is striving to catch up, they are killing employees in the process.  "
bad,"Once the Charter buyout was in place everything changed-culture, priorities and goals. Opportunities suddenly vanished with lack of answers to ""what will the next day bring?""  Too bad-Time Warner was a good place to work and while not perfect felt like family."
bad,"If your looking for a job that you could fired within first few months of working there or few years, then its the job for you. Specturm is no where near the company that TimeWarner Cable used to be."
bad,"it is a exciting job to do, lots of learning. don't pay that great but lots of overtime. they do not care about your personal life, will tell you with one day notice you are working overtime tomorrow, to bad you don't have a babysitter. deal with it."
bad,You will be abused by customers and there is no way to defend yourself. The job is set for customers to be right no matter what and can and will treat reps how they want without the company helping the reps. Company changes policies for the reps very often and is not stable of the reps duties for the job. No one is on the same page most of the time and micro-manages each rep. Hard to advance within the company.
bad,"Trained for about 5 weeks in the North Facility. ""Drive-along"" with other techs for about 2 weeks which is 4 days per week and then was left alone to learn by myself. This cause headaches, stress, and customers would get impatient because they thought the time frame would be an hour, but impossible with a rookie on board with no proper training. Definitely need to change the way they train in Spectrum with more hands-on training and real life scenarios."
bad,"They need to do more work... Especially with their Customers...  They do some considerations, however, sense their turn over to Spectrum, many employees have either quit, retired, or moved on to other jobs."
bad,"At spectrum you are beyond under paid and over worked. The money is terrible, and the raises they give out are near insult. i wouldnt recommend anyone to go to work there unless it is TEMPORARY!"
bad,It was a job that provided me a decent income to live. Upper management operated nicely.  There is little to no room for advancement within this company.
bad,"Taking a job here was a big mistake. "
bad,"The shift they hire for don't let you leave a normal life the hire for 12,30 to 9.00 and give you a 30 min break you work in the dark climb poles and deal with people all for low salary we are super under paid compared to other compies that do they same thing"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"The environment and employees are awful, and make the entire atmosphere hostile and bitter. Management uses people for their own needs and terminates ""certain employees"" for unjust reasons but will attempt to retain poor employees to have power over them. Really bad environment."
bad,The changing of the ability for representatives to handle the call in there own voice versus using a script. Pressure of the callers with verbal language and abuse by customers were very stressful.
bad,Worked in all weather and customers were usually unhappy with your company when you arrived at their house. This made them unhappy towards you as the technician who often didn't deserve the way they are treated.
bad,"Management was not truthful about anything. They would lie to your face even when caught in a lie. There was no responsibility taken by management and they would throw you under the bus in a second. Management would not speak to customers so that they could not be held accountable for what they couldn't do like we were. Out of sight , out of mind - Management philosophy."
bad,"stressful, lack of communication among management. Your voice is heard but no one cares when listening to employees concerns it is just a show for HR. HR is absolutely lazy."
bad,"For starters, I know there are changes. I've been with the company which was when Time Warner Cable first took over Adelphia. At first, it had some issues, but quickly, it became a great place to work. As Tier 3, we were respected, had input that could get implemented. The pay was nice. Were able to work 4 10 hour days with 3 days off. Were able to bring in our laptops. All in all, it was one of the best places to work in town as far as tech support was concerned. You could use your knowledge to actually help people and learned many other things you might of not known. "
bad,"This was a great company when it was Time Warner Cable but is just the opposite since Charter/Spectrum bought the company.  Management is very regressive and not employee friendly at all. Policies and procedures have caused complete paralysis in some business segments. HR policies such as not being allowed to work remotely have contributed to this.  Ironically, contractors who have replaced employees are allowed to work remotely though.  Health Care coverage has also been reduced significantly."
bad,Spectrum is a huge conglomerate in the telecommunication business. The treat customers and employees poorly. They are constantly having bad reviews written about them.
bad,I worked for Specturm formerly of TWC...i have worked here for 4 yrs now..and i have learned a lot and have used my management/customer service skills on a daily basis!
bad,Overall I enjoy the work and the people i work with. However I do not like doing double the amount of work for the same pay and less benefits. I also do not enjoy trying to keep up with unrealistic and constantly changing job expectations. Also when the company makes record profits and the CEO makes something like 98 Million dollars while his employees are the lowest paid cable technicians anywhere is a red flag about where the company's priorities lie...
bad,"If you're wanting to be in this kind of industry, Charter is great place to learn. However, if you plan to support a family from your work, this is not the place to be. Charter pays much less than the standard for the type of work that is done. Other places will pay much more for the exact same amount (sometimes less) of work, and other places will give you a better chance to climb the corporate ladder."
bad,"they are not a family oriented company, they will penalize you for any and everything you do. it is harder to keep the job once you get it than to get the job, youre competing with ever changing statistics and mother nature(if youre a technician)"
bad,The job is exciting but they made the sales goals so difficult it was hard to make a living. Assigned work areas became hard to sell in due to the rural area I was assigned and the fact that I was assigned mostly high risk areas where it was difficult to collect the first months payment to start the service.
bad,"When this place was TWC it was probably one of my favorite jobs, wasn't perfect but I liked going to work. Charter purchased the company and now they are Spectrum. Now where tech related calls were every 5 mins on an average they are now back to back. Every phone call you will hear  the title of this review. To sum it it up ever since we became spectrum: Less PTO, decreased benefits. Increased the scope of support and services provided by my position and lowered starting pay for my position by about 4 dollars."
bad,"Meandering training, doesn't focus on anything in particular, poorly led. The management is pretty severe if you need to have a moment to yourself. More interested in taking stupid calls then staff."
bad,"Spectrum sales used to be great!"
bad,"very bad place to work for no respect for employees over worked schedule changes every 6 months , too many changes nothing consistent way to many chiefs and not enough indians"
bad,"Time Warner Cable was a great place to work."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,company not good no breaks or lunches paid for they make you do there work and pay you little to nothing this review is not true aT ALL im just mad they make you do this v
bad,"This has turned into a terrible place to work since the merger. Benefits have gotten worse and most people had to take a pay cut. Plus, health insurance premiums raised considerably."
bad,"The people you meet are mostly good.  However, there are some that are rude and you have to have thick skin and find a way to move forward.  This position is not for everyone.  Give it a serious thought before committing.  Good Luck!"
bad,"Horrible company.  Dishonest, stodgy, and operations under a monopoly mindset and business philosophy.  Sleazy (and at times unethical business practices)."
bad,"I got to meet different people and cultures, site other places besides Louisville, KY. Working long hrs ecause appointments where set at later times to customers availability could be a hassle sometimes."
bad,commission based sales positions - management will steal sales from one rep and give to another - happened every day - so corrupt that outside auditor came in and laid off tons - still happens because they know how to hide their tracks on systems now.
bad,"Great companyto work for,  just bad at communicating things to employees. Very hard to move up in the company.  Managers not on the same accord"
bad,"I loved the job at first. Best part about it is the free cable and internet. Management holds job over your head. The micro managing is rediculous. Once Charter took over and started implementing their policies it was too much to handle. Your treated like a kid in school. Taking back to back calls with no breathing time in between. unrealistic sales goals. Things were great and laid back at the beginning, then it became same old call center routine. less perks and not fun at all. It made you not want to come to work. Made the time there unplesant. Their turn over rate is at an all time high right now because of charter. They started mass hiring ppl with lack of training. Shoved ppl into the cubicles. Every month you sat at a new desk. Everything about this place is a mess. You could walk into work and be fired. No job security what so ever."
bad,Need to train management on coaching.  Need to review rules and guidelines with employees. Need levels of discipline. Need to train employees. Learn to treat employees with respect.
bad,"Management very non shalt about everything.  If your a hard worker they take advantage of you. If you can convince behind close doors you will get promoted.  Definitely an eye opener as for a communications company, no one is on the same page.  Too many cracks for the customers to fall through. Management never listens to ideas for improvement.  Broken tools to aid customers with.  Want the last 5 years of time back as charter has been a very negative experience for me.  Too many dead ends and not enough support all the way around.  Good luck"
bad,If you enjoy getting screamed at by angry customers and have a tool sets (too many) that don't work half the time. by all means apply
bad,Goals are ever changing and often unobtainable. Management shows clear favoritism and sleeps with team members for favors. Very great incentives. Superiors will often alter performance goals to cap pay. Very high turnover rate.
bad,Poor Management. Wont last if sales numbers not met. Expected to travel to east bum shoe to cover other offices that are not staffed properly.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of preparing your computer and being on the phones. I have learned a lot and my coworkers are the best part of my job. The hardest part of my job is that things are always changing and it is very hard to get help when needed. It is also discouraging that people are very expendable here which makes people feel unimportant and fearful, especially people who do not deserve to. The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers & some of my customers."
bad,"Management is given suggestions but never can act on them. We can't offer the customers a better offer than the competitors. A lot of turn-around and changes all the time hence the nickname in the subject. It feels as if there is no stability, structure, or promise in this company. There is always a contradiction."
bad,This is extremely hectic job and management seems to care about nothing but sale goals.There is no work and life balance.
bad,"A lot of brown nosing is done. I did not enjoy my time with them and they were very condensing. But pay was great, the hours were unstable."
bad,Work in this company was ever changing. The management was less  than informed about the changes that were taking place. The management did not work with their agents to promote professional growth.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I began working there in around 2014, worked until the end of 2015, almost 2016. It was fun in the beginning, until they make you on your own 100% quota. Once you're at this stage, everything, I mean everything, is based on performance. They say ""We are here for the customer."" That's wrong, I was in the top performing office in the whole enterprise, it was very stressful, if you did one thing wrong, or spent too much time in one place assisting the customer's every need, the managers/supervisors would question your every move. But I thought time warner preached ""Customer comes first"", wrong.. their bottom line comes first. "
bad,The job is ok. Lots of hours to make sales goals. Management is not there to help you when you have questions. You are on your own 98% of the time.
bad,"Not interested in rating the company at this current time. Unfortunately, it has been a while since I was there and I do not wish to give a review."
bad,I would not recommend this place to anyone trying to grow within the company. There is little to no room to grow unless you become friends with management
bad,"Although it can be quite stressful, once you find your niche - twc can be a great place to work.There isnt very much structure and good training isnt available to all employees. There is a lot of uncovered information that everyone is not willing to share. The office culture varies from hightly motivating to defeatous- depending on what department you work in."
bad,I work hard and you don't get credit for the hard work you do..I work well with co-workers. The hardest part of my job is not being appericate .
bad,Requirements are not reasonable and teamwork is discouraged by upper management. Co-workers are good to work with and try to look out for each other but the corporate office has little to no respect for its technicians and refuse to listen to suggestions or answer questions on what can be done better.  Local management easy to get along with and work for.  Poor training.
bad,"I worked for this company for 4 years. Every 6 months to a year you would have to do a full shift bid so it was very hard to balance personal life. You could start at an 8am-5pm shift and a few months later get a 3pm-12am shift and they do not allow you to shift swaps with other employees."
bad,"My schedule changed every week it is horrible, the management is very on edge due to the upcoming merger w/ charter cable. Many jobs they expect will be lost"
bad,"This is great place to work if you have good management, the day to day is long 8 to 10 hour days. Co workers make the day easier."
bad,"Sales queue manipulated daily making it impossible to attain the salary advertised. The  rules & regulations change constantly, commission goals are always changing drastically. Employees must sign new contracts twice monthly as the mandatory sales goals and commission eligibility are changed bi weekly. Inbound Sales Reps basically handle customer service, grievance and complaint calls. Free coffee, free food, contests for prizes are fine for employees that don't expect to make more than $9.20 an hour.  There are a lot of misrepresentations at the interview and throughout training.  Excellent health benefits and very affordable. A great place to work if this is your first job and you aren't a college student or parent. You will work  nights including every Friday and Saturday night your first year regardless of promises. The supervisors are very motivated and will try to help whenever you need them. A very energetic and positive atmosphere but achieving the salary advertised is challenged by the threat of job loss if sales goals aren't met and a list of ever changing criteria to get a commission of  either 100%, 50% or 0% of your sales totals. This tier system is not introduced until the second month of employment."
bad,"The company expects you to meet goals that are unrealistic as an outbound agent making cold calls. "
bad,"This job was great... at first. Although my supervisor was completely incompetent, my co-workers were awesome. We would routinely work together at the end of the day so that we all might go home at a decent hour. You never knew what time you would get done, so don't expect much of a personal life after hours."
bad,"Management has been replaced many times, but not repaired. I do not wish to talk about Charters short comings."
bad,Charter was a very stressful place to work.  I was just not cut out for call center employment.
bad,"*Cold Call Door to Door in buildings downtown Indianapolis that supplied Time Warner services"
bad,"the company is great to work for as long as you are a drone, but it is apparent that office politics runs the day to day operations"
bad,Benefits are great but not such a great place to work at. Management is horrible. Co-workers are good though.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Crazy pepole sometimes and dirty houses you have to enter or smelly ones or dangerous roofs or basements
bad,Fix a problem that has been fixed many times before you arrived and will be fixed many time after your fix.
bad,"To many changes that are not communicated to the employees in a timely and apporate fashion,"
bad,"You come in the morning... sit on your desk. Hear from your supervisor about sales, sales, sales. Then after lunch I would hear it again sales, sales, sales. You are only as good to them as you can make sales. If you arent good at selling good luck at this company. Advancement is neat impossible if you arent buddy buddy with your supervisor. Overall horrible place."
bad,"Very stressful job, some supervisors are helpful if they know the answers. Time warner has a lot of issue with their services so customers are always displease witch make your job harder to please. They have so many rules that don't seem ethical which makes it hard for reps to explain to customers. Lots of micro management at time warner in Ontario. Mangers are not approachable or helpful. They seem to have a high turn over rate. Constantly firing reps. Classes for new hires start every single month. And the let go of employes every month. Remind me of disposable cattle."
bad,Poor management and for the stress level that occurs with this job thy pay is definitely not enough.
bad,"Work off a schedule, maintain quality, shipping product out on time to costumers and I had to manage 5 different areas;"
bad,"Too many changes within the company executive team over the last couple of years has led to a lack of clear direction, and fear about job security among all ranks."
bad,"I enjoyed good compensation for 5 out of the 7 years I spent at TWC. I threw my heart into everything I did for TWC, with usually very inadequate training for what I was asked to do. I was terminated without any verbal, or written warning. I was made an example of by my immediate supervisor, who lived in another state. I was subjected to an interrogation by the security department, which did a background check all the way back when I was 19 years old. I was 60 years old at the time of the interrogation. This was all started by my neglect on a handful of seasonal accounts, of not running a required credit check, even though they already had an account at their normal local residence. Extreme over reaction, and mistreatment! "
bad,Makes a lot of changes on a daily basis enjoyed working with co-workers don't think it was fair how they ended the Retention position
bad,"A typical day for me I start work at 7:30."
bad,"work in a call center trouble shooting problems and taking payments"
bad,"Time Warner Cable is an exciting product to market. However, the environment is unhealthy and HR (which isn't in the market) is unable to do anything about issues. It seems the only way to advance is if you have a connection with management."
bad,"As a customer service representative in a retail store, customers approach my counter and I assist them with a variety of needs, ranging from technical support, billing questions, sales and payments. Having experienced both the call center aspect and the retail store aspect at this company, I have sharpened my customer service skills and have learned to develop a rapport with customers, as well as with my co-workers. Throughout my five years of employment at Time Warner Cable, I have learned how to successfully satisfy the needs of my customers while meeting the goals set by the company. My relationships with all my co-workers have all been extremely positive, and I am proud of the teamwork that my peers and I have demonstrated throughout the years. All of my immediate supervisors have been a pleasure to work for, and I have always been happy to assist them in any way I could, including volunteering to fill in at other stores as needed, helping with the schedule, filing and other clerical duties. At the beginning of my employment with this company, I was eager to have the opportunity to advance. However, now that the job responsibilities have veered from a focus on customer service to a strict focus on rigorous selling, this is no longer a company I would feel proud to advance in. With the focus on sales superseding any other aspect of the position, I have decided it is time to move on and seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"My entire career has been in the Administrative Assistant/Customer Service Field and I can honestly say during my short stay with the company it was obvious their concern wasn't the customer being first. The Supervisors were not consistent with their procedures and ""rarely"" took a call from a customer when the customer requested it. One of the poorest examples of a Customer Service Dept. I've ever seen."
bad,Worked here for 31 years and I am glad that I'M not working there anymore.
bad,"I enjoyed working here only because the pay was good and I was lucky enough to be the in the only training group that had the 8-5 schedule. And the people I was training with were great people that I grew to know and still speak with to this day. Bit as far as managemnt. Their VERY uptight and they give you know support on the floor when you need it. They have a ""online supervisor"" ""support system"" thats never worked. Sometimes you you would have the costumer waiting on the phone for over 20 min just to get a supervisor online. But I wouldnt recommend or refer anyone to work there."
bad,Charter is changing its way of charging customers and is causing a little ripple when it comes to price.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Things change TOO often.... Great benefits but the turnover rate is horrible. They don't value keeping their seasoned people. The best part is the pay but they cut commission several times.. Its not even that good any more.
bad,"Taking call from the que for billing ,sales and technical support.During these calls I was to upsell the customer,assist customer with their needs and resolve any conflict that the customers had."
bad,*Juggling act between people who dont want to work and people who don't know how to work.
bad,I interviewed for this position and they offered me $10 per hour. As an 11 yr army war veteran and over 15 yrs experience as a telecommunications field engineer and logistics specialist...I was somewhat disappointed.
bad,A typical day would be start at 10AM. work a 10-12 job or two. Take lunch about 12:30. Start 1-3 jobs head to 3-5 jobs and then start 5-7. Never got off on time due to work force scheduling.
bad,Being a Charter sales rep! You get to meet all kinds of new people every day.Which i enjoyed but it has its cons to like when you have to go disconnect somebodys cable people are never happy about that.But its the other way around when your connecting there cable.I would have to say all in all it was an exciting job always new people to meet and challenges that is why i enjoyed the job.
bad,Alot of hours/no family time/Bad Management/Good co-workers/liked working and helping out customers. Always on call most of the year especially on holidays
bad,I worked at this company for two years. The typical day at work depended on a lot. The most enjoyable part of the job was the commission. Co-workers were good people to work with with.
bad,"Overall I loved working there. It was a place where I thought I made a difference to both my coworkers and customers. I can honestly say I grew as a professional. I started there thinking this was just another job but then discovered my aptitude for technology and creative thinking. I was able to meet very influential people. However, in the last couple of years I've noticed that the 'culture climate' has changed. Good talent is often the first to be laid off while others who steal time/money from the company are still around. Management plays favorites to the extreme that it impacts customer's services therefore the customer's relationship with the company."
bad,During the first year of employment I really enjoyed my time at work. After that I felt as if the company only focused time and energy on new hires and didn't spend time acknowledging their top performers and hard working employees.
bad,If you live close to the city driving out to parts of Gainesville can be a hassle. No training pay. They want to pay you the minimum on mileage. It’s mandatory to work on Saturdays but never mentioned in the employee handbook. Pay sucks compared to the cost of living
bad,number driven job its basically a numbers game productively customer satifacation repeats time between jobs on the job while it changing the rules all the time
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone if you’re not really interested in this specific company but just want somewhere that’s a fun place to work and good pay. The pay is decent but the hours are horrible & having to deal with the customers are horrible as well.
bad,"Back to back calls, changes without Training .  Focus on what you aren’t doing right, instead of what you are doing well.   Large turnover rate."
bad,This company  has great leadership.  The pay starts low but does increase over time. Training is thorough.  Management will always go to bat for you and try their best to help you.
bad,When working forbTime Warner the job was great.  I had been a lead technician and had enough challenges to keep me interested. Once Charter bought out the company we started to lose a lot of good techs. Management was so far removed from the laborers and would implement duties that had no positive outcome for tech or customer.
bad,"Extremely stressful! So many changes implemented without much training, management was horrible, especially with escalated calls putting more effort into AVOIDING taking the call than helping you. Never enough supervisors on weekends which were the busiest days!"
bad,"This is a position which allowed a 40+ hour work week over 4 days, which made it possible to get a second job.  100% necessary since this job is nowhere near capable of paying for living in san diego."
bad,I had 14 different supervisors in just over two years. There was constant change and turmoil and the company's values did not seem to genuinely care about the customer.
bad,Management is a joke... we were brought in as retention reps to Save customers but later that job was placed under the sales umbrella... sales expectations do not match reality....
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,we often feel beaten down.  no room for advancement from the inside.  our team is like family but that is the only benefit.  that and free cable.  only company i have worked for that pays you less every year
bad,"I was excited to start working at Spectrum, I thought that it was going to be a career for me.  I was started at $15 an hour and it just wasn't worth what I had to do, I was not there very long and already the expectation for installs on time was unreasonably fast.  There's no possible way for them to correctly calculate correct times per customers household, every situation is going to be different.  I left because I felt like I didn't want to work the rest of my life with that constant time pressure on me, also considering the work life balance was minimal, had next to no free time to spend with my friends and family whatsoever;  Lots of overtime, not enough pay to compensate for what I had to do.  The only part I really enjoyed honestly was the training that I went through my first few weeks, after that it was straight downhill."
bad,"The benefits are great, the pay doesn't get too good though. No one will tell you what the pay is or what your raise will be for progression. Get over booked with jobs and will have to work through lunch, over your clock out time, or both."
bad,"Very danger work for females, schedule time 11:30 am to 8:30 pm Monday to Friday, Saturday 10:00 am to 2:00pm, salary less than minimum wage, + commission, more than 8 sales p/month to get some commission. Door to door sales, something in very danger territories. Free internet, tv, phone services, some other benefits."
bad,"It's call center life like anywhere else. Most call are easy to resolve with little troubleshooting. However, the metrics that are in place won't allow those who try to be the only rep the caller has to talk to to be as successful as they can be. Too much passing the buck or kick the bucket down the road happens and issues are fixed for a short while. Not enough effort in to correcting known problems."
bad,"The workload and stress was not worth it for the lack of compensation, communication, and organization. Had a panic attack due to it and started having heart palpitations. Nope, my health is worth more. I was ready to leave after only 6 months in, but kept convincing myself it was growing pains from going from Time Warner to Spectrum; nope. Three years later that cannot be the case. The company, or it could just be my location, is a clusterfcuk."
bad,"This company has evolved into a sweat shop.They only care about how long you;re on the phone. Everything is monitored very closely, you can't sneeze without someone knowing."
bad,A lot of companies are falling into this unfortunately. They are basically “buying” their employees into the door. With such a high turnover rate due to terrible floor management and supervisors it makes it difficult to stay motivated and focused in a high stressed and quick paced environment. They will give you every benefit available but treat their employees like Nothing.
bad,Hard to advance. You have to know someone. The Moral and Culture is below disappointing. Management and upper Management could care less about the employee. The CEO is small business minded and seems to be greedy. More revenue less employee appreciation. It’s like a sweat shop. Unorganized and be prepared for uninformed change.
bad,"It's a job if you need one, pay is decent and free cable. No direction of where the company wants to go. Too much micromanagement and not well thought out ideas."
bad,"The agents were miserable....low morale....supervisors were not professional (except one). Playing favorites was very common....and personally  having 4 supervisors (not a typo) and  2 managers wasn't a good thing because they weren't on the same page. "
bad,"If you are retired or a student I would say go for it, or if you want a career advancement in the field. Its a great start to earning some money to get going on bills or school but its not a long term unless you want to become management or have a big role in the department somewhere. You will have a lot of stressful days."
bad,I worked in the call center billing agent.former. downsized. Survived  through many changes...20years or so..technology staff and leadership. Leadership tried their best to be fair and fun not always easy to do with the strict rules and demands. Everything was no and you need permission. Something was lost . took the family atmosphere we created and devastated it.
bad,"No Knowledgeable supervisors,  managers roam the floors all day  constantly asking about your calls they find ways to stiff you on your commission ..."
bad,"Two years and 51 weeks with Charter ended 5 days short of being vested, getting the $5,000 company contribution to my 401k. It was 3 days after my 64th birthday and 3 days before Chistmas 2017. I was the 2nd best performing salesman in Direct Sales (door-to-door) that month and was completing my best month in the almost 3 years of employment in Mankato, MN. "
bad,Spectrum focuses solely on sales on a day to day basis. The environment is super stressful and could use some fun and maybe yoga classes to relieve some of the stress!
bad,"The warehouse functions, but sometimes barely due to room in the building. When work was flowing, it would be all day. I worked the docks unloading trailers at bay doors."
bad,"This was the most stressful environment that I have ever worked in.  The management was untrained and had very little leadership skills."
bad,"Would say an OK company, if only management will consider listening suggestions from technicians. not just implementing unnecessary rules that only favors supervisors, makes simple things harder for technician."
bad,"The upper management is a joke at Spectrum. This place is a joke and I wouldn’t refer my worst enemy to work there. The company doesn’t care about their employees, they have you work off the clock on a daily bases ( even though they say it is against policy to do so). Local managers  are constantly changing their own policy to make the numbers on their reports look good on paper. Everything about this company is broke, as well as the product they are selling!!!"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,You felt stuck in the job a little.There were some perks but it wasn't enough to deal with the constant verbal abuse and entitlement the customers displayed on a daily.
bad,"poor management, I had a newly hired supervisor that was never able to assist me with anything. I need a change of schedule from working 1:15 pm-10:15 pm because I no longer had a sitter to watch my 3 young children, and was forced to quit because they were not able to change my shift. The company is against anyone wanting to do a permanent change of shift, and if you want your shift change you have to wait until you are eligible to do so. So I had no choice and had to quit, because I will not leave my children by themselves late at night."
bad,"Great job for recent graduates, company has unrealistic standards for the technicians and little to no control over our personal scorecards unless you work the system."
bad,"Long term management does not have the drive and ambition of newly promoted leads to managers. New age management invest more in your growth and is more knowledgeable with current operating systems, and strive to assist their team. Great company benefits but the pay is not worth the stress as a internet tech support rep. The Ontario, CA location rather meet metrics than have satisfied customers, expectations are to have a resolution with-in 10 min. Is that really in the best interest of the customer, the customer that invest monthly for this company be in business? Not my kind of service carrier."
bad,"The title says it all. Despite offering good pay and excellent benefits, Spectrum can be a difficult place to work. Performance is managed by metric and not all reporting systems are dependable. The environment is very high pressure and assigned goals are frequently unrealistic."
bad,A typical day at the office entails a lot multitasking. A lot of troubleshooting and a lot of speaking. I've learned a lot different aspects of the company and how each work.The culture at spectrum is very fast paced and for ever evolving. The hardest part of my job might be the sudden change that occurs sometimes with no warnings but just you have to roll with the punches and adapt. The most enjoyable  part of my day is when I overcome a challenge with no help.
bad,"Spectrum has been terrible. Unrealistic expectations set by executives in a corporate office. Constantly adding additional work to every work order with no extra time, or pay given."
bad,"I worked there for a year and a half. Wasn't my preferred job but worked in a pinch. Call center environment was like being in high school all over again with cliques everywhere. Back to back calls most of the time and heaven forbid you take a personal break from the phones for longer than 8 minutes or they log you off. If you have any medical leaves be prepared to be sent through the ringer with their leave administrator. Provided documents from my primary doctor and a specialist stating going back to work would be detrimental to my condition and they still denied it, 4 months no pay. So if you need to be on disability you better make sure your doctor will fill out the forms needed. Once returning felt like they were doing everything they could to push me out... Never got my personal day, sick time was not being accumulated nor vacation time. So glad they basically fired me but stated that I quit for personal reasons."
bad,"The first 2 tiers of your management have no actual decision making power, you could be fortunate that they have the ability.   The environment is one of claiming your opinion and input is appreciated, however, when something comes down the pipe, the decision was long since made by the time you hear about it, and no input from you or your peers will change it.  "
bad,"Sadly, once Charter took over, any employee consideration went out the window. They came to care only for profit and shareholders. This is not longer an employee friendly company."
bad,"For a first job this place is okay. Not somewhere I would look to move up. Benefits are good, but the pay is lack luster and the raises cap out fast. Understaffed and now the hiring strategy is to hire in mass and many unqualified people get in making your job even worse."
bad,"very stressful job, very bad hours because it is a call center, a lot of work changes on a daily basis, small room for advancement, customers can be very difficult to deal with"
bad,Management sucks. Some random guy at the top makes rules for employees to follow and has no clue on how it will impact employees or dosen't care. Impossible metrics and zero accountability for management. They will throw you under the bus quick.
bad,"Do not work at this company if you need to believe in upper management. All they care about is making quota.  This company is broken. It takes an act of God to get a quote out the door. Compensation is fair, if you can get through pre-sales processes to get a contract."
bad,"The company changed a lot after merging with TWC. Sales performance is based on the number of calls you take. They required average talk times of 10 minutes or less, and it is mandatory to attempt to sell all available lines and the highest service level package first, on every call. Failure to meet any of the metrics in a sales period leads to coaching meetings, where depending on your manager, you receive helpful tips and feedback or are told you'll be fired if you don't improve."
bad,"Rules constantly changing, bad internal communication. Even had a shift bid that was never brought up in interview, so assume that the shift the shift they hired you on would be permanent"
bad,Pay is okay. They really expect you to go the extra mile for them but will not do the same for you. The benefits are good if you are willing to do that type of work.
bad,"Everything management expects of you is contradictory. Nothing you do right will satisfy them. They care more about numbers than people! You have to talk nonstop for 8 hours minus breaks and have to keep worrying about numbers. One of the reasons I quit was because the customers are HORRIBLE and the company doesnt care but you're the one who might get fired if you're caught defending yourself against profane, sexist or racist remarks. But their right about one thing. Spectrum definitely sucks. I cant ever even get on demand or the tv app to work!!! Charter doesnt care about the customers or the reps who work SO hard to be apologists for the corporation. They are making so much money but cant fix their product? yes TWC was better before they were spectrum and it was different management too. They want you glued to the phone and literally keep track of the mins you spent in the bathroom. They expect you to take no more than 9-10 mins on the phone but you have to wait around for 10 mins trying to get a lead to help you with things out of your control! This is a job that may make you cry. If you can help it, work somewhere else if you dont want to lose your voice, be micromanaged, cursed at over the phone or lose your mind over impossible expectations."
bad,"This used to be a great company to work for, but since the Charter/Time Warner Cable merger it has gone down hill. Supervisors are more concerned with 'catching you doing something wrong' than they are with maintaining a team that works well together. Advancement is possible, but not likely due to an influx of upper management coming from other markets and structuring opportunities for their buddies rather than hiring within the department. Vacations are more stressful than they are relaxing due to the heavy workload and deadlines. If you take a week off, expect to work 75 hours the week before and 75 hours the week after in order to catch up."
bad,"I have been in the industry for more than 10 years. This is one of the worst places to work and they don't care about your well-being. If you don't mind being talked to like a dog, then Spectrum is the place for you, otherwise run fast."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,I would not recommend this workplace to anyone due to some of the rude customers you deal with and also the lack of help you receive in training. Management was okay to work with
bad,I was laid off from Time Warner Cable when it was bought out by Charter.  Spectrum is changing everything that TWC had accomplished through out the past years.  Their policies and procedures are being set back to 10 years... The employees are only promoted by who you know not what you know... is ashamed what the company has become....
bad,"This place is about a stressful a call center as you can get. We are always in queue, like 700 calls in queue, and it doesn't ever let up! If you have to have a break and it's not your break time, you better have a doctor's note saying you can go to the bathroom. Some managers are sneaky and not only do things behind your back, but behind your manager's back! Nice co-workers though!"
bad,"Spectum has ever changing policies making keeping up with them almost impossible. Every time a question is asked, every single supervisor or manager will tell you something different. Company is very unorganized and confusing. Sales and retention expectations are almost impossible to meet."
bad,Your typical week consists of hearing about all the ways you can get fired a couple of times a week. Getting yelled at and sometimes cussed out and personally attacked by customers calling in...but you cannot hang up or transfer them anywhere without the customers verbal consent or you will get fired. There are just too many things to write down. Overall the job is trash unless you like being constantly stressed. The best thing is meeting and working with some really cool people.
bad,"This is a great company to work for if you can handle answering phones from extremely vulgar and angry customers for 10 hours a day. These are some of the worst, most racist customers I have ever come in contact with that yell at you on the phone. The customers that this company provides services to have made me not want to work another customer service job in this lifetime. Aside from the customers, there's little room for advancement within the company and the salary was minimal for the stress I was put under. Management was great and always super helpful."
bad,"Charter acquired BHN & TWC in May 2016 and proceeded to merge the 3 companies. Charter quickly showed that they do not respect their members of leadership by eliminating their jobs without notice. The Billing Call Center was very fast paced, but there was never enough training provided to new employees. Management was often over-worked with very little support. The direct management of the Livonia location was great and most of them worked together as a team. When it came to higher management corporate showed that they truly did not care nor respect the management at any individual location. Benefits provided were ok, but not near as good as BHN had provided and they were a much smaller company, again, Charter does not care about their employees, they only care that the VP's are getting their bonuses."
bad,"When I first did my orientation and training, there was an energy to the company. During the training class, the training department supervisors would corral in the leadership to introduce and show how much they ""care"". I fell for it, I actually thought these guys get it; they know what they are doing! I felt like I made a great move. The leadership team talked on and on about how you can get raises and promoted fast!!.. Fast forward 6 months, I found out that it is possible to get raises. Spectrum's metrics are not well explained and to find out what each number is and how it affects your raises is IMPOSSIBLE! Anytime I have asked any member of ""Leadership"" of how my numbers are calculated. They will either A) refer me to another employee who is in charge because they don't  know themselves. or B) Give me some explanation that is filled with jargon to try to confuse me. I just smile and say ""Okay"". This place is a great stepping stone for anyone that loves working with technology. But the Leadership team is the BIG problem, I worked at places and see Supervisors answer questions like this ""I don't know the answer but let me go and find out the answer for you"". Working here the Sups look at you like a number and that is it."
bad,"It is a typical call center job, the only difference is with this job you have the ability to earn commissions based on your performance in saving customers from disconnecting their services. That is about the only highlight."
bad,"At the call center I worked at, we had a huge issue with communication. Example: changing the price or package of a channel package and not informing the call agents (the ones taking the calls from the customer) in a timely manner for the call agents to relay the correct information to the customer. Or we had a lot of issues with other call agents giving wrong or outdated information to customers and it causing a huge conflict. For example: telling a customer the silver package includes premium for only 89.99/month when it doesn't even include those premium channels and it actually cost 99.99/month. These are not actual prices. and it SEEMS that the company does nothing to these employees that do this cause it happens a lot. Also when they took over TWC they were really unorganized when the merge took place. They left us call agents to figure it out. They also stopped caring for the employees. Example: people that have to work on the holidays, they used to feed us, pizza or something or allow us to do potlucks. Nope, they quit that. So, my experience working for this company was disappointing. The best thing: SOME of my coworkers.  And the benefits (health) like anywhere else. nothing special."
bad,This company has absolutely no appreciation for the workers that have stayed after all the unprofessional things this company has done. They lack communication with their employees. They have no sense of caring about the work pace. They literally just laid off people who have been with the previous companies 30+ years! They lack compassion or any sense of caring other than draining money from people. It is turning into a very corporate type of company. That’s all I’m going to say.
bad,The benefits and pay of this job were great. The job itself would be worth it for everything except the management and the way the company treats their employees. You are basically just an employee number. Nobody thinks of you as a person no matter how long you have been at the company and they will do everything in their power to make sure if you succeed and make money they will push you out so they can get the next person in at the minimum amount of salary.
bad,I began working at Spectrum during a major transition stemming from a recent merger. Contract negotiators were encouraged to forgo professionalism in favor of a street hustling approach. This was against my expectation of a major fortune 500 company. I was unable to adapt to the new workplace culture so I was eventually let go.
bad,"I've worked at call centers and offices for about 8 or so years of my life.  I can tell you absolutely every one of them were awful, but Charter/Spectrum was especially so.  The culture is cutthroat, doing anything one can to get ahead, the management is terrible- in many cases doing the bare minimum to get by, the metrics are impossible to make in the confines in which they want them to be made it's just an environment where you're continually stressed all the time.  Look elsewhere."
bad,"I worked for Time Warner, not Spectrum.  I am not aware what has changed since my employment under Time Warner.  I enjoyed my time at Time Warner, but nearer to the end, I felt under valued."
bad,"sales were in flux.   no one was happy at their job"
bad,"Work here if all you are looking for is a pay check."
bad,"I learned a lot about sales while working for this company and how stressful sales can be at times.  I enjoyed the job, but the management could use some work."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,The negativity in this job is astounding. Never have I seen worse morale in the workplace. This includes managers and supervisors. Just a dreary place to work when everyone you encounter is cranky for one reason or another.
bad,"The job is easy in the beginning but wears on you after a year or so. There can be great people to work with including supervisors but no one is on the same page ESPECIALLY the supervisors. If you make any noticeable mistakes, they're never forgotten by management no matter how large or small. "
bad,"Dispatch from house to residential houses to install electronic equipment for TV, Internet, Phone "
bad,Poor management from the highest level down. Unorganized and very cut throat corporation. The company does not create a positive work environment and can be very not family friendly.
bad,I have worked for time warner cable for 11yrs but now we are spectrum since we merged with charter.  Everything has changed for us here in sales.  This is no longer a good career like it was when time warner was around.  I would never refer anyone to work for spectrum.
bad,"The job itself is not hard or complicated. But the companies way of running the business is very scattered and all over the place. There are multiple answers for every situation which in turn will cause you to scolded by someone else for doing it ""wrong"". The whole company can not keep on the same page and Most management don't care enough to try and fix said problem."
bad,"The minute Charter bought Bright House Networks, I knew all of the great things about BHN were going away very soon, and I was proven right. Spectrum doesn't care about their customers, and they especially dont care about their employees. Anything that used to build morale among the staff was summarily taken away piece by piece. The only thing that matters is the bottom line, which comes with having to answer to stockholders. Don't help the customers, but you better darn well sell them something and get them off the phone as quickly as possible. You'll be reprimanded, and likely fired, if you don't, and that is no exaggeration."
bad,"I liked the job very much my manager called me names yelled at me stood over me and was very aggressive I went to his manager who he was friends with and nothing was done,"
bad,"The people and the atmosphere at the Charlotte location of Spectrum are very cordial in a Southern way, especially considering that a Connecticut company is in charge.  The cafeteria is quite good, but not always cheap.  The online systems are in chaos, and will be for a long time to come, because three companies are being combined into one.  They simply cannot get stuff done on a timely basis."
bad,The management team was very strict on being there. They did not care what may come up with your family. Very strict on selling their products. Did not care about their employees mental health. It was a very stressful job.
bad,"Technicians are forced to work till 9PM and on weekends, mandatory overtime is common."
bad,"This job is really just that a job, it isn't a long term solution by any means. The company is going thru so many changes that no one really knows what's going on."
bad,"If you enjoy being treated as a number or just another cow in the barn, then Spectrum is the place for you.  They have no concept of the worker as a person.  No respect for talent."
bad,Ok place to work for...stresstful at times...i believe the technicians could use a pay raise for the stuff that they have to put up with on the job....but just like any other job it has its ups and downs
bad,"The job itself is not bad but the policies are. There's a continuous Business Attire dress code in this call center even on weekends and holidays,continuous micro-managing, and minimal leaway/grace for 1st time infractions even if you are new. There's disorganization amongst upper management. I personally attributed this to the merge of Charter/Spectrum and TimeWarner Cable because I was hired right after the merger, but I could be wrong and it just might be the way it is, but I don't know that for sure. Any questions about company policies and/or procedures are met with undefined answers and responsibility is passed from department to department. Pretty much, the way the company gives customers the ""run-around"" about a cable service issue is the same way they treat employees with a job-related issue (no straight answers, Until you make a mistake). Processing of new hire information, scheduling, and pay move at a snail's pace. Accomodation of one's scheduling needs is much less than desireable. the only good things I observed about the company are my co-workers, the potential commission earnings and the benefits. Apart from that, its the typical ""cut-throat"" call center environment. The company cares more about their needs, policies, and procedures than the employees needs, situations, & life events. If your about to work here, prepare to be just another statistic in their monthly reports and not a human being."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,It is a fast paced job that gets stressful due to customers attitudes when they aren't getting the answers they want. The best part of the job is when you really get to help someone and you know they are happy and satisfied.
bad,"My commission was just cut by 70%, it was just a way to get the department to all leave. we were give a 30 day notice mid year about commission charge"
bad,tho I liked the pay what I didn't like about the retention process was that they wanted you to up sale and make MORE money off of people who clearly could not afford the packages they had thus why they called to cancel so instead of helping to save a customer seems like management didn't care the goal was to get them to spend more. I did not like that morally
bad,"I worked as a business customer technician, and was still forced to try and push for sales every time I spoke with a customer.  Businesses already paid too much money for their service, and most of the time you spoke with a customer it was because there was a problem with their service, not a good time to try and get them to spend more money."
bad,"I worked at the main location down by 40th or so, next to a bar.  If that does not tell you everything, I don't know how else to describe it.  It was ratchet.  Just like the bar next to it.  You could see fights, physical and verbal.  The customers hated the service.  It was a stressful environment.  I did meet some good people there though."
bad,Must be able to work alone and manage account alone. Ability to drive and answer a phone is required. Travel to multiple properties is required. management of property maintenance is required.
bad,"conveyor belting customer on an off the phone"
bad,"was a great place when it was time warner, charter taken over and became real greedy cutting pay and taken all the fun out of work. low morale. the two years I've been there under time warner I was a model employee winning trips and prizes then spectrum comes in change all the scope of support adding more jobs with no raise that I didn't apply for and making it harder to bonus and every thing went down hill for me in two months"
bad,The recent merger has had significant negative impacts on the company to employee relationship making the work environment toxic to growth.  While the process is ongoing there seems to be more efforts implemented to save money than provide adequate customer service.
bad,"Time Warner was a great place to work where the company valued and took care of their employees. Charter takes over and destroys the TWC legacy and eliminates the way TWC operated with the Charter way, which means eliminating hundreds  of jobs and greatly reducing compensation for those who are left."
bad,I worked for Time Warner Cable as a universal tech for 10 years. Though the job was ok and the benefits were good the management sucked if corporate would just that the average Joe from the field and have him or take them though a everyday process they might see ways they can improve.
bad,"I worked for Brighthouse Networks and it was bought by Charter, after it was taken over, I was removed from one department without choice and placed into another department.  Two months after this was done the department they placed me in, they decided that it was not going to work down here in Florida and that they would be moving the job back to St. Louis, essentially laying me off since I can not move to St. Louis."
bad,"Generally a temporary spot to work. Very little movement, Management very inconsistent. Difficult to move up if you don't play office politics. It's ok if for a short time, but just don't get comfortable."
bad,"To work in customer service, you need to be able to take what comes at you. People are not mad at YOU, they are mad because they are paying for a service and something is wrong. I find it rewarding to solve these issues and make someones day. Lots of things changed on a daily basis and I learned how to do things on a roll. People want to know you are true about assisting them."
bad,"Dispatch start of day with back filling am routs with am calls to tech routs.  Pre calling un visited am calls and documenting each route and up dating field sup. of misses and late calls that could not be routed for onetime am arrival. What I learned was multitasking in a hands on way,  Dispatch management main concern is our phone monitor score, co workers feeling stressed.  The hardest part of this job is giving out late calls to other techs knowing they will be dinged for late arrival.  going home after your shift and every other Thursday which is pay day and the free cable and phone and internet  is the most enjoyable part of the job,"
bad,"If you don't mind getting yelled at everyday than this is the job for you. You can not wear you heart on your sleeves. Awesome little perks and great benefits as far as qaulity health care, pension plan, & matching 401k, that is until the new company took over. I was released before the full transition."
bad,"The pay and benefits were good, but as for working with you regarding family emergencies, job security, or advancement, is horrible."
bad,"Hard to push TV and phone in a time when many are cutting the cord. Overpriced services and everyone despised TWC. No management support to speak of. Did get free services while part of company. If you have a ""used car salesman"" mentality, then go for it. If not, you will hate every day."
bad,"If you're not meat in a seat, they don't want you. They also believe you have to dress for success.  Strict dress code and work environment.  You get a single 19"" monitor.  Stuck in their old school ways."
bad,The Charter organization as far as management is not what you would expect.  Supervisors and upper management treat employees with little to no respect. But the overall experience and one on one with customers is amazing.  Gives you the opportunity to build rapport with the customers.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Unprofessional work environment due to poor leadership. Foul language, inappropriate attire and smoking in unauthorized areas abound. Very bad work environment with televisions going all the time with inappropriate content on at times."
bad,"Over-inflated quotas, bad market reputation, makes for a very challenging job. Long time sales reps do well due to no need for sales prospecting but new reps have to work hard to build a sales funnel."
bad,"Set up for what ever live event was on the day or night, we learned how to use different types of transmission equipment to get our jobs done, however the management turned out to be very harsh and volatile, lots of mistakes that were made due to bad information was constantly blamed on the employee, we had to keep notes and paper work copied, so prove the mistake was done by following orders, the hardest part of the job was going to the job, the best part was some of the coworkers, we kind of watched each other backs."
bad,"Very high turn over rate, however there is room to grow. They offer bonuses, and contests to top performers. Nice looking company"
bad,time warner was better at the beginning gradually benefits started decreasing and the work environment became very tense
bad,"A typical day at TWC  you clock in you get 5 minutes to bring up your computer and then your on the phone taking calls helping out customers with going over the bill or trouble shooting there equipment. when I was working at TWC I learned how to multitask trouble shoot on phone, cable boxes and internet modems. Management was really good they did what they could to help and try to make employees feel good co workers are very nice its a team friendly environment you have to work together to get help on certain issues. The hardest part of working at TWC is being on the phone all day because the calls come and come and you dont get enough time to catch a breath or take a break after dealling with long stressfull calls. The most enjoyable part is when the company has team BBQs or when HBO , SHOWTIME  and STARZ come and do there presentaions."
bad,There a big company that does not treat there employees with respect the bonus structure and benifits are great but there only going to fight for there managers and anyony that has a higher status than jus being an employee
bad,Every level of management seems to be lacking on some level.  Every goal is driven by stockholders and little credence is given to running the company correctly
bad,"Bad leadership, no one talks to each other. but you get FREE cable and internet :) A company i would not prefer to return to."
bad,"I do my duties on daily bases as my title requires. "
bad,"Easy work, hours depend on type of employment. Would not recommend for long term job, stressful situations with customers on a daily basis."
bad,Company needs to improve upon sensitivity to employee needs and situational circumstances relating to schedule change.
bad,Too many goals to meet to ensure job security. Too many quotas but the incentives are great. Its hard to sell to a customer that is disconnecting their account. You job relies on how well you can sell to someone that doesn't want to or can't keep keep the service.
bad,"The pay and benefits are so great at TWC that it's hard to be wiling to give that up. However, the company itself is a terrible place to work. TWC makes such a big deal out of being diverse, but there is a major lack of women in leadership positions. TWC's good diversity ranking comes from the customer service representatives, not other staff. Being a woman in a professional capacity and being paid equally to men is as rare as a unicorn. The glass ceiling definitely exists there. If you aren't a ""Yes Man"" -- emphasis on the man -- you aren't being promoted. Drinking buddies get promoted to incompetence while a great brain drain has been taking place with people dissatisfied with the deaf ears of corporate and the nepotism of the workplace. Avoid unless you are one of the few people that can completely separate work and home life. I wanted to live to work, not work to live."
bad,"Some management is good, they treat employees like the customers overall i would go back just in other departments"
bad,"Dealing with angry customers is always bad, but thats not what you get all the time. Advancing is easy, meeting set goals is also usually easy. The pay is worth it, except for the management. The management runs the spectrum from cliquey, incompetent, and biased to overbearing, over critical, and joyless."
bad,"Work long hours, Not much room for advancement. Poor management."
bad,"Not the best company to work for.  Its all micro mananging and no one is on your side a supervisor can say anything they want and you as the tech cant back yourself up. The ONLY enjoyable thing about this employer is that they pay well, but good luck advancing they change the way they advance you every yr in a half so you think you can advance and then they change up the ""process"" once again, so you have to wait.  The only raise you get will be your annually raise, hopefully .30 raise.  They only way you can advance is by taking college courses online, which have nothing to do with your actual job, they never advance by the actual way you perform, only ""books"" Its all a numbers company, you can do the best job you have EVER done, but if ONE person calls back you get dinged within a 30 day period, even if it was a customer caused issue.  The worst part is the MANAGERS, they get new managers every other year. Every time there is a new one he wants to change what is already in affect."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Recently, the daily message has been, meet the new, sometimes unattainable sales quota's or face the possibility of being fired and expect to work on your day's off."
bad,"I have had worse positions and also much better positions.  A quick summary as a sales rep here.  Sign up as much as you can.  Bend the truth to sell the phone.  When another reps customer calls in try to get them to cancel so you make more money. I know right, your thinking ""why would I do that?""   Come work here and you will see why.  Dog eat dog pay structure.  "
bad,"Daily selling, building a pipeline of prospects that qualify for the service."
bad,"Good pay, good benefits, horrible working conditions.  Beware of the hiring Director for the Supply Chain Manager position in Birmingham.  She has lost 5 Managers in the past 2 years."
bad,I don't agree with the company's way conducting business.  Definitely a high pressure job but the thing I hated most was the constant change and disregard for customer service.
bad,"Provide customer service to roadrunner and digital phone customers"
bad,"Typical day is taking calls from irate customers. I learned how to clean up others mistakes and errors. The management is unsure of what they are doing. You will be a guinea pig unless you are going to a department that is already established. The co-workers are great and a good source of help as supervisors and managers don't know the system. Hardest part of the job is having to correct others mistake, Its a cut throat environment that you will be working in. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you log out to go home."
bad,"Job went from (my position and department) technical support emphasis to ""can you sell the most and if you fix the customers' issue, great"""
bad,"I would drive door to door trying to get people to sign up for cable, the management wasn't the greatest but I liked controlling my pay on work ethic."
bad,"The term ""micro managed"" is putting it mildly. They will only allow you to use the restroom on your 15 minute break. They constantly tell you that you can be replaced in no time, and are biased on people. They also refuse to pay out any disability claim, and will fight tooth and nail on unemployment. They have a high turn over and create a very stressful atmosphere. I have seen people literally kill over in the office and they clean the persons desk before the ambulance gets there. They refuse to let people preform CPR on coworkers, even giving life and death situations. Regardless if you're CPR certified or not!"
bad,"I worked as a customer care rep. They focus more on selling customers more services than actually resolving their issues or concerns. The training for customer care only focuses on selling and minimal troubleshooting of services. Metrics constantly change, you are penalized for scheduling service calls for service issues, and survey responses from customrrs who hate TWC count against you as an individual. They allow they sales department to do anything to get the sale which in shows a lack of integrity."
bad,"The company itself may be okay to work for, but the particular call center I was working at, I wouldn’t recommend to anyone unless it was the only option you had to put food on the table for you and your family."
bad,Don't believe the hype with this company pay is good but you will feel like you working for them morale is low alot of micro management also alot of miss communication on product and procedures
bad,"Put in six years as a broad band tech,trained new tech's did trouble calls, install's. Loved it the first two year's. Don't expect much from management  they can't do much. Spectrum see's you as a number not a person. I all way's had great number's every month but they gave a 2,000.00 check to a guy who had only been there two years and who all way's needed help doing his job's. The new area manager had to wake him up in the weekly meeting to give him the check. A customer called in and said what a great job he had done, but three of us went over there and helped bail him out. This happened everyday with him but the big boss liked him so he got the check we got nothing. Great pay and insurance. They say you get six or seven paid holiday's off but not true. They draw names every year. I got picked for Thanksgiving and Christmas three years. Installing cable on Christmas or thanksgiving? Feel's like i wasted six years of my life there.Hard work crawling under trailer's and house's, climbing telephone pole's, crawling through attic's. You will be behind all day as the routing is another problem. Load you down with more than you can do and want you to go above and beyond. You never know what your about to walk into, most job's were total messes and you get an hour, so it takes you three hour's to make it right now your behind all day and your score card take's a hit because your on time is late. Witch hit's you on your raise. Send you out for the week with three cable boxes witch you use on your first job the day you get your boxes. So now you have to call five tech's and beg for"
bad,To start the day you would go into your office and get your computer started up and running. You would then get all the programs going and running then a must was to go get your coffee in the break room to start a very busy day. I learned how to speak in meetings and learned how to handle very angry customers. The hardest part of the job was the weird hours working 1pm — 10pm. The most enjoyable would be the break room and all the nice stress relievers
bad,"The first 4.5 years were great.  Advancement seemed realistic, proven people were trusted to do their jobs without micromanagement.  Sadly, that did not last.  The culture became untenable.  Dishonesty and deception crept in.  Office politicking became commonplace.  The center adopted a philosophy where coddling and enabling substandard workers was considered the right approach.  The money was pretty decent, at least."
bad,"I currently wish not to leave a review about my experience with the company. As with all companies, there are positive and negative situations that are part of every company."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Customers are rude and management only cares about numbers and how you rank with other centers. During coaching time the supervisors make you feel stupid and that your not good enough.
bad,Only positives about my experience was the pay and the benefits. My supervisor was very rude and was always anxious due to the stress from the job. You could tell that management only cared about numbers and productivity and didn’t really care about their employees or customers. The job itself wasn’t difficult but the constant stress from upper management to make numbers and the micro management made the job stressful .
bad,"The pay and benefits are great and almost worth the insane amount of stress from working there. There is no ceiling to the amount of work they expect you to do. Supervisors and managers will continually pressure you to do more, even if it is not physically possible. You can be the best employee there, get the most done, and it still might not be enough to prevent you from being told it isn't enough. Meanwhile they pick favorites who are allowed to do nothing throughout the day (maybe you will get lucky and be one of those)."
bad,After moving to Dallas and working for ATT I was looking for an environment similar to what I used to with ATT.  This was surely not it the employees didn't care how they came to work dress and the team leads didn't care either. This place was not for me because of the atmosphere I came from.
bad,"You will love this job is you're okay with being verbally abused by customers for 8-10 hours a day. Most customers are upset and want to cancel service and you have no resources to really help them with what they want. The customer base is so unhappy and displeased with the services and they take it out on CSRs and you just have to deal with. A lot of calls result in escalations, but too many escalations will get you in trouble. The stress is too much for the little pay. You want to help the customers and do the right things, but you cant. A lot of the policies seem unethical. The job is mentally taxing. They tell you that you can advance after one year but make it almost impossible to do so unless you want to advance in the same dept. Coworkers unhappy and looking for new positions outside of the company. Hardly anyone lasts a year in billing. Extreme micromanagement."
bad,"Everything is always broken or a known issue. The tools you use to do your job, most of the chairs you have (back killer), the customer apps/equipment/etc. It's hotel seating that changes every month (so everyday you work you sit at a different desk). The metrics are stupid. There is almost no available time it's always back to back. My supervisor is amazing but her hands are tied on alot."
bad,"Management never has answers. Management adds policy and reduces time for trouble calls and installs. Warehouse never has equipment, but jobs must be completed and when you ask about equipment management says figure it out and don't be late to your 14 jobs that you can't get equipment for. Very high turnover rate due to very poor management."
bad,Call center job. First one of my career. Tools are inconsistent and everyone has a different answer to solve the issue. 10 min to resolve issues is what they grade you on. And other metrics. Shift are all over since it’s a 24/7 call center.
bad,Techs are over worked for little pay routing system is always down making tech fall behind on job routes and supervisors still question why tech run late on jobs .good luck get out on time if there are still jobs pending dispatch will not clear you to go home even if your time is up .most of the time they will ask you to stay late and pick up more work
bad,"I worked at Spectrum, taking inbound calls for internet/phone repair. They offer 5 week, paid training which is great! However, once you get out of training, you’re not offered the same type of support from management. The pay is good, however, management is TERRIBLY slow and incompetent. The hardest part, as someone else had already mentioned, is keeping up with the metrics and also constantly dealing with angry customer. Management expects you to keep up with their metrics, however, is slow at responding to questions and then gets mad when your score is low because they take too long to assist. Also, they expect you to automatically know things that they didn’t tell you beforehand and insult your intelligence when you ask for help on an issue not experienced before. Spectrum needs more competent leadership."
bad,Cares more about lawsuits than what is right.  Constantly changing commission and bonus structure as well as what they care about month to month.  Too many shady sales reps.
bad,"When I left, calls were almost constantly back to back from 8:00 AM until well after I left for the day. If you’re okay with a fast pace environment, this is fine, but the heavy focus on stats by management makes it hard to help a customer out for long without them commenting on your call length. Before I left I was on a top performer list, so it’s not impossible to do well, but it really feels like you aren’t allowed to go the extra mile for the customer like they say they want you to. Lack of after call time is annoying too, as you’re expected to complete everything during the call and hop immediately back in, so there really was no time to breathe. "
bad,the hardest part of the job is where thing always change back and forth. and no one knows untill the last second  management  each person has their own way of doing things then backing out when you need their help
bad,Job is amazing until you need something from your employer other than a schedule. They do not work with you or give you any leeway unless you make it a year into employment with out any issues including or not excluding family emergencies or medical issues .
bad,Management is under so much pressure it breeds negative energy on the floor..Nothing but attitudes when you ask them a question..but they barely know the answer anyways.every last single one of them power trips...high turnover
bad,"metrics are garbage along with all upper management"
bad,Technical support is highly stressful. Customers are allowed to curse and swear at you. You have to remain professional but many times there is nothing you can do to solve or fix the problem. Leaves you feeling helpless.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Enjoyed the work, working with the clients and public. Creating videos from start to finish was very rewarding. Coordinating multiple projects was challenging at times."
bad,Loved the work itself and my co workers.... however. training givea a false sense of support once on the floor my supervisor particularly was not helpful if I were able to get on a different team and yav better management I probably would have stayed because everything else was decent
bad,when i first started it was a great place to work but after management changed it became stressful and management was poor did not care about employees or how they felt about anything. when you have issues about anything or problems they are never around to assist you .
bad,"The job used to be great before main office and multiple management changes. People in charge that don't do your job telling you how to is insanity. So heavily micro managed you cant do anything without being wrong somehow. If you can get past all that (being a new guy there), it may not be bad. I do really like the job itself and meeting all the new people and different issues."
bad,"My experience at spectrum was chaotic. The company was undergoing a million and one changes with little to no help from the leadership team. It honestly was a mess, as a tech I was getting home 3 hours late every night because the company phone system wasn't working."
bad,"The benefits and perks offered were not enough to maintain a healthy balance between work and home life.  Stressful calls, unsupported solutions, minimal communication with Supervisors to support."
bad,Unprofessional lack of training unorganized negative environment no seating revolving door people always quit short staff always hiring mean customers
bad,"As a former employee of Time Warner Cable, being completely transparent I believe that Charter Communications ruined 'Spectrum' which is now the amalgam of TWC, Brighthouse, and Charter. "
bad,"Poor Management: Management had a double standard as what you were held to and what they were allowed to do, "
bad,I worked for Spectrum for approximately 2 years and my Metrics were always good and yet I was never able to advance into further roles. I even had the background knowledge in the IT field such as Desktop Support and Network Administrator yet was never given a chance to prove myself. I would always speak to upper management about growth and even left the company and came back to give the company a 2nd shot. I can not stand the company with how I was treated as some one who has the knowledge and know how to do great and yet I was treated like some one right off the street.  If they were to call me and offer a job in Cyber Security or In-House Desktop Support I would take it but never again as an entry level Help Desk Agent.
bad,"Time Warner Cable respected its employees; can't say the same about Charter Communications aka Spectrum. Since merger, benefits are reduced, salary is unbalanced between legacy employees and newhires. Trust has waned."
bad,"Charter cable is dba Spectrum. Upper management doesn't care about employees, only points and investors. They have created a hostile work environment. The turnover rate is the highest I have ever seen. Employees are micromanaged. No incentives to work."
bad,Different environment now than the previous company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the individuals I worked with. We were more of a family than co-workers
bad,"I did enjoy working at Spectrum. I get to help people to maintain  there health care by getting a doctor for the company to comply with the clients primary doctor about there well being every month. Also having a nurse to come check in every week. I have set appointments. an assist in office duties answering phone , taking messages, filing fax filles"
bad,"I came on board at the very moment it merged with Charter Communications.  It was not a smooth process and interfered with our pay structure, holding up our commission checks.  I left after just a few months because of this."
bad,It was very stressful to work at spectrum. Little to no help or support from peers. The matrix system was a joke. It was very draining. Ok pay and benefits.
bad,"Since Brighthouse Networks was bought out in the merger of Time Warner, the company has lost it's focus on customer satisfaction and focuses mainly on their call center metrics."
bad,"While the compensation and benefits are pretty good, the work-life balance is a bit off kilter. Very old school principles and management in place. Dress is corporate with little-to-no exceptions. The culture is very 'punch a time-card' although majority employees are salaried. No ability to work from home or have a flexible schedule. Would not recommend to a friend who prefers to have the ability to manage their own work schedule or time. Also, favoritism plays a big role in who gets promoted, very common to be stuck in the same titles for a few years because there is 'no room for promotions' or very limited opportunity."
bad,If you have any other option please go with the other option the turn around in this job is real and its because the job is pretty much unfair out of my class of 30 only like 3 remained
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"This job will do you well if you have any family you need to take care of and don't mind having your humanity ripped from you. There is extreme corporate nepotism at Spectrum. You are timed on everything you do. They also track everything you do with metrics and send them to all the staff on your team. If you use the bathroom during other times than your break, they put that into a special time category and will send those to your team as well. Nobody really cares about the numbers, its just a fear tactic."
bad,"Fun and exciting job working with some really great and knowledgable people.  The experience I've gained has been great and has taken me to sports venues throughout Ohio and beyond."
bad,"I was outperforming most of my coworkers. In order to gain a foot hold to the next tier, you will need to be well liked by management. No assessment of current skills or evaluations to technical skills are necessary to advance to a lead position or supervisor. Most supervisors just read off what they see on a the screen to evaluate your performance. "
bad,Not a fan.  Company struggling to maintain size in a declining industry by purchasing other systems.  Integrating these while continuously improving the core operation is not feasible given the size of the management/operational team.
bad,"This job would not have been a bad job if the focus would have been on ""customer service"" and not time management! When I first entered the job market and trained in customer service, office procedures, etc, the focus was on the customer and not getting them off the phone within 5 minutes. My focus in helping the customer was in making sure that the customer did not have to call back, that all their problems were resolved to the best of my ability. That's customer service!!"
bad,"Overall the company is a decent company to work for. But they have management issues to iron out and work on. They recently acquired a larger company and don't know which direction to go. Which causes confusion with the direct reports. And usually the employee doesn't leave the company, they leave the management."
bad,"After the acquisition by charter, the culture and respect for employees went way down. not to mention their prices are not competitive at all compared to AT&T and other competitors. benefits were also reduced post merger. lots of confusion. after alkmost 2 years there it was horrible to see it go down this far. My entire hiring class has left for other jobs."
bad,I enjoyed most of the people I worked for but it is run with a bottom line mentality that is not friendly to the workers.  It feels that management does not care about the employees as long as management is doing their role in their swim lane and they don't cross the line.
bad,Benefits are great for a large corporation. Pay is comparable to other call center style work. Very strict rules in the call center. Management can be pretty tough.
bad,"This is a very high stress work environment with little recognition for good performance. There is not a lot of positive things to say about this company. They have high demands for you to sell and no matter how much you sell, it's not enough, they want you to sell or attempt to sell on every call to help the company make more profit."
bad,At Charter Spectrum a typical day would consist of Logging in to your job device and seeing was services you had to provide for the day.Once clocked in I would travel to the location and install services.
bad,"typical day is sitting at your desk praying you get sales calls. Most calls are misrouted but you are still expected to sale to those customers (talk them into buying a product). It was alot better when it was brighthouse communications. Since Charter took over the culture is totally different. They are not about helping the customer, but getting the customers $$$."
bad,The acquisition of Time Warner Cable and merging of 3 companies into Spectrum has had negative repercussions on its front-line employees.  The company focus is now more on KPI than their employees' success. We are no longer people and are now just numbers.  It's a shame. Our health care coverage is now very poor under Charter Communications and we are numbers rather than people.
bad,Working at Charter was not the same when Time Warner management took over.  They systematically laid the Charter Management off.  This atmosphere trickles down.
bad,"I accepted a position at Spectrum as an entry level position into the IT industry. I knew that it was going to be a lot to learn and was really excited to dig in and get started. From the start it was nothing but confusion. I understand they are a large company (but the office I work for is small) but there is absolutely no communication. I was told 6 weeks for training, and we actually only received a few weeks and then thrown on the phones with little to know information on the systems we were supposed to use to troubleshoot. There were days we would come into training and would sit for hours without instruction. You don't have your own desk because the building I work in is too small, so you have to ""hotel"". You can't keep anything at your desk and have a limited amount of time to get your computer up and running with all the programs needed for the day. It is loud and managers walk about and scream across the call floor at one another and it is completely distracting. Their pay is on average $5 less per hour than their competitors. The benefits are great, they match up to 6% on 401k and have a 3% pension (until they are bought out by someone else) and they also have a partnership with Devry University where they will pay up to $5250.00 per year (beholding you to the company for a year). The benefits and experience are about the only positives I can see at this business."
bad,With the merger is ushered in a new pay structure that was literally half of what was paid out before. Long hours with weekends and long lines of disgruntled customers makes for a long day. At least pre merger you would go home thinking well at least I got paid well today.
bad,Charter/Spectrum seems to be having an identity crisis - what's the name of your company?  Hint - it's Not Spectrum.   Works flows from the top down - so of course users of Charter applications will never get what they need/want...Sad.
bad,"Read up on Charter's culture before working here. Salary and benefits are great, but the business does not support its employees, nor has it come to terms with modern benefits. This is not an employee centric organization and it does not work to keep its most valuable employees."
bad,"A typical day at work would include vendor management, facilities planning & engineering, budgeting/ forecasts, Quotes, PO’s, emergency repair, critical maintenance scheduling, ensuring standard operating procedures, interpreting monitoring systems, MOP creation/implementation and project management of ongoing CI projects."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Even before there was a huge disparity between mgmt and rev generating workers. "
bad,Job is great if you need one bad and or is a great starter job but we are currently the least paid in industry for line of work as well.  Lots of great training available to sharpen skills but metric and process conflict.
bad,"I started out at TWC, but this year they became Spectrum. Sometime working at a cable company its not that fun, but TWC would look for their workers. When Spectrum came they changed everything."
bad,"Sales in Austin came to a very slow pace as we were bought out and had to adhere to their sales methods.  "
bad,It was a call center. very hectic and loud. a lot to learn but decent incentives and commission for selling certain promotions and tv packages. Im not sure how spectrum is but time Warner cable was like that.
bad,Rocky transition from Brighthouse to Charter Spectrum. I am sure that things will get better as time goes on. Many of the benefits I wanted when I got hired are gone but I think it will get better with time.
bad,"You spend 8 hours of your day taking call after call, dealing with many different types of people. When first hired, You are trained on the programs the policies and how to take calls before they put you out on the floor on your own team. and you do have resources and people to ask for help and answer questions at all times. You meet a lot of great people, and the opportunities there are endless, you can move up any where you put your mind to. The hardest part of this job is by far the typical ""call center"" vibe that you might hear stories about and taking calls constantly. But the most enjoyable part about this job, is that you do meet a lot of great people and you do feel a sense of pride knowing that you help people everyday to the best of your abilities and you have all of this knowledge of things you never thought you would know. This job can get very stressful, and you have to be a good multitasker and people person in order to work here."
bad,Base pay is not that great for store associate but commission is nice and there is room to advance. There is not a work life balance with Charter since they are open 365.
bad,Eliminated department with Time Warner/Charter merger over conference call.  Would have loved working with Charter Spectrum if they treated their employees more like a human.
bad,"Charter is a fantastic place to grow and advance your career. Their footprint is all over the map and you could pretty much relocate anywhere you would like. On the other hand, they are petty. Since they took over, worker moral has dipped. Things like regulating bathroom time and focusing solely on numbers and not customer satisfaction are huge turn offs."
bad,The company provides employees with free cable TV and internet service as well as a match for a percentage of the 401K.
bad,"Excellent People in telecommunications , the salary was well below industry. moreover to many clicks internally that held up progress, TWC is finally Charter and no room for I hope the culture stays the same."
bad,"Very good company to work for. The benefits are really good. Love the variety of work and meeting new and different people. "
bad,I would still be there now if it wasn't for the poor management.  The Director cared only for how he did and not truly care of the feelings of the front line.
bad,"The wages and commission structure are what drove me in. Way back when I was in training I immediately learned that this company is very strict with attendance and adherence to policy. I heard many times that ""we understand life happens"" in regards to having to be late but that wasn't really true. If you're late twice during the 8 week training program you could have your employment up for review to be terminated. A recent training class began at 16 and dwindled to 5 before they were done. Although that is uncommon even for Charter that doesn't negate the fact that Management will leave you feeling expendable."
bad,"Great co-workers however micro-managed and although they had a great benefits program, I felt that I would be working for another company, I spent many years with the company and would still thank them for the opportunity to work for them."
bad,"It is an okay company to work for. The pay is great, but sometimes you seem to work like a slave. I did not like the hours I had to work"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"A typical work day involved a hectic schedule which needed the immediate attention of a supervisor to help with routing issues, customer support issues or dispatch support. The big issue is that the supervisor was never where he was supposed to be and you had to make your schedule work. So I did just that and kept a positive outlook on the days work schedule. I did what I could in what time I had and managed my time accordingly to the area I was working in. One day I would work the whole city of Greenfield, the next day I'd be in Pewaukee, Delafield, Eagle and further out. There was never a quiet schedule or day while working for Time Warner."
bad,It's an ok job and the hours are great but the pay is bad and room for advancement is not so good. The free cable services are good
bad,they make it so hard to get a raise not fair i do the same jobs as a guy thats getting max pay which makes 5 times more  then i do . i just think they can have a better ranking system
bad,"Although TWC has some good products and the financial ability to provide for customers and employees, they have become so focused on internal agendas and driving stock prices that they have forgotten that their customers and employees are the lifeblood of their business.  The management team is too busy playing politics and trying to impress their superiors in following detrimental plans that they have failed to listen to their employees and customers.  The drive to cut expenses and employees to temporarily show a better bottom line for stock holders in the proposed Comcast buyout was the epitome of short sightedness and sacrificed long term growth and customer service for the sake of stock price windfalls for those at the very top of the organization."
bad,Nice if u can just stay in Business Class...Resident services pay less and more is required of you.
bad,"Hard to advance and they micromanage.The employees were great but management sucked The would block you from going to a different department if you were a good worker, They could never put in a good word for you to another hiring manager. I have nothing more to say."
bad,Company was managed poorly and closed because of poor decisions made by upper management. Company did not really focus on taking care of employees or its furture
bad,"Advancement with the company is ""good ol' boys"" system. HR does not seem to be concerned with the subordinates, as they take care of the management team first and then company's image."
bad,"Actual work was great, coworkers were even better, but Management was the worst ever experienced. Micro management at it best! From the moment you arrive to work to the minute you leave, management would be on constant supervision. If all dispatchers would be allowed work freely the work would get done with a smile on everyone's face and a wonderful attitude!"
bad,"•	Responsible for generating new revenue for the Time Warner Business enterprise division.  "
bad,"working here was amazing! i learned so much and moved up pretty fast, it taught me to not be afraid to learn anything new, to not doubt my work abilities. The changes? were never ending with this company, and the way certian people were favored in the office was unreal.  The one thing i dislike about the job was having to apoligize over and over for prices, and changes made on accts that they were not notified on."
bad,"Interview Experience:"
bad,Non of the management team was on the same page. It was so stressful that there was people the would have seizures almost once a month or would simple just pass out.
bad,The culture and training at bright house has been very below standards.  For all the work service techs do in the field all day we are under paid.
bad,"Working here i learned a lot of things, even though this great opportunity is over, i'm taking this job as being a stepping stone for something much greater..."
bad,scripts wasnt a fan of them. pushy incentives management was tough. hardest part of the job was getting nice people on the phone or hoping to change someones attitude with a deal for them
bad,"The typical day at Charter was assisting techs as needed. I learned alot about the cable industry. Management was horrible, mostly people that were related to other managers, the lack knowledge of the job, and really was unprofessional. The co-workers were okay, most were very helpful if needed. The hardest part of the job, is educated consumers on what is going with their cable, and assisting. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service, if you have great customer service skills, the job is a breeze, and enjoyable."
bad,The job is stressful and it's best to get promoted before your in a position for too long then it is almost impossible to move up. If you work in customer service be prepeared to have your job threating everyday. The give impossible goals and tellts all from coporate rules are changing all the time. one of the most stressful job i have EVER had do not work in customer service @ this job
bad,"I worked for 9 years, really 4, because they acquired Adelphia Communications. The job environment is not fun. A lot of pressure to meet the goals of the call center. Discrimination. Difficult to grow."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Benefits are great.  Pay is good.  Training is easy.   Customers yell at you all day.  It will take awhile to get your scores up. After you are there awhile they will makeup a reason to fire you.
bad,"You have the opportunity to make great money, but between the management and duties of the job, there was really not a whole lot that compelled me to come to work everyday."
bad,This job has great benefits as well as room to progress to other departments.  You must be a team player with great customer service skills. Being a people person will help a great deal.
bad,"I can’t speak for all of spectrum but my experience was awful. I had a completely different idea of who I would be working with before I started, and even the first week was good. After 1 month I was laid off but I was provided no good training and the gossip and bad talk about others was consistent. They wanted someone who would not be afraid to ask questions but I got ignored and treated poorly when I did."
bad,"At Spectrum they make it hard because the rules don't apply to everyone.  Companies have rules and regulations in place to make the workplace a fair and unbiased environment. If not followed by everyone, it makes for an unhealthy work environment."
bad,"The opportunity for advancement is good, if you know the right people and mingle. I've never worked for a company that singled out contractors as much as them. Access to simple doors in cafe, outdoors or gym are restricted for contractors."
bad,Been there 6 years. No room for growth. Favoritism. Not a fun place to work. Micro manage employees. High call volume handle 40-50 calls in 8 hours. Dealing with irate customers
bad,"While I am grateful for my job, Spectrum is an extremely stressful and unreasonably demanding company to work for. Company policies change from email to email so it is nearly impossible to keep up with what is expected of us. It has never been more apparent to me and my coworkers that our employer does not value us as morale is at an all-time low. Career progression at the service technician level is as slow or as rapid as you are willing to apply yourself yet promoting to other departments can and does take years. Relationships with coworkers in other departments are nearly impossible as we are so disjointed from each other; expected to work productively and positively together while being given conflicting goals on a daily basis. I do not recommend applying to this company unless you are motivated to be overworked and undervalued."
bad,Management is terrible and there’s nothing that changed about that. They are messy and not mature enough for their role. It sets an awful tone/culture for the whole environment! They don’t work with schedules and show favoritism... so beware!
bad,"I wish i could score higher, and two years agon this review would be a shiny 5 stars. Since the merger, the company has lost touch. This line of work can be frustrating,  and they used to seat down and speak to you as a person and talk to you. Now, they hand you a pre-printed EAP paper, say ""hope you feel better"" and continue to work. It used to be an environment of care, now it's a sour bitter pit."
bad,"I can only speak for the office that I worked out in Smyrna, GA. "
bad,Unrealistic sales goals. Pressure. No sales training. Advancement only if you kiss butt. Commission was good. Loved my co workers. I had my own cubby.
bad,"Inconsistent and bad policies for both employees and customers. Left to clean up the mess that the Upper Management made. Local management is doing their best, but there is only so much that they can do. Corporate is not listening. All they care about is stats. Nothing else. Which blinds them to what is really going on. Want to stay, but I can't handle much more. The stress is killing me. I have to take care of myself - even if that means losing money. I hope that they get their act together before I am forced to move on."
bad,Started off as a great place to work. Until we started transitioning to a mobile call center. Then the focus was mobile and billing agents that weren't transitioned yet were left behind with no support for escalated phone calls. This is on top of the fact that the customers are downright evil and rightfully angry at Spectrum and in turn all their employees.
bad,a typical work day consists over being overworked with no time for lunch. managment has changed drastically since time warner was bought out and it feels like the company is moving backwards
bad,"This place is fine to work if you are looking for something to keep you afloat financially, your peers will help you make it through even the most stressful days because everyone is respectable of each other."
bad,"Spectrum is managed by top leadership that learned their management styles in the 1980's and have not changed since that time.  They do not understand how to manage a 21st century workforce and policies such as no work-from-home or remote work arrangements drive off good talent as well as prevent good talent from applying.  This leads to good job security for those who wish to continue working for the company, but also leads to burnout as staffing levels are not adequate for the amount of work necessary to operate an enterprise as large as Spectrum.  If top leadership of the company would address these issues, this would be a good place to work.  But with the current philosophy coming from the top management, the company has a poor culture and not a pleasant place to work."
bad,This is the most disconnected company I've worked for. There is very little communication between departments & very little integrity on the sales side of things.
bad,"The job is more demanding of your time then lead on in hiring process. Routing is very disorganized causing you to work 1-3 hours away from home. The appointments are over stacked causing little time in between to commute to next job. This has a negative effect on your progress which is out of your control. While the discounts are nice the poor routing, angry customers, and required overtime are not worth the pay. Management does not seem concerned about tech grievances only making money."
bad,Typical day includes engagement with peers and customers working towards resolution of concerns and selling products in a fast-paced environment.  The most enjoyable part of the day is meeting with agents and coaching them to success.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"The Florence Call Center for Spectrum has eliminated several positions and shifted work rolls for the entire center 3 times in less than 2 years.  With the recent shift from Billing Specialist to Outbound Telemarketing they have cut all front end employee pay by 30-40%  The Supervisors attempt to keep moral high, but are given little to work with.  At this time, I would not suggest employment with Spectrum."
bad,"All I can say is your just a number here, unless you are friends with the ""higher ups"" you will never get promoted. Job can have its perks but always wondering if you are still going to have a job the next day is super stressful."
bad,"Management changes after the TWC/CHARTER merger left the video services dept in a very bad place.  I would not recommend the new Charter for any developer trying to truly ""advance"" their career."
bad,My time at Spectrum was mixed bag of feeling. Initially i  joined working for Time Warner Cable during that period i was excited to go to work even when the days were hard. Once the transfer to Spectrum I felt that i was not given the told to do my job correctly.
bad,"There was no consistency. My supervisor was always so busy with other stuff, after being on his team 3 months, I was coached 1 time with our lead. There was constant sporadic changes. Even after an organized shift bid I didn't meet my new supervisor until 3 days after new shift started. These are just a few things. The HR team was horrible and little to no help."
bad,People love to yell at you over the phone because they would never see your face. It was upper stressful. Overnights were the worst because that’s when the perverts would come out. The pay didn’t match the abuse we received. Some managers sucked but most were cool. I didn’t mind working there but it was emotionally draining coming home.
bad,"I had absolutely no problem with the work I was doing. In fact, I found the billing shstem that I used daily relatively easy, and customers were easy to handle. The company itself is what drove me away... Uncaring bosses, bosses that neglect to respond or answer their phones/PMs, vague direction, decisions that didn't make sense, unfair scheduling... etc."
bad,I am not a sales person I am a customer service person and I told them this from the moment they hired me yet they tried to push me into being a sales person and made my life horrible until I quit.
bad,"Manage and over see performance of my team and what the demands might need to be covered"
bad,"I initially loved my job but there's some missing perks that would've been greatly appreciated and maybe help with the amount of stress you deal with on calls daily. There's no cafeteria, no gym or any form of stress relief. The hourly doesn't really compare with most other call centers. You don't really have the proper tools to help customers the way you think you would for a multi-billion dollar corporation and you get cursed out daily for the poor, ever changing company policies and inconsistencies among your co-workers due to the revolving door of employees newly hired and not properly trained because the job is a joke considering you're handling customers billing info and getting reamed daily but you get paid slightly more than a Walmart employee or gas station attendant. The health benefits are not bad and the vacation, personal and sick pay are about the best things about the job because you're going to need every hour you can to getaway, that is if you can find available time off. You also do get free cable with all the premium channels, internet and home phone which is alright I guess. Better pay to afford rent and food is better than free cable in my opinion."
bad,"The company does a lot to make the work environment friendly and comfortable, but doesn't do enough to prepare you for the level of stress brought on by the job itself."
bad,Individuals in and out of the community Take them out on a daily basis to museums Parks malls.Help individuals learn how to live in society count money shop go to the library.Some of the individuals work so when they get paid we would take them to the bank teach them how to sign in cash their checks and then shop and get the necessities that they need
bad,"While I like the flexibility of Spectrum for Outside sales reps, the opportunity to make  a satisfactory living was just not there for me. Too many variables that dictate success in my opinion, (territory, competition, reputation of the company on the heels of Time Warner, etc). If not for a great supervisor, I would have left a long time ago."
bad,"I love working at Spectrum and love the challenge but I feel our job security is not there. I work 6 days per week and go door to door selling services. My team is great as well as my direct supervisor. The hardest part of the job is going door to door and trying to make people understand that Spectrum is a new company, not Time Warner Cable. I enjoyed working the job, meeting new people, and considering I am definitely a customer advocate, any of my customers I signed up for services would definitely, and have, referred me to others."
bad,"Typical day includes getting equipment and Truck ready in the morning. Then heading out to the field (customers homes) & either repairing or installing cable, Internet & phone services. No 2 jobs (homes) are the same due to various obstacles & home layouts."
bad,"I planned on retiring from TWC.  It was an excellent place to work!! The job, the benefits, the people, all outstanding!  "
bad,"Spectrum/Charter is hiring a whole bunch of people for this job title basically sight unseen and based on 15-20 minute phone interviews without much detail on the job so let me help. There are also a bunch of staffing companies looking for people for ""GIS Network Designer"" or ""CAD Designer"" jobs at Spectrum but don't be fooled because there is no GIS involved. The job is hardcore Microstation and RF design so if you don't have at least a little background in CAD or RF you're already behind the curve and it's a mighty steep curve. If you’re lucky you’ll get a few weeks in the office before you get thrown into 2 weeks of heavy duty training classes for Microstaion ED-COMM but if you’re not lucky and have only been in the office for a short time before the classes your tenure at Spectrum may also be really short. What they don't tell you is your job is contingent on passing a test after being thrown into to the 2 weeks of training which is why you need to have at least some background in ustation or RF design otherwise you won't make it. Do yourself a favor and don’t go for the money if you talk with a recruiter about this job. If you don’t have some background in CAD or RF you should keep looking and spare yourself the hassle of being micromanaged and have your time wasted like I did."
bad,"A very lack-luster environment (in my area anyway). Not professional, not organized and lacking direction of any sort. Poor communication from the top down."
bad,"Working as a call center agent you must know what you're talking about. If you're not confident (or don't like lying...) customers will eat you alive. It's pretty important that you've had experience in a call center before or it will be very stressful. The management is good, but they don't really take the time to teach you anything about telecommunications. You have to learn as you go, which can make the job difficult."
bad,"Charter/Spectrum is the epitome of the word ""corporation"" in all the worst respects.  There are so many things wrong with the company, I could literally go on for hours, but like a doctor diagnosing a patient, you have to start with the symptoms and see what they point to.  I could tell you about the 30 year old billing system that they still utilize for account and equipment management, or the records kept in triplicate every time a call comes in (like a joke out of a bad movie), or how about the daily gamble of which support tools will be out of service on which day.  Yes, hours could be spent on these topics but in the end it all comes down to bad leadership."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"Spectrum destroyed the great atmosphere that was Time Warner in Austin."
bad,Its a great stepping stone for most people but there is no room for advancement so if you want to just stay at a job an work then its a good job but if you wanna move forward it might take awhile.
bad,"When owned and run as Bright House, it was a good company to work for. Now that it has been purchased by Charter, it has become a large corporation with little regard to employee concerns."
bad,"Time Warner Cable has some great benefits but this also comes with some major company issues. The actual employee benefits are one of the best out there, great coverage decent prices. The work itself is not too difficult but the customers can be a lot of the times, working in the call center business you will find out that people will be more direct and difficult at times due to the form of interaction with the customer. Being so big and changing so often a big issue with Time Warner Cable is that they are not on the same page throughout the company, what one manager says will not and usually does not match what another manager says. This creates lots of confusion for the employees and that then gets passed down to the customer. Agents performing tasks that have been changed or removed completely due to not being informed properly, even prices can be different depending on what agent you reach since not all are given the same source material or promo codes. You are also not allowed to use the ""After Call"" feature that is IN THE PROGRAM THEY MADE to completely finish a customers account, be it notating or making a change to the service plan. Due to the nature of the job it is very hard to always follow adherence since you cannot always control the duration of a call, but you are penalized for it, this is due to the poor setup of breaks and lunches and the flexibility of adjusting to call duration. Many times the company changes what they prioritize in the ""Score Card"" and agents must adjust to this sometimes monthly, the issue is that it can mean they prefer a faster call time"
bad,"While they have excellent benefits and opportunities for overtime and advancement that keep you there, it's fast paced and stressful environment with some very difficult customers and sometimes even worse upper management. It's not for everyone."
bad,"Well life and work balance is not there, i like the job its self management wasn't great they didn't work with you and did minimal one to one meeting to improve performance. Compensation and benefits were amazing."
bad,"Corporations in America are desperately trying to swing the pendulum backwards before there were such things as unions, benefits, paid time off, etc. Their goal ultimately is to compete with other third world countries and their slave wage labor force with hazardous working conditions and zero benefits. Their only goal is to enrich the top 1% at the suffrage of the common person."
bad,It's definitely not a place I would recommend anyone to work without having a strong back bone. I was cussed out at least 6 times a day and hung up on repeatedly. I hated the fact I never felt as though I had job security because they were changing things up so often I never felt safe.
bad,You will have to work every weekend...Only time you are off on weekend is if you use vacation. It takes at least 9 months to a year to get a Mon -Fri Position.
bad,its ok but high turn over . No work life balance and expiations can be to much . This review wants me to go more in to detail what can I say its a job you work in all weather you lift and craw on and under houses you deal with customers daily and you come home to do it all over again . benefits are great but because they offer a lot the expect even more out of you .
bad,"Constant calls, constant long queues leading to irate customers when they reach you. 2 pages of call flow, most centered on up-selling customer and only one question on resolution."
bad,"If you love knocking on doors or being on the phone for minimum pay for long hours, then this is definitely not the place for you.  All the support jobs have been moved to California or New York.  Too many good people have been let go the last 2 years"
bad,"Charter was not a great place to work. Management changed constantly, everyone was unhappy. The work schedule was ridiculous. Everyone who calls in is angry."
bad,"the work is terrible you get yelled at all day long because people get terrible cable int and phone service and their bills just keep creeping up, the job pretty much focuses on teaching you how to manipulate people into being ok with paying more for bad service there is no flexibility in the work schedule if you get hired you're definitely working 3-midnight until they do a ridiculous shift bid then you're literally bidding between an entire call center of 200+ people on the shift you want so good luck...oh yea and they took pay bonus away and the ""coachings"" are them making you listen to a call you had and even if its great they will pick it apart and make you feel incompetent"
bad,"I saw a lot of good people come and go, all the way up to a greedy lawyer turned CEO who could not wait to sell the company to the highest bidder so he could cash out, after the old CEO died of cancer."
bad,Fast paced sales position with high emphasis on driving sales and meeting sales expectations. Customer facing position with high demand for sales attainment.
bad,Does  not invest in employees i have worked here over 3 years on phones with the highest degree and yet every position applied to i have not been approves for. So if your looking to grow within your profession you may want to reconsider but great job for customer service and several other potions.
bad,"The jobs we were assigned were easy and challenging too. The company was very hard on their employees, and made you always feel like you were on edge of losing your job. Also many were suspended without proper notice or warnings and were many times placed on two week suspensions."
bad,"The company has great benefits, cable, health insurance & 401K. They provide little to none training on systems or job functions. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. The company is too big to concern it's self with consistency."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,typically workers in the company are over-worked and under paid. The CEO's do not seem to bother with how the employees or even the residents are being treated as long as they are making money.
bad,"great benefits, weak management, great product offerings and very competitive in the marketplace but difficult yo move within the company unless you know someone."
bad,Management breathes over your shoulder every day. CEO keeps trying to sell. Company looks for every and any reason to let go of its employees. Decent job to start off with if you are fresh out of high school. For folks who want stability this job is not for you.
bad,"This is a very stressful, fast-paced company to work for, at least at the customer service level.  It is changing and there are opportunities for growth if you are able to hang in there to be eligible.  Good bonus structure, but you have to work for it."
bad,"Time Warner Cable offered good benefits to its employees but overall, wasn't pleased with the atmosphere in the workplace. I did have the opportunity to learn more things about the products/services offered by Time Warner Cable and the most enjoyable part of the job was incentives given for different contest among co-workers.  The morale could have been better and management wasn't very supportive."
bad,Repair coax and fiber to maintain service to the customer.  Lots of overtime and on calls.
bad,"A typical work day started by receiving our route. I would go from home to home fixing each problem that I came across for example a bad remote control, internet not working, or picture breaking up issue. We usually worked a 10 hour day, but depending on the workload some days we would work an 11 or 12 hour day. The hardest part of the job is your workloads. They were very unpredictable due to you didn’t really know if any type of updates or outages had happened through the night, so planning things at home or having event to attend were really hard to plan for. "
bad,"Great benefits. very difficult job, you constantly get yelled at, have very little support, and there's always something you are doing wrong. During training you are not told or prepared for the abuse that you take while on phones. 90% of customers are beyond rude and have no concept of manners, and you are not able to say anything to them, aside from ""i apologize"" and ""i'm sorry you feel that way."" again, has fantastic benefits, but you need them with the health issues you will establish."
bad,The company is always changing and you have to be able to adapt to the environment with each change. The management is not the fairest. Most times you get into supervisory or manager roles based on peoples personal feelings versus your work ethics and habits. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with some people that you can learn from.
bad,"Charter offers great benefits but nothing special compared to anywhere else as long as you work FT. Management is dumb. They will pound you to get paperwork done but when it comes to them doing it they are turtles. It's easy to get hired but the turn over rate is ridiculous. Honestly felt like I was in high school working there. They will pass out candy, balloons, prize incentives, and they do kid activities/contest."
bad,"Motivation, determined and patience . If you have patience you have everything, the managers and recruiters are super nice and willing to help you through anything"
bad,"Theres a problem if as soon as you meet coworkers they're talking about an exit strategy from the company.  "
bad,"Poor management. Training is 3 weeks long but does not set you up for once you are on the floor. Management is patient for the first week but does not help much when you are struggling. Constant complaints from customers and tools break down often. Spectrum does not believe in pleasing the customer. A highly stressful environment with a high turn over. Benefits and pay are good, but not worth the quality of life."
bad,"The pay and benefits given are fantastic, but the customers and management will destroy your mental health unless you have skin thicker than hide. Also, you must be ready for your tools to break consistently when they're pushed out before they're ready, frustrating not only you but those calling in as well."
bad,"Sometimes you may have a good supervisor. Sometimes you’ll get one who never should have been put in management. They pay you well but it’s essentially hazard pay. It’s an awful work wnvironmentThey will promote you and get rid of your job and throw you back to customer care. They do not care about their employees, you are just a number."
bad,"I stayed too long. I hated it.  Customers have no filter, they want you to fix it and NOW.  Management was not supportive.  Terrible, just terrible!  I am glad I am gone now."
bad,"The interview process went very well. the process went very fast and a few days later I was onto the 2nd round interview. The management team seemed like they were very knowledgeable and business-like, but was very curious about the culture and how they treated their employees. I soon found out the environment was rigorous and needs more focus on employees."
bad,"Was hired for a specific position that never became fully funded and is going to disband.  Do not feel I have spent enough time there to realize the full potential, as the bulk of time has been becoming familiar with the teams and process, which continues to change daily."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,I would not advise people to work there. You are underpaid. The building I worked in was filthy. The comftorbality and friendlyness lacked immensely. There was the rare okay manager.
bad,They not a good company but dont pay far for all the work u have to do an the time off polices now is bad they try to do things like having fun time an picnic  but I feel not enough
bad,It is a beautiful facilities very eco friendly. Room for advancement. Not all upper management deals fairly. The hardest part of the job is the fast pace environment.
bad,"It was occasionally stressful when it was Time Warner Cable, but the only metric they looked at was customer satisfaction scores. Then the old CEO resigned and died because of cancer, and the new CEO couldn't sell the company fast enough. That's when Charter came in and changed the positions entirely to 6 calls/hour average, plus upselling, plus using certain scripts, and later combined the roles of tech support, billing, and sales into one role."
bad,no thanks. it’s your pay or your mental and emotional stability. constant changes and pressure to main stats all while they constantly make changes within the center as well as with the service to have  extremely upset customers call in and yell at you and use profanity while forcing you to put up with the disrespect and dont let you hang up on a customer EVER. no matter what profanities they are screaming in youthe changed they make is as if they WANT you to fail. ear.
bad,"I left a very stable job to join the wonderful call center I worked at. 6 months into employment on my day off I got a call that the center is being closed, and everyone is being laid off. I was floored. It was such a wonderful job with great people, and room for advancement. They told us the center was closing for being ""too small"". Which, doesn't make sense for a company this big they could have bought a new building and relocated. I believe it was a political reason. It put a lot of hard workers."
bad,"In Hawai'i Island, a large majority of the island is not serviceable, the parts that are serviceable 9/10 have spectrum services already (upgrades to service do not count towards sales goal), the amount of people who do not have service and were not negatively affected by the company switch over is very small. No relief is offered to employees working there, corporate delays opening new communities that would help Direct Sales sell services, other departments outright steal what sales you do have. Over all lack of communication in every way from a communications company."
bad,"You WILL work without pay. This called ""advancement."" At a certain point you must take classes, on your own time, in order to progress naturally through the technician ranks. There is no compensation for this."
bad,Terrible management. Frustrating work. Treat their employees like garbage. The pay is good but they suck the joy out of you.  Long hours supervisor'd have no clue on how to manage.
bad,Upper management can be very overwhelming. No remote work and your daily task can become very tedious. Groups are sectioned into silos. The salary seems to be below national average.
bad,"Great benefits are offered, Recoveries, Collections department is new there and is horrible it is ran poorly and leadership is not great at all. You are not given development to succeed such as, no coaching, huddles or feedback on calls. major inconsistency with information such as bonus structure, goals, and quality assurance.Have heard it is a different environment in the sales department and people are actually happy to come to work and supervisors that actually build team morale and motivation."
bad,"There was always something to be doing to stay busy at Spectrum however tasks were often very monotonous. Often just had to figure things out on your own, even when you have never done them. Would hardly talk to people around the office mostly people kept to themselves."
bad,"One Checks! "
bad,was hired under false pretenses saying they wanted me to fill a position for a short time then would be advanced to higher position. was then passed up repeatedly for advancement. management was harsh and overly critical to all the employees.
bad,"Management is inconsistent, you never know what to expect the focus will be from day to day.  It makes it hard to stay motivated when they are constantly changing things on you."
bad,The only really thing good about working here was getting all of the benefits pretty much for free (TV/INTERNET/PHONE). Besides that don't work here..
bad,"There is 0 sense of freedom, if you're not on a call you're expected to sit and twiddle your thumbs, the are also frequent tool changes that feel unneeded and cumbersome"
bad,Working at spectrum I don’t believe is for everybody your customers are always yelling at you over the phone and things are always changing me personally I feel like you don’t get paid enough for the nonsense that you go through sometimes some people do like the job I am just not one of them. You do get benefits but for me my co-pays are still insane and it’s very hard to balance work and your personal life at this place. You also have to dress up professionally which to a certain extent I understand but it’s a call center and no one can see you they went from being able to wear nice  looking jeans and appropriate shirts to having a dress up and work clothes aren’t cheap these days. Send me the job is exhausting and there’s very little support many of times
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Hectic environment based on numbers.  Management is all about numbers.  Never about the well being the employer.  Numbers will potentially get you fired.
bad,I do not wish to give a review of this company.  The company is under new management and things are much different now. I do wish them luck as they pursue new challenges.
bad,"I was a cable technician and they over work you. You could not take breaks and there was time where you didn't take lunch. The pay was ok, but when new employers came in the company they got paid more that the experienced employees. No help from one another so basically your on your own."
bad,"As a Tier III Tech support agent for 14 years in the same call center under three companies (Adelphia, Time Warner Cable, and Charter/Spectrum) I have to say the people in management did everything they could to keep us agents relatively happy, but the nature of the job, constantly dealing with upset customers, created very high stress levels. I was one of the few agents who managed to keep working despite the stress, until I finally couldn't take it any more and left"
bad,"Your typical day includes 30-50 calls about services. Some of these calls are misdirected and require a transfer. Some days are busier than others, such as nationwide outages. The people you work with are great."
bad,"When I got hired on, I genuinely thought I would retire here. Now I am having my doubts. "
bad,"A typical day at work included answering incoming calls. I was in retention so i was the last person to speak to the customer. They were calling due to increase in their bill or wanting to disconnect a/all services. My job was to follow the companies sales technique called R3. I was to save the customer or help them get a competitive price."
bad,"The company was a more organized when it was Time Warner Cable. There are too many changes happening in a short period of time without any consideration for employees with families and other obligations. You’re expected to work nights, weekends and holidays. Since the merge there is no opportunity for growth or advancement in my department. If you post out for a different position within the company you’re expected to keep the same pay and do more work. Also, if you apply for a position you will never hear back from the recruiter. They usually extend the courtesy to at least send an email declining the application. I applied for a position last October and never heard from anyone and also in April, nothing."
bad,"Customer interaction and Team member conversations were the reason/s I enjoyed my job.  Management was not open to opportunity and ""sold"" that they new it all based off their job titles.  Management did not coach behavior, but they did counsel based off the way Spectrum's cookie cutter approach to handling the incoming calls."
bad,Very cutthroat environment. You go into work everyday not knowing if that will be your last day or not. They are constantly relocating entire departments and entire departments are losing their jobs. These people have been with the company for over 20 years and they don’t care.
bad,Management is horrible at spectrum they do not lead by example. The company does not value employees or care about them. Its a very selfish company to work for
bad,"There was a lot of turnover in the sales teams. Managed events, budgeting and sales teams. Lots of changes corporate wide. Bust fast paced environment"
bad,I loved working in the callcenter it was my  spotlight i enjoyed my coworkers & working with all type of people.My teamleader was great at his job help manny others become team players for the company
bad,"Train other employees instead of leadership training them , Leadership promotes mediocrity . "
bad,"I learned how to be installer & system tech, running a route was a typical day Management was poor, hardest thing was working outages by yourself at night."
bad,some great people and training but a bit of a sweat shop. your success can depend largely on who your supervisor is. there are some very poorly qualified supervisors here. They tend to focus on the negative and do not encourage with the carrot/positive reinforcement.  middle and upper management is good.
bad,Work place was very stressful due to management. Long hours and no direction to what is needed. Leadership was very weak on questions asked and help that was needed. Manpower was very low so work load was very heavy.
bad,"Working with cable involves more work than you think. Like any job you are pushed to strive for perfection as you should. But the pay doesn't match the effort you have to put out to do this job. From crawling under houses to marching through wooded areas with a ladder on your shoulder. If the pay was better, it would be better. To progress you have to take what is equivalent to a college semester test for a dollar raise."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"troubleshoot all issues with equipment,set up tech appointments,upsales, balance accounts, collect payments and discuss payment options,problem solving and retention for irate customers."
bad,"The management there wasn't effective. For someone in data entry, they weren't available when needed. There were many times the warehouse crew wasn't given notice of mandatory overtime."
bad,"Intensive training only to leave employees floundering once they ""hit the floor"" for real time phone calls with customers. Decent hourly wages if you can get over the severe critiquing by management and the customers screaming at you all day."
bad,I prefer not to talk about my experience at Spectrum. It would have helped if we had a better benefit package and all the benefits we had before Spectrum took over Time Warner Cable.
bad,"While work environment was positive, lack of recognition and low moral caused inefficient behaviors to continue resulting in multiple errors and delays in projects."
bad,They started wanting the customer service department to be a sales team even though we had a sales team. We had so many things we had to take care of for customers and to add sales on top of that it made the job hard.
bad,"Poor paid, no grounds for improvements nor further education. Extremely poor equipment. Terrible vehicles conditions. Poor management, communication and interaction."
bad,I loved the people I worked with but the fast paced calls coming in one after the other and the angry customers you had to deal with just wasn't worth it to me to stay there any longer.
bad,"Do not enjoy this job, odd work hours, not enough training. Put on the job without really knowing how to do the job. Stressful working conditions with little pay."
bad,"This job isn't for everyone. Long hours in a car 6 days a week, knocking on doors to homes where people have been burnt by the company in the past. No fun."
bad,"I used to work for Time Warner Cable. They appreciated their employees. We used to have incentives, competitive pay. I worked there for two years before the merger took place."
bad,"if you really really need money and work like an animal , so yes its the perfect company  , otherwise  stay poor with peace of mind , I will not recommend this job for anyone ."
bad,"As prior TWC the merger was less than hoped for. I worked hard and was rewarded well with TWC. With Charter I saw great people rolled over, the cost of a merger one might argue. Poor executive communication and removal of perks such as telecommuting, dress code increased from the bottom up."
bad,"Monitor, implement and support all network and VOIP based hardware and enterprise applications"
bad,this job is all about metrics and what your metrics stand at. everyone including the directors them selves had to worry about their own metrics. if you were not preforming at least to the center average then you are jeopardy of losing your job
bad,With all recent changes there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the future.  Work relocation required for a large number of employees due to centralization of various departments.
bad,"Empereon is a great job to have if you want to play with your future."
bad,I worked for this company for 10 years.  I was promoted to a quality monitoring specialist in 2005 then seven years later my position was outsourced. I was forced to interview for a position was supposed to be a different leadership position but on the same scale but was turned down.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I liked it better when it was time warner, when they changed they had employees and limbo and told us things about our jobs last min. Spectrum came and changed everything."
bad,"Unless perameters have changed since the new ownership, you are required to even upsell on disconnect calls and save people, if you can't you are asked why and then coached. Never allowed to lower bills, if so, you have to transfer them to a special dept who handles that. You could have perfect attendance, perform adequately, you are written up. You could perfom marvelously, and have spotty attendance, you are written up. Yuo have to be PERFECT here. The training rooms are ALWAYS filled, so be aware that the turnover is intensely high."
bad,"This job can leave you feeling drained. Time Management is an extremely heavy task in this job. Literally measured down to the seconds. The management and people who work here are great. They will help you to succeed within your role if you listen. But, moving up through the company can be challenging. There are criteria and stipulations that very few are able to meet. The hardest part of the job is shedding at the end of the day. The most enjoyable aspect was the income."
bad,"After the buy out, My position was eliminated and I was reduced back to what I was 18 years ago. Several other positions were eliminated as well. Benefit package Bright House was. Severe ""Micro Managing"". It seems that everyone is waiting to the next rock to fall and another position or job title is going to be eliminated. Scary work environment.."
bad,This company has several available shifts to help accomadate hours. Different shifts including certains days allowing you to get extras hours if available on other shifts.
bad,In my opinion coworkers are usually awesome at this company but some select have found ways to dodge work leaving it to the less educated in such lazy ways.
bad,"Learned new systems"
bad,Really poor culture.  Teams were laid off at least annually if not sooner.  East coast culture mentality.  Management was clueless about what was really going on.
bad,I enjoyed Charter mostly stayed pretty busy & had regular hours ect. .I moved onto e2 because better pay & what I thought was better opportunity.
bad,"My teammates are really nice people, but after charter merger everything begin to go downhill. My project got cut so I have to find another job..."
bad,The job is okay but it seems like the management picks and chooses their favorites.  Certain people can get away with something but if someone they do not like does the same thing then the consequences are different.
bad,Time Warner is a good place to work.  It has it challenges like any other company.  Things change almost daily without any communication to the other departments affected by the changes.
bad,My time with Time Warner cable was brief they had very good pay however the work to life ratio because of the shifts were difficult. But as with any call center it works off of a very strict structure.
bad,The co-workers were great for the most part and the job itself was not terribly difficult.  My biggest issues and reasons for leaving were lack up opportunities and I was micro-managed even when meeting and exceeding my goals which was overly stressful.
bad,"Micromanaged almost to death. when I worked there the pay was OK, but sales incentives made up for it. working hard gets you next to nothing, although the opportunity to advance is readily available, about every 6 months. there are a lot of team oriented events, management makes its presence, but weekly team training and meetings are available. performance reviews are yearly, and the management team is great at assisting in your professional growth, so long as you make an active attempt to communicate with them. this is a ""revolving door job"" though"
bad,The most enjoyable part of my day is to listen to what customers are looking for in their communication systems and figure out what products will be best suited to help them achieve their desires.
bad,"Good Temporary Job with benefits...And good pay."
bad,"Entered work orders new and reconnect, trouble calls, payments onto customer's accounts, try to sell new products, retain customers talking about leaving to go to other providers, balance cash drawer, prepare cash deposit for pick up & checks scanned deposit to bank, give new and swapped out equipment with customers."
bad,"Time Warner purchased the company I worked for, so this review is based on the transition experience. A lot of good people dedicated to their jobs were lost. They were either driven away by the company culture or considered redundant and let go. Lots of discounts with other corporate partners were plentiful (if you could actually afford to use them) but the perks were not enough to make up for the way things were run."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Company is more focused on individual employee stats than customer satisfaction.They need to create a better balance between employee metrics and customer satisfaction.
bad,The hours at the time were four hours a day in the evening. Selling is very important in order to get a decent paycheck. The environment is fun and great co-workers.
bad,"Benefits were great, but I was confined to a desk all day with the exception of lunch break. If I had to use the restroom before these times, I couldn't because we were not allowed."
bad,"low pay constant stress from customers, no advocacy from management."
bad,"Job as a dispatcher is the most stressful I have worked at.  Some of the mgmt. their does not need to be in their positions.  Have no idea what is going on at all. All I can say is, if you don't need stress....not the place to work"
bad,"Upper management were not always very helpful, they sometimes seemed bothered when asked to help with a difficult call/caller and would sometimes not allow you to transfer to a supervisor even after the customer requested. A typical day is call after call of people complaining about their bills being wrong or their services never working properly."
bad,"Good employees, good pay, but very stressful and strains your mind."
bad,"this may be the job for some people, but if you do not want to get yelled at by people who are missing the real house wives of beverly hills, look elsewhere."
bad,As an inbound sales representative. I take sales calls and work hard to assist customer with billing and technical issues. Immediate supervision was of great assistance when needed. The company is in the midst of a merger and is working toward their shareholders profits rather than continued success as a company.
bad,"Answered questions regarding billing procedures and/or problems. Corrected errors or discrepancies on customer billing charges as necessary. Accurately prepared itemized statements and understood, and explained ledger. Provided level I technical support to correct problems with high speed cable internet, digital telephony services, and cable television service."
bad,Commission is the only benefit working there. There is so much you have to do and say per call. Customer can tell its scripted and just rip you apart. When is then your fault and is counted against your performance.
bad,"Twc retention  dept in bound call center this department is to retain customers  give them excellent customer care and retain there core product cable ,internet and home phone ."
bad,"The company was a great company, paid well, great benefits. the position I had was not a great job. The customers were very rude, and cruel. they belittle you, they call you vulgar names, insult you at any opportunity. There are the few customers who are very friendly and appreciate all you do for them."
bad,"Busy days in a call center"
bad,"Strict work goals for all employees."
bad,"A typical day at Time Warner Cable is always very demanding. Although, I am extremely grateful for the experience. I have not only learned a lot, I have also gained a higher level of respect for the business side of companies that truly depend on retaining value in regards to their product. At Time Warner Cable co-workers very easily gravitate to one another to gain insight on how to retain customers and handle various scenarios to improve their performance."
bad,the job is ok but the managers are horrible they make it a tough place to be employed
bad,Decent pay. Cool managers. It just gets really boring. co-workers are fine. hardest part of job is managing your random stats like calls per hour and surveys. Some things aren't controllable and they know it but your still accountable for it some how. I enjoyed the perks like Discount on services at the company and different place.
bad,"Direct sales for TWC products.  Door to door sales made it difficult.  Verizon flooded marketplace which offered cheaper packages and faster internet service."
bad,customer service is now sales and technical support. the pay is the same but the goals are unachievable
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I liked the people I worked with,  but had to leave because there were no advancement opportunities available.  Also, the organization with the company is chaotic, at best."
bad,"With the Comcast buyout a possibility, this company may not exist anymore."
bad,"I started with TWC as a Tier 3 agent, this company is not competitive with salary and we frequently lose employees to other companies due to higher salary. Coming in at the T3 level, I am already maxed out on salary and have to either move up to supervisor status or a specialized group. Unforchanetly, those positions go based on seniority not education or qualifications. In my time here, I have been passed over many times at this company because they hired their drinking friend into the position. As for benefits, each year they get worse. For example, the cost of medical coverage doubled this year and less is covered. When it comes to college, if you stay a full year at TWC and attend school that year, your degree is free thus; it is a great place to gain experience and a free degree. Afterward nobody stays because they pay top-level agents around 15 dollars while Yahoo in my area pays 25 dollars for the same in my area. As for work / home life, the company has horrible hours, I have been on a 1 to 11 PM night shift with split days off for the last year and the company refuses to change my shift to accommodate college courses and if someone quits, their shift is not recycled among the team, it goes to new hires so get used to not being home with your family or having any hope of a social life. Overall I would recommend that you pass on this company unless your in college and looking for an alternate solution to pay for your degree and certifications or your family in need of full health care coverage."
bad,The company was confused with it's own direction. A lot of company change decisions left too many managers and supervisors indecisive and confused as to operating procedures.
bad,I made breakfast and lunch to seniors. I learned some dietary meals that seniors need to have. Management changed quite often. The hard thing was never knowing what your schedule would be from week to week. I enjoyed talking with the seniors.
bad,The best part was the positive relationships made while working for the company. The only downfall that I could see is that your not able to do your job effetively with the system in place.
bad,make sure everything was packed right and make sure that nothing got by without a stamp on it
bad,I was given the opportunity to dispatch service calls to the Customer Service Representatives regarding clients internet services; their was only three of us in this department at the time the internet services was established we worked as a family.
bad,"While I learned a lot working for Time Warner, it was not very conducive to team building/working together. I had spent a number of years prior to this in cable management, and I'm sorry to say this was my least favorite company."
bad,"Thrives on Numbers, Could spend a little more TLC on there clients needs."
bad,Sales environment inside and outsides sales office and work from home
bad,Install cable services. field position. required excellent time management.
bad,"It was an ok environment, very fast pase. The company had great workers and a lot of great benifits for the employees."
bad,"Handled calls for 5 states, escalations,and customer service"
bad,"On a daily babsis I would upgrade or downgrade customer accouns. I also took payments, as well as asnswer any questions the customers may have had regarding their accounts. My co workers were great to be around, always enjoyable to be around. As far as mangement they did not communicate well with their employees. The hardes part of my job is when I was unable to satify the customer needs because of a technical problem."
bad,the company has gotten to be the giant company it is due to making every pay cut it can and setting employees up for failure when it comes to promotions and pay raises.
bad,Spectrum was a very stressful job. All day long the calls were back to back and for two years ive dealt with verbal abuse which made it unbearable to like working there due to that fact.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend working here if you care about customer service. You have to regularly apologize for processes and lack of communication in the company. The training I went through was amazing and very well done. After training you get put on the floor. The job itself isn't that bad, The days get very long. The company cares about its employees but it doesn't seem to do so on a work based and personal level as large corporations tend to do. "
bad,"Horrible job, things change too much for any normal person to keep up. Care about metrics more than people. Pretty hard to get fired so it’s secure, but I hate it."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"I usually am able to put up with a lot at work and keep my emotions detached, but this job was def not for me. Sups, leads, and SME's were very helpful during the 12 week training phase but after going to my actual team, it was miserable. You were getting yelled at, cussed at, and harassed on a daily basis over the phone and in training they tell you to de escalate the customer no matter how angry they are and to never hang up. Idk about other teams but mine rarely ever spoke to each other throughout shifts so you're basically just hearing customers complain for 8 hours without any other human interaction other than your sups if you need help. It was just a negative work environment that I NEVER looked forward going to. Quitting was the best decision I ever made :)"
bad,"A typical day at work would be average just like with any other job; there are good and bad days."
bad,Time Warner Cable was a good company and growth within was great how ever when Spectrum took over they were a smaller company trying to make up for how much the purchased a big company making cuts left and right which made working there a little stressful.
bad,"Phone/Internet Customer Service Repair/Tech Support"
bad,"As an enterprise customer support rep you had several duties other than answering phones updating tickets calling customers back finding out the situation in the field which made it not a fun place to work anymore. "
bad,"Was originally Time Warner Cable. TWC was amazing to work for. Since Spectrum's take over in the last 2 years. I have seen people quit in droves. We are no longer treated like a valued part of the company, we are now just a number that is easily replaceable. "
bad,"Great benefits, better organized when it was TWC. Great medical, dental,eye vision options, Lots of restrucuring, and lay offs with new merger, It was great working when it was twc"
bad,"Work location was becoming an issue, start from home to job site was becoming a task because of traffic was excessive in the morning and early in the afternoon."
bad,"They tell you what to wear down to your socks and shoes. The hours are long, and in the role of customer service agent you are also expected to meet sales goals and sometimes in the location where i worked, there wouldn't be enough people coming in to meet the goals. The pay is ok for this area.  The computer system is VERY complicated, but ok once you learn it. Their training is excellent but the long work hours and constant micro managing every detail of the job gets very difficult to deal with.  I would have liked the job if they could relax a bit. But everything you do is accessed and evaluated constantly."
bad,"unprofessional job. I was in a inbound sales agent and I was getting billing calls instead of sales calls. The pay was okay they could pay us more money."
bad,"As a Field Technician, they work you like a dog, especially during summer. "
bad,Dont plan on making a career out of this place iys just like any other call center enviornment. Policies always changing and exaggeratedly strict on EVERYTHING.
bad,A stressful and often unpleasant place to work.  A high percentage of hostile and irritated customers.  Every second of everything you do is recorded both on audio and video.
bad,"You will work crazy shifts, have weird off days and poor help. Dont take this job if you are scared of heights. and watch out for management, they picks favorites and will not stand up for you."
bad,rough and tough work days. I got in touch with my inner man.it was tough climbing telephone poles. but meeting new people everyday was great!.. its dirty fun!
bad,I will not comment on this. My personal experience with this company has left a not so great taste in my opinion. That's all I really have to say about this.
bad,Working at Spectrum can be difficult as a technical support representative. The customers completed a survey at the end of every call and if we were unable to fix the problem over the phone we would sometime get graded for just that instead of our customer service. I believe this was unfair.
bad,"overall a decent place to work, but the work culture has changed since charter aquired the other 2 companies. The bottom line has become paramount. Good pay, great benefits, easy to get burned out."
bad,"Working for TWC was great but right when they got bought out by Charter Communication and ""rebranded "" into Spectrum things changed !!!!! and not for the good"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,"A typical day at work started off easy then after the second training it took a loop. The management and supervisor team was not much help as I asked day in and out for extra field help. Without the extra field help it became extremely difficult to provide quality work for the customers."
bad,Working at Infocision is an experience itself. I enjoyed working Time Warner Cable but their Political files became to outrage and disrespectful to continue with their Political calls.
bad,The pay was great however the billing systems are extreamly old and hard to get use to if your not acustom to working with older systems. While they are currently updating to a new system they have been completing this system upgrade for quit some time and you still have to complete the majority of your work in the old system which you are having to use numrous screens and codes.
bad,Working here was not for me my work-life balance is great and the pay is okay but it is a little bit stressful when the customers are very unhappy with the service because they never work properly and we keep removing channels and raise the price and we are unable to change the prices. I was not trained properly in the system and had to learn as i go. I have been here for 8 months but itis still extremely difficult to understand and no mire training will be provided. There have been times where we cant view bills in the billing department or customers cant make payments online or through the automated system so we must charge customers to take theyre payment. IT IS EXTREMELY STRESSFUL but decent money. If you can handle stress from evil customers and can manage working with systems that dont actually work or can handle lack of training and a ton of disorganization then you will be successful here
bad,"Low starting pay. Competitors pay roughly 70% more to start out. You can advance your career as fast or slow as you please. You do get bonuses based on performance. Decent medical dental and vision. Does seem to get worse year after year. Free internet, phone and cable package. Good management for the most part."
bad,"the job is major headache, too may changes. crazy metrics. Not enough help. no one wants to help with escalations. They don't paly about attendance. Overtime is available."
bad,"get to jump on calls right away and start making sells, calling all day can get a little intense at times, work around your co-workers everyday and talk, give each other advice."
bad,Focus more on sales and meeting metrics rather than customer service. There's never a day when you're not going to get told off by a customer is already upset when they get on the line
bad,"At this point in my time there from my hire date I have experienced significant change, some good some bad, but in the end there has been a lot of change that involves plans that will in the short run cause disturbances in work flow, in the long run cause congestion in our call flow that will trickle down to our customers."
bad,"At the SMB Call center you are expected to play their numbers game which hinders your ability to successfully provide good technical support to their growing customer base and the SMB call center is expected to resolve all issues including failed installs, orders and dispatches and only 60% actual trouble shooting and isolation"
bad,"Charter wants us to dress professionally which I understand however the pay we make isn’t sufficient enough to take care of personal needs as well as buying clothes to comply with the dress code. Also the calls were very mentally draining and the customers always complained about their bill being high and there was nothing we could do for them since Charter isn’t offering any promotions unless they’re a new customer or add a new line of business. It was very hard and I dreaded coming to work. The managers and higher people that didn’t have to deal with those aggressive phone calls were making the big dollars while us agents are paid poorly and have to deal with abuse from customers. If we had to maintain a professional manner at all times then Charter could of at least enforced the same rule for their customers we should not have to deal with abusive customers and profanity from them, they talk to us any kind of way and make threats but yet we have to take it and cannot disconnect the phone call but we get disciplined if we disrespect the customers but they don’t get any discipline. Overall the job had some great benefits but it was not worth my mental health. This was the most stressful job and it was the customers that made it difficult and then the base pay wasn’t enough for my sanity. Billing agents especially residential billing should get paid way more than just $15 an hour, Calls are back to back non stop while leaders walk around the floor talking loudly and you can barely hear your customers. The job was just very draining and depressing for such little pay and horrible"
bad,It was stressful taking calls from customers who were yelling on the other end of the line. Using four different programs at once was also very difficult.
bad,Great place to start if you are looking for a place to get the basics down of proper over the phone etiquette and learning troubleshooting workflows in respect to technological and electrical services. Do expect some micro management at times as in most corporate environments. Very much took advantage of the employee courtesy accounts for free Premium Internet and Premium Cable TV.
bad,"I left my previous employer to embark on a new road and was excited for the change. The training period lasted six weeks and I felt confident that I was going through with little to no problem. Once that training period was over, you're immediately on the phones. When you need assistance, you have to wait. Overall, there was not enough preparation for the transition."
bad,"Taking incoming calls, servicing customers. anything from service calls. to setting up new services. or just info about the product."
bad,This is a high stress job. The benefits can make up for the stress levels because the benefits are great but be prepared for endless and stress inducing days.
bad,"a typical day at work for me is to walk in make sure I speak to all my co-workers with a smile. Go to my desk set up everything that I need through out my day. I would learn that every one at work today is not going to be as upbeat or happy as I may be, and those I would inform that everything would be alright. Making sure that they understand that and continue with my day. The hardest part of my job would make sure that my upset customers understand that I am doing my best and will make sure that at the end of the call/ visit that every issue that they called/walked in about would be solved, the most enjoyable part about my job is actually coming up with a solution for the customer with what ever problem that they had and seeing / hearing a smile of relief and know that my job is done."
bad,Time warner was definitely a fuin place to work the energy there was fantastic.. great company great pay .. awesome people working with
bad,"Prior to the Charter, Time Warner merger the work environment was very comfortable, and I was actually happy to go to work, but things have fell short"
bad,I learned a lot about working in a corporate enviroment working at Spectrum. From the days of Time Warner Cable to now Spectrum I learned many things.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
bad,Prior to Spectrum(Charter) buying Time Warner Cable it was a great place to work.  Once Spectrum came in to the picture it was a totally different environment and went downhill fast.
bad,I enjoy helping people obtain access back to the internet I also enjoyed the fat space environment computer multitasking and most importantly paying close attention to detail without making any mistakes
bad,"In an environment working with businesses it becomes very stressful because they expect guaranteed up time which is not supported in the coax SLA, Spectrum does not support internal wiring or internal networks and install techs are hired by 3rd party and often confuse customers or leave them with no information so they are to fend for themselves with their equipment hooked up improperly to the Spectrum modems. There are multiple systems used and often they don't show correct information. The people were great and supportive and the pay reflects the stress of the job but this is not a good role for a person that is overly compassionate, sensitive, and likes things organized."
bad,"a typical work day is coming in to work in the morning, getting your work truck, got to customers homes and assist them in their needs."
good,"I would love this job if they paid more. You work your butt off for pay that is not amazing. they start at 15.75, You work past when you're supposed to get off everyday and that is everyone thats a Tech.  If pay was better i would say this is a amazing job, very demanding for sure."
good,"Management is not held accountable, neither HR! Training are unprofessionally and they’ll change dates and times on you during so without much notice! The prices are too high for the services! You get penalized for using you vacation/ sick time if not approved! You wait longer than usual for calls... on average about, an hour. They don’t care if you can’t work shifts they give to you!"
good,"It was a temporary job, no too much to learn, no opportunities, just physical work, discrimination."
good,"The overall theme I thought was represented was disorganization.  Anytime I walked in during peak call hours (9am-8pm) it seemed like sheer chaos.  No one including the supervisors really knew up from down, I could ask the same question to several different supervisors and end up with several different answers.  This made it very difficult to learn.  However, the benefits were great and having a gym was great.  Once everything settles down I think it would be an ideal place to work and I would work there again."
good,"the over all experience was less then what I had high hopes for, could have had better working environment."
good,"Avoid at all costs, Upper leadership has no concern for the employees. Middle management are a bunch of yes men who are only worried about metrics and protecting their own skin. Great group of techs to work with just trying to navigate the oppressive culture."
good,"If i could give management a -1/5 reviews i would. As far as the security department goes it is by far the blind leading the bind. They do not care about employees at all. They pay people with no experience almost 6000-7000 more than people who have degrees and certs. I have been there 3 years and i still dont make even 50000 but there are people coming in today making"
good,The supervisor was amazing! Awesome guy all about his technicians and they're needs. Corporate does not care about employees. Paid under a living wage while also adding more work every week
good,"working at time warner cable at the time was ok. lots of incentives, you worked at your desk, taking calls continuously. learned more compassion and sales."
good,"Is a laid back place to work, too laid back. Was stressful as there was not a boss for second shift. Other than that had great people to work with whom helped and trained us along the way."
good,"Spectrum use to be timewarner. I started as a tech - moved up, and eventually got injured from a heavy work load and my fault for being exhausted from it. Moved into dispatch where it was better, but again the work there was tedius."
good,"An average day working for the Spectrum order management department would entail either keying in an allotted amount of orders or placing or receiving phone calls pertaining to scheduling orders. In general, the setting is average and coworkers are friendly. The supervisors are overworked but friendly. Working as a contractor can make one feel a bit disconnected but in comparison to call centers, it is not bad."
good,"Spectrum has unreal expectations of employees. They just take and take. Want and want. Nothing in return. Benefit and commission cuts. Extremely high goals. Extra duties, but expect no OT"
good,"Company is trying to go in to many directions and are not for filling their daily objectives in management. Very unorganized, undecided regarding sales platform and managerial process."
good,"Was a fine job for a time while i was living in the area. i would not have chosen this job for the long term, if i were staying in the area longer then 4 years"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Corporate environment"
good,"good job fun industry,   to many changes need to slow down and take survey what they have before making changes.  other than good company good industry to work in."
good,"No culture, no real direction from leadership, and HR SUCKS! Don't expect market pay from them. You will probably get fired if you mention union as well. Everyone is trying to get ahead so they will throw you under the bus."
good,"I have worked here less than a year, and found out few months back that almost everyone I worked with during that time were new except the management and their friends. They lure highly qualified engineers from all over the country and outside as well with relocation packages. Then once you're there, you're stuck for two years no matter how exhausted you are working almost 24x7x365. "
good,I still dont know about the job culture as I am still new to this company. Time warner was purchased and still a lot of changes coming down the line.
good,"Encouraged to build customer loyalty through advanced and complete troubleshooting from the Time Warner Cable Business Class customer inquiries.  Regarding high speed internet products and services. Educating Time Warner Cable Business Class customers about PC equipment, e-mail, Business Class Phone, router configuration, software and cable modems in a high volume/high demand inbound call center environment."
good,this company is only looking to profit off of the back of its employees. They allow the customer to speak to the customer care agents any way the feel like it. This company does not look out for their employees nor do they provide good serivce to their customers.
good,When I first started back in February of 2012 Spectrum Inc was a good place to work. The inventory on trucks coming in the shop was consistently growing and the group of guys I worked around including management was great. When the economy took a plummet so did the commercial paint and body shop industry which cased the company to down size and lay off.
good,This company is nice to work for an the management team do their jobs.
good,I enjoyed working for this company but it was through a temp agencey. Worked for 9 months but was never hired on cause they didn't have any openings.
good,the typical day starts at 6:00 am inspect the bus for safety reasons and start picking up students for school.
good,When I just started the company was a great place to work it was fun and the moral was always up.Our bonus checks were great. Then managment chnaged and so did our pay and moral.
good,Over all it was a great experience it allowed me to learn many aspects of customer service. Also allowed me to meet many people and reslove many issues that the customer may have had which allowed me to experience many aspects of the publice on a more professional level
good,Micro-management at every turn. Impossible sales stress and little to no support from management. People terminated on a daily basis.
good,I worked at Charter/Spectrum for 9 months. I had several projects and due to inaccurate information gathered during intake several project were cancelled. There is a churn in the PMO due to the new Senior Directors policing of Project Managers. Project Managers are treated like children and are demeaned verbally and via emails to senior executives. Very toxic environment. If the Senior Director left and new leadership were to be placed. Charter/Spectrum would probably solve Project Management retention . My Program Managers were amazing as well as my colleagues
good,"Each and every one of the wireless companies I have been employed by or even discussed pays commission per line of business as each is it's own company revenue source. Not Spectrum, the goals are unrealistic with a 3 line account for example only counting 1 towards your goal. And $10 each for the additional lines. That is the activation fee BTW. So you MUST sell to stay and not get commission on everything you sell."
good,"This is not an Employee focused company, work you till you have nothing else to offer then replace you. they show no loyalty and a network of good ol boys, either you are in or you are OUT!"
good,The benefits are what keep people at this company. The ability to move up or get a pay raise are slim. Other than the benefits I’m unsure why people stay here
good,"Probably would be a better place to work if upper management would join in on the 20th century.  Old school culture mentality, and somewhat micromanaged.  No work remote opportunity and not casual policy...not even on Friday's.  Salary is ok and the benefits are decent.  Nothing above and beyond."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,This company was great to work for always my goal was to make sure that customer is getting what there paying for and the customer service I would want someone to give my mother
good,No communication between management and staff. not much room to grow. over use of contractors without job security and and awful contractor culture and  minimal in-house opening for contractors
good,I never worked for Spectrum. I worked for Time Warner. I cannot comment on an organization that has not only changed the staff but also the name of the company.
good,Employee value is low. Extreme expectations of leadership with little recognition. Most promotions are given to candidates based on relationship with senior leadership rather than qualification.
good,"The merger of the three companies( TWC, Charter, Bright House) that make up Spectrum has been a long arduous three-years task yet to be completed. It would appear this company cares more about the stock holders than the sacrifices of it's talented and dedicated staff of thousands. Employees have been struggling with the drastic reduction in pay and constant policy changes that make it next to impossible to maintain households. The accounting has been the most alarming with no check and balance in place to check work. In short I would steer clear unless you want invite confusion into your finances."
good,"For a straight up hunter, great place to build a business that will need to be hunted again right after the close.  Promised keeping accounts that produced revenue only to hand them over to account managers.  If you can survive over 6 mos your decent. 1 year your top of your game. 3 year mark you will realize you lack of value with the company or be invited into the club."
good,"Its a job, but what they don't tell you  before hand is how the commission structure works. No room for growth in retail sales. Turnover rate is high."
good,Extremely Stressful and face paced. Your quota was important. Training was continuous and that was a plus for us. You really have to sale and market on every single call because it could mean the difference in commission or not. I feel like the hourly plus commission should be a lot higher based on the job responsibilities.
good,I worked for Spectrum prior when they were just known as Time Warner. I am not sure how or if they have changed since then. But from my prior dealings with them I am more inclined to not ever apply for work in the future with them.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working with Spectrum was talking to customers daily.  Being able to assist with billing disputes, signing up new customers and just helping customers resolve technical issues.  The ability to know that you can assist someone and not seem as rushed in helping the customers."
good,"The job is tough, most of the people who work there are amazing but the customer base is disgruntled.  The job requires a lot of patience and willingness to change as policies and procedures change quickly."
good,"try to sell phone, cable or/ and internet, even if most people just want one thing such as internet, spectrum expected you to keep selling what they call the bundle. even if people did not want a home phone"
good,I was there when it was time Warner and I would have liked more pay for the work performance. But would have like a better supervisor with more patience.
good,"After working with the company for over 9 years, I have come to the conclusion that I would not recommend this job to anyone. The benefits, and discounts are phenomenal, but unfortunately the moral, poor management and unfair pay, is not worth the abundance of stress you go through on a daily basis."
good,Terrible place to work at. They don't know what they are doing and it shows every day. I would suggest not working there and going to work for a company that actually values their employees.
good,"Work - life balance is not a priority. There is a high turnover and many uncertainties. It's a very stressful environment, and no actions are taken towards punitive managers."
good,management is the worst i have ever seen. While working in sales the company will always try to still sales from you and not pay you for the sales you have received.
good,"Constant changes in day to day operations, unprofessional work environment, and no structure to training. Treatment felt very child like, with dramatics involved."
good,the technician do alot of the work sometimes get blamed for stuff thats not there fault but on the other hand the pay is not bad its a fast paced job if you want to work hard and get paid for it this is the jo for you
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"the company has changed a lot within the past few months.  it used to be more fun, and now the dynamic has changed so much the morale has dropped. management is wishy washy and has their favorites. hardest part of the job is meeting metrics that are impossible with the calls that come in. most enjoyable part of the job is when we have incentives that are worth it."
good,Not a place you want to be if you want to grow professionally and learn more about leadership. No opportunities for advancement unless you are willing to show loyalty to poor management.
good,I believe this company can be an okay company but the people make it bad. It is true a bad manager can make a good employee go bad. As long as you have know ideas you want to share you will be fine. The manager I had was threaten by my level and skill in my position. It was difficult for her to convince me what I know would not work or did not make sense was a smart move. She would always try to cover her self by referring to the grey area in making decisions. Do not stay complacent in any area once that is don't you become stuck.
good,"this used to be a good company. Not since the merger though. They used to pay, now they promise commission which isnt achievable. If you work here be prepared to be stuck in your posistion."
good,"Conduct door to door interviews with potential clients."
good,"Selling home phone, internet and cable for United States customers. I asked probing questions to identify the customers needs. Loved the teamwork."
good,"It was a good place to learn and work with talented people, the problem was that talented people kept leaving. The upper level leaders were good, the regional level leaders lacked training in IDN sales."
good,"Charter is coming and everyone is going out. Technical group has been moved to Denver,CO. The management group is a little over zealous of its capability.  A greater portion of its management micro manages everything that it can."
good,With this company be very use to change. You will answer a lot of phone calls. Things will change on day to day basis. Management will work with you if you know them outside of work. I learned that with this company hard work does not pay off. Its not what you know but who you know and the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing.
good,"Charter Communication is a nice place to work. Over the years a lot of changes has taken place. Co worker are very nice, Management tends to show a lot of favoritism. They have their picks. But if you go to work and do your job you will be okay. Very Team oriented in the Sales Dept. Makes very good money."
good,"yes, it is nice and challegeing. I like the company and their products therefore, they are an enjoyment to sale. I would recommennd working f9or this company."
good,"A typical work day could be extremely busy or very calm with down time. However, there is always work to be completed. Fast pace lots to learn. My supervisors were great! Teams changed once or twice a year depending on the area you work in. This was the easiest job ever nothing hard at all... I enjoyed every task I was given to complete. Overall a great experience, but the pay was not the best."
good,"It's an O.K start for a transition into the Metrolina area, at first your going to have long work days and alot of trouble calls until you master your trade, but if your dedicated and if you have what it takes its a good start to get to know the area/ surroundings!"
good,Jealousy among managers. There is very little advancement  beyond supervisor. Communication is very rare. Good overall company outside of Alabama.
good,Engineers works day and night without without much job separation. Charter has an aggressive concept without thoroughly planning and providing workers the necessary tools to succeed.
good,too much micromanaging. not organized at all. one department never knows what the other is doing. don't care about the employees.only care about the numbers. don't recommend
good,"Level 1 Video Repair Agent-answering phone calls from customers to assist in video trouble shooting.  Patients is always a good thing.  Management is all very nice, my co-workers are great people to be around make the day enjoyable.  All the changes being made is the hardest part of the job.  Little hard to keep up sometimes."
good,"providing assistance and emotional support to  individuals. Entering , recording, storing or maintaining information in written or electronic/ magnetic form"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,i felt used as an employee instead of a member of the team. as if i was expendable. So my employee moral was low as well  the rest of my coworkers. I'm a very fun loving person who wants to see all my fellow peers or associates happy to be around me.never uplifted one another very sad place of employment.
good,"While I was promised a Marketing Internship I was instead used as an all around lot boy. While this gave me a great insight into how all departments must work together to complete a common goal, and how important teamwork is, it was not the experience  I was promised."
good,After 14 years of service business was going in a direction I was not willing to go.
good,"Stressful company"
good,"What company tells an employee of 5 years who started school because this corporation said they would prefer someone with a college degree. After getting my college degree from AB-Tech I was told that a Bachelors was preferred while I was getting my Bachelors they had several management positions open which I applied for and was rejected for other employees with less tenure, worse numbers, and what broke the camels back was that each only possessed a H.S. Diploma. What kind of human resources is this who hires and promotes like that. "
good,"Installed and repaired cable television, high-speed data, and digital telephone services equipment used in a LAN network into a subscriber homes or business dwellings per daily schedule."
good,Benefits were good excellent health care but they did not care about you as a person you were seen as a machine to them. Hardly no one around to give you help because the majority of the supervisors got away with doing nothing. They pile on extra calls from different areas but never gave you extra money for it.
good,"Polices and Procedures change often, co-workers have great attitudes and you must be a fast learner as well as a multi-tasker to keep up in the fast paced environment which helps the day go by faster."
good,Great call center experience. I learned alot about cable industry.
good,they do pretty much let u work any hours which is great but they don;t have enough hepl or supervisors on the floor at peek times.
good,"Employed for 6 years, and made my highest salary in the second year. As the economy declined, so did the possability of selling continually price changing cable products. Policy would also continually change as would the pay structure. It also had an unfair playing field with favorites getting best territories or apartment leads-(like shooting fish in a barrel.) Quotas exceeded during times of recession, and the requirements for signning up customers intensified. i.e. Money up-front, reccurring method of payment, credit check...By the time I left, commission payment was once monthy and base pay was once monthly. In 6 years I had 8 different sales managers, all with new techniques and stratagies. The work week also changed to 6 days a week- 6.23 hours a day. ( although I worked 7 days a week, from morning to night."
good,"Charter has set up its performance metrics to guarantee failure in some way. After stripping its employees of all personality, the management expects perfection, yet won't let you achieve it."
good,A typical day at Spectrum consists of 2 hr meetings every other day (no exaggeration there) & calls from customers with service issues that are never fixed for long.Throw in an unspoken hierarchy in regard to how many of the managers on site actually have say in managing you whether they have valid reason to or not. The hardest part of the job is when you become well aware of how Spectrum handles its issues & then have to glaze over it with a customer who is genuinely bothered. Pay is consistent & better than the minimum.
good,Working at the retail center with spectrum has been extremely disappointing  the management and leadership has no organization or show that they care for their employees
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working on my current project, little interaction with anyone. There was no feedback from management on job performance, which I feel is important."
good,No job security in Management and turnover is very high. The employees are terrific but executive level does not appreciate hard working employees. A big lack of accountability
good,"There was no room for advancement and the management is unprofessional.The Heath benefits are great .After working there for some time it’s a supervisor that should have been let go. I started to hate my job, because of her attitude."
good,Spectrum is a decent place to work. The free services makes it worth while. Its like a revolving door but there are many who have worked there for a long time.
good,Everything went from all about the customer to all about the bottom line efficiency tools not always working always something to be knocked down about took away the work at home program place was much better when managed by twc spectrum took all of the happiness away.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"No support and systems crash all the time"
good,Working in call centers are awful unless you’re ok with being on the phones constantly. Automatic incoming calls are crazy during the day time hours and on night shift it’s really slow. Customers are rude but what do you expect since customer service in the call center is a revolving door. Plus micromanaging and 2 breaks and a 30min to 1hr lunch. It’s definitely not a job for everyone. If you're One that’s good with working in a call center environment then this is the best call center job to be at as far as pay and benefits.
good,"When employees  express their discomfort about working conditions, it seems that the hierarchy takes precedence before the employees out in the field."
good,Company has a churn and burn culture.  No regard for customer support or customer service.  Management is inexperienced with no regard for employees or partners.
good,"I enjoyed the location of where spectrum wa slocated, on site gym was a plus, phones were consistant which kept our days busy, loved talking to new people over the phone and helping them find their best package which benefits their household. Managment needed a litlte more work as far as communication between supervisors and employees,  the pay was very good, bring part of the union was also a helpful."
good,I learned a lot about myself and earned great pay and benefits. This job allowed me the opportunity to refine my skills and become a better me. The entry level opportunity is a great experience for anyone that has not worked at a call center.
good,You are promoted only if you are cute. They worry about the bottom line more than the customer.  No customers means no bottom line. They might realize that some day. Work you like a dog and no thanks for it. They just expect it and demand more.
good,"a typical day at work included counting your drawer to take with you to the sales floor.After which I interact with the customers and take care of their needs. I have quite a lot at spectrum we were constantly doing courses that pertains to the job. The hardest part of the job is sometimes customer are never satisfied, they wants more than I can offer, so it feels you have failed them. The work place culture changes ever so often so I just change with it. The most enjoyable part of my job I enjoy the diversity of my peers and I met a lot of great customers."
good,"The job has great benefits but the environment gets toxic after awhile. It’s definitely a get in and get out type of job. Favoritism, flirty managers and inconvenient  schedules"
good,the days were fast paced and a lot of the times we did not really know what we were doing. To be a communication company the departments that made up the company do not communicate with each other.
good,Management micro manages everything. Constantly watched and not trusted to do your own work. Random seating means coming in extra early every day. Discounted services only good thing.
good,"Unethical, misleading the public, and it's own shareholders."
good,"Inbound sales position at Charter Spectrum is for single or married people with no children. I do not recommend this job for any persons with any form of life outside of themselves, including your pet."
good,"Paid training but poor onboarding process"
good,"Spectrum has a very competitive environment. "
good,"No job growth opportunities ,  decrease in Employee value. Director of Sales Support is Fair for the most part.  Managers of the department has brought morale down due to inconsistency , dishonesty and favoritism."
good,"Go  see if truck gonna start. "
good,"The Cable industry is a bizarre world based in old non productive philosophies.  The company never really cares about it's employees, the merger between Time Warner Cable and Brighthouse Networks only made things worse.  The TWC management has completed turned the direction of the company into a downward spiral."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"If you enjoy getting little pay, watching your boss through a temper tantrum on the production floor and getting cussed out daily then this is your job. They claim they give annual pay increases, they don't if you get one it will be under a quarter. (yearly) The call center is fully of thieves and my car was broken into twice while working there. The supervisors are more worried about how often they get a smoke break and are never at their desks. The leads do all the work and never get promoted. When I first started this job it was a great company. But then they merged with spectrum and its went down hill fast. You can't have anything on your desk and you can't take any sick time or you get written up. You get 2 hrs of sick time, every 80 hrs you work.. got help you if you have medical problems."
good,Everything currently is adhoc as issues coming from the field. Not very proactive in finding issues before they happen. Seems the team is constantly on defense trying to catch up to issues. They get a lot of push back from vendors when issues are found and have a rough time getting the vendor to by off on the issue and get a fix in a timely manner.
good,High stress job with little training.  Culture definitely changed after the merger from TWC to Charter Spectrum.  The health benefits are definitely a plus.
good,This place will sell you dreams. Like someone said earlier the Managers only care about themselves & their bonuses. You make 3 mistakes & you’ll be fired for nothing. They play Favorites & never try to understand their employees. Don’t even think about taking a vacation they will guilt you into feeling like you robbed Jesus.
good,Door to door sale s job. but the did not want you to be able to make money at it. The  started to take a way your sales tools and resources to make money.
good,The Legacy Charter location in Louisville suffers from lack of understanding.  The management on site does not want to listen to the few supervisors that speak up and let them know why people are leaving.  The Supervisors are being left out of the loop for making the place better and the focus has been to increase the work load on the supervisor which means that the reps will have less support but more stress.  So the reps leave and management feels that it is a great idea to increase more work on the supervisors.  If you need a job and don't want support and are okay watching the supervisors stay stressed this is the place for you.  If you don't like a big pile of stress rolling down from on high.  This is not for you.
good,ever since the take over  the amount of money that agents are making has been cut in half and morale in the center  has been drastically affected . the requirements for hire have gone down as well
good,"High turn over rate, low wages, they expected the customer service agents to handle tech support, sales, billing, etc. Young people working there with no customer service background, high stress because of the ethnic ratio."
good,"Great benefits, great co-workers. Management could be a little more helpful. Certain guidelines are not clear which can result in termination. Free cable, internet, and phone."
good,The company is a great place to start your career. Great benefits and a great culture in most departments. They are always looking for professional applicants who understand the demands and diciplines of the business.
good,While the benefits were good.  The team I worked for was not very friendly.  I felt that the Director level was not supportive of employees and very little guidance beyond punishment for mistakes.
good,"Bright house was bought out by Charter . "
good,with career progression and any sort of job security.. doesn't provide straight forward answers when questions are asked. always getting the run around when asking how to project yourself into your work
good,"Worked for Time Warner before it took name Spectrum"
good,Meeting with managers at various sites; setting up appointments and events at sites; troubleshooting with management at sites; selling product and services
good,"fast paced learn as you go "
good,Basically you come in you have a schedule everything is on a schedule ur lunch and breaks you are measured on productivity and schedule adhearance so you follow your schedule customers often. Times fuss at you and belittle you most of the systems go down often no one really has answers to ur questions because things are constantly changing the people who make it here kiss butt and are friends with hiring managers otherwise they rather everyone be on the phones forever with no advancement
good,"Learned new systems, culture is based on the situation, hardest thing is lack of communication. Perception of management lack of care for workers. Best part interaction with peers."
good,"constantly given contradicting instructions, spent two weeks in training and then was told that things were done a different way. When I asked for clarification on policy and procedures that did not make sense was simple told that that is the way things are done even though not right."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"It's a sales job.  You had to be shady and it was expected to meet numbers.  Management is a joke.  They can't seem to make it a month before having to take a week or more off.  Not a good one in Kingsport,TN"
good,The job ad the people can be very stressful. Actively looking for new employment. The benefits are good but not worth the stress it can cause to your health
good,"TWC was much better to work for before the merger. Since Charter took over the whole company has gotten worse. You're treated like a cog in their machine. There is never any sort of employee appreciation anymore and since Charter changed everything it's non-stop calls all day long. My call center was switched over to billing after I was hired on as a technical support rep. The 8 months between that switch and my leaving is the worst I've ever felt at a job. We were constantly berated and cursed out by customers who we couldn't do anything but godforbid you hang up on them. Not to mention the main stat management goes off of is the CSAT surveys which obviously you're going to get bad ones since you don't have any way to lower people's bill. Also if you need to go to the restroom or need to take a second to catch your breath, you can expect a supervisor down your throat after a minute or two."
good,"Did not like the way customer talked to me. Did not like the breaks, Did not like the supervisor. Did not like the Job at all. Working there will get you free cable internet and phone service but thats the only thing i liked about it ..."
good,The job was very stressful dealing with angry customer. The staff were really great and same thing about management.  Management was really good about helping  the employee with bring up their metric number form the month.
good,Management isn't great. the have mandatory overtime.Do not offer great benefits. Do not pay well. There's no room to grow. It's not hard work... everything you need they will teach you there.
good,"The environment was clean, the training was sub par, as is the management. The work ethic of most employees is to pass the buck and you end up with angry customers and agents because of that."
good,The company is constantly unaware of what is current policy and not able to give timely responses to important concerns as it pertains to pay or benefits.
good,"everything was ok when we were time warner cable. However, after busting my butt for over 2 and a half years, plus speaking both English and Spanish perfectly,  I'm barely making  $12 an hour. right now we're being forced to work Sundays and holidays. commission structure went to heck as well.. right now, if we don't hit 75% of the goal we don't get paid for the other 74% of that we already sold. and reps over the phone promise way too much just to get the sale, so here at the stores we get all messed up account with super angry customers because we can't grant what was promised. the only condition I put to work all weekends of the month was just to get 2 days back to back to go to school. but for whatever bs reason they said no, you will work all sundays and get Mondays and Fridays off... not very helpful when you're trying to get your degree..."
good,I was one of the top door 2 door sales reps and let new members shadow me to learn of to get past no.It was a fun place to work but it was changes everyday.
good,"See the Review for Spectrum,this is not a good company to work for any longer, and pay is minimal at best.  I would not recommend working for Spectrum."
good,"Management does not care about you at all, you are expected to operate like a robot.  Ex: 10 minutes a day to use the bathroom that is clocked and timed down to the second."
good,"Most of my friends are the relationships I made why working for Time Warner Cable. The work is awesome you work alone in customer homes installing TV, Internet, and phone. There isn't much direction from management, the best thing to do is keep your head down and do your job."
good,if you have a life you can forget it once you join the sales department and get micromanage even for going to the restroom just a heads up but if you can handle it then good luck...
good,Got a lot of knowledge that has helped me outside of twc.. Again I felt like me as an employee wasnt valued great benefits with the new change and merge maybe it will be better
good,The job was constantly changing which was good you never continuously did the same job every phone call was different. Which mad the job always interesting and fun but still challenging at times.
good,A technician's Productivity Rate is based on a rolling 30 days cycle. Vacations and non productive days (such as technician meetings) heavily impact your productivity rating.
good,"Its fun working at time warner arena at times. Management is a joke tho especially security manager, for a surprising $8 and hour they expect too much, extremely strict, a ton of supervisors that make only a dollar more then you do all just stand around forgetting to give their employees breaks, now have the nerve to make certain days and times mandatory,, like really for a part time seasonal job. For the little change they pay for expecting so much and treating the job as if your securing the president's white house is really ridiculous. Job use to be fun. Now its similar to a military camp. I personally wouldnt recommend it for security but other positions you are guaranteed to have more fun."
good,"working to make customer happy with paying for their services, however your company keeps changing the prices without letting the public know and it customer service staff know until you get that call."
good,"As a contractor we pretty much work on our own, and we do not get the benefits of being an employee, free cable services, paid time off, insurance, etc. Everyday, as well as every job, is different. The hardest part of this job would be working with the weather, especially on rainy and extremely cold days because over 50% of our work is outside. The best part about this job would be meeting new people and seeing the customer's faces when you turn on that TV or Internet for the first time."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"The job involved very technical aspects, but had an excellent team atmosphere when needing help. The major downside was the requirement to sale when the majority of the job was geared towards technical and billing support."
good,"In office position. Assisting customer with starting new cable services and customer service issue.  Very faced paced.  "
good,"When you're used to banking and its policies and procedure, working here will fill your wig. "
good,with any company there are ups and downs.  This one has a lot of mandatory over time and you are not allowed to skip it whats so ever no matter what... If you have a family then this really is not the job for you! However if you are singe and need some great money you can definitely make that happen!
good,the management staff is completely unperfessional. They dont promote from within. The company has unrealistic expectations as well as unfair toward their own employees
good,I did enjoy my time with the copy because I love to sell however the training I received was inaccurate and unhelpful. This lead to a serious learning curve in the field and managing my reps. Management was decent however gentleman I reported to wasn't much for managing as he was for selling. The work days were long 12-9pm with a 30 minute expected lunch time.
good,to much stress and not enough reason to go through it and stay...a typical day at charter was answering phone calls and being a verbal punching bag to the customers on the other end...charter wanted to have there cake and eat it to and they are not in the environment to do so
good,this is not the place for a career if you have a family and if your are a kind harted person this is not the place for you
good,"This job does not have a lot to offer. The benefits are not good, the hours are crazy, and there is no room for improvement."
good,"This is not a job for everyone, and lately it has been the case for me. Even though I know my job inside out, I feel I have overstayed my welcome and it is time for bigger and better things. It is an extremely fast paced job, there is no ""down time."""
good,"We supported Internet, Digital Phones and Cable TV for TWC Pacific West markets."
good,too much support being offshored. fast paced call center enviroment covering Texas region.
good,A Typical day at work is going in clock in going to you'r desk and start working.
good,"inbound calling, collections, new service set up, sales, cross selling meeting quotas"
good,"Working with children with Autism was very difficult but challenging at the same time I learned to have a lot of patience with children my co-workers were fun people to work with, the most enjoyable part was to see the kids smile, the hardest part was being in a scary situation with the students at the school site wasn't sure if some of the children would lash out or not!!!"
good,Being an account manager is the hardest job at the company very high stress. Back to back calls come in all day with not even enough time to breath in between. The only good thing about working for this company was the benefits which are dwindling away.
good,"Been working for 10 and half years, too much nepotism; no chance for advancement."
good,"Nice people working with, upper management does not know what they are doing - Don't really care about customers"
good,The people were what made this a good job. my co-workers made this job fun and made me feel like a part of the team. the challenges made me stronger and I liked learning new things and am always willing to do so.I liked learning about the company and the way it dealt with the community at large.
good,"This company has zero concern about morale. They intentionally pit all sales departments against each other - ink wins philosophy - Their ROE - Rules of Engagement are more like ""suggestions"" because they are not enforced.  Not to mention they will have you sell products the network isn't even close to be ready to deploy - SD WAN, Fiber TV and IP TV."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Extremely stressful work environment, hardest part of the job is not being able to control your schedule. There are hardly any 8-5 spots there. The people you work with are great, but the customers you deal with are not."
good,"The company works with metrics which most of the time is hard to accomplish.  The company keeps adding what one has to say to the customer which waste time for keeping the metrics. The company keeps adding things to do which makes it hard to keep up with the metrics.  This is all decided on by the upper management.  Maybe they should do the job, they may realize that what they are asking their employees to do is unreachable."
good,"I was told i would be working day shift. Put in my notice and started the training class and found out only 2-11pm or 3-12am was available. The desks were way to close together. I was told i would be chatting online with customers assisting them however it was over the phone and mandatory sales with 0 commission. When my grandmother died, they didn't want to give me any bereavement."
good,This place doesn't care about you or your family. As long as you hit an unrealistic goal you are kept once you don't meet a goal you are council led every month till you do or your out the door.
good,"This job isn't difficult. What makes it difficult are the poilicies in place that make it way worse than it has to be. I love this job, it just feels like the upper levels of management don't listen to the ""boots on the ground"" techs when we have legitimate issues."
good,I have worked for Spectrum for the last 3 years and have accomplished my monthly goal continuously every month. Spectrum is a good company to work for with good benefits.
good,"Management is nice but their hands are tied as far as being able to help move your hours and its hotel seating, managers dont pay attention to you, only numbers"
good,"Charter is too disorganized with the merger of several companies. There is little to no training as new job duties are often added. It's basically sink or swim as they throw you into new responsibilities without warning. Work culture is like high school, and the best I can call it is ultra ghetto."
good,The time I have spent at Charter/Spectrum has been interesting.  This company has a terrible management style.  I was hired along with several other technicians at a time when the network was growing.  They quickly brought on many people to correct the imbalance..
good,It would be a wasting my time to even go into all the things that I dislike about Spectrum. I will say that if they shoot themselves in the foot by not truly listening to their employees and following corporate mandates that makes zero sense.
good,"Charter provided a commencement into technical support acquired skilled and able to have customer service experience as well.  Charter's culture was that of being a team player environment.  As a call center representative, the metrics is what caused a lot of headaches and stress on a daily basis."
good,"Pay was good and genuinely got along with my coworkers. "
good,"Working at spectrum is good for the time being . High demands for little or inadequate pay. Everything is performance based so you’re competing against other teams / people in the office & other call centers. Training is disorganized especially due to new virtualization and taking calls from different states. The training wasnt sufficient enough. Other than that the work schedule flexibility is horrible. If you are a student or have kids , it may be very difficult for you to balance. Employee incentives are an insult, after receiving a compliment from customer you spin a wheel & receive gifts like a pen , lunch box , play doh. Ridiculous."
good,as contractor for spectrum it has no good benefits and pay was not good. we have more to do with no good benefits. we had no raise through out i worked there
good,"My manager is not even allowed to call herself a manager she is the assistant manager, which is confusing to me because they say that the district manager is the manager and the district manager, which I have been working here for 5 months and have only seen her twice. We are micro managed, everything we do has to be okayed from someone higher up. We can not celebrate holidays; life for Christmas we could NOT put up a tree or decorations. We can not give candy out on Halloween to the children, we can not do anything but sale, sale, and sale. Thank God for the local office I work in because we treat each other like family. We will swap day, work for each other or whatever to make sure that we are all good and can handle business. & do NOT have surgery, OH MY GOSH they will harass you, I didn't even go through with my surgery and still getting letters from the company about it. I called and canceled it due to all the stuff they wanted me to do. Like I understand its a lot of paper work and they need to cover themselves, but I feel like im being harassed. I love my job, and I know no job is going to be 100% great or good, but some changes would help, something so simple as listening to the employees."
good,High stress job not enough pay. Staff friendly but the job itself is very demanding and they don’t pay enough for the headache but it’s a good job if you plan on moving up
good,"I loved the job when I first started, but then they started to set sale goals that were almost impossible.  If you didn't meet them you were written up until fired."
good,"I was there for 4 years. The fist 3 I had an awesome supervisor who was very supportive and always offered constructive criticism and positive coaching. The last year I got someone vicious and condescending who was constantly critical. The first 3 years the culture was very good, the last year a new management team was brought in, almost no one from the old team was left and the culture became toxic.There was always pressure to sell additional services but it wasn't emphasized. The last year there was tremendous pressure to keep customers and increase their bills. This led to huge amounts of lying from CSRs and many irate customers. WEorst part of the job was increible pressure to sell customers un wanted services. Best part were co workers and benefits."
good,"They placed a lot of pressure on you to sell their products on every call and it seems they sent the sales calls to customer service and customer service calls to sales. Lastly they have a quintiles system to determine how much your commission will be for the month. Terrible system, but it is a way for mgmt to reduce the payout on commission."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Still trying to get a grip on the situation. Moved to Charlotte for a job and things are getting very hectic. Demands being made that are not really logical or helpful in doing the job.
good,"I found out that Spectrum leadership is somewhat weak in their decision making.  They tend to be clicked to their race (white) and do not display a diverse environment.  Although they hire people of color  and that is to present the image that they are diverse, at least not in the St Louis area.  Spectrum wants good workers and performers but lacks paying for the experience.  The hardest part about working at Spectrum is their lack luster leadership, what I mean by that is they promote from within when in fact the people they promote lack the leadership skills to do the job.  The most enjoyable part is loving what you do to enhance the business."
good,I enjoyed my time there but there is no chance for progression management is spotty and there is a lack of culture overall a great place to work but very limited chance to progress.
good,Have been working at charter for 4 years my last year has been as an associate ISP engineer When i started this job there was no management in my area and once I was put into the on call  list I was run ragged   it took them 4 months to find somebody else to help out and even then we still had no management now we have 3 engineers and a new manager is coming but this job is really made me unhappy about it because of the lack of management
good,"Cable is a good field to work in but when a company doesn't care about its employees it makes it very difficult to appreciate the job. even when your immediate supervisor does care, when management doesn't do anything to help out the employee and set ridiculous standards of excellence that are only obtained by 10 percent of the work force it puts the supervisors in a bind"
good,"Bright House Networks, Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable merged almost three years ago. There is still not a clear vision that has been articulated for the company employees. Policies, Processes and Procedures are in constant flux. The way that you did things yesterday is not the same today. Work is being duplicated many times over to get the simplest orders processed. The true victim of this merger has been the end customer. The customer experience went from one of being good to one that is truly disappointing."
good,"Installs new cable technologies in homes or companies."
good,"It will depend on which team you get in. In my current I reach the top the first year. Nowhere to go. I have to get something else. I try within but ""blocking"" is obvious so I need to look outside as I'm doing."
good,Decline started to occur in job satisfactions and overall center moral due to poor Management and treatment of employees. Leading to major employee turnover.
good,"Horrible management"
good,"When it was Time Warner, it was a great company to work for. They used to listen to their employees. Now that it is Spectrum, they do not listen to, or trust their employees, they come out with unrealistic expectations, ignore things that are broken or do not work and constantly deploy products they know do not work and want us to keep installing them."
good,"Charter Spectrum's primary focus is on numbers. I love what i do and I am passionate about seeing employees advance their careers through training and development, Charter no longer focuses on that. Charter Spectrum would rather hire externally for leadership positions"
good,The job was just ok. The team I worked with I enjoyed. My direct manager was ok but other than that the place lacked communication and little to no growth in the training department.
good,I have been told many things that weren't true and no career advancement program even after keeping my stats and attendance great. I felt like a seat filler.
good,"Over all Spectrum is a great place to work. Great benefits with great employee discounts. However, the environment is very stressful and there really is no job/home life balance. They will not be flexible with schedules for people that have children and need to work around child care. It's more like a you got that schedule so deal with it type of thing."
good,"I cant judge as spectrum it was time warner cable when I was there and I find it unfair for me to label this spectrum.  I didn't know the staff or their benefits then,  So this would be unfair for me to judge"
good,"I love working for Spectrum because of the benefits. I believe that since we merged, the culture has changed dramatically.  It often feels that you are not cared about or just a body in a seat."
good,"The management team at Spectrum would only hire from within an exclusive clique.  If you were not a member or the good old boys' club, you had no chance of advancement beyond supervisor, regardless of performance or qualifications."
good,long hours with poor management. very little room for growth within the company. Decent pay but the company will take take take and give little in return.
good,I loved the freedom of my position. The leadership did not give the best moral boosters. This was not a position for me personally. Due to the lack of leadership.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Little room for advancement even though they say that you can. A lot of decisions being made that don't take the quality of life for the employees into account.
good,"this ia a good place to work, nice people health benefits could be better and with recent changes it kind of makes it hard to advance to the next level, overall a good company"
good,There is a lack of training. Once you are on the floor answering calls you are pretty much by yourself. The amount of stress that comes with answering back to back calls makes it not worth your time.
good,it wasn't great for anyone. the managers are hostile. the only good people are the subcontractors. those people actually enjoy their work and care about their employees
good,It’s a job. Can be stressful at times. Hours can be demanding. Also depends if your and in-house tech or a contractor.  This job is not for the weak but for the strong
good,"Well, lets start off with the trainers. Trainers need to have some sort of management training. They talk about they treat everyone with respect, but sometimes they would treat us like kids. On the first day of training they let you choose your schedule based on who accepted their job offer first, so that was a huge disappointment. So if you accepted the offer a couple days after, then your chances of working a late shift with unusual days off are high. The training itself was ok. A lot of group work. Once you're on the floor, its different. my team hardly helped me when i needed help. My supervisor was never around. I never received any coachings while the people i trained with are getting coached twice a week, so i felt like was falling behind or not getting the hang of things. The leads take forever to help you out. Overall, it was ok. Once i figured out things on my own, it was pretty easy."
good,normal day were spent listing to ppl about billing and trying to lower rates. fixing internet and cable and phone issues. once a week is coaching where you are told what your doing wrong. givin extra work you must complete in between phone calls and hand back in by next coaching.
good,"The benefits are very good, managerial skills with management can improve. Too much time during the day wasted in checking in every morning, afternoons and evening. By the time I get to my properties to meet with my property managers and customers half of the day is wasted in conferences and checking in calls several times through out the day."
good,Just part of the new world we live in. It is who you know and very low salary. There is no job security.  Raises are blanketed and not according to you as an individual.... meaning you can do all the work for a year and do none of the work for a year and each will get the same raise.
good,"I enjoyed working for Time Warner Cable and the people that were there made it great. Once they switched over to Spectrum I just became a number and stopped being an employee to them. The calls were controlled to where it would hurt your commission. Also, after Spectrum took over, they started nit picking at everything to write you up because they were told their turn over rate wasn't high enough. I am not one that likes to feel underappreciated, but if you don't care and want to try and make good money, then go for it."
good,typical call center type of environment. coworkers are all really nice but there is always drama to get wrapped up in. upper management doesn't take care of their employees.
good,"Overall good job, but is a very stressful environment . This company isn't for everyone, you would need to be very goal driven. The training and nesting process is the mist stressful part of the job."
good,"Concerned only with bottom line numbers, limited to customer service opportunities ie call center representative,inbound sales, field technicians.  Doesn't pay well for a major cable provider."
good,"Working for twc now spectrum was interesting until management changed the work location. They have recently moved my department to the city of Irvine as to where all of my co-employees could not make the relocation as well as myself. The environment was fun and the people were great to work with. While working for twc i've learned so much in the IT field regarding programs that we had to learn to survey the areas for outages. Responsibilities included troubleshooting network problems, conducting network tests, dispatching technicians to install / repair the network, provision and configure devices for compatibility, communicate with corporate leadership and inter-office personnel via conference calls."
good,There is no upward advancement. You cannot switch positions for 1 year. They are starting the business and IT units over again ever since the huge layoff a few years back.
good,"When charter bought bright house networks, my position was eliminated and I was offered the position I started at 18 years ago. After that many years of service I did not want to go back to my roots. I had worked my way up the ladder and was not going back."
good,"Company is going in the wrong direction"
good,"The job of answering phones and taking the customers payments was the easy part. Unfortunately, there are some real issues with management. Within the last 5 months I have been gone, 25 plus people have quit due to management. It really is too bad... the company has the potential to be better to its employees."
good,"Spectums acquisition of Time Warner Cable called for me to relocate to Stamford, CT. I choose to not relocate so I have to find another job. They strongly support co-location of work teams for good or bad. Personally, it is bad."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,This was privately owned when I worked here. Did not offer benefits. Poor pay for many duties. Very stressful on the body and they did not ventilate the drive thru well in the summer so you get sick from heat exhaustion and no heat in the winter. Was warmer in the cooler than out in the drive thru.
good,"Dress code is very casual. Don't expect to much help from management. Health benefits is great, however the rate of pay doesn't match the health benefits provided. You no longer have the option to sell products to the customer."
good,"Time Warner Cable Services are the best telecom services in the industry. The company allowed me to work with property owners, managers, and tenants to bring our services in to provide value add. My work day typically started with 7am phone calls and maketing, and concluded at 5pm with customer service."
good,When I started there it was a great place to work. It soon began to go through a lot of changes very rapidly which made it very difficult to even know what roll we played as employs.
good,"Receiving in bound calls assisting customers with their concerns pertaining to their account..Solving  any issues with accounts, very very stressful job."
good,Good place to work if you're looking to gain experience but not necessarily looking for middle or top pay.  If you are quick to learn you can be promoted fairly quickly.
good,This is a great job leading to a career where you will repeatedly bump into the same people across companies. Many Time Warner employees come from other cable providers. Good place to stay if you have no plans on advancing to a higher level. The progression system is nearly impossible to accomplish and the base pay is very minimal for such a massive expected workload.
good,"Good place to work. People were great. Client was ok, but it was not their fault as we were an outside seller in their store"
good,"I worked on campus to make a little extra money. The convenience of the job being close was helpful, but they expected too many hours out of me while I was trying to balance work and being a full time student."
good,"It's been said that if you have nothing good to say, you shouldn't say anything so...I'll be brief."
good,"I love the work I did at Time Warner Cable! I loved my customers, enjoyed helping them with their issues and fixing the problems they had. Management was ok for the most part, however, the employees are severely  micro managed!!! My co-workers were the best you will come across, always willing to help with a problem or a big job. Always willing to share information and educate one another! The hardest part of my job was going into homes that I was unsure about, by myself, and seeing things such as child neglect and animal abuse. The best part of my job was meeting so many wonderful people and making them happy by fixing the problems they were experiencing with there service!"
good,"the benefits were great but offten id get stuck on a very large job and get no help i would call my sup several times and be told every one is buisy no one can help then the next day hear from some one else that they sat with nothing to do then a week later id be sitting with little to do and call my sups and be told no one needs help then the next day some one else would tell me about some large job they had that i could have helped them on but with over 60 people in my tech group its hard to call every one my self but if they are calling and i am calling you would thing the supps would pair us up"
good,"Firstly nothing i learned in training i actually took with me on the phones it is a self learned field i think. Secondly idk if they realize it or not but we do have families and other obligation aside from work. The shifts SUCK every Saturday is mandatory with long dreadful hours. The staff plays favoritism out of this world as long as you're selling you'll be a favorite so you basically can leave when you want, call off, slack off and nothing would be done BUT if you're not a good salesman every little thing you do will become a write up. The money is good your effort determines your pay so as long as you try you'll be ok. Best part about the job was the people i met other than that I absolutely  hated this place"
good,"I started working for Bright House Networks in 2012, I was hired into their technical support position in their Orlando office. I can honestly say the first six months of working there was amazing. Tons of positive re-enforcement, lots of respect from fellow co-workers, as well as tons of motivational activities. But right around the time I was transferred to new department I was noticing a disturbing trend coming through the call center floor. We went from an employee concentric set up to very much turning into your atypical call center numbers game. Why this isn't uncommon, I feel this cost us to loose a lot of good people who had helped Bright House establish their former positive customer view. In the ensuing year and a half I was in my final position, I watched ridiculous policy changes, and a sort of house cleaning come through. "
good,"very political"
good,"The job is pretty good but now they have a contract with ctdi with is ok for a starter job, but its only threw a temp service you can get hired threw"
good,"I started as a customer care rep, they then changed the title as well as job to promo roll off then to retention.  It is well known that your job title as well as duties can change at a drop of a dime. There is no loyalty at all.  The job is very stressful but the pay is good"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Working daily to up sale customers just to meet sales quotas and businesses felt unethical and misleading to the valued customers who love the company and the product we provided.
good,"Time Warner is the first large corporation I've worked for and overall I'm happy with the experience. I get along well with the customers, my co-workers, and routers/other office personnel. I've learned a lot about how cable and telephony work and how the network backbone is configured. "
good,"Learned a lot, stressful, pressure to work harder/faster for little pay. They give you little time to do a proper job and why am I not going faster but then complain that I fly through jobs without checking everything. Management/ higher ups treat you poorly, the scorecard they hand out every month makes you not excited, just brings morale down.The turn over rate for techs is quite high because of all this."
good,"average pay, low stress environment.not much opportunity for advancement.unrealistic expectations for maintenance techs. management does not take responsibility for outages or other company issues."
good,"Bad supervisors, poor equipment, work in all weather, low pay, Co workers were fine but always working alone. No teamwork involved with job. Poor policies for employees."
good,"TWC Arena is a great place to work if you like a fast pace atmosphere, constant turn around and working 65+ hour weeks. You get to meet a lot of cool people and see sporting events all of the time. Pay, isn't great. Isn't even competitive."
good,This was a nice place to work. However they did not have enough positions to hire everyone on. I was at the bottom of the group and was let go cause my contract ran out.
good,Great comapnay to work with great management team. Excellent company culture and exciting work environment. Daily tasks vary on a wekly and hrly basis.
good,"Good job work/life balance"
good,"Handling Irate Calls, Taking Supervisor Calls, (Insight) Building Address in Icoms, Handling"
good,Difficult to implement new ideas or easier processes. Cluster work environment. I enjoyed accomplishing tasks. It was exciting to know customers were receiving their products each day.
good,"a typical day at work was being on the phone with a headset"
good,"Great to start off and get money flowing, but no room for advancement!! Call Center wasn't the place for the professionalism..be aware! lol"
good,enjoyed job when I first starting working for them but then a lot of the old supervisors left and get new ones that really did not know much.  co workers were nice.
good,"Spectrum is a Herman Miller Dealer. Herman Miller is a huge brand in office furniture. I was hired to work with a specific client as a Project Manager on that account. The position is more crisis management then anything else. I do more administration work then I ever have in my entire 14 year career. The position does not allow me to properly utilize my skills that I have worked very hard to define. The company has no processes in place and makes for very inefficient work flow and poor time management. I pride myself on my time management skill and my current roll and the way the company operates has me doing the same thing multiple times in a row because they run several software programs that don't talk to each other so a lot of my computer work is manually entered multiple times throughout a day. The hardest part of my job is managing the clients last minute changes and still maintaining high level of customer service to meet the last minute change. The office morale makes the day seem to last forever, nobody gets along and it adds additional stress and difficulty in doing your job."
good,"Charter displays this job as a great way to make money and a career opportunity. Unfortunately, they don't inform you of the poor management and extreme lack of autonomy given as sales rep. They micromanage in extreme ways and ask for 6 days of the week from you. Conference calls that interrupt your day and make you disposition at every door which only wastes your time in the field. Make sure you tread softly when looking into this position."
good,"This company had a lot of benefits they offered their employees and plenty of incentives to want to be better. But they also informed you that you will never reach ""the highest standards."" You will forever be striving to reach unattainable goals. If you did make those goals it was at the sacrifice of the customers and their well-being and I am 100% against customers being treated unfairly and tricked into plans, items, and products they do not need and are really over priced for a sale."
good,"•      Set up and configure Arris DAC6000 running 4.4.R4 and 5.0 R1 for Lab testing"
good,"Stable working place"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"•	Data analysis and modeling of a backbone network comprised of Cisco and Juniper routers and 			switches"
good,Productive but fun at the same time. i learnt to manage people/handle pressures from people on a day to day basis.
good,"The company seems to think that working in fear will make up for bad management. They are still reorganizing after five years and you never know what will change tomorrow. If you find a comfortable spot it is OK but things will change."
good,They are Terrible to Work for they have a good system but expectations on a dailey point system is most of the time impossible to give the customer enough of time to fix or install Cable issuesto a high quality of customer service they want you to fix everything right but do not allow enough time to do it right which in turn gives you a low dailey point score or techs have to take short cuts which generates repeat trouble calls and that hurts you also on your dailey average. I feel if I am on a service call you dont complete the job til everything is functioning correctly equipment tested and all aspects up to code to prevent future trouble calls.
good,"This is your average company to work for. Has your benefits, vacation ect but I felt like I couldn't move up in the company or further my future with them. Definitely needs better management within."
good,"They would issue us work through our PDA's and would have to route ourselves to ensure the work got done in the most efficient manner.  They would give us our jobs only minutes before we started shift which would leave us in a rush to ensure we get the jobs completed.  They would issues anywhere from 18-20 jobs a day and discipline anyone that didn't finish, but pushed company policy that we only had to be able to do 2 jobs an hour on an 8 hour day."
good,I met many wonderful people working at TWC and developed many skills that I am proud to hold today.
good,"Installed/repaired Cable tv, cable modem and VoIP at residential and commercial customer premises"
good,Compensation is ranked amongst the best. Privately owned by some of the best people in the world.
good,"A typical day within this position consists of canvassing assigned territories to make contact with existing subscribers to Time Warner Cable products. Upgrading equipment, repairing basic issues and upselling products. I learned the importance of good time management and planning skills. I also learned that depending on leadership to help chart your path  is a mistake and giving career direction is not something that all companies take pride in or focus on. All things considered, coworkers maintained as they had to and the concept of growth is often referenced more as ""survival"". The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain solvency and financial stability as there were many attempts at making drastic changes to pay structure.(commissions) The most enjoyable part of this position has been the benefits and good relationships with a few co-workers and members of management. (there are very good people here)"
good,"a typical day at TWC was very busy fast paced. The job itself was not bad at all. My co-workers were great always willing to lend a hand. Majority of the supervisors were great as well, really wanting to help! My immediate supervisor was horrible. Did not know how to coach nor supervise at all. When going to upper managment, the impression was we are here to help but in reality they are only there to protect themselves!! TWC statement was to stand on integrity when in fact they actually want you to cottle the customers and lie to them. Good employees with integrity doesn't last long there."
good,"When I was hired on at TWC, I was very excited. Upon realizing how they conduct business, I was extremely disappointed. They expect too much with lack of or inappropriate training. There is no structure and everything changes daily. In addition, they are constantly shutting down parts of the organization and forcing people to either quit or move to another position causing confusion in the entire office. The entire environment is chaotic and is set up like Chuck E. Cheese. Not a place for adults."
good,"Charter communications is contracted through Revana  which is a company that was previously called teletech. Typical day at work includes 100+ incoming calls regarding new service or the service that is already provided. I've learned to troubleshoot cable, internet, and phone  issues. Management was to small for the number of employees and the company which was located on black canyon was relocated back to Tempe. Coworkers were great and loyal. Harders part of the job was no advancement and no raises. Commision was offered. Most enjoyable part of the day is evenings because customer have more time to talk sales than in the morning."
good,"Time Warner Cable has an excellent network, and a wide range of excellent service offerings. "
good,"Good place to work as a technician for 13yrs, however the longer in the tooth you are the less valuable you are. As of late management was very improper about their professionalism. Showing favorites and allowing advantages for some and not others, In instances being very open about how they felt about one tech over another,(not being base on work or attitude) allowing better equipment, job types and job load adjustments. All bonus and raises are performance based. However if you meet the requested guidelines the tighter the reigns and the harder you will work to receive a pack of gum. Don't get me wrong you get good benefits and all. As i said if you are not in the in crowd and if you try to make the job better and not go along with the crazy parameters they set then you are the outlaw."
good,the calll center down stairs was loud always but there was always someone there to help you out
good,"No advancement from entry level. Self supporting as ""co-workers"" and management was in a different state."
good,"TWC is a great place to work, the compensation and benefits were great."
good,very much wanting employees to push new services on existing and new customers
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,You are treated like a second rate person. They don't care who you are and only care about being at your desk and they look for reasons to let you go.
good,"answering calls from customers and employees for internet, email, and phone issues. Surveying network infrastructure for outages and signal issues. Creating user names and passwords. As well as user access and permissions. Repairing hardware and software issues on pc and laptop. Reimaging computers. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unsatisfied customers with internet and voip phone service. Most enjoyable part of the job is turning unsatisfied customers into happy customers after their issue has been resolved."
good,"The job entails taking incoming calls from customers concerning billing, repair issues and 1st level technical support."
good,"Long Hours,heavy lifting,and high pole climbing.Spend long hours driving from one job site to next usually spaced out diff cities or was back in days when I was employed there."
good,A typical day is to talk with tech that call in about the job they are on and help them trouble shoot or something that the tech needs help with.
good,"Can get lost in the shuffle in this big company, especially when it comes to Human Resource needs and concerns."
good,"my biggest issue with TWC is that they award shifts based on productive numbers, and customer reviews, which are terribly squed because of issues out of your control, every 6 months. so you in theory could have a drastically different shift every 6 months."
good,A very rule orientated work place. Do not get many chances to make a mistake before they fire you.
good,"The employees at spectrum are typically nice, i worked there for 4 years. speaking with nice customers gave me a sense that i was doing a good job however when there were angry customers it was overwhelming but manageable."
good,Short breaks. No time Time to breathe between calls. We can not use wrap time between calls. This is mentally exhausting  by lunch time. The general public forgets we are human.
good,"As a new member to the organization, not affiliated with a legacy company, it's clear that there are factions that continue to operate as the legacy company.  Lots of bureaucracy and below average pay."
good,The benefits with Spectrum are good and the pay is decent. The disadvantages would be shifts bids/vacation bids and trying to get the time you want or need off.
good,Not a good balance between work and personnel  life management is more focus on number than employees the hardest part of working here is to having to mandatory work on holidays and time off the most enjoyable part is they have a decent 401k.
good,"If you dont mind being tethered  to a desk all day taking back to back calls and being screamed at by customers. atmosphere is upbeat. You need thick skin for this job. One thing don’t get sick or you will be terminated. Expect to work every weekend and have no life outside of work. Company is always making changes. Also, alot of shady things going on between  Supervisors and agents."
good,I learn to turn an angry customer to an easy sale just by taking my time and using my communication skills. My coworkers was fun to work with. We always had friendly competition when it came to sales.
good,"The only tech company I've ever worked that is stuck in the past and is consistently looking backward.  They don't allow casual dress for non customer facing employees, there is no work from home and the hours aren't flexible for the salaried.  The company rarely does any kind of team building exercises or offers any kind of significant opportunity to socialize and achieve a sense of belonging.  Overall morale is low.  If you're seeking a job where you work on a wonderful campus in well lit areas among greenery, you'll find the exact opposite at Spectrum.  Many of the facilities are antiquated, florescent lit, cubicle farms.  Abandon all hope ye who toil here."
good,"I love working cable tv, the people and repair issues.  But some management made hard there because life and the world is not perfect. So I said my good bye"
good,I am happy to work there but need more money. They provide a great service to the community but it’s a non profit so getting grants really make or break there’s operations.
good,This company is ok but they make your job a nightmare. Because they are so being l beyond disorganized it's unreal. They also want you to hit highly unrealistic and impossible sales goals.
good,"Overall the problems I had were with management.  I was tired of being treated like a 'battery' to make other people money.  Yes I made good money as well, however it was never good enough, 90% was not 100%, top 5% wasn't top 2% and their culture was more about pushing the top tier to be even better, and forgetting about the low tiers."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I have absolutely loved being a field Technician, but the work life balance for field operations is atrocious. 50+ hour weeks with ""volunteer"" overtime regularly makes it hard to maintain your life outside of work."
good,"I was a internet tech support agent until 10/18 when the company decided to move the internet tech support to SC. The company then moved my entire depart to the local cable tv office where we receivded 2.5 days training on something we already knew."
good,Management and associates change on a daily basis. In the 2 years of working there there were 3 system changes with minimum training. The culture has changed for the worst and management is okay with a high turnover ratio.
good,"If you have ever worked a call center before, this will be almost identical, if not a little less strict; at least while I was there. You're typical day will be having to be on your computer and ready to go no less than 5 minutes BEFORE your shift, otherwise you will get dinged on your adherence rating. Same thing applies for coming back from breaks/lunches. Make sure you leave exactly on time though. You will be measured on any little number they can pull on you and at any given time, those same numbers will be used against you, even if they are great, they're still never great enough. "
good,"Not the best senior management. but lots of hard working employees. Lots of turnover, company has a hard time keeping employees. Other than the free cable, benefits are quite average."
good,"Good money, seems like the person in control of managment has mood swings to where it seems like any and everyone could lose their job at any point in time. They are good at dangling the proverbial brass rings to regular employees on career advancements, then hire from outside. It is a loose attendance policy as well and they have trouble accommodation use of sick time and if you have major medical issues they won't blink an eye before replacing you. They also expect you to sit all day and give you problems for taking any time off the phone to do anything including use of the bathroom. On top of that there is no rewards for tenured employees other than an extra week of vacation time after 5 years."
good,"Some supervisors haven’t been in the field so long they can’t help you, other employees will help, but they may have route across town. Expect you to come in on days off, not mandatory but you have to explain why."
good,managers and direct supervisors cant seem to get on the same page about much and information dissemination about what needs to be done is poorly. productivity and repaet ratios are our only judges for possible raises and they dont factor in actual work done
good,The environment could have been more professional.  The selection of lower level leadership should be restructured and give much more consideration. Management is top notch.
good,With no room.for advancement it was hard to stay at Spectrum. The coworkers and the people there were great. Spectrum just seemed to be very disorganized when trying to let a person know if they were eligible for advancement in the company. They treated us like workers with no opportunity to really grow and I felt like that every day.
good,"Advancement is determined by an outside test known as the Network+. Without that certification, one can not advance to a cost of living pay grade. Despite having great work ethics, good metrics, great customer satisfaction, manager acknowledgement for work done, etc. it's all for nothing because growth is determined by a computer based test of memorization. That, alone, kills the whole experience."
good,I've been the in tech field for nearly a decade. Spectrum has a lot of clean up to do in management and in how they treat and handle there employees and method of business. I've noticed how they continue to put there customers and employees on the back burner to reach and unidentifiable goal. I hope the best for them but I believe they need to put there true workers back on there priority list.
good,"Co workers are mostly stressed, frustrated and ready to leave the job. Unfortunately they feel they must stay because they need the work for their family, pay bills and to live."
good,"sales quotos , customer service,  like any company mangers have their favorites, very good benefits for working there , overall a good place to work and earn a living"
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced and lots of calls.  I learned a lot of customer care skills as well as basic internet troubleshooting standards.  Management seems to only care about the numbers even though they try to sell you on coaching to the behaviors.  The culture is ok, lots of nice co workers and friendly people.  The hardest part of the job was the training, it seemed to have very little with what we would actually be doing. I did enjoy the people that I worked with."
good,"If you're in a career transition, then you may be content. "
good,"The pay is not good or at least it doesn't align with your educational background and previous work experience you may have. There are a lot of politics involved to the point where its not what you know, its who you know"
good,Spectrum really tries to make work fun but they fall short with the work stress and overall pressure that management puts on their supervisors and in turn onto employees.
good,"Job is very stressful, but you do get to work with some awesome people. Even though you have a team, you are pretty much by yourself. Thinking outside of the box is the key."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,You will like it here if you like spending all your time working. Not much time for anything else.The supervisors are kind of mean and demand a lot out of you and the other employees treat you bad.
good,I love working their the job is a challenge. I wish I had more online resources to better my skills. I wish we had better areas to meet at with proper speakers so we can listen to calls and to go through our meeting w/o having to be pushed out or meet at our desks because they are taken. getting assistance while on a call is almost impossible especially on escalated calls /pcs are slow there is limited parking
good,Did help the employee advance...only wanted them to sale and did not care if the employee was verbally abused by the customer.  Call center where calls was answered and up sale all customer
good,"Walking from door to door through all weather "
good,"Leadership was the main flaw while working here.  Co-workers were top notch, management level is where the problems start.  Processes are continually changed to the point it is unclear what is expected that particular day.   Had a great team in place of seasoned construction crew- now all have been ran off with no recourse from management despite the multiple HR filed complaints."
good,"Back to back phone calls with company guidelines that allow for other departments to work loop holes and not help customers. Most escalation paths boil down to one or two ways which can be denied. Can be difficult to help customers and do the right thing when company guidelines and other departments don't need to work that way. "
good,"you begin signing in to all your software and tools which will take you 10-20 min depending on how the system or computers health. You must be ready to take calls immediately after signing in having all your tools up required to help a customer. A lot of information needs to be research and usually in the system. support is there through a coach or supervisor. Ensure courtesy and empathy at all times to ensure positive workflow. For me it was great I knew most people who are like family since you spend enough time around them and work and collaboration is essential. Learning is part of the job as everything is subject to change with technology. The hardest part is ensuring you are meeting your goals, concentrating on your weak points as you make improvements. The most enjoyable part for me was helping customers and having successful outcomes for them."
good,The company offers great discounts and employee benefits but once you are in a position it is very hard to advance without making the correct contacts within the company.
good,"Most days can be really fun, but you have to realize you have no choice over your work hours. If you have kids this can be a major issue. Great benefits though! You deal with a lot of calls and they count against you even though the customer is just trying to get to the right department."
good,"Was there for 4years and 11.5 months and did move up the latter yet not due to HR.  Yet I left on my own accord and received an email  at the beginning of the year that the Pensions would now be determined by the physical year not the actual date.  Yet when I called to get my pension payout, they stated that I had 2 weeks left and would not get it- which is how appreciative they were to a dedicated employee for 5 years. "
good,Commission is a great perk especially with all the stress from the job yet its structure is always changing.. Management never has there ducks in a row and always verbally threatening you to meet unrealistic goals.. The agents know more then the actual supervisors and always having to do their job for them without any actual recognition for it!!
good,"If you like working for a large organization where you are just a number, this is the place to you! Really, the organization is so large! I did learn a lot of my excel knowledge here and learned to work with lot of different management styles."
good,"Working in the Regional Service Center is not an overall bad job.  The local management up to the Director is engaged and willing to discuss issues.  However, that being said, the management above the local director feels disjointed and unaware of the workload that is asked of the employees."
good,I guess it just the store I work in. Not enough traffic goals unreasonable for traffic draconian rules. Too don't match reality on the ground. Disappointing
good,TWC when I worked for them valued their customers much more than employees. They allowed their employees to be verbally abused on the phone to keep their customers. I found their benefits and everything great. I just think that being verbally abused by customers is too high for me to pay to receive decent benefits
good,"Overall, a lot of benefits available for the employees.  It is challenging for any comany to effectively support their employees and address all concerns."
good,no advancement and poor environments since merger. all departments sent out of state. Only sales left in the call center. poor management and leaders running the call center.
good,The culture was off. I was well qualified for a number of positions but I was not given a chance to secure and interview. The management was not very transparent.
good,I loved my job but people have no common sense so its very hard to work with people who cant even understand simple things my first supervisor was awesome the manager was great my last supervisor made everyone hate there job
good,"Overall health benefits are good,very hard to get decent schedule.There are very good co-workers and some management .The environment is very numbers driven can be stressful and metrics are constantly changing."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"This is a good place to learn and develop good work ethic. Job is very stressful and you will end up thinking about work all the time, even at home with family."
good,"You would spend a long day of 10+ hours working on the phones to assist customers to solve various issues with their internet, telephone, and cable services in a very comfortable enviroment, but didn't have enough variety of resturants available.  Plus it was somewhat difficult to travel home from, espeically after the buses stopped running in the evening."
good,Work and non stop until your shift is over. You learn advanced video content and transport devices. No body cares.  You do your job and follow company rules.
good,"If you want to listen to people complain that their service isn't working or that you charge too much for cable then I have the job for you!"
good,"I worked for Time Warner Cable before the merge with Charter Communications. I feel like the company has no clear direction and that from one day to then next there are things that don't make sense for us to change. And then weeks later we change it back or make an even bigger change that makes the previous change pointless. The company looks good to customers and they are happy, but internally we are sinking and the outlook is bleak."
good,As a field technician for Spectrum I had no problem. Work was great training was provided and work load wasn't too difficult. Only problem was being able to advance in the company and pay could have been better
good,"I had six weeks of paid training to learn my customer service job.  I learned a lot about cable, computers, television operations, digital telephones, and public relation skills."
good,"It was a interesting place to work. The game room had an Xbox One, 2 video arcade machines, a pinball machine, 2 tvs, a ping pong table and a pool table."
good,I did not work here I worked at Time Warner Cable. I left the Company before they became Spectrum. That is all the information I have to offer.  This also should not be a requirement to up date your profile.
good,Very cut throat position. Many pros to job but also many negative reasons why this it not a perfect position. Management/leadership  did not care about success of each person only their own success.
good,"I dread going into the office and open email just for the stuff that my boss sends,  The environment is incredibly fast pased and you never know what is going to happen,"
good,Leadership doesnt consider methods for best practices. Many people with experience are downsized without proper planning to ensure customer experience not impacted.
good,I’m consider myself a people person and you have to be as a technician. You must be able to deal with many personalities and be able to defuse hostile customers without being hostile yourself
good,Lack of focus on the employees and customer. Poor communication from executive level in regards to how the employees are spoken to. Extreme level of distrust. Lack of concern for change impact to customers. Level of change for employees is never-ending.
good,Having to go into other peoples houses is....different. I've learned that not everybody lives like me or has the same morals. Management was lackluster and incompetent most of the time. Hardest part was dealing with the elements outside or peoples living conditions. Most enjoyable was clocking out honestly.
good,"The company changed over the 10yrs I worked there.  Many departments were eliminated, passing the workload onto everyone else who stayed.  The quality of people being hired was lowered.  The company does not seem to care about the employees.  By the time I left, I had developed a stress disorder similar to PTSD."
good,"Spectrum provided good jobs for employees without college degrees.  Unfortunately, 200 of them were relocated to Texas and valuable jobs in Coachella Valley were lost."
good,"Worked there when it was Time Warner as an Install/Field Tech for several years. They frequently went on firing sprees and always fired 3 at a time, not always for valid reasons. Management didn't like backlash or speaking your opinion. Was decent pay, but wasn't paid enough for the type of dangerous work that's involved. Became a numbers based job and they didn't deter from those. Said it was about the employee, but showed with actions that it was really about the bottom dollar."
good,"The draw is the pay.  But it's a revolving door.  Managers and associates get walked out daily.  There is a culture of fear and micro management.  But if you are one of the few that can handle the stress and sell/ retain, the benefits are amazing.  Big money, company paid group vacations, etc"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Its very diverse culture. I can only speak on the sales support. There isn't any training for those that may come off the street. Right into the dept. You have to be there an  work in other dept. To be able to understand.. Other than that the company its self is great.
good,Good benefits and discounts keep you in there BUT bad communication will make you run. I had hoped to grow with this company but sadly I have to find new employment due to the merger.
good,This company does not care about its employees or customers - they only care about the bottom line. Employees are treated as numbers and everything is segregated - there is no TEAM environment.
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with the ever changing commission schedule and rules regarding selling within and or without assigned territory.
good,"My schedule was horrible. They wouldnt work with my school schedule, I'm quitting by the end of the month. I really had no life outside of this job."
good,"Job is ok if you can deal with what comes with the territory. Stay to yourself, do your job, get your money, and go home and you'll be fine. Otherwise you won't last too long, Not too many do."
good,All I can say is that if you can stand being berated all day by people who clearly don't understand how an isp works then this job is for you. Management is little to no help. Schedule adherence must be followed to a t.
good,"I liked working at time warner during the time i was there but the progression setup i felt was a bit unfair. I know you can't go from novice to expert pay in the blink of an eye, but theres no reason why McDonalds workers are getting paid more than a certified technician. We're putting ourselves at risk on a daily basis by going inside customers homes. Co-workers are great and the culture was good, they helped me whenever i needed help figuring things out. The system in which you can get bonuses is some what unfair, if you do the job the ""RIGHT"" way theres no way you'll receive that bonus. Its kind of like you're set up to fail."
good,"I work as a Sales Support Desk Agent out of Columbia, SC. I have been employed since Feburary 2016 and overall my impression of this company as a whole is mixed. The training is less than stellar and its truly baptism by fire once you hit the floor. The pay is fair but a little under whelming when measured against other jobs with similar help desk functions that you would perform here, and the PTO and sick time is something to be desired. Be prepared there is no adherence metrics in these call centers. If you are one minute late from a break or lunch it counts as a occurence which can quickly get you walked out the door. In this department be prepared for a extradionarily high call volume as well. The merger is bringing some positive changes but the overall experience to date has been nerve wrecking. The software systems they use are not the most business friendly programs CSG and ICOMS are two of the most least business savvy softwares I have worked with when dealing with call centers and these two by far are more prone to error messages and fallout problems then i can count. Hopefully with the merger being complete we start to see some real changes but the lack of communication from management and the sudden change of policies without notice has made for less than stellar start to my carrer here."
good,"High volume inbound calls, many abusive callers, and very little empowerment to adequately resolve problems. Prepare to be micromanaged by somebody who has never done your job as internal promotions are done purely on a token basis."
good,I am not willing to discuss this information as I have signed a documented privacy clause to not discuss anything about company details. Thank you for understanding.
good,"If you genuinely care about providing top quality service to your customers, look elsewhere. Management only truly cares about how many stops you can do in a day. Good employees are run through the ringer picking up the slack for the less motivated. Bottom line, in the Wisconsin area it seemed more like they would just hire any warm body to fill a spot. Super high turnover rate in the tech side of things. After 8+ years of their lackluster management I parted ways. BEST career decision ever. Super high stress and mediocre pay."
good,Management does not care about their employees. Not willing to make changes to improve the quality of work experience or that of a customers experience. Not a company I would do business with.
good,I would share information with customers regarding Time Warner promotions and products that are available.  Sign in clients for account overviews.  Provide excellent customer service.
good,"Enjoy the freedom of managing each day, the people are friendly and helpful. Regionalism has made it hard to compete some tasks during daily operations"
good,"Working for this company was a blessing, I enjoyed the freedom that it offered, and the compensation for the work I did was satisfactory."
good,"We helped people with issues with phone and cable, I enjoyed helping people, but the managers made it kind of a hostile work environment with average people lasting three months before quitting."
good,I was a CSR for Time Warner Cable and loved my work and working environment. Even though I loved my work it was very stressful and takes a toll on you. I learned that all anyone who calls in to a call center wants is great service and their problem solved. I also learned you can't always solve it yourself but you can get them who or what they need to fix it.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,working with my co-workers was really fun and exciting. Everyone got along really great and it was just an enjoyable full time job that kept me on my feet. Great experience!
good,"Time Warner was a great company to work for, but there are some issues going on within the company. The management is not supportive at all, and there is no room to advance here locally in Evansville. The job itself was fun, the coworkers were like a family. A typical day at work would involve assisting customer service representatives when they had any issues, such as upset customers, billing issues, or troubleshooting questions. The hardest part of the job was speaking with highly irate customers. This is something that I am very comfortable with, but it isn't easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was that all of the co-workers are very close. It made it easy to come into the job knowing that everyone in the call center was very supportive of all situations going on."
good,There's little time for family and the work is stressful. A lot is expected from employees and more responsibilities are continually heaped upon you. Complimentary services are very nice however.
good,Did not enjoy my overall time at Charter. Management seemed to not really care about its employees other than getting the job done. I would not recommend to others.
good,"I really liked all the people I met there however I was lead to believe that my skill set as a very experienced sales professional would assist me in big commission opportunities.  Unfortunately, the job was more like a cattle call in a call room setting where I was severely restricted in using my tried and proven sales skills because they wanted me to follow a script about 95% and didn't spend much time in training.  My sale close ratio and big sale success was very good but the quantity of sales couldn't suffice a minimally acceptable income for me.    The goals seemed unrealistic and with a high turn over of employees it became evident it wasn't a good fit."
good,"Need to implement good Software Life Cycle process, Knowledge Management best practices to make sure that all products are delivered on time."
good,I was away from the family a lot. and I didn't think the pay was worth it. the training was sub-par and they kind of just threw me to wolves.
good,The company failed to install on time and provided poor customer support after the sale. Ok management but small sales territory and too many hours on internal reports and busy work.
good,"It's a great paying job, but there are a lot of downfalls which come with the responsibility.I do not see my wife and kids as much as I would like to. A typical work day is between 10-12 hours. The homes you will have to go into could be infested with bugs and rodents, some are covered in trash and drug paraphernalia. It takes a strong mind mentally to deal with some of the things we see on a daily basis. The pay is very attractive for someone without a formal education, though."
good,"Negative negative negative. Constant negative culture. Nothing is ever good enough. Great pay and benefits, but poor atmosphere"
good,"A lot of high pressure with the job, but pay was very good.  Management was always changing the matrix that you were scored and paid on as if they could not decide what was really important.  Very typical call center environment that is not for most people and very little advancement opportunities."
good,"Day to day 90% of the calls that come in are angry customers calling you names and complaining about their services.  There are never any supervisors for advice when needed.  You are rated on every single detail of your calls.  Seconds on a call, amount of reduction or addition to an account, loss of a customer and your customer service satisfaction surveys. If you make a judgment call on your own, because of lack of supervisors available, and it is the wrong decision, you get written up. It doesn't take much to get written up here."
good,"Everyone wants you to meet certain goals, do things at every job, but do not allow enough time to travel, eat lunch, and finish without OT, and at times they prohibit OT. You'll be routed by a program that people constantly interfere with, so you'll end up passing people going the opposite direction, you'll go out to the very boundaries of the covered area for a single job and come back (90mins total travel time) and still be expected to be as productive as if all your jobs are in the same zip code. Coworkers are great, and really the only  reason to bother with the job, aside from free cable services if you live in their system. Given two choices, the managers will always say you picked the wrong one, creating a constant catch 22 mentality."
good,The company pays substandard wages and over all the benefits are ok. How ever there is very little room for upward mobility and pay increases are not much to talk about. They tell employees that they support work from home. However they complain if you do it more than few times a year. They hire few people for an overwhelming work load. They also hand out additional responsibilities without additional pay. I would not recommend this company currently.
good,Answered inbound calls. My job was to answer inbound calls and whether they were calling for sales or any other issue I was to ask question to find needs for services that the customer didn't already have or enhance the ones that they had. I learned that in sales it is very competitive and  other agents will take your sales if given an opportunity. Management was changed regularly because of changing shifts. Each manager focuses on different things and those things can change constantly. Management styles varied greatly and could be very difficult at times to adjust to.My co-workers were very supportive and most of them were very helpful with sharing things that worked well for them. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my last manager who was very much so a micro manager. She would try to have a conversation with me while I was on the phone with a customer via in person or through instant messenger which distracted me from taking care of the needs of the customer. Being pulled off the phones constantly when you have numbers that have to be met as far as sales and the number of calls that you take in a day. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking with the customers and making a connection with them and being able to help solve their problem and keeping them happy with the company and our services.
good,"Work environment is very up tight, you have to sit in a chair 7.5 hours a day, supervisors frown upon getting up and stretching once in a while, they say its a safety hazard. pay is mediocre, not worth what you should be getting paid for, especially when you are gettting yelled at by customers all day. Co-workers for the most part are alright, you still cant trust anyone. the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are upset about the service that there getting from the company which isn't good at all. Company charges way to much for the quality of service. The best part of the job is having friday and saturday off. The worst part about it is getting out of work at 12am. The company also changes things about the work place that you have to do at any given time."
good,"Things change so much,  policies and procedures change but the goals and requirements don't"
good,This company has shown its true colors to me sense the economy in my area has gone down and not many people are ordering new cable services. They are your best friend to your face and holding a knife waiting to stab you in the back the moment you turn around.
good,"If you like working in call centers, this is better than most. A lot of great co-workers and supervisors. The hardest part of the job is keeping up on all new products and stats that you have to maintain. The most enjoyable part is prizes that are given out."
good,"Not much to write. You go in, log into the phones, and then go home."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,There is very little positive to say about this company and their practices. I would prefer to keep my opinions private.
good,"Unless you work on the back end (meaning no customer interaction) or work in management, things can change for you at any given time. TWC really stands for Things Will Change. Management will tell you that. So, if you don't like change then its not for you. The company has great incentives for employees but remember customers come first before anything else. Thick skin is required when deal directly with people over the phone."
good,Very challenging time in this industry.  Learned the power of large and small numbers...a small amount recurring a multitude of times can result in significant cost savings.
good,"Stressful job environment."
good,"My typical week at work consisted of 6 days, 12-16 hour days on conference calls, travelling and being in the outside elements. Salaried and commissions do not add up. The incentives diminished greatly throughout my time with Charter. They offer a competitive package for a seasoned sales professional. You're either terrible at face to face, door to door sales or you're not. Great job for the right person."
good,"The C in Charter really does mean CHANGE. I learned how to d-escalate customers over the phone. co-workers were mostly friendly. Management was nice, but unorganized. Hardest part of job was to keep up with the almost everyday changes. Most enjoyable was the satisfied customers & starting pay rate."
good,"•  Answers incoming support- and billing-related phone calls from new  and existing customers;  read and respond to email messages from new and existing customers; retrieves and replies to voicemails from new and existing customers; meetings established call-center metrics and call-quality standards"
good,Pay is great but this is a High School Environment that plays heavily on favorites. If you get along with your superiors you will go far.
good,"Things have drastically changed for the negative since TWC has bought Insight Communications. Customer service has fell thru the roof. Customers now and will speak to someone all over. Denver 1 time, Next, the Philippines, then maybe Charlotte, NC. No personal touch or service. All employees are only a number. To many chiefs and few Indians. Once a month pay on commissions, Limited sales opportunity...(they limit your production), I could go on & on. I'm a very positive, productive, and a real team player 100%, however their idea of treating people fair are at total opposite ends of the table. Please forgive me of the frustration."
good,"The job overall as an customer care professional I enjoy, had there been more training with what was actually happening on the sales floor I feel this would be an idea company to work for."
good,A majority of the day is spent answering questions about why the monthly rates continue to go up.  Many calls are transferred to a department to help lower the customer;s rate. Pricing continually goes up and every caller wants a lower rate on their services. about 1/4 of the calls are for payment arrangements for past due customers.
good,Time Warner Cable has constant change with commission structure; never consistent. I would have to say the plus about working there would be the health benefits and discounted services received as an employee.
good,The pay was awesome but it could be a very stressful job. After working there for 10 years and having your job taken away and given to workers overseas it was devastating. I would not go back being you never know if your job is secure.
good,Scanned labels and cross referenced barcodes  for accurate daily totals learned new skills that i would apply to my daily duties there was minimal supervision in which certain co -workers would fill in that position. The hardest part of my job would be the constant demands to fill numerous orders with less material and the most enjoyable part  would be to accomplish it in a timely manner and keep customers satisfied
good,"Enjoyed my job, but limited work at the time and no health benefits available for part-time hours I worked"
good,"It's a good job, not a great job.  It has flaws like any other company but they change direction as a company many many times.  I will like consistency.  So far, it is good but it won't last as there is a major change on the horizon. "
good,"I found working at Time Warner Cable to be extremely productive.  I always was busy when handling inbound and outbound calls for customers in TWC collections department.   I learned how to use their computer software and also how to deal with difficult people.  My co workers and management were always helpful and courteous.   The hardest part of my job was getting some customers to pay the full balances on their accounts.  The most enjoyable part was helping people, and having them pay the full balance on their accounts."
good,Advancement opportunities greatly limited.  No promotions from within.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"There is no such thing as a ""typical"" day at work with this job/company. Some days that's a pro, but often it's a con. The position I hold is incredibly stressful and lacks the financial compensation to make it worthwhile. I've learned a lot about data networks and fiber-optics and have enjoyed that part. I do enjoy my co-workers a lot. Everyone is down-to-earth and ultimately just wants to do a good job and make customers happy. The schedule in my current position is the most difficult part. We work days, nights, weekends, holidays and on-call all at a moment's notice. This makes planning anything (or keeping plans) almost impossible. Coupled with low pay and no support from management has lead me to start seeking employment elsewhere."
good,"This a high stress job, with the company disregards to your physical and mental heath"
good,Wonderful Place to work. Learn much cable industry technology. They gives you free cable and lots of toys and stuff to play with at your desk. This is a great career job start up company to start with. The culture is great. Everyone is friendly and Helpful.
good,"early mornings. Heading to shop to get trailer with the trencher on it. punch in my job locations I got from lastnights email. mostly up in akron jobs. I had a helper to help with small stuff like picking up marker flags cleaning up old cable grunt work. I was my own management at the jobs. I learn how to be aware of my surrounding. The hardest part of the job burying the cable it can get tricky alot of times. Most enjoyable part was be able to take a break whenever I felt like doing so, but did not take breaks really only had breaks when my helper cry to much about wanting one."
good,"GOOD company to work for, on the phone constantly, co workers were great"
good,Customer service is excellent opportunity to help others that are dedicated to a companies overall service.
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job is assisting people and making them feel empowered. I have learned how to utilize my customer service skills by showing empathy, ability to listen closely and clear verbal communication."
good,pressured environment to meet work load expectation. union and management stress. hardest part of the job is meeting customer expectations while balancing company allowed guidelines.
good,Issues with training not being accurate to actual job. This place has a gym on site and that was interesting.
good,When you recieve calls from a customer and they are swearing and yelling at you its very stressful. You are scored by the calls you receive and if the customer is unhappy you get rated by the survey they give you and that is based on your job performance.
good,Great people to work with. Management cares and listens to employees. Policies are always changing.
good,"it was a nice place to work if you can deal with, long hours management sucks and you have to put up with a lot of junk"
good,Nice experience to leran Customer Service skills and to develope advance skills to better my career also learning about referbishing equiptment and goals and procedures that Time Warner carries. It was fun and fast paces learning expierence.
good,Great Benefits but opportunity for advancement was limited.
good,"Charter is an okay company to work for. The local office that I worked for was very family oriented. We were very close, that's what I loved most about each other."
good,After 5 years of loyalty. They decided to fire me for some random reason. Come to find out I was due for a raise the next day. Coincidence?
good,Worked nights and weekends
good,They dont care if you have a family or not. If you cant work a forced shift they will fire you.
good,"Spent over 6 years in Operations and Engineering here. I jumped ship at the first real opportunity due to the culture of blame and finger-pointing that is a constant cloud over the workers heads. Lack of accountability at the Senior and middle management levels even for mult-million dollar mistakes are common. The Company touts it's ""family"" friendly values but this will only benefit those employees with the last name Bergman."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,This company is growing. It is a good place to work if you need to learn lot of new technologies. Work pressure is tremendous here. Job security depends on which team you are working with.
good,Ownership of whats lacking is a something that needs to change.  When problems arise it needs to be looked at as opportunity to change not negativity.
good,Spectrum was a great work environment with specific managers being very supportive but that was not necessarily across board.  Colleagues were a little too competitive because the company seemed to prioritize earnings over collective achievement and this makes individuals who could excel less noticeable an a bit isolated way too early in the assimilation process..
good,"always changing new products, something different happening every day so you never get bored, you get free services, benefits are really good and affordable."
good,"This company could offer more incentives for their employees."
good,"I have the ability to give customers good service by fixing our plant issues in a timely manor.  I have the ability to work outdoors.  However, I feel my work is not appreciated or fairly recognized."
good,"really enjoyed my time at spectrum.  good place to work if you are looking to work extra hours if possible.  only thing I didn't like was having a schedule from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and getting another job to drive to at 6:55 p.m., then not getting off until 11 or 12."
good,"Very fast paced and stressful work environment. Calls monitored and meeting of set metrics addressed in weekly ""coaching"" sessions. Average handle time of calls must be at or below set time frame"
good,"Spectrum was a pretty good company to work for, with $12.00 hourly plus commission. They are extremely strict about your time, clocking in, out and when you go on breaks and lunch. Since it’s a call center everyone is assigned a set schedule so no incoming calls get left unanswered. Also while in training they told us that our position would be based on what position in the class our overall performance put us in. Which it did not. We went from training hours of 11-7 to working hours of 12-9 pm."
good,"I LOVED working here even though the pay was not great. However, after the teams changed around alot. I was on 4 teams when I left here after 18 mths. And loved it till my last Team. The Teams were all moved around as there was a lot of leads that had left at the same time. I didn't know my new lead at all when I was assigned to her team. Little did I know the change that was to come. She was AWFUL, NEGATIVE, SHORT & RUDE. Some of my team had been with the company as long as 6 and 7 yrs. I found out that when they found out about who's team they were being moved to they went to HR to ask to be changed. They were told: No. A couple even looked for new jobs and left. I didn't know any of this when the stuff started happening with me. I thought she just didn't like me or my personality or ??? She didn't like that I was ""Customer"" focused and not ""Make money for the company"" focused. So she was on my case all the time. Most of the things she told us to do was contradicted within a week or so from corp. office that it was not to be done that way. I honestly don't know how she still has her job. But she is still there and alot of other people have left or went to a totally different shift (to be off her team) since they were moved to this team. She even told everybody in a meeting that ""I am having a rough time at home right now"". Well, I know that you are to walk through the doors and leave it at home......You are suppose to ""Build the Brand"" not tear it & the employees down !!!!"
good,"It was an unorganized project, Management and the Project Management office was not involved. The owner of the project had no interest in the overall project."
good,"Spectrum is great if you don't have a life. if you have kids or any kind of emergencies they are less then understanding. they reprimand employees for using too much paid sick leave that they provide. if your'e late even if you contact your supervisor they will still count it against you. if you have a bad day and your calls get pulled you get reprimanded. if you talk to much with your co-workers, reprimanded. there is little to no supervisor support for escalated calls, you are on your own."
good,"Spectrum is a good place to work.  In my experience, the co-workers were great. Tons of work which was fine. Management in my department was not good however thus my 3 star rating. May be better in other departments, it's a huge company.  "
good,Answer incoming customer phone calls and take appropriate action for each call. Maintain customer satisfaction ratings based on explicit criteria set forth by the company. Attend mandatory training sessions to stay updated on product or company policy changes
good,good place to work. you where able to cross train in your department. kept you informed during the process of a layoff. reasonable number of paid days off.
good,Great Benefits but opportunities to advance in my desired field. They work hard to make it a fun place to work. It can be challenging to deal with the divers customers but it is rewarding when you are able to solve there issues.
good,Not a very flexible company to work for. They are very focus on the representatives to sell the products at any cost. Training is available but needs to be updated to our current times
good,"If you are looking for something that will pay on time and accurate, this would have been it, but the rules, meaning dos and donts intertwine with each other."
good,"They people you work with and benefits keep you there. But if the leads and the managers do not like you, you will be gone. Your Sups will be your best resources, but do not get me wrong, the over night leads are great!!! The company is strict on attendance, so do not call out, a Dr. note does not count there, HR will not even take it."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"They had fun days but training was poor for a telecom company.  Internet training for 3 weeks followed by 2 weeks separated from rest of floor on the phones and after about 15-20 weeks of being there, they train you on phone repair.  Typical 24/7 call center environment. During the ""fun days"", management would get loud and distract you from your calls.  Their leads often had pushed back on some issues that you need help on and they didn't have enough working there.  Advancement didn't happen while I was there and typically has to be on the job for 1+ years."
good,"work gets repetitive. training is given but you learn once you get out on the floor. a lot of work expected for low minimum wage however if you are good you can make that money back with what you sell. free cable given, difficult customers, people who love it love it. good way to make extra money. horrible schedule hours/"
good,"Ordinary work, lots of stress, not fun at all. If you want to make money, it’s right for you. If you want to make money and enjoy your time "
good,"I really liked this job when I started, great benefits but it changed to cell phone sales. Half of your commission is based on cell phone sales and the store hours changed to 8pm nightly. Plus they are opening 7 days a week now. Supervisor is very unprofessional. Likes to put employees down in front of others."
good,"I did not like working in spectrums billing call center. Management turned off help lines so we needed to directly get help from our own personal supervisors which put stress on the teams. Hours of back to back calls, customers being beamed in to your consciousness to whine. Admittedly most customers aren't that bad, just the sheer volume of people will assuredly get you multiple sour puss' who will whine about the cost of service. Would not recommend getting stuck in this place. Spectrum also kinda screws customers with their upload speeds for internet. Even people who get the gigabyte speed can still only upload 35mbps. That is pitiful."
good,Before merger it was a great place to work. Now it is all about pleasing the stock holders. Don’t care about family time only that the next call gets done.
good,Lots of changes after charter took over. Not necessarily bad just very different from Time warner Cable. Benefits were significantly higher than many companies.
good,I enjoy keeping busy.  I expected to be taking care of technicians as a dispatcher (Regional Support Technician) for Spectrum.  As an RSC representative you are expected to answer phone calls from customers as well.  I was not aware that this was a thing when I was hired into this position.
good,The work environment is solid. Great benefits with excellent compensation for the right positions. Work guidelines are clearly defined leading to a well structured day.
good,"As call centers go, this was one of the worst. I was overstressed and until I made Lead, completely ill-equipped to handle the demands of irate customers. It's a good thing I have good soft skills, or I would have gone crackers after this one."
good,"The people there are amazing, but the job lacks the ability to progress pass entry level status. The job is pretty straight forward, and it's a very fast paced environment. If you can't multi-task, it's not the place for you."
good,Recently the company has been proactively trying to get rid of veteran representatives that are making more money an hour so they can hire reps that they can pay less
good,The people here are awesome!. 11 years and i wish i could stay well in my department. Alot of changes has happen within the company more negative than positive. I believe onces all the changes are done it will be alright.
good,Working at spectrum is cool until a certain extent. Management is horrible.. it’s ok at first but they interview weekly because the turn over rate is high!
good,"The job is stressful and frustrating at times. Management provides contradictory rules based on metrics they feel needs to be met. the biggest thing is to basically forget any thing outside of your job, no flexibility for time off, and unless your supervisor is willing to work with you, most requests will be rejected."
good,Leadership is male dominated.  Don't expect to have any opportunity to move up even if your stats are better than males around you. Healthcare benefits are not what they tell you. Worked there a little over a year and was like that the whole time. Left May 2019
good,"high volume calls, fast pace, must be able to think on your feet and remember common issues and problems with lines and billing issues. this can be competitive"
good,Bad management and goals too high when everyone is cutting off cable. They don’t want to pay commission that’s why goals are extremely high. I don’t recommend working here.
good,Spectrum just put you where they need you.. They do not help you out with your scheduling unless you are management... They really show favoritism to certain employees... only good thing is pay plus commissions and comp services...
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Non stop calls from the minute you logon till you logoff.  Always being pushed to upsell mobile on every call even if customer cannot afford or does not qualify
good,"Great benefits, amazing perks,  not valued employee.   Consistently being told you need improvement,  never told what a good job you are doing.   Everyone.  Poor management, people leaving all the time,"
good,With better supervisors and time to exhale after a stressful call it would be a better place to work. Better pay for the awful shifts. Better incentives.
good,"The overall workplace is great the guys you work with as well as direct Supervisors are for the most part great people.  Upper-Management needs an overhaul, there is NO communication between departments which leads to resentment towards one another on the front lines.  The hours could be a little more flexible, especially for people with a family and young kids.  The benefits as far as health and services is awesome, just wish the company cared more for their ""front-line"" employees a little more."
good,Hard work is not appreciated here. Raises aren't the best. I like that they don't micro manage here. As long as your work is done you'll do great here.
good,I went to work strictly for the money. The job is stressful and makes you question your own integrity with the way they have you manipulate customers and pass the buck.
good,"Worst place to work for if you have adult bills, over worked, management only care about their bonuses, HR contact is to friendly with the upper management, HR is suppose to help you not conspire with management to keep people from progressing"
good,This job has the worst managers of all company. They are not for the staff workers at all. They only care about themselves. The turnover rate is high in this company.
good,"its a very stressful call center to work for. good pay and bennies, but bad mngrs. i chose to leave due to work place environment. supervisors are never at their desk. always outside smoking."
good,"they push you to your limits and sometimes you feel like you will lose your mind, but if your money hungry then this job is for you. the work experience here is very stressful."
good,"Took inbound calls for customer service, billing, and sales. Some overtime allowed, some early outs allowed. Good 401k and benefits, high turnover for the average person."
good,No comment. Job is ok at best.good employees to work with.Most of the time it is avaerage. Good job if you need one.Got some experience in the cable industry.
good,I have worked at Spectrum since it was Time Warner Cable. Some of the issues they are facing now deal with equipment being sent to customers that doesn't work. The uppermanagent in my department is blind and we are all just trying to not be last on reports. The agents are only required to pass an on boarding assessment with a 30% so the bar is not high on who gets hired either.
good,"The main reason for leaving Spectrum was that advancement opportunities were given to less qualified coworkers because they were friends of the management, It wasn't about who was best suited for the job and more about who you knew."
good,"management kept adding chores to the already stressful hour long time period for each customer. management out of touch with reality.  very physical job, good for younger people ."
good,My work day focuses on the whole center to assist agents do the best they can do while on their calls. Give input into management to be sure the work day is going smoothly. Provide training and coaching to agents to use their strengths to focus on areas where improvement is needed. The hardest part of the job is getting to know 600 different personalities and to use that to learn how to talk to agents.
good,"Liaised with customers to identify root-cause and resolve telecommunication issues. Facilitated the installation and maintenance of cable, phone, and internet services across a diverse customer portfolio"
good,work hard and you will get paid but goals are difficult to reach. Not alot of room and advancedment.  Sales is above everything.  no loyalty to employees.
good,Professional individuals who work together to ensure quality solutions are produced.  Business sponsors and leadership worked with the team to provide high quality product.  Working with these individuals was the best part of my time at the company.
good,"Spectrum is a great motivator for getting the community involved to support various local charities and organizations. Though Spectrum continues through its merger process, it still finds time to support the community."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Worked for this company when it was Brighthouse. This company has resurfaced since I worked there so I can't tell you anything about Spectrum. My assessment would not help anyone applying for Spectrum.
good,You hit a ceiling after some time and can no longer advance your carrier past that point. The buyout of TWC and BHN was hostile and they still give preferential treatment to Legacy Charter employees for positions even if they are much less qualified for the position itself.
good,"Time Warner Cable was a good company to work for but, since being bought out by Charter, upper level management has lost sight of what is important.  Neither customer satisfaction nor employee moral seems to be particularly important to those in charge.  Hours are long and they make it hard to do right by the customer.  Systems are regularly implemented that have ""known issues"".  Often it's like watching a train wreck--you see it coming from a mile away but you are powerless to stop it.  On the plus side the benefits are good, the abundant overtime pay is nice, and the work is challenging."
good,Things changed for the worst when Spectrum took over Time Warner. They lost site of customer service and only focused on the business. I enjoyed my job and co workers but some of the management lost site of customer service
good,It is a relaxed fun environment mid-pace working area..once you know what to do your weeks go pretty fast..the pay is no good though for the exp..u may have
good,"This employer is nothing but stress to work for. Some people love the free cable, and are brainwashed into thinking they don't have many other options."
good,"Spectrum is an okay job, most people don't last more than a year because of how stressful it is to deal with the performance expectations and interactions with customers."
good,"I left a job to go work at Spectrum because of the pay and benefits were substantially greater. During training, we were told that we would have a supportive environment. I did not feel this way. I felt like the moment we went on the phones to deal with angry people, we were thrown to the wolves. I am very good at dealing with stress but this job pushed me to my limits. If you needed help on a call, you would sometimes be waiting to hear from upper management for 10-20 minutes, if not more. I can understand that we're high volume but when a customer is yelling at you, cursing and things, it gets old."
good,Good products & pricing.  Management often confused about direction and poor communication is every day occurrence.  Management and worker objectives are rarely aligned.
good,"Gives opportunities to learn new technologies but makes it tough to stay busy.  Also does not provide training.  Management can be micro-managers, but I suppose it depends on what department you work in.  My department was micro-managed."
good,You really have to have a thick skin to work here need to relax the day policy on customer who disrespect and degrade you should protect the employee instead of punishing them for not allowing someone to curse them out or call them names
good,The company used to be a great place to work as Time Warner. Spectrum's management style is keeping everyone under their thumb. There is is no thinking outside the box. It is their way or no way.
good,The management was bad. Got stuck at work almost every day. Only good part was the consumers. They will always make your day better. You always work in a home setting.
good,Use to have advancements and other perks that no longer exist. Little growth and company keeps changing positions on thinking. Spectrum keeps going around in circles and takes forever for any type of change. Hires people with no computer experience and hires people I wouldn't even trust to work at subway.
good,the shifts offered here do not leave a lot of time to have a family life. the pay is decent but for the multiple job role that must be preformed it is under what we should be paid. i enjoy my work just not the nonsense that comes from above
good,A company that only cares about there numbers not there customers or employees. The representatives are over worked and under paid. The management is not there for you when you need them.
good,The company was good to work for if you did not have a family or much of a social life. I worked there 2 years during second shift and weekends without much of an option to change my schedule.
good,I feel management within the company should be based on what enhancements you can bring to the company. You have to be able to manage all personalities no matter what.
good,New managers prefer to micromanage vs leading and too often ignore the warning signs of bad leadership.  It is also a company where everyone seems more focused on pointing fingers vs actually working as a team and seeking to solve problems.  The hardest part of the day is ensuring you are absolutely perfect and saving all emails to ensure you can weaponize them.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"A typical day at work was full of meetings and not enough time to coach and develop employees. To be a great manager you had to make that time! "
good,I learned the East Coast Vs. West Coast Management is very frail and needs to be built up upon relationships both in and out of Spectrum for our business Clients.
good,"Average day.  You get work orders around 5:30 am. You cannot clock in until 8:00 am and at that time you have to be at the customer's home.  Which means you may have to leave at 7:30 and drive there without getting paid for the trip. At the job site, you are required to run multiple tests with a meter even if you are swapping a remote.  The tests could take up to 10-30 mins depending on the issues the meter detects and how long it takes you to fix them. Fix the issues, change out all wire connection in House Box, then you are ready to work on the issue that you are there for. Close out WO check your next Job. Another 25-30min ride to your 9-10 job so you will be about 30mins late.  Get to the 9/10 job and you have a 10/11 and 11/12 job waiting, all of which you will be late for. Possibly no lunch depending on what time you finish your morning route.  On to your 1/2, 2/3,3/4,5/6 and 6/7, I almost forgot the double time frame jobs like two 10/11s.  Average drive time of about 25mins to each one.  Routing cant or will not move jobs even if you are hours behind. Your manager may be able to help but don't count on it.  Upper management is at home. All your jobs will receive a call about your work like if you were on time and did you cover everything, the results are kept and go towards your Csat metric along with your rework( did someone have to go back to that job}, on time arrival and productivity.  After 90 days you may get a bonus if your Metrics are good. IF THEY ARE NOT, you can be assured that your manager will remind you daily. Any complaints about the long rides hurting"
good,"Charter Communications bought Time Warner Cable and became Spectrum, but even now it seems like they are two companies fighting each other. Too many things are implemented before their feasibility is really thought out and there are too many departmental turf wars instead of cohesion and cooperation."
good,"Spectrum went from two middle size organizations to a huge organization with the merger of Charter and TWC. The organization isn't bad overall, though it's too big for it's own decision-making capabilities sometimes."
good,"Typical day consists of taking inbound calls: troubleshooting, networking, and discerning bills to customers. "
good,Benefits are good but the job culture is antiquated.  No work from home options and a strict dress code policy are very out of date.  Leadership is very top heavy and there are not a lot of ways for employees to make a difference.
good,"Productive company, with good benefits. Fast pace and stressful and very competitive. Offers good benefits, provide vehicle and tools . Allow Tech to take home vehicle and start from home in the mornings."
good,"Spectrums office, cubicle arrangements are very much different then Time Warner. Very low cubes, extremely loud work environment w/75 people within direct line of sight. Very challenging to perform day to day job functions."
good,"dont like it. have no life with this job. Not bad money, but if you want to growth you have to go further."
good,"Job duties required to be on time at 3:00 am daily to route out all work in North, South, & Central Texas. 11 hour days, 10 hour shift. Morning is busiest, 3a - 9a"
good,A lot of the management at Spectrum have gotten there just because they've been around a while. There are times where they have no idea what they are talking about
good,I have been with the company 15+ years and when it was Time Warner it was amazing. Since we have switched over to Spectrum it has gone down hill. You no longer are a person you are now just a number
good,"The company was okay to work for but I didn't like all their strict attendance rules. I had a coworker that was pregnant and had to go to the doctor. Well, she brought her excuse because it was an emergency and she still got written up. There should be a better way of handling these attendance issues."
good,"You get the right supervisor.  I got sick, used my company insurance to try figuring out why I'm getting so sick, that required me to take time off and while I was still trying, working hard, throwing up between calls, and on pain medication I shouldn't be driving on much less talking to people, and I get terminated, stripped of all benefits.  The average day isn't horrible, customers like to yell and cuss at you if they don't get what they want and most leads and supervisors will back the employee in a situation with a customer but overall if you need help with something you're better off asking someone next to you because it can be 10-15 minutes before anyone answers the help chat they have set up."
good,"Stay away from this company if you value your sanity.  Very poor management and CEO.  The CEO has been named the highest paid CEO in the country, running one of the top 10 worst places to work.  Let that sink in."
good,"I had a great manager it was the other hire ups that made the job suck.  Also, they continually changed out commission plan so every time we started to make great money they would change it to make sure we could not obtain our goals."
good,"I enjoyed working at Spectrum, but the management was not great. It was hard to get into contact with one when needed. the lack of communication was awful."
good,Very great job just was not very understanding when I had family matters to address. overall good pay. some cons would be the prices keep raising and employees seem to be making less and less.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,it was an ok job. Everyday something was changing and most of management sucked. Plenty of work life balance though. Free cable and internet and discount on pin
good,"Due to the constant change in company direction, working for Charter is unpredictable.  The benefits are great and there are some shifts that are perfect."
good,"This was probably one of the worst places I've worked. This was during the time when it was TWC and we had no idea of we were going to be Comcast or Charter. The call center manager was annoying and a terror and it made it so nobody was ever really happy. People were always upset because service didn't work or the bill was too high. People would call and ask for help to set up TVs or other appliances when we were just the cable company. Most newbies at that time worked until close and you were only able to bid on different shifts quarterly. Seniority played a huge factor is whag shifts you would get. You would work holidays and would bid to either work or not work them, once again seniority played a role. You also had to upsell and there were certainly monthly goals you had to meet. If you met them you would get a bonus. You certainly didn't get paid for all you had to do or put up with. The only positives were the free services (cable, Internet, phone and Intelligent home), you got all the premium channels free and there were always food days with good food."
good,"Daily life at the job was always changing on the hour.  Many supervisors providing instruction but not stating the same thing.  Time management for employees when needing time off or scheduling vacation days was very difficult, constantly working on a skeleton crew.  Difficult getting the shift you wanted to work.  New hires were getting the requested shifts and also was difficult to get promoted due to department needing people.  "
good,Low team morale.  Low pay.  Small chance of advancement.  Easy to get stuck in a position if you do it long enough.  Pay amongst peers with same position can vary.
good,"- The pay is good, but if you are contractor, expect to work over time on a daily basis. Also be ready to work on Saturdays and some Sundays. "
good,"At Charter (or Spectrum), there is limited opportunity for advancement and salaries aren't appropriate for the area corporate is headquartered. Should be higher."
good,"Good benefits and nice people"
good,this job is very demanding with a lot of stress. the company does offer a chance to advance if you are willing to relocate your family to a new area in a larger city.
good,Pretty good benefits . free cable and internet hsa and hra . has company kitchen in break room. Tuition reimbursement. 401 k with matching.nice people to work with
good,"working in San Diego California Spectrum office was one of the best times of my life everyday was interesting exciting busy but kept you on your toes never a dull moment .o when  your doing an amazing job management notices promotions will be given raises and if needed employee transfers will be done highly compensated for transfers .but like everything else all era's will not be the same "
good,"Most people don’t last a year, me ok the other hand I hung in there for roughly three. All I have to say is, if you want to lose who you are and never see your family and have a tremendous anxiety life change then I would recommend this job for you; other than that, never in a million years again. Money is not better than happiness."
good,"Timewarner Cable was a great company, but once the company got bought out by Charter and changed to Spectrum it is a different company. There is not a lot of room for growth within the company and they have very high turnover rates."
good,"Ever since time Warner merge things have gone downhill. no more flexible schedule, no work/life balance, micro managed, pay isn't what it used to be. overall things have went downhill"
good,"Training program for CS was unstructured. Even some of the information was inaccurate. Company is NOT ADA friendly. If you are lucky to talk to an HR rep, they will do everything they can to keep from making accommodations. Forget unscheduled time off. You better have a note from your mother. Once on the floor your backend support disappears. Leads and mentors conveniently disappear when things get busy. Metrics are unattainable. One error over the course of a call blows your numbers."
good,The job was very relaxed overall. The supervisors don't really know what they are doing because rules and business operations change constantly. Definitely worth it if you are willing to bite your tongue when it comes to customers. Clock in get your money and clock out.
good,"a typical day at work is seeing if you have any work for the day. In the Maint. Dept. you have to fix what a house tech thinks whats wrong. Sometimes it could be that the problem is outside and its an AMP that needs to be fixed or a line is damaged. But sometimes you  have House techs that find the problem in the house."
good,"Since Spectrum took over for Time Warner Cable it is more stressful, many incentives are gone .Our health care coverage is substandard under Charter Communications and we are numbers rather than people."
good,Work goals and time frames are about an impossible task to make. Cannot complete trouble calls in the time allotted for the job when there is too many issues at a time to correct.
good,"Half of us never made the commission. The territory was being reworked over and over and no one was making sales. When I got into a car wreck they told me to rent a car and keep working anyway, however they didn't pay enough to cover the cost of the rental car."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,At one time this was a great place to work. But every year pay was always cut. a raise never came. even after 9 years. I have not been there for 8 years. It may have gotten better
good,Needs better training classes and better work advancement positions. It also needs better pay for all positions at the company and more hands on management.
good,The pay was just very small for the workload expected and the ability to advance was slow at best and not necessarily based on merit. Every year or two a new company takes over and you get demoted.
good,"If you have money over everything personality, competitive, all about me and over building relationships then  sales is for you. You can be flexible with your personality, become another person over the phone... Ultimately what you do to make the sale is all that matters. Great company overall but there needs to be an overhaul demand  for honesty, integrity, professionalism and  knowledgeable supervisors."
good,"No review at this time.  Good Products, positive culture, Nice software with 3rd party relationships that were helpful.  Job responsibilities were too heavy for one person to handle."
good,spectrum is strictly business and not family oriented. its very unfortunate that they have such a high turn over. there has to be a better way for this company to handle their employees with dignity.
good,A great job if you like working on your own with little to no supervision. Unfortunately the lowest pay with in its industry. The basic low level management are too busy brown nosing to really care about their people.
good,"Spectrum is trying to bring small town idea's Ft Worth, to the big city North Texas, its not working the area is way to massive to be handle the same."
good,"Typical day last about 10 hours. Management was great, the best part of the job is not being micro managed. Hardest part of the job was very hard for career advancement."
good,Time warner use to have opportunity for advancing your career and making BIG BUCKS. Sadly that all changed under spectrum. If u are good at sales y can walk away with like 40k!
good,Very high stress. I personally feel that the pay is not high enough for what is expected of you. You get angry calls all day long and can not stick up for yourself.
good,They don't do anything to industry standards and insist on repairing and reusing old antiquated equipment and tools. Poor training and high employee turnover mean if you are a skilled technician you will constantly be repairing others mistakes. The management will listen to your complaints but will never send them up the chain. So you are pretty much ignored until your metrics come out at the end of the month. Then no matter how good you do it was not good enough. There is no such thing as a perfect score here. The raises were also terrible. I once got 5 cents after having a near perfect scorecard. The hardest part of the job is just realizing you work for them and need to return to work. The best part was when I worked the night shift. No one ever bothered you. Overall 8 years of my life wasted.
good,"The employees are great to work with but the moving up on the ""Scale"" is hard. The employees are great but the managers are hard to deal with in a manager aspect"
good,Had a great time learning the streets of my home county and surrounding area; great place to work as a part time employee  Would do it again if needed
good,i was laid off twice after being assured my job was safe. The second time had no advanced notice at all and had to leave within the hour. I do not feel it was done professionally.
good,It was Charter Communication when I worked their. Very organized but had no concern for their employees but the employees made sure they have fun. Very corporate
good,"A typical work day consist of a lot of emails for status of pending projects. The duties are the same every day so once you've mastered it, it becomes routine. This place is about who you know. The hardest part is that you are expected to deliver without any direction or proper training. I enjoy the people that I work with, peers are friendly and helpful."
good,Charter's purchase of TWC and BHN was not well done.  The merger is a mess and they don't know how to manage a big company.  They are still managing day to day as if it is a small mom and pop shop.  They can't plan for anything and it still feels like they are ready to sell the company again.
good,"Residential Field technician. "
good,"A typical day at work is reporting to the office to retrieve leads to work, then head to customers residents to try to convince them to change or purchase cable in their home."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I am not a fan of this company. For one reason, pay was not high enough to continuously day in and day out on the majority of customer calls being harassed and screamed at due to internet connectivity issues which on more than half of the occasions the customers fault due to the lack of knowledge of the equipment they used for internet services, including their own personal computers."
good,"I've been with the company for a long time and since the switch to Spectrum the changes the company has made is making many things significantly better for the customer, but much worse for the employee. When I started, the company was a huge improvement from my days in retail, but has been stripped of what made it better and now is only marginally better than retail.Considering most of our locations are routinely understaffed and the customer base is often extremely angry, the pay is usually not commensurate with the level of work done."
good,"The new culture overrides business needs. All VPs , directors and many mangers expected to move to Denver or Stamford. Culture is archaic 1980's. CEO and executives are heavy handed. Not employee friendly."
good,"Many positions at Charter Communications. Every department is different & every supervisor treats you different probably like at most typical call center jobs. When you're a telephone rep, trapped at your phone all day long, call after call, customers are usually upset with their service or experience they've had dealing with this company. I dealt with residential and business customers. You can only take so much for some long, people call in fussing & complaining so you have to hear this on a daily basis along with worrying about your call stats such as time availability on the phone, call after time, hold time, & making sure you do everything right on that call to get the callers resolution is solved so they won't call back & if they do you're hit for that. It's a lot to deal with, I was very much stressed out everyday. They make you stay in one position for at least a year, I'll put it this way its not for everybody & when you've dedicated so much time to the company they don't really appreciate that."
good,"it was a okay job worked in the Coppell location, the company laid off a lot of people while I was there and would not hire me on permanently even after a year of employment."
good,"Starting out as a field technician is enjoyable when allowed to perform the work without ""red tape"" and agendas getting in the way.  Advancement is quick.  Due to hours and a lack of focus on employees, having time for life outside of work is difficult at best. Management is rarely unified in their directives.  It's a good place to start if you can deal with the hectic and corporate nature of the job. It offers a technical skill that can be used anywhere."
good,Spectrum is going through some changes right now. I just found out my job is moving to another state. Along with other jobs. If you are interested in this company I would wait until after the summer for things to come down. I am sure by that time they should have more of a idea what they want to do. Good Luck!!!
good,I appreciated the time with spectrum but I look forward to moving forward and a career change. I don't think its nice to bad mouth nor is it necessary
good,Was hired by Brighthouse Communications.  Company merged with Charter in Nov of 2016.  The company is going through some changes.  It remains to been seen if the transition will be successful.
good,"The company is a good company to work for, they have great benefits and opportunities.  However, they believe in a work atmosphere that is decades old, compensate on the lower end of the payscale, and generally make decisions that baffle the most experienced and intelligent employee."
good,"most of mgt is not competent in the field they are given to manage and detached from the people doing the customer facing jobs"
good,"Management was unrealistic about their goals. Some of them didn't know what they were doing while others were great. It is a highly stressful environment and very strict standards of business. It was worth the money for a while but then as time went on, it wasn't. There's a reason why most people have a time limit on how long they can stand this company. It's hard work."
good,"Direct Telecommunications Sales, contacting businesses regarding their telecom needs.  Primary focus on strategic fiber internet, Ethernet and cloud products."
good,Time Warner Cable was bought out by Charter Communications.  They are shifting over to new brand name Spectrum for all customer facing employees.
good,"Very hostile work environment, no good compensation for all the hard work required. Needs to structure better and take better care of workers, Better more streamlined system."
good,good company with potential to be great if local management would adhere to policies and enforce them across the board instead of picking and choosing when to.
good,"Constantly hounded, belittled and told you are not good enough.  And that's from management.  Besides getting doors slammed in your face and being sworn at, yelled at by potential customers, you have to look forward to daily required phone calls where the management tells you how horrible a job you are doing....."
good,a lot of changes over the years for the worse. They went from being a favorable company to work for with job growth to a company with many restrictions and a job culture that makes you want to run for the hill.s
good,This Company is all about numbers and meeting metrics. The sense of customer care is lost in trying to meet call center goals and meeting more of the needs of the corporation.
good,"I have worked for this company for eight years in three different cities. Overall, the company has been pretty good to me - decent benefits, good working conditions, and lots of great friends."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"A lot of good talent, would like to have seen career pathing more from this company. Work life balance could be better, the company is under new management which seems to be a step in the right direction."
good,"I enjoy partnering with business owners to grow their business.  Most of my current dealers are prepaid mobile phone dealers. I’m very familiar with mobile phone independent dealers and their front line sales teams. My number one goal is to drive sales and increase market share.  I work closely with business owners to show them the value of my company’s products, financial gain and the support I offer to help them be profitable. I focus on the front line sales team as well. I find out what is their hot button to sell. I want them to reach their financial goals and show them how selling our services they can reach that goal. I give them my direct number to call me at any time to help them sell. "
good,"No consistency. Huge turnover.  Management has varied definitions of integrity, policies are not clear across the board and that made it difficult to thrive as a company."
good,"Manage a team of 275 field technicians in Southern Manhattan to ensure excellent delivery of internet, phone and video service to more than 400,000 customers while maintaining low rework%, high customer satisfaction and on time arrival to appointments."
good,"Threats about your job. No family values. Great company before, definantly not now! No room if you have children and something happens where you have to leave work or miss work due to illness or whatever. WRITE-UP if you do automatically"
good,On call rules are equal to slavery. Job security non-existent. Management unfairly gains off the backs of the grunts. Good benefits though.
good,"I worked there for like 2 months and it was easy,but they talked about lay offs the pay is only 7.75/hr not enough for someone with kids,but perfect for someone out of high school."
good,"This company branch in Akron Ohio in the sales department are really nice at first . If your a good salesmen they will let you in the door and sell for them and of course numbers are everything . A few things I did notice quite odd and law breaking about them, one they micro manage to a sick point. As in they only give you a phone to use which is tracked along with the iPad you use to sell which all your data and customer contacts, networking partners , even passwords are maintained. So when you decide to leave they have all the business you worked hard to achieve like referrals and good areas to sell in . Along with them controlling your paperwork , they also will tell you whatever they can to get you to sell for them . They promise business cards , which they won't give right off the bat or even at all -  they promise proper gear to go in the field with - which took serveral months to even get a second shirt in hot weather or a coat in cold weather . I was brought in on the assumption if I hit my quota then the job would be good and I would be in a good spot . Instead , in the end I learned all they wanted was people to go out door to door in a way that they don't explain to you at the start of the job - even in pouring rain they expected this because the managers didn't care - and they wanted the ADVERTISEMENT - your not a salesmen in outside sales department - your a canvasser ! They just want you to go post their flimsy ad brochures with the company phone number on it on every door you can get to . Also , if you do put them as a past job experience on your résumé, and whatever"
good,"Work environment can be fun, basically what you make it. My co workers are awesome. The managers are very nice and for the most part, there when you need them. If they're not, probably due to their hands are tied. I don't to much about this region for I am not that long ago transferred here from New York. Just under 2 years"
good,"A typical day at work begins with a morning conference call."
good,"Taking 30 calls a day,  no matter what call you get, management expects it to be a sales call.  If you get a dropped call, mis-routed call, non serviceable call, it is held against your commission numbers. You get free cable, phone and internet for working there. Health benefits are good."
good,"Time warner was a great place to work, but was very understaffed in my dept and it made the job very stressful. this is all I can say about the company,"
good,"As a Recruiter for the Talent Acquisition & Movement Department is responsible for full life-cycle recruiting in a fast-paced and dynamic environment.  "
good,"Very unorganized not very structured, alot of complaints with services from customers that seem to be never resolved, it wasn't a good working exp"
good,"I worked as a inbound sales rep and initially it seemed promising. It was basically a ""learn as you go"" situation because the training was always behind on what we actually needed to know. Honestly I think the trainer couldn't have cared less. This is a high stress environment. I repeat; High Stress Environment! Although you do not work on commission alone, you will work for every dime you make and if you do not management will be breathing down your back to ensure youm do, or you are going to be on the fast track out the door. There is NO job security. Oh and please do not have an emergency or dare need a last minute day off, accomodations are few and very far inbetween."
good,"Advanced trouble shooting, installs, disconnects. Also worked as a tech Ops field Supervisor for 7yrs. Suoervised a team of 18 technicians,"
good,The company has no consideration when it comes to switching your hours based off of their demands and interest and not the employees
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I worked as a Video Repair Representative (Customer Service on phone) at Charter Communication, to help the customer to solve the video cable problem over the phone."
good,"The internal customers or co=workers are great to work with. diverse customer base, and the company has a great business model."
good,"I entered the office for a hour to do paperwork, then I would go and sell new accounts until 3 p.m.  After 5 p.m. I would go close any sales I started earlier in the day.  I learned to correct other Company problems with customers."
good,"Answer inbound calls to help customer with technical issues. Take payment, setup technician appointments and sale products and services to customer whenever possible. Meet and exceed daily/weekly/monthly performance metrics."
good,it was a productive work place safety is definitely a must good team work and love to get alone with coworkers the work wasnt hard at all u just had to make sure safety was number one priority and just get the work done
good,"open a cash drawer, assist customer, and Sale! Sales is a priority. the is a lot of pressure on sales. they rather you make an error on a account instead of making your sales goal. Even compliments from a customer at times were over looked."
good,The schedule was terrible and very hard to change. Job very stressful but there is an opportunity to make a lot of money if you focus on making sales. The job advancement was a joke.
good,"Worked as an outside sales rep for almost 2 years and loved it until new supervisor came in and destroyed team moral.  Upper management could have cared less as long as you worked 6 days a week and got new customers.  Had conference calls in the morning afternoon and again at 9:00 pm every night.  Then also again on Saturdays. No work life balance.  As an outside sales rep you kind of have control over your schedule, not true with Charter.  You basically worked 10-9 Monday through Friday and 10-4 on Saturdays."
good,The company is very good with small to mid sized customers. Build out of fiber was sometimes a problem and required customers to wait up to a year for installs.
good,"8-5 Mon- Fri"
good,"Poor middle management, out of tune with the various markets served, training leaves a lot to be desired, too many departments depend on other departments before the job can be done."
good,"the benefits are great and that is the only thing that keeps people there. The pay is okay. I've been with the company for over a year and not even doing the job I was hired on to do and got a terrible raise. No one is on the same page, ever. If you're not a ""favorite"" you will always be in the wrong. No matter how right you are"
good,"I was expecting more out of such a huge company. I don't enjoy being a part of a company that doesn't exceed in offering a great line of service or customer experience. Management very unorganized in the department i work in. Retention department makes it very hard to move up in the company to other departments that may be a better suit for my skills. Great benefits, but i'm looking for more to better demonstrate my skills with a reputable company."
good,Time Warner Cable has great benefits and a lot job advancing opportunities. co-workers are helpful. Can be a stressful environment at times or can be very laid back. If you are not a muliti-tasked person this job will teach how to be. LITERALLY.
good,"Engineering departments don't promote healthy work/life balance.  People stay because they fear something new.  There are positives, great industry and you will learn a lot if you work hard."
good,"Overall, It was a great experience to work there. A typical day would consist of helping customer's concerns on a daily basis. My co-workers were the best to work along side with. The most difficult part of my job was to manage some of the concerns of customers at times. The most enjoyable part of my job was working alongside wonderful people and resolving customer concerns."
good,"Worked there for 10 years and moved around to different positions like from tech to call center and to retail store. I always tried to move up, Ive gotten tons of experience with customer service and sales. Everytime i tried to move up and advance my career I would get denied saying I didn't have enough experience, then for one of the positions i got denied for, I get a email saying they would like my input for that certain position so they know what qualifications they should use to hire people for that position. If i don't qualify or have enough experience then why ask for my opinion 2 weeks later after you denied me. I tried for supervisor and they rather would pay someone else thats bi-lingual and not as experienced than pay me who has tons of experience and can't speak spanish. Management there is only about their own back and if it concerns the bottom line then they do something but when they push excessive overtime on you and sales goals that are way out of the park to get to then its bad. I could have been one of the best managers there if they would have given me the chance to be and make good changes, but when I brought up stuff that needed to be changed and the ways things should be done I got the finger basically and then they found some lame problem to fire me and get rid of me. The pay is good but if you want to feel stressed a lot and feel like a 2nd class citizen while at work then this isn't the place to be."
good,"Time Warner Cable is very linient with goals and attendance. However, if you do not exceed and fight off the other sale people from stealing your deals, you will starve."
good,Opportunity to tailor programs to meet local employee and customer needs.
good,"on a typical work day you start by being at you first job at 8am, you drive a company vehicle straight from home. its always pretty much an easy day, but you get that once a week hard day. you go to about 5 to 6 houses a day, most people are really nice but you can also those rude people."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Good income and benefits are the pros as well as some freedom."
good,"Out for the buck!  Not a very cultured company.  Training is good, you are taught the job.  You will know exactly what to do after training is completed.  Cold environment, all about $."
good,Being an hourly employee is what you should do. I'll save you an essay and just tell you not to waste your time.
good,"a typical day at work includes starting your day logging into your tablet (unpaid) to find out where your first job of the day is. then driving the company vehicle (unpaid) to your first job of the day. clocking in to work at your first job. Typical job techs assignments for techs can be one job per hour in 8 hour or 10 hour shifts. technicians get a 1 hour lunch (if you can get one). "
good,"no good raises bad co-worker's but has good benefits and your on the internet all day. management is okay, the hardest part about the job is rude customer's getting cursed out everyday. perks of being here is having internet all day any website, benefits. and that really about it."
good,"Great benefits and  perks, however, the management needs much work and improvement from the bottom up. Work moral is discussed but not realistic. Sadly the perks out weigh the job it self. Mission statement is about the service. TWC falls short in service department all around for both customers and employees."
good,"Everything is on freeze until merger happens. They say BAU, but everyone is leaving and morale is looooow."
good,"co workers were great.  Very team oriented environment."
good,The company was not stable.  There were always cutbacks.  The coworkers were great.  Local management was always accessible.
good,Management feels 'You're only as good as your last 37 minute update in your sales tracker'. Especially since the pending merger with Comcast. Management is under pressure to show results. So its 3 strikes and your out.
good,"under trained and conditions were poor, unrecommendable,"
good,"Take a lot of calls, assist customers with technical,billing support."
good,"The health care benefits are probably the only thing that this company has going for it from an employee's perspective. The pay in nearly all positions below management is mediocre at best."
good,"I learned to mutli-task, loved working with my close co-workers, hardest part was dealing with upset customers and keeping my bearings."
good,Time Warner Cable's mismanagement caused more issues in my home life than I care to remember.  I was actually rushed to the hospital for having an anxiety attack from their call center being such a hostile work environment.  I took calls from unhappy customers whenever they dropped the NFL network or CBS because of contract disputes.  They illegally terminated my employment and tried to hold back any unemployment benefits that I paid into.  No joy in working there.
good,"Good place to work if management knew what they were doing. Everyday was an event.you were told one thing by one person and by the next day something else, employees were then blamed because upper management stuck together to cover themselves, but causing fraustrations and stress with the employees.mansgements  also pressure employee to sell their products.but the systems used  to enter the products barely worked, but guess who was to be blames....the csrs, sales was a joke, but it was the main part of your stats, but the system allowed other people to take your sales and again, the fault was blamed on the csr, lack of proper training, and supervisors, have a problem with conveniently forgetting important issues regarding  the employees they are suppose to be .guiding and improving to be the best.twc would be a wonderful place to work, if the ones at the top took their career seriously, and lead as they are supposed to, but every one have an agenda, their paychecks."
good,"I learned a lot about computer networking and troubleshooting internet, phone, and television issues.  Took inbound calls for the entire day to help customers with technical problems.  Favoritism is the perfect word I can use to describe the management.  I enjoyed some parts of the job, only the customers who were not upset with the service."
good,took inbound calls assisting customers with billing and technical support while assisting the sales team by upselling or doing add-on sales. most enjoyed part of job was making sure customer was fully taken care of by end of call. hardest part of job was 3rd shift hours.
good,My time with my last employer was good but not condusive with my home life.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I learned a lot of things here which help me become a better person because of the training we went though.
good,"Provides great products, has great repetition in the Orlando area. Although working for the organization lacked solid organization, direction, and consistency. Company policy was very informal and easy going which was a plus but work load was stressful, and had many ceilings in each department."
good,"Over-all, my co-workers were great to work with.  They made it fun to come in every day.  Downside, management would often show favoritism to certain workers and would not follow up on certain employee complaints.  Hours were long, could not change shifts unless a shift bid was put out."
good,"If company would evaluate their management in tow then it would be a better place to work for. No values, no morals, just the bottom dollar."
good,A typical day working as a Sales Representative involved  walking around best buy helping customers with both time warner cable and best buy questions.  The job was temporary and under different circumstances i feel the job could have been better. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and talking to new people though out the day. Some customers were less  enjoyable to talk to and others would make your day a lot easier.
good,"It was a great place to make quick money but it wasn't the place for me. My first red flag was the fact that they didn't do drug testing prior to employment. That right there alone was a sign that they have a high ""turn over"" rate. It bothers me to come in and have my supervisor tell me that if ""we don't get a sale by the end of the day her job is on the line and the agents as well"". That alone is too much pressure. Especially when you have people hanging up or getting upset when you call. This was a constant threat. I mean if you don't have bills or much responsibility I would encourage anyone to go for it!! The interview process was misleading, I was initially scheduled to work for a shift which I didn't request, and was told that I would make $9hr at training but it was actually $7.80. I accepted that, but after the constant screaming and yelling from the supervisors to ""GET THAT NEXT SALE"" (who provided little assistance to helping new agents learn the ropes) it was too much for me. If you have the energy and persistence go for it."
good,"Co-Workers were awesome. Working with customers was great! However, the higher ups were over worked and underpaid, and they made sure everyone knew. Every supervisor said something different, making it hard to know exactly what was expected of you. Supervisors arguing in front of everyone, yelling at agents across the floor, and disappearing when agents needed help with a customers question, leaving agents having to answer questions for other agents, and when the supervisors found out that was going on, we got in trouble for helping each other. It was the supervisors who made the typical work day seem like a bad day at high school all over again."
good,"o	Provided technical customer support "
good,I really dont know what to say. It is a call center. The people are friendly but the customers are not. Inbound calls. It takes someone who does not take things personally.
good,"Time Warner Cable has great benefits. As a service technician, your hours are not very stable which could affects home life at times."
good,"Answering customer phone calls doing every position billing, sales, troubleshooting"
good,Compensation is below average for what all you do and advancement is suspect. Management is questionable
good,"A typical day at work involved getting into work, going to the daily morning meeting, getting on your dialer, and making calls to current customers trying to upsell whatever you can to them.  "
good,terrible schedule after training benefits are really good that is the only reason people stay
good,"When i started from what i could tell they were very focused on technician benifits and care, now with changes in management it is no longer there. Yes they are a customer satisfaction company however how can you keep customers happy if the face of the company is not taken care of?"
good,"Outside sales rep with 20 apt communities. When you move in you were given a list of your services providers and I was on that list. You would call and set a time for us to meet. I would come out and ""sell"" you a service or services. After the sell I would connect your service."
good,"Typical day started eight, and visited anywhere from 8-10 homes a day. learned how to install and repair cable, internet, and phone services provided by Time Warner Cable. The physical grind was the hardest part, and meeting new and different people everyday."
good,Fun place to work when you have good coworkers.  Management was very disconnected and not very helpful.  Not a great place to work.
good,"To sell customers cable tv services, home phone service and internet. Good work enviornment , great people to work with . Hardest part of the job adjusting and meeting the scorecard system that produces your commision. Making your monthly sales not getting paid out on commision. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find their home entertainment needs. "
good,"very busy environment, enjoyed assisting customers, enjoyed providing customers with knowledge for internet, cable and telephone"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Nice Benefits, Good People to work with, Limited Growth Opportunities"
good,"Great company, with great benefits and values, however lacks in job security as well as consistent potential for growth."
good,"•Consistent sales over $7,000 in products and services per month."
good,Working for Time Warner Cable was enjoyable at first. The first 8 weeks of training was great. People come in and paint this great picture but its not what it seems. Once you hit the floor everything changes. Even working in customer service it is more sales driven than actually helping the customer. Direct supervisors can make up there own rules that do not apply to the whole center just your specific team. Even to the point where the supervisor can refer you for termination EVEN though its not a company wide rule. The benefits are probably the best thing. You cant beat the medical benefit and you get free cable and internet. I suggest not applying for a call center if you do apply. The turnover rate is extremely high. They are ALWAYS hiring.
good,"Time Warner Cable boasts of being a place where there will be ample opportunity for advancement, great values, and competitive pay. After working there I don't think that it lived up to the hype. If you come to the company as a customer service rep training is inadequate. In the Fair Lakes Call center they are giving partial 10 day trainings and then sending you on the phones. A typical word day would have you answering calls nonstop from the time you log in. Also the call volumes are soo high the customers and none too happy by the time they get a person on the phone."
good,"Charter is a nice place of employment for those not looking to advance in their carreers. You also have to be very flexible with your schedule, you could be on 2nd shift for 6mo and days the other 6mo so its not very family orientated"
good,"Charter provides excellent benefits and compensation. Unfortunately, constant restructuring and policy change makes it a difficult and trying place to work. While there is a lot of discussion on putting customers first, the discussion does not translate into action, and rarely is the customer experience satisfied. Frequent changes to pricing and structure make it difficult to develop a good relationship with customers."
good,they give you TC all day long one in seal beach the next in stanton its crazy the way they are wasting money and don't you dare complain you wont last long there they even threatened to fire anyone who spoke to union reps i was one of there better techs
good,"A typical day is very busy back to back phone calls about many different issues from services not working, to billing inquries. I've learned to be very paitient. Also, that people take their cable VERY serious. I've been called names and verbally abused at least twice a week. I felt that the pay should be more due to the position requiring so much. I loved my co-workers, very down to earth and a pleasure to work with daily. Management is so-so, when things were at a high volume there were very often clueless and just pushed the fact that we should take calls. They also could be a bit grumpy,other days when things were slow they were very laid back sometimes too laid back if you ask me. The industry is a changing one and there often were rule changes, rate changes, system changes, ect. which could get very confusing, and the staff wasn't properly notified. The attendance policy was tough and really not family friendly. Although, they would ""waive"" certain occurences depending on their personal opinions, one would still end up on a final and if they were late or called off within a 6 month period they would be fired. The most enjoyable part of the job besides the great people I met was the food and snacks they often provided. Overall, its a great job for someone with their own transportation and no children or medical issues."
good,Initially the job was exciting and fun but then the compensation was cut and moral went down. The most enjoyable part of the job was time in the office with co- workers they were a lively bunch.
good,At time warner i was an inbound call center for Advance Technical Support.
good,Document things if there is a problem. Alot of different resources to use to do your job. Keep up with all the changes.
good,Depressing work environment. Little lighting in call center. Stressful environment.
good,"Management, as I was part of it, is their biggest weak spot. We were the central part of all major services provided to this day, which I am highly proud of being apart of."
good,High Stress
good,"They have shift bid every 6 months, the commission is not as good as it used to be. I was in the sales epartment and this comapny was way better 5 years ago."
good,came in at 7am open up the department
good,"A typical day starts at 8am and could end as late as 9pm. My co- workers and I work very well together in helping the end user have the services they desire. The hardest part of my job is definitely the long hours, but it is doesn't compare to the joy I get from seeing those customers that were without cable, phone and internet service have them restored."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"inbound call center, on the phone all 8 hour shift, retain customers from canceling cable services."
good,"It was an inbound call center took calls all 8 hour shift, retain customers from canceling cable services"
good,"Made out bound calls to cancelled accounts. Learned how to sale and promote better products. Co-workers were fun. Hardest part, to sell a product the customer just cancelled. Enjoyable part was my co-workers"
good,Time warner cable is a great company. the only things is that management and supervisor change responsiblity everyday it hard to catch up if we still doing that or it changed..
good,"A typical day starts at 730am with a quick check of computer for list of jobs and area of deployment. A Comm Tech is assigned 8-10 jobs to complete. Teamwork is a necessity,which was the norm when some jobs take more time to complete. The Tech's were great at helping eachother out to ensure everyone makes it out the feild in a timely manner.The hardest part of the job was dealing with irriate customers. The easiest part of the job was fixing the problem ,as long as you apply the principles the solution will reveal its self. My experiance with Timewarner as far as management, they are helpful and knowledgable but set goals that are unrealistic. What I learned from Timewarner is I enjoy a job that constantly changes it keeps the job exciting."
good,"The people you work with are great, management is terrible, all they care about are the numbers if you don't make them they get rid of you, if they like you they will help. The turnover rate is about 35 - 39%"
good,The money is good but the culture is not. I felt that they sprang overtime on people and it had a negative effect on sales goals. The culture changed from a sales environment to customer service with less payout. Quite a disappointment.
good,"I started out as an direct door to door sales rep for 1yr, then transfered to call center as outbound sales rep for 1yr then inbound sales rep for 1yr. Then I was transfered to retention specialist for 4yrs.This is where I handle all customers who wanted to disconect their services. My job was to retain them and up sale products."
good,"I was told on my first day that ""I am not starting a job, I am starting a carer"" Well I quickly learned that is not the case. I was named employee of the mouth 5 times in my 3 years there and went for 4 different jobs and did not get a single one of them. Also the micro management is awful they count how many seconds it take you do close out a call. My job was Tech Support and I had a sales expectation to do."
good,"Training took 5 weeks of 8-5 and some very boring days. After training, I did not feel 100% prepared. I felt that the training, only prepared for the ""ideal"" situations. You do not know what hours you will work until you actually get done with training and jump right into work. They say ""You could get to work days between 8 and 5"", try 230pm to 1130 pm..."
good,treats employees poorly and pay is getting lower for new employees.management looks for a reason to write you up. The pay was decent at first but dropped lower and lower.
good,Oceanic Time Warner Cable was an amazing company family-friendly and alert to all the community. Once Spectrum bought out Oceanic everything went down hill.  Job security is NOT there.  Everyone is looking out for themselves.
good,it is a call center environment although they do strive not to make it feel like it. nice clean facility and equipment that works well. management tends to oversell how good call quality is because you do get quite a bit of trash calls. true they are still opportunities and need to be treated as such. pay is good if you are hitting numbers and depending on previous employment even if you are not. the benefits are good health care and 401k and other things like free service. overall cool place to work if you want the type of position better than most other call centers.
good,"You are expected to give 150 percent everyday. number dont give you any slack. youre working your butt off in all weather types and management wouldnt bat an eye if something happened to you, i worked there for 2 yars. ive seen about 40 techs come and go. turnover rate is sky high because workers are under paid and under appreciated"
good,Great management team with awesome pay structure. Ability to move up in and around the company.  Flexible hours and ability to work remote.  Great benefits and other perks
good,The training was great and so was my facilitator. The problem was the hours and management was horrible and made everything more difficult. The coaches are also fantastic. Working until midnight when you have to take the bus is impossible due to many buses not working after a certain time. IF YOU WANT A DAY SHIFT YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT unless you stay with the company for mire than a year and your metrics are at the top.
good,"Very stressful and short staffed, they have a good PTO if you can find someone to cover.  Lots over time. Clients and the job itself are very delightful and fun!  If you don't care about what other co-workers and mangers feel about you can last there along time.  Depending on the house you go to, some have been there for several years and act they are more entailed to things then others and the house manager will clearly stand up for them.  The director dies not like to hear about and will not fix the working environment."
good,"Depending on the field you desire to go into, will decide whether you are able to move up in the company. With recent changed and ideas the option for ""moving up"" has become little to none."
good,"Decent pay, pretty good benefits, free cable, internet, phone pkg, but can't always get hours or time off needed. They're generous with food compared to most. But changing management & scaling back on things, despite good sales & business year. Heavy on monitoring, coding, learning new systems. Periodic changes in pay/commissions, & bonuses (if any), & system to view stats in, & not always working/ able to see. (appears less generous than several years ago.) Can't always get requested time off, if near holiday, despite having earned PTO & giving several months notice. Tenure not always respected. Current push to sell Mobile products."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Everything is based off metrics. Good luck getting a new shift playing the shift lottery. Not very flexible if life happens. And be ready to be talked down to by customers and yelled at
good,Hours are crazy.. Pay is way too low. Too many people dating each otherl. Was like being in highschool! Only way more stressful.. Worked there left and came back.. Not a good choice..
good,"High management does not care about employees, only numbers. You feel used and abused at the end of the day. Benefits and pay are good. Hours are acceptable."
good,Focus on employee and customer experience. Drive results to deliver an exceptional customer experience. Analyze performance review and customer SLA make adjustments on workforce to address customer demands.
good,There arent enough Techs in the area and there is never enough equipment available for technicians to complete their jobs throughout the week. This is stressful because techs arent able to complete jobs in a timely fashion making them late to their remaining jobs for the day.
good,"Great pay, poor advancement, revolving door of talent, difficult product to sell, internal obstacles in the sales process - workplace culture is awful, constant reminder that you can be replaced"
good,This was a competitive and learn as you go environment. It required 60+ hours weekly and very little work-life balance. Compensation was worthwhile as TWC but became less lucrative under Spectrum.
good,"This job is too stressful and repetitive. All thecompany is concerned about is numbers and performance. Your well-being, they can care less. Long term advancement is near impossible unless you know someone."
good,The company is making an attempt to get into the digital world however the shift from distribution of content to being a content maker is going to make that difficult long term with customers shifting over to internet based content delivery.
good,"I hated this job, I worked at the organization when it was TWC, the commission was horrible, the goals they set were unattainable! The work environment was horrible. Everyone there seems to have some level of shadiness! They allowed a lot of unethical behavior based on commissions! I hated this job!"
good,"Spectrum is a changing company that has a good idea of where it's going but is not sure of how to get there.  The changes that are rolled out may make sense at the top level but there is a real disconnect of how the retail level operates on a daily basis, and the transitions are sometimes bumpy and awkward."
good,"If you want to wear a ton of hats for every role you will play while getting cussed out at least once a day, this is the job for you. The benefits and discounts were BEYOND phenomenal, but my personal opinion, not worth the stress."
good,"The great thing about Spectrum was they offered excellent products and benefits to employees. The sales expectations were ridiculous and working in the field knocking door to door was near impossible to for most people on my team to get sales. The turnover is high and the pay was low. Even if you made a sale, more often you would lose the commission because the techs didn't install or the customers would cancel. The company never honored existing customers complaints and they often lied about bill increases. The cable game is crazy!"
good,"It's a call center!? Lol!? Always changing, fast paced, information & updates slow to get to the floor.... Over promised & under delivered.... Limited growth opportunities..."
good,The company was a good place to work for with good benefits and culture. Everyone took pride in their contribution to the whole and felt like what they were doing mattered.
good,"Difficult work/life balance sometimes, opportunity to make competitive income. The ordering system can be challenging however if you can sell then a supervisor can help resolve issues with system issues."
good,"During my time here, I learned a great deal about how to sell to a complete stranger by building rapport and asking high value questions. When done right, the discovery portion of a sale can make or break a call. There is no shortage of opportunities to make money here. The days are long and arduous, especially during peak times of the year, such as back to school season, but the hard work does pay off. High levels of absenteeism require the agents who do show up, to work a lot of mandatory overtime. The worst part of working here is the hours. Starting out, shifts are based on how one does in training, although this does not always a reflection of one's skill. Some Tier 1 agents choose actually to work later shifts. If you work anything other than 1st shift, you will most likely work 2p-11p or 4p-1a, which is unfavorable for early risers like myself. Overall, I think the inside sales position at Spectrum is great if you want to make money, but if depending on the shift you work and if you're a morning person, it will not be a good fit."
good,"My experience with spectrum since took over feeling changes on all directions and also unstable. But after all good money getting a lot better."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Lack of process is the key thing. there is possibly of growth but the process is really not as efficient as it should be. a little needle in the right direction might help
good,No work life balance and your are forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day. you are not done when other techs are running behind. you are given more jobs than you can complete in 12  hours. 90% of the day you run behind and they wont move your jobs. miss your lunch break most often. crazy environment
good,The company offers a wide range of positions. The benefits are excellent and available at start date. Great local position for anyone who has family in the area.
good,Overall Spectrum is a good job to have its steady fast paced and keeps you busy. The companies ethics seem to be all about the money and not about the customer base anymore and its causing a lot of loss in their customer base.
good,"Spectrum needs work on the upper management side. The work can be challenging yet rewarding.  There is some room for movement up, but it is limited.   Really needs to look at the structure of how items are determined."
good,"I did 6 months at this soul crushing compound and don't regret leaving one bit. Training is accommodating and is paid but for 5 weeks worth of sitting in a classroom there's a lot they fail to educate you on. The job itself isn't very hard , simply answer technical support phone calls for internet and phone. The call queue gets old quick as you have less than a second between calls to prepare your tools for the next customer account which leaves literally no time to mentally prepare for the next angry customer( which is literally 90% of your calls). Getting yelled at over the phone by customers wouldn't be nearly as hard if the company didn't harass you into meeting their metrics by any means necessary. Regardless if your calls are positive and the customers expectations and needs are met you can still fail miserably as an employee through all the metrics and expectations placed upon you. Also as another reviewer mentioned if you miss a day and don't have the accrued hours to cover it on your paycheck(the company feels the only way you can miss is if there's a way to pay you otherwise you get written up) it can severely affect your time off hours for when they are actually needed.  I was lucky enough to have experienced ONE good Supervisor and Lead experience who let a lot of bullcrap slide and actually helped their team by any means necessary, but when my schedule changed I was thrown into another team who operated on a less supportive level with no regard for the customers you interact with and as another review mentioned they insult your intelligence even if its an issue"
good,"Its a good job, I enjoyed at times.  Have all respect for the company. There are wonderful people who workers the good environment.  There are some things they can improve!!"
good,"My manager was great very helpful, didn’t enjoy the job. Company is ok to work for. Didn’t like the in and out sales aspect of it."
good,"Good compensation if you can sell, if not then base pay is low. Little micromanagement but also low job security if not hitting quota. Management could do more to train and help their employees."
good,It is lead and has opportunities as if it was a startup.  It is very different from the rest of the company so I can not compare apples to apples.  Overall I do feel that I have had opportunity to learn but the company's work from home or flexibility in remote working is non existent.
good,"The job is not hard at all the only thing that really upsets me is that it can be very numbers driven. They trained me for internet and phone service when i first started, now I'm doing internet, phone, cable, streaming services, some sales and billing. if the amount of money they paid me reflected the many hats i now have to wear"
good,Very stressful at times must be able to handle stress well. Since charter took over not as many advancement opportunities a lot of departments have shut down
good,"Struggling for baby sitters or daycare and they really dont care they want you to put your family life on hold for them, you would think they would have there own built in daycare"
good,Good place to start your carer but depending on your department or location may need to move around to other departments to stay with the company. A lot of changes happen.
good,"I have been with Spectrum since it was Time Warner Cable. "
good,"Excellent company and pay structure. Tough job however if you work hard you will play hard. "
good,I didn't enjoy the east coast management.  Big culture shift.  Pay was very good.  Mgmt seemed to opt for people doing work instead of finding automation solutions.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Charter is a fast growing company in an ever-changing environment. One of the benefits of that is there are many open positions within the organization.
good,"Just save your self the stress the free cable is not worth it. ( they charge for extra boxes & equipment when spectrum took over)"
good,"Look not to bash them because if you need a job they'll hire you right away no problem. You'll get benefits, such as free cable and internet is but be sure you live in their footprint or else you're starting pay as a Tier 1 agent will make you run for the hills when you hear these customers give it to you."
good,"The company has great benefits but i do not think they set their employees up for success. the training was not very good, and they do not give their employees the tools they need to be successful. the billing department does so much work for the pay rate. they should really review that."
good,It's a job that gets the bills paid not so much as a self fufilling career more like a depressing abyss into a swirling spiral of of being berated by customers because of poor sales intergrety and imporperly closing deals with out customers understanding what they are committing to.
good,"Good place to learn about MSO and cable industry . Decent benefits , poor work life balance , leadership and management of teams and employees. Poor planning and project management on almost all projects."
good,"Spectrum (Charter) is not structured in the customers' best interest and does not operate as if the customer is their entire existence. Same seems to apply to their employees. Upper management is all about good numbers. Often times common sense and taking care of the customer is over-ruled by scores and percentages. There is no reward, only discouragement, to be had for actually caring for the customer. "
good,Horrible place to work. Not enough money for the stuff technicians have to put up with on a day to day bases. Nothing ever gets done about it either. Plan on being screwed over a lot working at this place
good,"The culture of Time Warner was good within the employees, however, management was disconnected with employees. Some supervisor/management does not recognize hard-working employees looks more for people without a voice for what is right. The company itself has very good benefits and perks for working there that I like a lot. The main downfall with working with Time Warner Cable is that at the time I worked there if you were not kissing up to a few main supervisors then your stay would not be long."
good,"Leaders do not develop and on-boarding new hires are not organized."
good,Spectrum is not a bad company. However do feel as if they don't value long term employees. Culture is quickly changing and there is no level of accountability.
good,spectrum was a fast pace and busy company that was great to work for while under time warner. benefits were high in costs advancement  was almost non existent due to management.Numbers set to meet were near impossible with changes brought on by spectrum.
good,My experience was an okay one. Management looked out for those they truly liked. Many of us worked without receiving internal raises that the Forman's gave to others.
good,"Be prepared to work in a fast paced environment. If you don't mind getting yelled at half of the time by their customer, they do compensate you well for it. This job isn't for the faint at heart, and you must have a very thick skin. The company has high expectations for their employees as you will be held to strict call guidelines like average handle time. You will also have metrics goal that you must obtain to keep in good graces with your supervisors.  The money is good, if you have a strong personality and don't give in easy to verbal abuse from the customers."
good,"Since Spectrum is the company created after the merger between Charter, Bright House Networks, and Time Warner Cable; it is too soon to rate the company fairly. There are so many internal structure changes that make employment uncertain at Spectrum. Once the company has done all their internal changes employment may be better. As of now their benefits are great."
good,"The moral working for the company has gone down, goals are no longer realistic, if you have a life outside of work this is not the place to work, If you want to have mandatory overtime every week then apply"
good,"When I started I was only doing Video repair , as the months progressed we started doing random training and schedule changes without advising us first. I had video repair , phone training , billing internet and retention under my belt with no extra pay"
good,They did not have the integrity and care for customers that Bright House did. Share holders and pinching pennies is their way. Sales reps would tell the customer anything to make a sale.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"There were very few opportunities to break into new departments, as they were frustratingly fond of hiring from outside the company. An inconsistent incentive/commission program that changed often."
good,"Phones always busy - did enjoy talking with customers "
good,"If you are not their circle you become If you are not their friend, or don't let them flirt with you or if you're not the ""yes/man"" they will treat you differently regardless of your performance.  Sadly, upper management and HR won't listen to representatives concerns."
good,The company is more reactive to most things. It's a day to day change. No one really know what is going on until it happen. The morale is very low. The workplace there is very stressful.
good,Working for spectrum there's no sense of community any longer. And the customers are 10 times more unhappy than they were some time ago. There doesn't seem to be any more incentive to be at work. It's a job that I don't enjoy coming everyday to work for anymore.
good,Taking care of the customer on a daily schedule.  Everyday is a learning expeirence rather from the customer or technical skill.  The hardest part of the job is the heat and different environments you may come across.   The most enjoyable part of my job is the feeling of accomplishment after every job.
good,"Many confident and strong sales people come in and fail at this job. Some people come in and succeed. This job is for the tough, who don't take things personal, are personable and know that nothing lasts forever."
good,"Spectrum Accountable Care Company provides the highest-quality healthcare professionals to mental health hospitals, Institutional healthcare organizations, and private facilities. Let the Spectrum ACC recruiting staff introduce you to these unique environments with interesting and diverse patient populations"
good,Very fast paced. Micro management was very big there. I loved my co workers. They were very strict on dress code. They were very strict with quality control.
good,One thing it may lack is training of the management to deal with specific cases. Like most of the large enterprise their is a lack of power from the local instances. But overall the employees were great and working hard.
good,"High Demands, Loads of Work, but typically the people that you have to work with are GREAT!.  In all seriousness... they worked us like dogs, but it was an amazing environment.  Make sure you are hourly, as opposed to salary :)"
good,"Report to work by 11am had a meeting with leader and all of the sales people, then went out to your territory to sell cable,internet and phone services. My direct manager was terrific until he transferred, then my next female manager was nice but did not do her job very well. Work place culture was decent but there was a lot of turnover. Hardest part of job was working till 9pm especially in the winter time, would have preferred starting earlier and finishing earlier so you wouldn't annoy people knocking on their doors so late at night. Working independently."
good,"Before I got promoted the worst thing about my job was the lack of challenge.   The work was easy and I was always 20 minutes from my home and only worked 2 days in a row.  it was extremely nice.   "
good,I don't have much to say about the company. They have changes just about every week and want us to be able to adapt to each change on a weekly basis or there is corrective action. I need a more steady job with job security. Great benefits.
good,Take as many calls as possible to maximize bucket. Great incentive for those who continue to meet and exceed monthly goals. Every year select sales reps go on a trip to a specified location courtesy of the company and you get to bring a friend.
good,it was a rough period to work there not there fault... its complicated. they were merging with charter from TWC so a lot of things changed the culture the pay and my wife and I bought our first home so we were not able to transfer so here I am. overall I don't mind all the various callcenter positions
good,"Charter/Spectrum is an alright place. Its a culture of micromanagement. You do get promotions and management values loyalty, but work life balance is not good."
good,Can get your money if u know how to sell and close deals.  Sales closers will do very well here.  Culture is lacking.  But if your numbers sre doing well you are left alone to do what you do.  Sell.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I have been in Director role for 13 years and the best part is engaging with my 5 manager sales tea and developing plans to help them achieve the company goals.
good,"The people that work here are great. However, because the company is a corporate, there is a lack of Aloha spirit.  The morale is low and many individuals call out sick."
good,"When I first joined, you could still sell to pretty much anyone, anywhere, anytime. Great salespeople stood out, as they developed their own strategies, methods, and areas of focus. But as the old saying goes, things change. Eventually they turned the outside sales force into drones that are now required to sell a certain area at a certain time in a certain way. It basically cut the knees out from top producing sales people and limited the amount of sales that could be generated. The only benefit was to new sales people with no experience, as they can start working within the system and have a confined amount of sales expectations."
good,"Ever since Spectrum to over Time Warner Cable, it seems management has no control over operations. The lack of knowledge really impacts technicians causing stress and often times employees quitting"
good,Spectrum can be a fun place to work.  Some of the managers are awesome! The offer competitive pay and the opportunity for growth with the company. They also have many events at the job to show their appreciation to the employees.
good,Been with the company awhile when they were previously Time Warner cable. Since the merger 2 years ago there has been a lot of restructuring and culture changes happening (which is to be expected). From a Supply Chain point of view our job value has greatly diminished with no career advancement possible and low pay. It was my understanding that more in house jobs would be available but that is not the case in my dept. and in my area. Actually quite the opposite with Charter hiring 3rd party companies to do our jobs.
good,"In a 10 month period, my schedule changed over 4 separate times to various shifts and days. All employees are now salary based so no overtime. Location is near the RTD rail line for some buildings which is a bonus."
good,"fast paced , hard working environment. large territory , multiple stops ,building relationships, road warriors, physically challenging , self motivated, minimal supervised enviornment"
good,"Company benefits are very limited."
good,"Once Charter began re-organization of departments from the three companies, they company began laying off thousands of employees across the country.  Almost all engineering teams were relocated to Denver, which meant that all remote teams and teams from previous operational centers were disbanded.  Even when keeping remote teams alive would save the company money, executive mgmt. still forced people to move to the Center of Excellence (definitely NOT excellent), or lose their job.  Now, all their eggs are in one basket, so to speak, and the company has lost a lot of very good people for the sake of over-centralization and consolidation."
good,"The management is horrible with this company. They do not care about employees and their family. "
good,"work day is you come in sign in head out within 10 minutes, go job to job, attempting to make the time frames, depending on the dispatch. you can make it on time. Management if they care about you makes sure your trained and have the proper equipment, if not your on your own"
good,"Just another call center type environment. The management is alright, sometimes it takes a while for any questions to be answered and things to get done correctly. Fast paced environment, taking lots of calls, usually upwards of 60 a day. Overall a good experience. The metric they grade calls on are actually reachable, and there is no strict quality assurance telling you that you must say this or that."
good,I great job to provide for your family. Great benefits and perks. Paid comprehensive training to give you the best start to succeed. Just need to adjust to shift bids every 6 mos
good,"This job was one of the most stressful I've had. Clients are considerably more abusive over the phone than they are in person. Between this and the pressures of taking as many calls as possible within an hour, making sure you were on script and upselling applicable clients, as Quality Assu8rance could be listening to any of your calls, it simply became too stressful for me to continue."
good,"lot of changes with merger, employee changes, lot of unknowns, teams supported each other, constant changing of policies, great benefits, mix products"
good,"It is a very fast paced, high volume sales call center.  Emphasis is placed on producing the highest volume in the shortest amount of time. I've learned to be persuasive...it's a sales position.  It can be cutthroat at times and people continue to push the limits to gain sales advantages. However, there are plenty of wonderful people who are a joy to work with."
good,"Make sure you get the hours you want to work up front"
good,"Commission is nice if you can earn it with all the business rules in place to keep you from making it. Some Supervisors made it hard to do you work when they are constantly in your face screaming at you."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Spectrum is a big company with a lot of growth opportunities. The transition to bring 3 companies together has been difficult but I believe they are on track to be great one day.
good,Charter / Spectrum acquired Bright House and Time Warner Cable so they are effectively merging 3 companies.  It can be quite stressful at times.  Most likely will be a very different company after 2 or 3 years when the transition is settled down.
good,Stressful but the pay is nice. The bonus checks or incentive vpay is worth it alone. If you like money and are good at empathy this is the perfect place for you.
good,Charter was a decent place to work I liked many of my co-workers and the job itself. I was disappointed in advancement opportunities and pay-raises. No stock is offered either.
good,"Not a place to be if you are looking to start a family.  As in any newsroom, you are always on the go.  "
good,Very poor customer service.  Management not supportive to employees.  Help numbers for my customers changed too often.  No protected accounts.  Too many other reps calling into my base of customers.
good,"the salary and compensation for the work is amazing, but the work is stressful with very little to no management support."
good,"It’s a great job and they pay really well, but the lack of human interaction is not too fun. You go in, you sit there, you take your breaks at the exact same time every day."
good,Agents are awesome!! Some team leads fail to do their job as it should be done. Call Avoidance should go for everyone who is supposed to take a call from agents and also team leads when handling calls as supervisors.
good,"Great Pay But your Micro Managed. So if you don't mind working every Saturday and being Micro Managed,,,,, Go for it ! The hardest part working in all types of weather !"
good,Very self motivated job. You did not have a set schedule but Management wanted you to be working between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. every evening except for Sundays. You could always work earlier if you would like but you had a quota to meet everyday of how many  doors you went to and if you did not reach that quota management would be upset with you. Every month had a sales quota as well as new areas to work. I was given a very low income area and when I tried to tell management about it they kept saying that low income areas were our best areas to sell at. I sold a total of 6 packages in the 3 months I worked there. The monthly quota is 10. I resigned due to the fact I was given poor selling areas as well as management just yelling at me when I could not meet the quota. If I ever had an issue I was told to call management and every time I called they never answered and by the time they called me back I had either lost my sale or found the answer by asking other reps.
good,"Topical administrative functions Meet and greet, filing, ordered office supplies, Manage calendar. Assist entire department. Process expense reports. input info into computer."
good,This is a very stressful work environment.  It is a call center so it is to be expected.  Ridiculous policies constantly being implemented.  Double standards and micromanagement.  Someone is always looking over your shoulder.  They do not advocate for you or the customer.  Metrics are the most important thing here as they represent leadership.  If leaderships metrics are bad it will trickle down hill to the lowest level and becomes your fault and your job becomes at risk.
good,"Your work day is never the same as a over the phone customer service agent which is not bad, honestly the customers are not the bad part of the job. There is a serious lack of communication between the high up and the customers service rep. in my particular call center it seem like there was nothing but rules that honestly made the job more stressful and also frustrating to handle the customer and many policies that prevents you from helping the customer"
good,"Used to be a great place to work. Typical call center type of job/duties. As time went on, it became more strict and focusing on petty things on your calls."
good,"Must love to sell, sell sell.  "
good,"actively and consistently support all efforts to simplify and enhance the customer experience. This role will provide basic customer support related to Charter/Spectrum services, including handling billing inquiries and payments, while establishing and maintaining professional and positive relationships with customers on behalf of Charter/Spectrum."
good,"Great place to start, but eventually most people move on after a year or two.  The nature of the news cycle make it super slow at times, interrupted by the chaos of breaking news and/or special events."
good,"Was a good company to work for initially despite being very cliquey in terms of management/owner being close personal friends with a lot of the ""middle-management""."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"TWC had much better working conditions, but Charter cut back on benefits and vacation time, made restrictive working conditions (dress code, remote work, etc)."
good,"Great stint for about 7 years. "
good,"The company is undergoing a merger and the changes have been many. Being a publicly owned company they now focus on their bottom-line and have become disconnected from their working class and their customers. Management plays by a ""good 'ol boys club"" so unless you have the contacts you cant advance even if you're more qualified. They also like to remind employees that they are replaceable and can find other to do their work. Complaints toward the company are not welcome. Overall, the company culture has diminished greatly and efficiency is out the window."
good,it is what you make it. either you like being in the field or you don't. The customers are for the most part okay with you doing your work but not always understanding. if you can get a call center position you would be better off
good,i love the money made at the company and it offers great benefits i just dont think that it is a job fit for a single parent. ithere are alot of my friends from previous jobs that work for the company there are alot of ways to make money and the pay is well worth the work
good,"The hours don't work with my lifestyle and you really have to be "
good,Poor compensation plans for account executives.  Hardest part of the job is making a consistent salary.  The most enjoyable is there is flexibility in your work schedule and meeting new customers.
good,"It has been a difficult transition from Bright House Networks to Spectrum."
good,Spectrum has great benefits as well as pay can be pretty good as well. Does not allow a lot of flexibility in regards to hours and most reps are required at least one weekend day.
good,"The company culture has changed a lot from before Charter bought us.  Charter is trying to get as many Time Warner employees as they can to resign so they can hire less experienced, thus lower paid, employees."
good,"The job has changed so much since Charter took over TWC. It was a little stressful at times before but now as Spectrum it's getting unbearable. You can expect to get home an hour or 2 after your shift ends everyday because they book so much more work than techs that are working. So no family time besides my 2 days off. During your shift You don't get time to breathe. Forget a lunch, if you do get one, that's an hour later you will have to stay after your shift to complete the work. The metrics are just outrageous and unattainable. Especially when everything and everybody has control over them. But the pressure to make those goals is non-stop. Tech Management doesn't care, they act like they do but do nothing to help. The decisions are above their pay grade.  Everybody knows it's crazy but can do nothing to help. The company has gone from being employee friendly to be completely customer and number driven so the Morale is really low right now. The pay is decent but low compared to what other companies are paying their techs. You do get a company vehicle, gas card, good benefits and discounted services."
good,"Spectrum is pays fairly well and has great benefits, but there are too many changes to the commission structure and there is absolutely no job security."
good,"I worked for companies sub-contracted to install for Spectrum. Work could be either slow, or very busy. You were paid on a point system for work completed, so time spent doing work you weren't getting paid for or waiting on customers, Spectrum tech support, or driving meant as much as a couple hours per day."
good,"Decent job, as with any business things are subject to change, typical day at work is extremely tiring. Also mentally and physically draining.  alot of changes since the merger."
good,Manager lacked communications skills and came off as very cold. She would hold up in her office some days and avoid any contact with others. Not that likeable at all.
good,"Just fine but very old school, like working in a Mad Men environment from TV at times. Nothing else to say just filling in the gaps here to allow me to proceed"
good,Once the company was acquired by Charter it went downhill. With Bright house it was customer focused and an enjoyable work environment. Employees were not trained well.
good,"phone job, customer first, low pay increases, limited advancement. This post is making me add more about this job, but i do not want to so this is all i will do because this should not be a required field."
good,"At that time, Time Warner Cable was trying to expand products/services via different promotions."
good,"Company was great when it was Time Warner Cable. We recently were purchased by Spectrum and the changes have hard on EVERYONE from the top to the bottom for those of us that were originally TWC. We used to be able to have fun, now we feel like unappreciated slaves. No recognition, no way to move up in positions at the time, since the new progression plan for us has not been rolled out and make of us want to make more money and grow. So the hardest part is the changes on top of the recent mandatory OT that we have to do on our days off. We are short staffed and need at least 5 or 7 more people but upper management won't allow it. Everyone is forced to be overworked. We are doing our best but everyone is getting burnt out. The morale is so low."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,it was difficult to meet the job quotas and requirements. Pay was by commission which could be great or terrible depending on the sales that were completed.  By Meeting the Quotas I was paid well and insurance and vacation packages were generous
good,"With the recent merge with Time Warner cable, the work environment is constantly changing due to re-structuring, centralization of functions and company culture"
good,"It's an ok place to work if you can't find anything else, Pay is way below the norm and PTO is almost non existent, Local managers do the best with what they have but corporate only cares about profits. No pay raises or chances for promotion."
good,"The pay is good if you're willing to put up with being yelled at by customers on a daily basis. The building management is very friendly and helpful, the corporate level.....well, it's there. The decisions made lack any for thought about the customer experience, and more so for the reps that work for the company. They emphasis customer satisfaction but constantly increase rates and don't give any justification for doing so. When it was still Time Warner Cable they had TONS of incentive programs and rewards for the reps, as charter, almost none exist."
good,"Steady work and continual learning capabilities. A place to learn your profession and how to adapt when needed. Supervision is there if needed but most of the time once you learn the procedures you are doing your job solo, others will be close by helping with other parts of the job to complete the task at hand."
good,"a bit of a bully culture, insecure management.  reorganization is a regular occurrence, though not necessarily creating greater efficiency or process."
good,"After the merger with Charter Communications, this job has became very cut-throat in with employees, and customers (Take it or leave attitude). This company has found a way to cap commission, take away time off that is needed to cope with the stress of a dying product., terrible schedules. The expectations to keep cable is unrealistic when customers are buying firesticks. I predict Spectrum will be bought by another company in 2-4yrs. If you can deal with being called racial slurs, disrespected, and belittled for a paycheck this company is perfect"
good,"Turner Broadcasting is family oriented. The compensation could be better with the experience already provided. The benefits are good and could be better as pertains to co-pay and etc. The people whom have worked for the company over 15 years are very territorial; petty and carry on sorority/fraternity type antics. Promotions are given to favorites. Management only manage themselves. The over all culture is laid back, with highly intelligent, fast pace people. The summer Friday's and Thursday's activities, movie premieres are a win. This is a great start career for college grads in media/communications.  However this position it's not designed for long-term, because they aren't willing to compensate."
good,"Made great money, spoke to great people and provided quality products and services. One of my favorite places to work and would work there again in a heartbeat."
good,"The benefits were awesome as Time Warner Cable. As spectrum I never worked because they faded my position company wide. They have other positions available; however, I am not sure about the security."
good,"Great fast paced workplace with and ever changing challenges that keep you engaged and ready to do your best to get the job done. If you enjoy the freedom of working alone and love customer service as well as troubleshooting, this is the job for you."
good,"You come into work and sit down to answer the phones for tech support questions. Seems simple enough. You just want to help the people on the phone to have the best experience possible. Only to find out that your hands are tied with the most common sense options being too expensive to offer (e.g. sending a tech out for one-on-one supervision with some issues) and just trying to handle the tech issue over the phone."
good,Two brothers ran their fathers business and would constantly fight over nothing making it a bad working experience. I would not recommend working there.
good,Unless you come in as a manager you will never move any further than a part time employee hanging out listening to music and helping all the customers it is like every retail job you have worked
good,"Ultra competitive regarding numbers and a classic ""what have you done for me lately"" environment.  Unreasonable expectations set by leadership with a low priority placed on ethics and doing right by the customer.  Just bring in the dollars and you will be left alone, otherwise, expect to be micromanaged and pigeon holed.  Don't expect much internal support regarding identifying prospects or coaching.  However, good money if the challenges can be navigated."
good,I was inbound sales and my co workers were great and my supervisor was good but the schedule was bad for my life but some people liked it. It was to many variables that would affect the pay check.
good,Co workers were great.  Training was fun too. But once your on the floor (production) it can be stressful. This was my first call center but the angry customers finally got to me. On the top of that my supervisor didn't partake in any of the fun activities the company offered. So my teams moral was at an all time low. Being new you can't bid on shift change until after telephone training. Which I never got an invite to on my 3 month mark on the floor.
good,"It was Time Warner Cable at the time that I worked there. I""m sure much has changed since they were purchased by Spectrum. The representatives did not have a lot of power to aid the customer and the flow of calls didn't make sense. The nature of the work was always stressful and I don't feel as thought he employees were thanked that much for their hard work. The best thing about it was the high pay and the benefits - which seems necessary after being yelled at by angry patrons all day"
good,"I started with Spectrum under Time Warner Cable as an outbound retention telesales agent. The company was very strong on internal advancement and continuing education. After finishing college and being promoted to Supervisor my daily task took on a new meeting. Constant data reporting, daily coaching and quality control monitoring. Measuring productivity and addressing areas of opportunity real time. The best part of my job was being looked to to develop training material to enhance department sales and saves performance. Coaching agents up and watching them get excited about their enhanced performance and their eagerness to maintain and or excel their goals. Also being part of the culture crew, ensuring that the department stayed abreast of the morale and keep all workers engaged and determined."
good,I would recommend the job to anyone that is suffering from high levels of stress or does not have the ability to mentally block out negative intentions that the cust and some co-workers tend to throw out at you.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Working for spectrum your required to work in the field 50% of the time collection equipment or payment for services. Outbound calls were made to remind the customer of payments, pay due, or schedule pickup."
good,I was with this company for 4 plus years. The job has really great opportunities for growth with in the company. They offer great pay in the retention sales dept. I actually left the company right after the charter merger took place due to relocating. They do not seem to support transfers from state to state.
good,"It was an ok place I was trying to only work part time though and they would not allow me, so other than that it was a great place to work. I would recommend it ."
good,The culture at Spectrum is one of micro management. The is an emphasis of direct management. Anytime there is a merger of 2 company's there is always change and for some of the displaced employees are being penalized for where they are living and not what their abilities are .
good,"I have the opportunity to be the first supervisor that they hear from/interact with.I have learned to manage vey well, coach, interact and create a positive culture."
good,Spectrum is growing as I understand the period that I worked for them was a good experience I'm looking for outside sales and which I have over 20 years experience.
good,"Very high employee turn over due to job stress. They literally count the seconds that you are off the phone. Work instructions and responsibilities change weekly. The job offers good retirement plan and free home phone,wifi, and cable."
good,"typical day at work consist of getting a route of about 3 to 4 jobs that you have to finish within a time frame , after your done then the quality control manager goes and checks it and if you made a mistake in installation there might be a risk that you wont get paid for that job. Management was horrible there they didn't want to help out with anything at all even when you needed support they would just tell me to call the operator. the best part of the job was you have noone really on you you can work comfortable without the stress of someone being on your back all day."
good,"My experience with this company has had it's ups and downs. The dynamic of the company changes constantly. Must be very adaptable to change.When i started the company was a pleasure to work for.I believe with the new merger, if managment works on building rapport and morale with the employess, the environment would be much better."
good,Company needs to increase pay based on job demands. Advancement opportunities are few and far in between. Hours are not ideal for work life balance...
good,Always short staffed. Couldn't find good workers. Never had the support of management to do what was necessary for work to run smoothly or effectively.
good,Busy work environmet; back to back calls; Tied to phones; Not very much support with management; No room to grow and advance; gave overtime as needed.
good,"very handful you learn a lot on your day to day duties , every job is totally different , not the same environment so is very helpful , commercial department"
good,Spectrum decided that they would not let anyone remote and anyone from Time Warner Cable had to relocate. They were not prepared for the merger and work essentially stopped while Spectrum's management sorted things out.
good,You have to be willing to come into work the next day and completely forget about what you've learned the previous day. Overall pay was great . Free cable .. other than that its a temp job
good,"if the right person likes u your good, no matter your stats"
good,"CNN/TBS is a nice place to work.  However, it can be hectic when staff doesn't always see eye to eye, and even worst when management can't see eye to eye.  It just brings the whole morale of the office down."
good,"Overall the day is normally fast paced and back to back. Not much room for conversation or questions about what you are doing. kinda have to assume half of what you are doing and then when you get it wrong it comes back to bite you when customers complain they are told two different things. Not much help from polite coworkers, no one wants to be there, which makes for a hostile work environment."
good,Learned a lot from management.  Interesting work. Relaxed environment. Compensation is a little lacking.  Always against a deadline.  Overall not a bad place.
good,"Back when I worked here, it was a much different place. From what I have heard, things have really improved for employees at Charter Spectrum. It's been almost a decade since I was there."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Easy place to work if you want to make $12/hour and get some commission. Difficult place to work if you care about making real money. Commission is capped with employees competing against one another for it.
good,"the best part of the job is solving customers problems and providing a useful service. I learned a lot of how to provide the best customer service possible by paying attention to detail and never neglecting the spouse of questions or concerns. "
good,"Descent pay and good benefits. But it's a call center and your probably not going to get the hours you want for at least a year. Don't listen to the recruiters, new people usually get the worst hours and won't get holidays off either. If you have no other options or really enjoy working in a call center than this is a good one. If you have other options I suggest you use them."
good,"Spectrum purchased Bright House Networks (who I had worked for, for over 26 years) and I only worked under them for less than a year but during that time that I worked for them...it was an uncomfortable working environment...the management was not interested in keeping staff... I didn't understand their culture... the hardest part about working there was not knowing how we could integrate into the new companies philosophy and therefore we were encouraged to take the severance package and leave the company. I did not enjoy the working environment nor working for them... Therefore, I took the severance package."
good,my thing is the company don't even follow their own policies which ultimately cost me my job but other then that i loved every minute of the 3 years i gave to them
good,Spectrum is going through significant changes and those changes require relocation. For me I will not be relocating and will be leaving the company.
good,"Typical day at my workplace includes answering customer calls regarding customer billing questions and concerns. Walking customers thru changes in the company (Changing from Time Warner Cable to Spectrum). I strive to be the very best with my customer and make them feel their issue is important. It is important to me to do the best I can every day so typically I read, learn everything I can about my job to be the best I can be. Management teams are good, there could be more interaction and instruction from them. Focus on report cards are most important to management, much pressure is put on employees to exceed these expectations. I have managed to exceed and have won 2 ""Employee Excellence"" luncheons. Hardest part of job is trying to advance in the company."
good,No Comment because one doesn't want to talk about sour grapes of merger that happen too quickly and clients are impacted from incomplete planning forcing a reactive mode
good,"I did not work for Spectrum I worked for Time Warner. I was the first female Operations Supervisor they every hired, in field services. I enjoyed learning cable installation and maintenance. My prior experience had been telephone and digital."
good,The company used to pride itself on customer service.  Then it started taking over more territory for service.  Quality started lacking.
good,"The company has been good to me and I made lots of money. I never had a complaint until recently. Now that it's charter there is poor communication, less money, expensive benefits, higher goals for less money, no incentives, worked holiday and the list can go on. I usually would recommend this job but now that charter took over it's not worth it ! All they do is take from their employees and they only care about them and their shareholders"
good,"So many changes, after months still no guidance on what was needed from us.  But still expecting us to do better.  The tenor that was once important, is no longer helpful."
good,"When I started at Charter, they had awesome giveaways, contests, casual Fridays, and a fun work environment.  The longer I stayed there, the more privileges we lost and the more authoritarian the supervisors became.  You'd have one hovering over your shoulder annoying you as soon as your call hit 10 minutes.  Ridiculously petty dress code, like how much of a percentage of your foot could show depending on whether your shoe had a strap or a heel.  They took away our mute button.  They began treating us like children and we had to raise our hand and wait for a supervisor to do basically anything because we were so disempowered to help the customer.  However, commission was awesome and benefits were pretty great -- free internet was the best perk."
good,The company has experienced phenomenal growth in the last several years and is currently facing the challenges of becoming an industry leader. Great team to be a part of
good,twc is a great company its just certain things that need to change within the company the hardest part of this job is the system called icoms theres really not much help when yu need it everybody for their selves.
good,I worked long hours for 6 days a week. I wish Time Warner kept their promises that were made to me. It was a very positive workplace and some supervisors were helpful.
good,"When I worked for Charter the company was just getting off the ground and there was numerous growing pains, I hear they are much better to work for today."
good,Things are constantly changing here. The job has plenty of opportunity for growth. It has employee activities that are good ice breakers. There are some systems that need to be updated to better serve the customers and the employees. All in all not a bad place to start.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,cubicle type job. friendly co-workers. convenient hours. flexible for time off requests...opportunities for advancement. lots of times you call to discuss a new roduct to sell and the customer wants to talk about thier acct and rate reduction
good,"Pros "
good,Excellent benefits and pay structure is fair.  The job itself is awful and the environment is very cut throat.  A lot of behind the back talk and management plays favorites.  Not worth the drama.  Customers are hostile and the work environment is borderline unsafe.
good,"If the prospect of working in a reality akin to that of the movie Office Space then this is perfect for you. Even if you're the highest performing agent there, if one customer complains then they will throw you wayward without a seconds thought."
good,Nothing to offer blue collar workers everything is setup for the workers to receive the lesser end of pay scale compared to other companies.
good,"Your experience as a care rep was affected mostly by the supervisor you had. Some sups were micromanagers and some others you would never receive feedback from. They have a very hard time keeping competent people in the call center due to inconsistent management and low pay."
good,"Cable is a great industry, and Time Warner is a solid company. Just have to be able to carve out your area in a sales position."
good,"Time Warner is a great company to work for if you just want to get ""settled in for life: The free cable and internet compensation is worth everything. The medical/dental plans are the best. I loved my actual job in direct sales. However management was difficult at best. I quit after only a few months. The atmosphere was a little too controlling for me."
good,"If you want to learn, this is the place to do it. The second largest cable company in the country with small business mom-and-pops leadership mindset.  Aside from this conflict, it's a great place to work for a year or two. Any longer than that in the same position and you will get burned out."
good,"Everything is very unknown about the future with Customer Care, I also think we will see a lot of changes during the new fiscal year."
good,"I would not pursue if you are someone that drinks any regular amount of liquids because your job security is based on how often you are not available for calls... Thus if you have a small bladder or are on any meds that require frequent bathroom breaks, this is not the job for you.  The company gives bonuses for sales and Customer Satisfaction, but not like a real sales job you provide you with commission checks. You can have a better work experience based on your manager, and they vary greatly."
good,"typical day of work is a fast paced non stop, melting pot of many things. i have learned a lot from charter, everything from shipping and reciving to system analizing . managment is lacking leadership skills in some areas and others they are fine. as far as co-workers go we have a very diverse ethnic group of people, and we learn a lot from each other. there isn't anything to difficult about the job so long as you are willing to learn."
good,When i gave my resignation when i knew i was going to be relocating to Tennessee i was do 3 gift cards from working volunteer overtime days and were denied them because I resigned. The overtime was worked way before I ever thought about moving. This is a practice that TWC is acustom to. I worked for them several years ago and they haven't changed. They will and do take every oppurtunity to get over on employees.
good,"Could be fun with the right people around you, but very tight ship they watched every minute.  Monitored your calls and it just felt creepy working there."
good,"Coworkers extremely unhappy, and it's palpable. The call center is filled with angry yelling, slamming of desk objects."
good,"Corporate American Standard... "
good,There is something about fixing problems that no one else can fix that somehow makes this job rewarding to me.
good,"If your just entering the workforce, consider this as a ""ok"" route. "
good,"Charter is a very interesting place to work, things change often new things always hitting the floor to learn about so if you are like me and love to learn new things this is great place to wok the bad thing about charter is management their are no set rules there everyone have their own separate rules instead of going by charter handbook. Flexibility is depending on management"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Typical day is test the Bright House mobile app on multiple devices. This position exposes you to a lot of mobile devices technology. Management tend to leave you alone. They tend to keep to themselves and do not engage with the workers too much. The team that I am on is great and we work well as a group.
good,Too many trackers that have the same function. You end up putting the same data into different sheets. Too many hands in the same pot.
good,"High paced, makes day go by easy. Friendly and professional atmosphere. Hardest part of the job is dealing with numerous outages on a daily basis, however a company of that size is expected to have some issues. Most enjoyable part of the job are the people working and the vastly diverse groups."
good,"Bright House was a good company in the past however with the impending buyout in the works, management is more concerned with saving their own jobs."
good,The benefits from this company are great which I think you will see echoed in other reviews. The employee services account and the free level of services being offered are great too. What you could expect working in a service technician role is a hard day's work. You are going to be bringing your hardhat literally. The shift schedule on a  day to day basis is supposed to be long. You will often go over it or have to go through a lunch break on a fairly significant amount of days. The partnerships that you can a part of with Time Warner is the biggest thing that I enjoyed during my time there.
good,"A typical day was very busy, high volume of calls.  I learned a lot about problem solving equipment problems. Management and co-workers very helpful. The hardest part of the job was order entry required too many codes to make the order work and more training was needed.  The most enjoyable part was using my customer services skills to solve a customer complaints and seeing them happy and satisfied with my help."
good,"typical NOC operations overnight that usually rollercoaster in events and outages, great place to start. Variety of tools to learn and practice with"
good,"Customer Care Rep at TWC was not a horrible job. While you dealt with hostile customers with little to no time between calls. The supervisors and fellow workers were by and large a decent group of people. What was truly lacking from the company was the fact there was little true support other than ""its what corporate is telling us."" Couple that with the fact that things change every day it leads to burn out rather quick and a negative impression on many employees which can just build up. Only take a job at the company if you have a thick skin and even temper."
good,good people to work with management not so much but the pay is great and the commission as well. also had incentives every month and prize giveaways
good,TWC Business is a good company.  It is a dynamic and ever changing environment.  There are some very good people in the organization.  Matrix organization that could benefit from decentralization.
good,"I personally did not like the environment, the team I was on was very catty. Customers were mostly rude. Company's main focus is just money, do not care about customers."
good,"ok work place, job is not easy with customers upset with the past charter. the new charter is a pretty good company. management is only about the numbers and make it very difficult for employees to truly help the customers.  benefits are good."
good,"I enjoyed the compensation. i thought the company should've invested more money in the trainning areas. This particular area wanted aggressive sales representatives that had already been doing the job. The trainning ""skimmed through"" the 1 week class with products and proceedures."
good,"Good company to work for, just depends on what division you are in. Good hours, good pay. New division I was in is very unstable. Everything is about productivity."
good,"I'm currently a CLI Inspector and my daily duties are driving 80-120 miles per day looking for cables that are hanging or have been cut to report to be removed. At the end of the week, create a report of all the violations to be submitted for removal or replacement."
good,"Numbers are everything and when it comes right down to it the bottom line is all that matters. Gestapo like management techniques and heavy handed with discipline. They use you for all you're worth and then jump at the first opportunity to let you go. Unless of course, you're in the inner circle..."
good,"My day generally begins around 6;30 am.  From my work tablet, I am able to see my workload for the day. There are several applications that can help techs troubleshoot prior to arrival.   I use this time to research customers equipment that may be outside of Charter specifications.  I can see trends that may give me an idea of what to look for when I log on to the jobs. Once logged on job, I have a regiment that has served me well.  My meter is my most trusted companion and confirms instincts that have developed from hands on, in field work. As no two jobs are the same, I learn something new every day.  Management is hands off for the most part and team play from colleagues are our primary support along with dispatch and ITT support.  My primary function is the RF integrity for drop system from street to premise, equipment variables, and customer satisfaction.  The superior training I received has helped me to become the most consistent technician in our office in meeting goals with a customer satisfaction routinely at 95%.  Without fail, a job well done and a happy customer is by far the most rewarding aspect of my job."
good,"Time Warner Cable isn't a bad company in general, great health benefits, salary is ok, and the people you work with (for the most part) are mature."
good,"This job is good for people who need to be employed right away. However, I would not make this a long term career. It is too hard to advance, there are certain cliques and crews and if not in the right one your career will be at a stand still."
good,"the typical work day is nice and easy its just three hours and we have long breaks , I've learned a lot of communicative skills, the management is caring for there workers , some of the co workers were unkind but most of them were very kind . the hardest part of my job would have to be keeping up with the resident but i still did it the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing all of the residents every day with a smile."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"In my current position, I am responsible in assisting the Charter Business team in executing project plans, service sales and the management of Charter Communications Cable customer resources, by tracking the needs of our customers and placing orders with Communication vendors to add infrastructure and capacity needed for new Ethernet and Wave network circuits that will be added to the Charter Business inventory. I assist in the evaluation of Quotes for new and existing circuits in order to ensure the most efficient use and operation of existing Ethernet services.  I also work closely with our vendors to evaluate leased fiber capacity options, manage colocation agreements, and work with numerous internal and external corporate customers to assist in the management, turn-up and testing of all Ethernet and capacity circuits in the Charter Network."
good,"A typical day in the call center, would entail myself, answering inbound calls, where i'm prepared to troubleshoot Charter communications cable boxes, by means of working jointly with the customer over the phone to restore cable services to the customer. During each troubleshooting session, i would consider all possible reasons/system malfunctions responsible and would troubleshoot accordingly. While adhering to all of call center core metrics i was able to assist my customers efficiently with a high energy of customer service. Any issue that could not be resolved via over the phone trouble shooting steps, required me to access dispatch quota, and schedule a technician to be dispatched to the customers home to service the cable equipment. "
good,"Typical day is a consistent pace of go, go, go with emails, vacation requests and managing quota and workforce. Makes the day go by quickly cause there is always something for you to be doing and most days the work load is just enough to be stressful at times but able to get all you need to done by end of day. That being said my normal work day was super stressful every day my management was there as I would be consistently badgered and question, sometimes moments after logging into my computer. Being pulled in many different directions with no clear direction and this only hindered my day to day functions, and with no room for errors. Co-workers were fun and enjoyable but are quick to pass blame. Hardest part of the job would be going to work due to ongoing issue with management and the lack of feel valued. Most enjoyable part of the job would be the free cable services and the establishment of some valued friendships."
good,A typical day at work would be logging on the phones and answering calls and trying to save customers from canceling Time Warner Cable.
good,Job was fun technical was but the pressure they put on there emplyees to meet deadlines is a little crazy. Pay is also low for the amount of work per day
good,"Charter was a difficult place to work for after a period of time. "
good,"no comment,, some room for growth.. great company .improvement on employer and employee relations. Good compensation if you are just starting your adult life.. However you must be in good company to get growth ..Customer service"
good,Poor training and management.  Decent pay with opportunities for raises based on merit and passing tests.  Long days if you get the 10 hour shifts.  Working outside in jeans means you sweat a lot in the summer.
good,"Bright House ""Was"" a great place to work for when I first started there. I love the games and gifts that were given out often. The pay is great too. When Bright House started making the changes about 2 years ago I knew it was time to go. The new hires wouldn't have a problem working there because they don't know how it used to be. It's life and things change. Some of the supervisors are great. A lot of gossip does go on there like every job you just have learn to stay away from it. Bright House management gets too far in your personal then they should and people have been fired for their personal business"
good,"OK work, Dispatch was bad and some customer just like any other place. They don't care about customers or employees to be honest with you"
good,"My position here was in the Customer Service call center answering incoming calls from New and Current customers to assist with billing inquiries, scheduling orders for new services/installations/service issues. "
good,"installing cable phone and internet in to customer's home. I learned a lot from Time Warner Cable splicing and running cables and wire. Management wasn't that bad, and helped with work load. My co-workers were great and they were big on team work. The Hardest part of this job was climbing 28ft in the air. The most enjoyable part of this job was the minimal supervision."
good,"No career advancement, they hire supervisors from outside instead of within company, no advancement. No motivation at all from anyone here."
good,"I'm not really a big fan of this company from the consumer standpoint, but it does offer good benefits and compensation."
good,"Job requirement consisted of making high sales. That also meant that one needed to try to get people to buy more in cable, phone, internet and being a little aggressive. I couldn't be like that. I enjoyed the people and the majority of the customers. Even the grumpy ones I made everything alright. Hardest part of the job was when customers would say that they just couldn't afford cable. I was suppose to 'push.' But I couldn't. They were a goodgroup of people that worked there."
good,"Excellent company to work for and the most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new customers. the hardest part of the job is the out door weather, and climbing poles,"
good,"Good place to work; compensation was base salary plus commission; therefore based on my initiative I was able to do well overall in total income. Typical day involved taking 30 to 50 calls per day to retain and up sell customers and potential customers.Heavy focus on training which I enjoyed; but due to magnitude of information we needed to retain; it was critical to train daily; weekly, monthly.Manage was good; but not always on same page which could be confusing from time to time. Coworkers were great; positive, upbeat, and determined to perform at expected high levels of performance.Hardest part of job was mastering the skill sets to deal with and overcome irate customers and their objections. The most enjoyable part of the job was the commission; and associated with the money all the rewards and benefits offered along with performance such as recognition and incentitives."
good,My experience with Time Warner helped me lean Microsoft Office. We had a Christmas party every year and they had door prizes. Santa would show up and tell us we were getting a Christmas bonus. We got a ham or turkey for Thanksgiving and Christmas. That was the best things about working there.
good,"I enjoyed the work I did with Time Warner, but I was a contractor as well. The contractor I was working for really made it hard for me to enjoy the job."
good,No one knows what they are doing and they throw you out in the feild without proper training. It's also very dangerous for how little you get paid.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,This is a good company to work for as far as compensation and benefits is concerned. The only issue I had is schedule changes without notice and they aren't willing to work with you schedule wise if you can't work a certain shift they are not willing to negotiate.
good,"High volume call center worked in billing, tech support, retention and sales calls. Dealt with a ever changing policy and procedures that I adapted well in. I enjoyed training new hires and ensuring older staff was well prepared for changings and data entrée. Was always up and knowledgeable on new products. I was a open door for fellow staff to answer and help research any questions."
good,"In this position you troubleshoot cable, internet and phone, explain and lower bills and upsell products and services. The environment is fairly relaxed, but there is high pressure to hit your monthly goals. You are expected to sell cable, internet and phone to customers whose first words when speaking to you are usually not nice... and there is nothing you can do about it. Help is scarce, especially at night- which is where all new hires go. A new class is hired every month but most people don't last. It takes a lot to sit and take nonstop calls for 8 hours. Although most things are repetitive, there are many situations not covered in training that are encountered daily. I've been there almost a year stuck on the late shift. Trying to get new hours is impossible- unless there is a shift bid- where they offer maybe 10-15 shifts for almost 200 people."
good,Comcast treats there employes very well and has a good commitment to serving their communities.
good,"While I did learn a lot working for the company, my skills were highly under utilized and under appreciated."
good,I was put online against my will and was working under and in a hostile work environment; while no assistance was provided or afforded to by reasonable measures by Time Warner Cable and others.
good,"A typical day at work- Taking calls about Billing, Sales, Troubleshooting. Can become difficult because of the metrics that you are required to meet every week. A lot of people transfer customer (Place them back in Que) to avoid lowering their goals, which makes it harder on the ones who don't want to cheat the system. You are only allowed to miss 3 days in a 6 month period. You don't earn any personal time until after an year, which is hard. If your a person who typically gets sick then this will not be the job for you. I love the benefits, which are cheaper compared to several companies. IF you love to SALE you definitely can bring home at least 1200 each check after taxes"
good,"The company had many incentives, but communication between installer/ service techs was poor. The ability to get help on large projects was pretty much non existent."
good,"A typical work day at Charter, would be keying daily drop payments. Enter acking with the customers taking there payments going over there billing upgrading there services or entering in new service. "
good,"The pay and benefits were much better prior to the merger.  The extra pay and free cable make it more worth the job,"
good,"Tough business cable, people only want to pay less and get more. Difficult job but friendly co workers and decent benefits made it fine."
good,"dispatching technicians to different locations to install cable and complete service calls. I learned about different locations within the city. We were pretty much independent workers, and we all got along great, the hardest part of the job was getting calls from customers saying they had problems with the way their cable had been installed. The most enjoyable part was when we got calls from customers giving good feedback from their installation."
good,I enjoyed helping employees advance and meet their full potential.
good,"Time Warner Cable offers great benefits and great pay, however the work environment is extremely stressful, with plenty of quotas to meet. Also there is no job security within the position."
good,Okay place to work. Same thing day in and day out. Pay is great. Corporate structure is all jacked up. No room for advancement unless you work 6-10 years in the same spot.
good,"I loved my job at Charter Communications. The work environment was relaxed and co-workers were friendly...at first. As time went on true colors were shown from both co-workers and management. The work environment became tense and stressful. We were required to work ""mandatory overtime"" and had little choice in time off."
good,"Take anywhere between 20-40 calls per day. Must offer triple play gold services on every call, no matter what type of call it is. Practice top down sales strategy. Co-workers are team players, fun to be around and make the day less stressful. The hardest part of the job is meeting the metrics every single day and getting every customer that calls your line to order all 3 lines of business (cable, internet, and phone)."
good,Cable phone internet as employee you can get an extremely discounted rate
good,Everything except the pay was terrible. Free lunch from top named restaurants but ever changing policies. Management is disorganized and no cohesive. Apply if you can deal with bs.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Customers call in for various different reasons.  I personally work in the Solutions Dept also known as Retention dept.  Its our jobs to retain all customers services and products as much as possible.  Most ppl are wanting something for nothing. They give you their whole financial background or complain about services or say the other companies are offering them this that and the other for next to nothing.  Thats part of the job.  So you give them a discount or inform them that they cant have a new package because its the best you actually can do, no you dont just make up a number and thats what the bill will be.......many people think that. When you dont discount the services enough you get screamed at and cussed out and so on.  95% of the time the reason your being yelled at is because the customer messed up somewhere, usually they dont read their bill.  Everything they need to know is on their bill but in the age of electronic lazy ppl we get the short end of the stick b/c your just a person there to kiss their tail and make them happy because the customer is always right....wrong the customer is right most of the time when with in reason.  "
good,"a typical day at work consist of handling technician work load, providing support with field operations, assisting others, support and retention. the demands of the job has given me the ability to work under pressure with a supportive group. working with others is dependent on the others in the department. hardest part of the job is working with those who refuse to learn however working with people who want the best of their day by making it easy."
good,"I was an installer. I would go into peoples homes and install tv internet and phone service. You would be given your route (your jobs for the day) in the morning. To do a good job on peoples homes jobs would typically take longer than what was expected this could cause you fall behind very quickly, in turn this would cause you to finish late and it would snowball from there. This is a high pressure job with long hours for low to moderate pay. The best thing I enjoyed about this job was the people I would work with. They would experience the same type of struggles during the day and you could bond with them very quickly about the crazy things you have encountered in your day. If I did not have the co-workers I had I would of burned out there in no time."
good,"Daily routine working on tasks assigned"
good,"The department I worked for was a great place to work initially, but after six years with the company, the corporate level began to tighten its belt and demands they put on the workers became unbearable.  TWC has hired Nano managers to oversee the Micro managers and workers are nearly confined to their desks and not allowed movement except to stand up and rest your legs and knees from sitting so long.  If you enjoy being treated as an adult you may want to look elsewhere for a job.   TWC has become a meat market and talent no longer matters to them.  TWC is the only company I've ever worked for that does not want to hear any ideas of making or saving money from the workforce.  Corporate knows all and corporate is systematically running the business into the ground as a result.  I am an educated man and have over 20 years of experience.  I don't like to make unfair or rude assessments of companies but having worked at TWC for over six years and to have worked over 1000 hours of OT voluntarily and then to have been terminated because the company wanted to hire in younger fresh meat, I think I have the right to mention that TWC is a highly oppressive company that should value its workforce better, as the job is highly stressful and not for everyone."
good,"Sitting at a desk answering phones for 8 hours. Most of the people you deal with are cranky or behind on their bills. "
good,"I Have over 20 years in management, sales, etc. I went to work for Time Warner Cable because a few of my friends worked there (who are now gone). On the 1st day of Orientation by HR we were advised that Time Warner Cable loses over 70% off its employees due to attendance. After a year and a half I found that very little of the ""missing"" employees were no long longer there due to attendance, their attendance policy is actually very relaxed versus most companies that I have seen. Policies on sales change quite a bit, they did away with some positions entirely, and put employees in to new positions with out any further training which made it easier to move through more employees. I was one of about 25 employees that was part of my training class, after a year and a half, I was one of 3 that were still employed. They hire groups of 20-30 employees almost monthly because of the high turn over rate. The training was the worst training I have ever had in 20 years of work history, maybe it was just the Trainer Cathy that we had, but it was pretty bad. The pros to this are that if you do well, the money is pretty good. I typically averaged about 2000.00 per month in commission plus the 11.00 per hour that they pay. My highest commission for one month was 5800.00 after earning the top performer bonus. I have read several of the above reviews and I agree with a few of them, that as of now, this is a good intermediate job, but not much on the long term due to high turn over. Benefits and pay are good while you are there though. The hardest part of the job is when they fill your calls with"
good,"There have been, and still some people with-in the TWC Corp. that have not been trained in management and it shows in the work force level, although there are very skilled HFC engineers in the ranks of TWC and are a pleasure to work with."
good,There has been a lot of changes since I worked for this company but the biggest issue is they should pay more in salaries especially since some the customers you deal with can be horrible.
good,"Working in customer service I dealt with many irate, difficult customers."
good,I worked at this company for 7 years. the worse part is the micro management. I had good times and bad times in the company. The worse part that you most adhere to everything they tell you. If you go off trying to improve something outside your job scope that is a no no there.
good,TWC is a company run with no care for its employees.  I was laid off twice from my positions with the company and now after obtaining a college degree I can not even get an entry level position that I am overqualified for.  If you get in do your best to stay in and move around within the department.
good,"Everyday is different and challenging that I like , you learn new things day by day , now management ( Arlington office ) isn't organized at all im sorry to say , most of my co-worker in Arlington Tx office fear for there job here recently for the past 4months , you run into speed bumps sometime like getting into tight spot and dealing with some customers other than that its great , the most enjoyable part of the job is that you work at your on and you are out on your own work , you almost your own boss."
good,"~receive job assignments"
good,"The people at Time Warner Cable are great and supporting. "
good,"Answering multiple inbound and outbound calls.                                                                                  Troubleshooting various cable issues. "
good,A fast paced work environment with ever changing challenges and customer issues to identify and solve.
good,"I enhanced my skills to consider the customer calling in to for services and products.  Time Warner cable offers a broad range of products,Time Warner Cable has staff available working hires to cover their customers who need assistance with their telephone or cable services."
good,8 am to whenever your work is done. All about any system used in a home. Management is OK to work with.Coworkers are great. The weather. Making customers happy and getting a thank you from them.
good,In a call center environment taking about thirty calls a day. I learned to be flexible and expect change. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the diversity of customers.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Good company to work for with great benefits. The downfall for me is with management within my channel. Could be better organized. We have way too many sales reps stepping on each others toes. Everything is open territory, so you are constantly running into each other."
good,"The one major lesson that I have learned at my current employer is, the only constant is change.  I have learned to adapt well to change and like it because it breaks the monotonous environment."
good,Time Warner Cable was a good work environment for the first 3 years I worked for the company. After the first 3 years the company  started going threw continous change and the changes were not in favor of the employess. A typical day at work I would answer anywhere from 40-60 inbound calls. Best part about the job were my co-workers and the worst part of the were the many changes that the company went threw and how the company never thought of the front line employees before making changes and how it would affect the us.
good,"If working within this sort of system doesn't make you feel confined, then it's better than having no job. I felt overall undervalued and out of place compared to the rest of the office but I did learn some valuable skills pertaining to customer service and I feel more confident doing performing certain forms of physical labor.  I also encountered quite a few different computer systems and was able to gain more experience in troubleshooting internet connectivity errors in a home setting - and in many cases, where people have little to no technical knowledge."
good,good place to work if you like to be on the phone all day. demanding quotas hard to reach
good,Not a very comfortable working atmosphere. Worked in an unsafe area. Much office politics.
good,In i feel technical operations is being mismanaged and as a result its becoming a difficult place to work.
good,"started at 10am computer work then field work till 7 pm in one of 3 systems which I liked,I can do most anything in a cable system some headin mostly field work.got along with all my coworkers and consider some of them as friends for life .I really did not find anything hard about the job sometimes it was furstrating.Recent management changes after a accident in 2010 had mad my job more scurtnized on everything and questioned.I like people and solving problems this was the most enjoyable part of my job"
good,"Time Warner Cable's initials are TWC, also short for Things Will Change. Policy changes occurred every 1-2 months, sometimes making it difficult to keep up. Supervisors were forced to micromanage and push for quotas on things that really had nothing to do with the primary job, while management was invisible to basic reps. Combine that with customers refusing to listen when you are trying to assist, and it ended up a relatively stressful environment, no matter how pleasant Supervisors tried to make it."
good,this is a good job but to many changes to business that dont allow you to make sales
good,"The company is a great company to work for, outside of a sales position. The division I was in was new and the management  had little understanding of the vertical market. As you can see by my resume, I was employed in major account sales for many years and with Optimum Lightpath for Eleven. Let's talk about that great run."
good,"Always some type of incentive going on ability to make money was always present.  However not understand when outside life needed attention, not flexible with shift changes are alters."
good,"Little to know room for advancement, lacking management, which in turn lets the employees dictate to them how it is run.  Going through a period of eliminating jobs, so are constantly wondering how long you will be employed before they determine they can do without you."
good,"The days at TWC were typically laid back and easy.  I did outbound sales so I had to call current customers and upsell them, which I found to be a little easier than I thought it was going to be.  I have learned better sales skills due to this job.  The management, unfortunately did not really always do their job as a manager.  I dont know if it was just the department I was in or what but thats how I and a lot of others felt.  My co-workers were great and fun to work with.  There wasnt much of a hard part to this job besides convincing customers to spend more money with TWC.  The enjoyable part of this job is the commission checks if you get your sales right."
good,"Its a good place to work, lots of benefits, changes come too often, and its hard to advance unless your part of the ""in"" crowd. "
good,"n/a"
good,"I was hired for a position that was misleading in job description and expectations. My supervisor was very upbeat but clueless of the office politics.  I could have really progressed there had he a clue of the lead's bullying going on-  It impeded my entire team's mood and performance. Then flipped to micro-managing. I liked the job it was very customer service intensive. But, was part-time and I needed to work with grown ups who put customers first.  "
good,"Trained all new hires on product knowledge and sales.  Created a positive working environment by marinating an effective working relationship with co-workers from every department.  Planned, organized, directed and evaluated new programs for optimal performance.  Created a product and sales manual for employees to reference at a later date. Prepared clear and concise reports for upper management on implementing new programs. Developed a complete strategy for continued growth and success of each department.  Conducted on going product and sales training for all employees.  Organized meetings with upper and middle management. Inspired staff and others to stay motivated for optimal performance"
good,The company seems to be in a constant state of reorganization
good,Very good job besides being underpaid a bit. Other than compensation it was a very team orientated company with plenty of benefits.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,It great if you like being treated like a kid. If you like climbing 30 ft poles and being yelled at by customers this the job for you
good,"Time Warner was very stressfull, constant changes, which left workers and management confused at times because changes where instant at times and with the dept being so busy there was not enough time to get the new info across fully. Co workers were willing to learn the new steps but it started to be hard because they were going to other depts or leaving the company."
good,Assigned to retention department to persuade customers to not only keep existing service but to upgrade as well to services not presently had.
good,Co Worker in most cases fine. I learned Big Companies talk like they care but don't really. Hardest part of job was being assigned a job that I wasn't qualified for so I was unable to give customers the appropriate level of care
good,The job is ony what you make it. If you work hard it can be easy to promote within the company. The only thing I don't like is that there are office politics that can jeopardize your job if you aren't extremely careful.
good,"This is a company the measures every down to the second. Even a trip to the restroom is on your records. Demanding that all calls be resolved on the 1st call but in a 7 minute time frame. They are now requiring customer care to be sales, billing and repair. Only about 9 out of 20 make it thru training and then some of these agents are gone within 2 weeks. Different standards for corpoate employees such as sick day usage they give you sick time but you have to preschedule it corporate can use their sick time when needed. a very small percent must vote to make them a great place to work at"
good,It is a large company with the hope of advancement as it is nationwide.
good,It was a great experience to learn about the services and products of twc.
good,"Was a decent place to work, learned a lot about networking, and met good contacts."
good,"easy place to get along with and meet people.You can move up in the company if you so desire.The hardest part of the job is dealing with all types of weather from 100 degrees to minus 60 wind chills, rain sleet and snow, the work still needs to get done."
good,Time warner offered alot of great benefits and perks. I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,"TWC is a fast paced environment, a very noisy place that requires you to assist customers whether or not you can hear the customer over the phone. The customer service and sales representative (CSSR) performs a little bit of everyone’s job while not getting paid enough. The CSSR is required to upsell to customers even though a majority of them are not satisfied with their service. We must also process payments, troubleshoot equipment, retain the customer in any way possible, escalate issues and provide excellent customer service while getting cursed out, and in some cases, threatened by customers. The hardest part of the job is trying to upsell customers that are already fed up with the service. Some customers don't want to upgrade service simply because they've had numerous negative experiences with the technicians not showing up to installation/technical appointments. TWC has a reputation for changing company policy and procedure very often, us employees like to think of the acronym T-W-C as “Thing Will Change.” The biggest problem with TWC is that one department is not on the same page as the next department, there’s a lot of miscommunication which leads to inconsistent information being given to customers."
good,"Installing of cable services such as data, telephone and video. Climbing telephone poles, crawling into attics and under houses."
good,A typical day at work(very busy) but fun because we had very great manager and fund co-worker's.
good,Expect to work long hours
good,"The key to this job is to allign yourself with as many refferal partners as possible. You must get in with property managers, leasing agents, property management companies, realtors, and anyone else you can think of that has the potential to refer you business."
good,"lots of driving, cable plant needs serious work, jobs get added to route without any notification."
good,"As a supervisor, coached agents on daily productivity, handled escalated calls, monitored calls and provided feedback."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"A typical day is being on the phones for 8 hours providing technical support to customers, educating customers on fee & selling time warner cable products. I have met a lot of great people here that are like family now. The hardest part of the job dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part is when a customer is irate and angry and hangs up satisfied with my performance as well as the end result of the call."
good,Worked in Billing very fast paced . Customers cuss you out all day long. To keep the job can do nothing about it. High preasure to sale more important than getting the payments You are given a sales goal every month that you must meet. If you know you are not good at sales do not take the job
good,Management is good...
good,"A lot to be fixed , with scoring system on compensation and how they treat there customers"
good,"Assisted customers with basic trouble shooting for their cable,internet, and phone services"
good,"A typical day is door tagging, collections and/or disconnecting cable services. I have learned more social skills. My co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job is collecting money in this economy. The most enjoyable part of my day is meeting new friendly customers."
good,"typical day at work was that I would come in and sit at my station, log in and answer cable related calls, took billing payments, went over billing, trouble shooting. The co-workers were fun and easy to get along with, management not so much. The only fun part of the job was talking to the customers."
good,"Get in to work and dispatch give me my jobs. Contact the clients before going to the jobs, Drive to the job, complete the job, and/or answer any questions of the client. Job is completed and I go to the next job. I would have about 13 jobs a day. My day is completed."
good,"I have only been working in the ""customer service/sales"" part of this company for only 6 mo.s and looking to go to another job. Company focus too much on sales not enought on their customers."
good,This company believes in training their employees and supports their learning efforts.
good,This company was great as far as the training went but didn't have much else besides that. The 6 weeks of training wasn't too hard but did have two interviews you had to pass. The hours were good for training but once they put you into an actual schedule it was kind of ridiculous. You had to either wake up super early in the morning or work until around 7pm. I was basically paid to get yelled at by customers over the headset all day. I would work at this job for the training and nothing else because the managers are super strict about every call you have because they monitor them all. I knew I wasn't going to last long there and by the end of it I couldn't stand the job to be honest. But hey if call center work is what your looking for then its a great job. The pay was really nice but the managers expected you to try and sell a ton of stuff to make the company money. I ended up saving customers money and then got yelled at by my manager. I voluntarily quit because they wanted me to work from 10am to 7pm and I would rather further my education then get stuck at a call center job for the rest of my life. As a 21 year old it was pretty neat working there considering all the other employees are in there 30s-60s. One of the employees talked to me about WoW all the time and it was really cool chatting with him on breaks. If I wasn't continuing my education then I would say you will love it for a full time job but it does get really repetitive. The mornings were really hard for me since I am not a morning person. You also get paid for commission on sales which is nice but the training
good,"Too much stress and pressure and hostile environment, they have preference with top performers. Great pay and benefits, free cable , mileage.lot customer complaints"
good,"I only speak from a sales position experience but the earning potential at Spectrum is very good. The pressure to perform is a negative though as the metrics keep intensifying. But, if you work hard and focus you can very easily triple the starting salary with the commission structure in place."
good,"Company-provided training was inadequate to the reality. The job was exhausting,  draining,  soul-sucking.  The metrics were almost unreachable for anyone without Internet ISP service experience. After surviving a year there, the raise was 19 cents an hour - insulting! If you're a gamer and you know ISP workings, though, this would be a great gig.  Free internet."
good,Set on a solution that was complex and many flaws. Unwilling to listen our invest in other possible solutions. Unwilling to support a working from remote locations.
good,"Line-level work pays well, provides a set schedule, and are provided with fantastic benefits including free cable/internet services.  The best part of the job is that there are a lot of rewards for fun contests (sometimes free food) and the company has a lot of growth opportunities if you pursue higher education (especially in IT).  The worst part is that they are very strict in terms of both attendance and adherence which leads to mental exhaustion and poor work-life balance."
good,Call center environment.  Typically handle phone and internet repair issues. We handle phone issues related to no dial tone to international calling issues.  We also handle internet issues from cannot connect to slow internet speeds.  We also deal with email issues and Spectrum TV app issues.  The most enjoyable part is when you fix a customer's issue. High call volume and we handle calls from all over the United States.
good,Challenging work environment. Very stressful and did not allow for enough time away from work. Pays well but many hours are needed to fulfill all needed requirements for this job.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Feedback that was given was responded to directly, then responded very differently to management. Some whom had only been in the position for 3 months."
good,"Typical day at work - 60-70 calls per day - non-stop billing queues - multiple tasking required and knowledge of billing policies that are constantly changing, consulting with other departments including repair, and passive sales of products and services. "
good,"Great company benefits , health, 401 K and discounts . A typical day at work is very fast paced but rewarding. "
good,"I handled self-install customer care.  All the equipment.  closed work orders helped people set up their service.  help the customer register thier new modem.  Educated customer on how we fixed something, in case it happened again.  Went over their bill with them. gave credits where needed. not often. set up tech visits to fix our equipment so customer would have good service.  i took and avg. of 50 calls aday.  I kept a 96 percent and above voice of the customer, while I was with Spectrum."
good,"Nice place to work if you are starting out in the tech field, but do NOT stay here longterm. it will kill your career before it even begins. No advancement opportunities. They will ask you to do things you are NOT paid to do. no raises or bonuses at all EVER. extremely low tier workplace."
good,"Try your hardest to be amiable and play the game. Regardless of how well you do your job, the way to get ahead at Spectrum is browning your nose. I knew several coworkers that turned down positions because they didn't want to deal with mid and upper level management. But hey, that's probably most places in the corporate world"
good,"Scheduling appointments, for video, internet, voice, and mobile sales. Outbound, and inbound calls.   Follow up on leads, educated potential clients of our products."
good,Different Company Different Atmosphere. New Spectrum owned Charter is a different from old legacy Time Warner. I have learned that no matter what you have invested in a company when is bought out the new company unable to see it.
good,"The free cable and benefits were great! Not a whole lot of room for advancement, it's about who you know, not what you know. The building was nice and so are the quiet rooms."
good,The training was good initially; I learned alot more about modems and general IT; The initial management prior to becoming Spectrum was alot more understanding and work with you. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team comoradarie
good,"Spectrum is currently putting a lot of pressure on their customer service reps. They are expecting us to do the near impossible with call handling and managing. When there's a new policy or a policy that is changing, they either A. don't let us know what the change is or B. tell us what the change will be, train us, then delay the process/policy three-six months out. There's also a clause to where if you call off for personal/sick time, you then have to have a 15 minute meeting with your supervisor and they ask you as to why you called off. With some of the job tasks they want us to is mostly able to do without a problem, but then they're putting the pressure of metrics for handling said call's into place which is also something we as csr's cannot control."
good,High stressful job . Good pay and benefits . Just the environment and customers calling in angry alll the time . I would recommend working here if you are retired or a college student looking for work . Other than that it’s not so good of a job being in billing
good,"This job required a lot of physical work but the wages did not match the industry.  The pay was not up to par with living cost. One of the benefits was free cable/internet/phone service and a company vehicle, outside of that, there isnt much to speak highly of."
good,"Benefits are good"
good,Job requiring a lot of manual labor outdoors. Also requires customer relations as you are often the only person representing the company they will ever see.
good,"A typical day at Spectrum is getting yelled at by customer's because of ""horrible"" service, which is not the worst part of the job. They have a serenity room where you can relax and take a nap, and a game room with pool tables, ping pong, game consoles, basketball arcade games, and more. The environment when you first walk in seems amazing. After training when you're actually on the floor is when it gets a bit difficult. The job is easy, but you have to meet certain criteria to keep the job, like 10 minute calls, little to no hold time, etc. They are very strict on that and attendance and the managers are a bit mean and rude when it comes to assisting you with issues. It really depends how well you do in this environment, as some people are successful and others are not."
good,Customer demands are high especially heading into the end of the year. With many process improvements in place we are headed in the right direction but still set up to fail as an organization.
good,"Spectrum purchased previous company and terminated employees in waves. HR first, Management second, high grade field techs last. Could possibly be a good company to start with. Experience is everything in the IT field."
good,"Fast paced constant changing environment. Changes are daily. "
good,This company use to be a good company to work for. Advancement was almost guaranteed if you wanted. Now with the new management the will do everything to keep you from advancing and making good money.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,This job is just your everyday typical call center job.  It is what it is.  The training is long but decent for a call center job.  They do not cover everything during the training so you are left with improvising when you get to the floor.  When you first start out they are not flexible with your shift.  You are expected to be on time and leave at the start and end of your shift.   You can not easily request a shift change.  You have to place in a shift bid and even then there are no guarantees you will get that shift as it is based on performance.  Management was okay but they often placed unrealistic expectations on agents in an age where Cable TV is often considered obsolete.  The benefits in this job are pretty good for an entry level position but that's about it.  Not much room for career growth unless you are willing to move out of state.
good,"The best thing about the company are the benefits. The culture is great and overall a good solid job. If you are a field tech however be warned that you will be working long hours. I worked a 4/10 schedule however, due to lack of unorganized scheduling/routing, there were many days where I was working 12/13 hours. Moving up in the company is possible but it does feel as if the company will try to keep you in the same positions since they’re turn over rate is high."
good,"CONS: The training is poor.The team leads are lazy and do not want to handle escalations. No one, not even management follow company rules/polices. Depending on your team that is how you are taught the company rules/polices. The way they handle personal and sick time is ridiculous, and makes no sense. People who work there say that is the reason a lot of people leave. Spectrum definitely has a high turn around rate. They are always hiring. They say it’s a great place to work, they say they are innovative, and they make it fun and exciting. It is the exact opposite. It’s an outdated, dark, and smelly call center building. "
good,Customer Service billing. be on phones at all time with minimal downtime. training too short for amount of information you need to work proficiently. Upper management offers little to no support to assist employees. exceptionally high turn over in call center
good,"Not a fun place to work, all  workers have to have certain amount of points          in order to consider as a good worker. All job are not the same, sometimes some jobs takes all day to fix but the managers do not seems to understand the situations."
good,"The work environment in the call center is nice. You can easily make friends with coworkers however, management just sees you as a number. You have metrics to meet the expectation is to be at least 50% while 80% or better is exceeding expectation. Management will jump down your throat and badger you as to why you are not making 80%. There are minimal rewards to you actually doing good. The only thing they highlight is the fact that you are doing bad in some aspects."
good,"They do have very good benefits, match 6% of your 401k, free gold package services. The downside of working here, in the Billing Call center, is the fact customers call daily literally screaming and cussing at you over their bills. They will belittle and tear you down over something that was not even your decision (ex: cant afford their gold package yet refuse to downgrade to something more affordable). If a customer asks for a supervisor because they didn't pay their bill and want their services to work; you can get in trouble for too many sup calls. If your calls are too long from troubleshooting you can get in trouble for that as well. Stat requirements are always changing, along with company pricing for customers. It causes a very stressful environment and over time it becomes less pleasant to even go into work. Good pay but not worth the mental and emotional strain."
good,Good company to work for if you have the drive and discipline to be successful at sales. Like any other sales organization upper management only appreciates those who create revenue for the company. The culture here is no different in sales as any other organization!! It's all about the CASH!!!
good,"Call Center environment"
good,The job itself was fine. but the management team was not good. I went through 3 supervisors in a month due to the company firing and re hiring people.
good,Call center focused on maintaining customer satisfaction. Multiple tools used to effectively assist with analytical troubleshooting. Top notch customer service provided.
good,"Trainer and training were excellent! Always available to answer questions."
good,"Worked for Charter for several months.  They are a low paying firm that doesn't really appreciate the employee as a person.  You are just someone they have to have to make their money.  The wages are low. The work is dangerous.  It is very doubtful that anyone is meant to be hired young, and then retire from this place"
good,"It was an average place to work. The benefits were only available to full time employees, which was not told to me when i interview or applied. That was an unexpected suprise when working fro the company."
good,"I did the 10-7 and 3-12 shift, it was a typically fast-paced environment. I was there during the merger so a lot of change happened, unfortunately not for the better. It was great to learn how to multi-task at a quick pace. It was stressful and you were verbally abused by customers every day and management didn't care. You were not allowed to hang up. "
good,"Fast paced"
good,People are friendly and job is great.  Pay is kind of low and not much room for advancement.  Management is excellent and they listen to any problems you have on the job.
good,"Great place to work and great manager but low pay.  Love working for my manager, incredibly nice soul.  Pay is extremely low though and I am not able to pay the bills with the salary unfortunately,"
good,Overall good place to work with competitive wages and benefits. The cable business is constantly growing and changing. Therefore there is always new technology to learn.
good,Company has goals that are unattainable and the culture is not family friendly. They don’t accept dr. Notes or any other paperwork besides disability and have created a miserable work environment for the associates. Not to mention daily rumors and write ups.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Call centers just aren't good places to work; Spectrum was no different. There are very few problems you can actually solve for customers, that's why the job title was ""billing coordinator"" not ""customer service representative."" I finally had to leave because the stress was causing too many health problems and they weren't willing to make accomodations."
good,"Call center environment"
good,Job advancement is very difficult and our goals were set at an impossible percentage making a very stressful environment. When the company was Time Warner Cable our goals were high but attainable but once Spectrum took over the goals sky rocketed.
good,"A typical day at Spectrum involves a lot of inbound calls.  There is little time between calls, often you get a call as soon as the previous call ends.  The work is stressful.  You are getting calls from people whose services are not working, so sometimes they aren't pleasant.  You'll encounter folks that just don't know tech and it can be a struggle resolving their issues, sometimes you just aren't able to do it.  "
good,"Overall it is a call center job and it is easy to get burnt out. There is a high level of stress at times, especially if you work for the bilingual department taking English and Spanish calls, the majority will be in Spanish, probably about 80% of your calls will be in Spanish. Bilingual is held to the same standard as the English department but because of the customers that we get, the majority of the time they will be looking to spend the least amount possible which means only getting internet and at times that may be too expensive for them albeit Spectrum does usually offer more than 3 times the speed other providers do. That being said as long as you are comfortable pitching what is called a quad play now; TV, internet, home phone, and mobile services you will be okay. Keep in mind that most customers now just call in for internet and it is going to be your job to up sell them to a bundle package, simply selling internet is not enough. "
good,"Overall I was happy with my employment at spectrum, my co-workers were pleasant, it was a good clean professional environment. I was unhappy with how my employment ended, resulting in tenured employees losing their jobs due to company changing hands"
good,"I've been at spectrum 3 going on4 years. It's high stress for poor pay, measly raises annually, with little or no support from the company. The only god thing are the coworkers, benefits and free services.. which could change at any moment."
good,"My position was great, but they moved it out of state with no options to move.  All positions left available were demotions.  This office location was great under Time Warner, but under Spectrum/Charter the employees are more disposable.  "
good,The culture would depend based on your job title. Each department and pay grade resides on certain levels of the building. The work environment is different of each level.
good,highly stressful dealing with customers all day for things that didn't always work. Some will succeed but there is a lot of turnover and they are going through changes within the company. Large call center.
good,charter has to many rules. nice bonus checks but people cheat the system to win. Favortism occurs a lot here.  Can never plan a vacation do to a lottery.
good,"Good professional workplace. Decent pay. Overall not mentally demanding as physically, focus and detail demanding. So if you have a high school education, can follow instruction and physically able, You are pretty much golden."
good,"The management expects you to sale mobile even though it is not in the job description. It can be very stressful as we have to take 10 min at the most on every call and still try sell the customer internet cable, phone, and mobile aside from fixing their problems."
good,A typical at work would be retaining current customers and trying to gain new ones as well and also offer mobile. Great company to work for didn't have anything against anyone.
good,"Leader of technology responsible for consistent delivery and support of Product and Development teams across the company. Directed, motivated and transformed 30-person team from tactical to strategic vision to create repeatable success across 120+ projects."
good,"since the charter/ time warner merger this company has really taken a downhill slide in caring for it's employees.  Pay scale is all over the place, for instance I have the most time in grade and am the senior guy on my team yet I make less than the rest of my team."
good,Since Charter bought TWC it has not been the same place to work. It seems TWC management has taken over and re implementing policies that did not work the first time.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"This is an extremely fast paced job and the hours are horrible for family life. The job itself isn't bad and is fairly easy. It the shifts, hours and lack of support that make this job frustrating."
good,"This company is a good balance company with a great benefit package, and paid time off.  I would recommend this job if you have a desire to work in the cable industry."
good,Started out as Time Warner and it was a GREAT place to work but when Spectrum  took over it went downhill fast!! Money got smaller and demand got larger. Management started fleeing and we lost half the department in half a year. Spectrum ruined Time Warner
good,"Good benefits and onboarding training, okay pay, nice volunteer focus at this site. Set schedule and no job uniform. Needs more positivity and professionalism. Management is inconsistent and not focused on company missions. Difficult job on calls with abusive callers and aren't able to defend yourself or hang up, and if you escalate to a supervisor it hits your personal scorecard and metrics. Lot of drama and gossip, hard to stay healthy with employees working together in close quarters and no permanent seating. No free services because there is no service in our area."
good,"Spectrum has great products and is willing to move forward with new products  that will complement existing products.  The days are average in workload and the work is very standard fare for the telco/cable industry.  The co-workers are polite, efficient without office hostility.  The most challenging part of the company is the unwillingness of leadership to listen to middle management on how to improve the overall business and break the traditional methods.  It is a C level top down management approach where even the senior level is following ""orders"" from the C -Suite.  The zero tolerance policy of working from home even if it is one day a month is extremely restrictive."
good,Too many administrative duties assigned to supervisors which doesn't allow for field support for technicians. Techs are overworked daily in order to obtain unrealistic productivity goal and quality assurance goals.
good,"Hourly pay is kinda low but you can make up for it by making so much in commission. The way they do schedules is dumb you have to bid and if you can't work what you get then oh well, but they are always hiring. Both my supervisors I had we're very unprofessional and didn't help me. Training was horrible got thrown into a 10 week pilot program."
good,"Two words: Cable-cutting; If you want to enter an industry at the beginning of the end of its' journey, this is your company. Management and people are great, but it doesn't matter if the market is not open to your advertising solutions."
good,"diverse , but pay was too low for requirements .. benefits was okay .. no parking and restrooms were always nasty ( the womens )the people in authority were cool .. managers .. tl .."
good,working at spectrum i got constantly yelled at and verbally screamed at by many f the customers regarding their bill and any other issues they had with their spectrum services. Never could show the customer any type of emotion except empathy for what they were going through. It definetly is a job that takes a toll on you mental stability at times. It challenges you to be out of your comfort zone on a daily basis. You deal with people from many different backgrounds....its not something they can teach you in training...you just have to handle it once you get on the floor.
good,Answering phones and telecommunication with customers.  Give all information customers need.  Management was okay.  Didn't have time to interact with co-workers.
good,My manager was great.  Did not micromanage and helped with all issues.  Once Brighthouse Networks was bought out and Spectrum took over we all lost our positions.  Nice severance package.
good,"Each day started with checking in with my supervisor. After going over the targets and quota needed, I would return to my desk and check emails. I usually would get to work about twenty minutes early so I'd be able to prepare myself for some of the calls that would come in. Once prepared, I'd take call after call until the end of my shift. They were inbound calls so people would have a problem with their service. I would do my best to fix their service and let them know about some of the new promotions we would receive. With each call there would be an opportunity to sell a new product. We would be accountable for upgrading their services and that would count as a new ""psu"". At the end of the day I would meet with my supervisor and go over how the day went."
good,"team effort is highly encourage, but like in all companies some do and some barely do. your experience depend on the supervisor you are assigned. I was lucky the get one that is supportive and promotes growth."
good,Decent job with reasonable security. Stressful job with crazy expectations for stats. Management tends to not be very flexible and getting promoted is pretty much a death sentence.
good,The culture is good. Open to feedback and weekly meetings are held. Teams can sometimes be large. Not a lot of team building but performance is recognized.
good,"they didn't have anything that needed on time. clothes,phones, tablet, etc.i had to buy own clothes & never got the the back for that! like now im fighting for my gas check! the people& atmosphere was awesome but many broken promises."
good,"spetrum is too large for what it wants to accomplish, to many levels of management  that are more con cerned with meetings than selling what customers actually want"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"A customer service job, but sales are expected to meet 100% of goal.                 this is not a customer service job. Sales are priority one. Customer service doesn't matter. ONLY SALES !!!!"
good,"Great opportunities for advancement, Great salary and benefits.  Many learning opportunities, Very poor culture, blame culture.  Company is changing WAY too fast and most are left behind."
good,The benefits of services is great but this was the least professional workplace that I have ever worked in. Micromanagement from supervisors.Supervisors were constantly inappropriate.
good,"Excellent experience gained at this job, training was wonderful. As with any company, there are procedures you don't always agree with, but everything went pretty smoothly."
good,Performed Bookkeeping duties and discussed with Management any concerns with daily transactions. Busy environment with a need for a support staff.  Learned about international sales.  Enjoyed being able to do my job without a lot of supervision.
good,"Mandatory overtime with no advance notice.  Environment in call center is somewhat unprofessional. Free cable, internet and phone.     Lots of room of advancement if they like you."
good,"I didnt like the job. It's hard talking to irate customers for 8 hours a day. Customer's are always upset, yelling, and using profanity. There is not much else to say."
good,"Charter is a very structured corporate environment. This position includes payment processing, payment balancing. Dual control, inventory control, ordering supplies quarterly.  Majorly focused on sales and goal expectations. This position provides many benefits and paid off, holiday pay, and sick time off."
good,They where very helpful finding me a job but unfortunately the place i was stationed had very poor management over work there workers while the mangers favorite's stand around watching you. not the type  of environment i wanted to be in
good,Took over Brighthouse and still haven't figured it out. Employees aren't happy. Over working employees. Wasted company money on a fail to recognize same training standards from previous Charter footprint.
good,"In the billing call center, you can expect to work 40 hours weekly at a rate above minimum wage. They are open every day. OT becomes available at first come, first served basis. Holiday hours are volunteers and then mandatory random selection. It is back to back calls from morning until evening unless there's a Pay Per View or political event on. Working major holidays are extremely slow but you get holiday pay. There is quite a gap between the phone time expectations per call and schedule adherence vs the real world. Technical issues and billing questions take more time than what they want their employees to spend on the call and if you're on a call that goes into your break, you're also out of schedule adherence. The majority of calls are billing complaints and the employees are regularly verbally abused by customers so it takes a thick skin to provide empathy throughout the call."
good,Good company to work for but even better before Time warner and Charter become one. Overall the company has worked with me with my school schedule and willing to pay for education but not much room to grow with in the company.
good,"this is a heavy sales oriented job, always a hustle and grind. You have to be a people person and great customer services and selling skill to thrive in this field."
good,The morality is down and everyone is being put on action plans and the language of the document means that you can be fired for not meeting goals and this is also for  newly fresh people out of training classes as well as those whose been out of training for months. Lot of management changes and structure changes.  It's a stepping stone  but the commission structure and incentives payout really has changed and it's not good at all.
good,Culture has changed since Time Warner was bought out.  I have learned a tremendous amount of info in regards to Telecommunications. When Charter bought Time Warner it continues to change.
good,"out of all of the call centers i have worked for i enjoyed spectrum the most, they had great pay, benefits and other great things like paid time off and sick days, which were all accruing over time, there is advancement opportunities and if this sort of job is for you, this is a great career location, I actually tried to go back, but was unsuccessful.  The only downside was i never really had a set manager or supervisor, i have moved 5 times in my 6 months, and that is with a month and a half training."
good,Spectrum is overall a good company to work for.  Number of meetings and work life balance could use a lot of improvement.  Removing the telecommuting aspect was not well received and centralizing departments that had been decentralized for 20 years caused a huge loss of knowledge and experience
good,So my experience with Spectrum was when my company was acquired by them.  As always they came in and got rid of a lot of employees.  Eventually they then started changing our compensation.  Along with having us train our replacements.  It was typical business however left a bad taste in my mouth.  I'm sure if you are a Spectrum employee from the start it is better.  However my experience was losing benefits along with losing money.  For the type of work I was doing it was not worth it.
good,"Prior to take over by Spectrum, Time Warner Cable was less stressful, but still very fast-paced atmosphere. Spectrum disbanded many programs TWC had in place, and re-structured for the worse."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Friendly environment. You used a lot of customer service skills in your position. The company prepared you for your position. Great training. Great environment.
good,Working for Time Warner Cable which is now known as Spectrum was a bitter sweet experience. The call center environment was nice because of the people that I worked with but sometimes it was a little demanding. I enjoyed the time spent with Time Warner Cable (Spectrum).
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was flexibility, and getting to know my customers as well as getting them the products that they want at a fair price."
good,"Hardest part of the job is lack of support and job load. "
good,"Very competitive market, cut back on commissions and dropped base pay. Micro- management, worked various hours nights, weekends and holidays. But they do offer discount on your cable tv"
good,Friendly People with known expectations. Job would vary day to day. Changes often. Very knowledgeable management. Some areas could use some improvement.
good,"The commission structure breeds shady employees who aren't good at sales. Rather, good enough to play a numbers game and hang up or avoid actual sales or customer service related work to only their own benefit. Leaving disgruntled employees and customers who are extremely upset."
good,"needs better pay and better schedules, training was great it was paid and the trainers gave you enough time to to learn what you need to know about the job."
good,"At the time of my employment, the pay rate was typical for the specific niche industry but way below equivalent positions at other companies in the area."
good,I work in an office environment with our Enterprise Business sales and Media Sales teams.  It is pretty casual and a good environment to work in.  I typically work 8 - 10 hours per day and report and analyze performance data for the Spectrum Stores nationwide.
good,"Its an okay job. Decent pay, hours are not the best, and you have to work weekends In most positions. You get free cable and internet, but its a very stressful job most of the time."
good,"A typical day involves taking calls from customers to schedule business orders, working with Account Executives to enter their business orders. "
good,"Policies and procedure were constantly changing. The company has consistent personnel turnover. The Pay and benefits are above average, but company morale among employees is low."
good,"Athough Time Warner Cable had its issues, the work environment made you feel comfortable enough to want to do more.  Now that it has changed to Spectrum,the entire business structure has been revamped, technology scaled back, compensation cut and goals unattainable which has completely brought the employee morale down. Not to mention customer complaints have gotten 10 times worse due to lack of customer service."
good,"Overall, an okay company to work for with great benefits, okay pay, advancement opportunities, and regular overtime opportunities for people who want to put in the extra time."
good,"When I worked there it was TWC. Takes a few tries to transfer to a department or go after an elevated position. Making friends helps with this. The calls we would take were pretty cut and dry. Back to back phone calls can wear on you but if one was up for it, they could enjoy the job."
good,"They have good training facilities, and trainers to get you in the field and teach you about safety and quality service, I have worked for Spectrum since they were Time Warner and they have come a long way,"
good,"Spectrum offers superior products and services but, unfortunately doesn't understand what is needed to support the sales of those products."
good,"The working atmosphere was fun in most instances, there were times when it became stressful especially at the end of the month with attempting to make sure that the sales were high enough to receive a good commission check. It was a little difficult working on commission due to the unpredictable pay checks, sometimes it can be high and sometimes it can be low."
good,No room for advancement since transitioning over from Time Warner.  Many of the Time Warner employees have moved on to find other opportunities.  There have been much downsizing.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"The company offers great benefits and decent pay. Things are constantly changing, which can be both good and bad. The management in the warehouse is absolutely terrible. The head manager is a tyrant and everything has to be done her way. Other managers are indecisive and bipolar, which makes everyday complicated."
good,Management changes constantly. sometimes favorites are played. Management does lack responsiveness at time. Supervisors are just pets to higher level people.
good,Spectrum is a great place to work. Keep your head focused and you will succeed.
good,"I have learned to take on and adapt to extra tasks and responsibilities that have been unforeseen while continuing to effectively maintain my daily tasks. "
good,I enjoyed working there before it became Spectrum. When it became Spectrum it became cut throat.Before it became Spectrum we did things for the community and got monthly bounuses they removed that when they took over.
good,"fast paced environment, with sales goals, competitive, a typical day includes interacting with several different people, processing equipment returns, billing questions"
good,I enjoy the experience working at time warner cable. i learned a lot from experience and knowledge workers. My location in brooklyn is were battle many obstacles as far running cable wire over the roof or building.
good,The job pays fairly well with the industry and it does include benefits which is always a plus. Charter does promote within and provides ample amount of training and support.
good,A decent place work but only there for 2 months. In that time the work conditions and environment were adequate. Not enough time on the job to recommend it to anyone.
good,"Was an awesome, relaxed place to work at first.  Then upper management wanted to make us ""more productive"".  It didn't work, they failed and sales fell 50%.  They made people stressed out for nothing.  When people who have been there 15+ years start quitting you know something is wrong."
good,"I have already mentioned my thoughts on Spectrum by selecting the different options. The company is healthy and offers good compensation, as well as benefits. The environment is fast paced and very stressful."
good,Good work environment. The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexibility that i'm allowed while working. The management is very nice and understanding.
good,"Great opportunity if you can deal with constant change, lack of leadership communication, and common sense decisions. Compensation and benefits can be top notch."
good,"Learned about the cable, internet & telephony world....How to use Ip's, static vs dynamic, signal etc"
good,"As a contractor, you are not treated with respect and work/life balance does not exist.  Even when family is ill or requires major surgery, you will not be paid as there is 0 work from home tolerance.  Additionally, management is only concerned about bettering their personal career.  This means (as a contractor), you will be looked down upon and treated poorly."
good,The company was originally very fast paced and fun. You felt you had purpose. The corporate atmosphere now is you are filling a seat. You aren't given a lot of ownership of your job.
good,I enjoyed some of my time there and some of the people that  I worked with the job itself is not bad it can be demanding butt the management leaves something to be desired
good,very high pace work environment. Lack of managerial communication with employees which causes a more stressful work environment. Aside from the actual job benefits and pay were good.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Very stressful work environment since merger.  There are many more silo's in the organization than there was prior to merger and it makes it incredibly difficult to serve our customers, install them in a timely manner, service them after the sales,  and keep their trust."
good,Not enough training. Lack of communication with the workers. Leadership is not on one accord. Not Inspired Enough. Not inspired to grow. Job Threat job
good,"Charter taking the reins have changed things quite a bit, from TWC's borderline trendy startup vibe, to oppressive score metric systems and stuffy upper management. Team supervisors tend to be level-headed, very friendly and helpful. They are slowly getting replaced by legacy Charter employees, however."
good,"First, as a contractor the pay rate was fair, but the length of the term was changed. Originally, it was supposed to be three months to hire, then it was changed to six months, then another six months, then I was laid off due to budgeting. But, I suspect the lack of budget was primarily due to poor management."
good,"Typical days are very busy, we learn new approaches to problems technically every day. My manager is a very fare with all his employees, the company culture is very fare. The hardest part of the job is sometimes getting access to equipment due to construction site. The most enjoyable part of the job is the group of individuals that I interact within the company as well as in the field."
good,This is a great place to work if you are able to separate from your personal life. There is a lot of gossip throughout the center. Compensation is more than sufficient and is based off your own performance.
good,"Fast paced work environment"
good,Depends on the position one holds.  Some business units are exceptional while others are terribly inefficient and frustrating.  It's a Fortune 100 company but runs like a momo and pop shop.
good,"A typical day at work will be getting either installs or trouble calls if your a tech 2 or higher. I learned how to install their equipment which is mostly refurbished. I do like that I'm out on my own in the field but I don't thing the pay per hour is where it should be for this type of work. You can work in hot attics or even in tight dirty crawl spaces under houses. Many customers will complain about their equipment failing which is not my fault and it will give me repeats which will prevent me from reaching the bonus for the month. They have a high turnover rate and I think it's because the pay is way too low for the level of difficulty the job is. I wanted to get into the industry because I figured it's a secure job with how big the internet is now. With that being said, a lot of people are streaming their video services now. I've had several jobs where people complain about internet speeds when there's nothing wrong with their equipment. Bottom line is, the job is not very rewarding. I've been top five in production for several months yet I'm getting paid like I'm flipping burgers."
good,work is heavy and hard on your body . no real advancement opportunities and management is weak.  hard work but not very mind stimulating. some of the shipping and receiving is done outside in all types of weather.
good,"Typical day is between 10-12 hours of work, depending on situational jobs."
good,I hated the job because the inconsistency of rules. The R3 process is so stupid that I literally made customers happy but always failed. Which led me to be terminated but I stayed all the way through because I made decent money.
good,"Spectrum was a good position for an agent as they are supported and treated well. Management is mostly hands off, and 2 of the 3 Managers are exceedingly nice to their employees. It's a fast paced job with continual calls and an ever changing atmosphere."
good,its a call center job... so regular multitasking and customer service skills required..... free services if you live in the area they provide service is the best part... the pay is decent
good,I worked for Time Warner Cable and enjoyed my job with territory sales. I knew the pay structure and the requirements. It was stressful at times because sales would increase.
good,There needs to be more support to the agents that are handling calls daily. I feel that no one should have to be disrespected in order to get a job done. There is no amount of money worth being mistreated for.
good,"Very competitive, low supervision, high expectations, low salaries. Must have thick skin in dealing with the public. Long work hours and all elements of weather."
good,"To low  pay for the stress, you have to deal with all kind of customers and the pay is minimum. It pays bills, but if you have another option, take it."
good,I have been with Charter Spectrum a little over a year since the conversion from Time Warner. The new hierarchy places very little emphasis on quality of life for the employee and is purely profit driven.  The job is very physically demanding and requires a high degree of technical and mathematical skills yet is incredibly underpaid for these skills. Teamwork from within each team is very good but overall the communications giant is very poor at communicating.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Spectrum bought Brighthouse Networks changing the nature of the business from a company that cares for its customers and employees to one that is more concern about stockholders and money.  The positions changed, people with skills were no longer needed. It is time to find another company to grow within."
good,"I was so excited to be working for Spectrum, and then slowly realized that the culture that the company tries to convey is a farce."
good,"i like working for spectrum but am looking for more growth. pros, the atmosphere among my co workers is great and benefits help provide my family and i great security if we ever need anything. cons/ stagnent pay scale once youve reached highest level as technician and do not want to be in a different department."
good,"Although this position has taught me a lot throughout my career in sales, I see no room for advancement within the company. Compensation has recently negatively changed and the amount of work has increased. The work hours have been difficult to manage a routine lifestyle."
good,not the most transgender friendly place to work. they gave me issues at the van nuys call center ..........................................................
good,"Spectrum-Charter Communications, whatever you'd like to call it, was simply mismanaged from the top.  For instance, lots of Cablevision execs were hired after the TWC merger-takeover, and if the top at hand didn't match or come from the Cablevision 'playbook', it wasn't getting done or supported.  Lots of fine and extremely talented TWC folks have departed or in the process of departing; very sad days.  I wish them luck, but that probably won't help."
good,"Overall, the job with Spectrum was not much different than working for TWC after the acquisition.  The major drawback would be the stability of employment with so many employees being laid off in Lexington, KY offices."
good,"At Charter, the store work environment is stressful, but fun.  There are aggressive sales goals that must be met each month, but the commission is very good.  The people are the best part of the company!"
good,"Not bad. Not great. Somewhere in between. Benefits are alright. Pay is alright. Management varies. Some areas it's great. Others it is not. Overall, it is a good place."
good,It was good money and decent just not a home feeling work place. I could be a future for some.  I just strive for better.  Didnt like the commute is the only reason I left.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the years it spent as Time Warner.Workplace culture has been deflated. High pressure micro managing ran Top Sales executives away.
good,The the demands that spectrum puts on the employees don't match up to the pay. Spectrum is moving backwards from where TWC had the company. Dos have great room for advancement! they promote from within.
good,"It is very unorganized and if they see you can do more work than everyone else , they stack that on top of your regular duties as well and do not compensate you for it."
good,"I worked there when it was Time Warner Cable and it was the most stressful job you could have.  They want you to fix peoples problems and up sale on every call.  They also expected you to be on the phone tops 10 minutes; however sometimes that is impossible to achieve when helping with problems.  Not everyone is as hardware familiar as others.  Some are even afraid to touch a plug. Then you get elderly people who require a bit more attention."
good,"The turnover rate was extremely high. New hires would usually stay no more than 3 months, only due to a high bonus for the first 3 months of employment. Salary pay was very nice to have along with commissions, but management constantly harassed employees to work on holidays and weekends. Goals were never met and were unrealistic."
good,The management that fosters your day to day interactions and happiness isn't the best. They do hire various personalities which is good to learn how to work with numerous types of people.
good,I can now sell things of the back and give customers a sense of being able to have a voice in a big company like Spectrum. Taught me to have that tough skin and not to be upset when an Irate customer comes on the phone.
good,The company was great before merging to become Spectrum. Management was great until this happened. There were a lot of changes made and now people are constantly leaving due to the low pay with empty promises of potential to make more. I wouldn't recommend working here.
good,Lots of opportunities but lack of cohesion across senior management and no accountability when issues arose. Constantly working under pressure to deliver services promised by the CIO without performing due diligence on the requirements for achieving success.
good,"The merger hasn't been the best, for hourly or salaried employees. Lots of lay offs. Pay not on par with industry, insurance is super expensive, angry customers who you have to allow to be rude and curse without hanging up. Calls back to back."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Typical big company. You are just a number. The execs do not care about you. It's all about their profit margins and how to make their profits bigger."
good,"Losing more and more customers everyday by increasing rates without notice and no elderly discounts. We used to put our customers first, but not anymore. Such a disappointment."
good,"As a Customer Service Rep, their was high demand to upsell customers that called in to renegotiate their bill. If you didn't upsell you would get a low rating from QA which affects your employment"
good,"Great pay, and direct management is very supportive. However higher management seems to not value it's employees the way several of my previous employers have. ."
good,Poor communication. Insane quota requirements. Fine pay. The constant rotation of schedules was difficult to work with. You weren't allowed to change departments in in-bound sales.
good,"Good company to work for"
good,"Its an okay place to work, many changes, good cable discounts. Love helping the elderly customers. Wish they will offer better rates for their current customers. Changes every week or so."
good,"Great opportunity to enhance my overall financial position. Meet with C Class executives to present products and services. "
good,"The commission structure is very uninspiring, the level of communication to employees needs to improve a lot. The employee medical and dental benefits are excellent."
good,"Work life balance is off, as is the case in most sales cultures. Pay and benefits are off the charts amazing, if you are willing to commit everything you have to it."
good,Changes are happening and it makes it difficult to explain to customers. Our call center was converted to billing only and hearing customers gripe all day is challenging.
good,"Very stressful environment right now.  lots of lay offs and mass confusion over future."
good,"A typical day was to sign in into the system. Then, start taking calls to support all the customer's problems across the East side of the country.Sometimes, the network was so slow to communicate via VPN. Here every day was different. A problem will not be the same."
good,The position this is referring to is a very proprietary role geared to the cable industry.  There still is a fair amount of IT related tasks that would lend the employee to expand their skill set.
good,"Managers were friendly and encouraging, and the opportunities for advancement were numerous. Pay could have been better for the amount of work, but all in all it was a decent place to work."
good,The commission structure and earning opportunities are very good. Starting pay is also very good. Far too much micromanaging and over reaching policies will have you leaving sooner than you thought.
good,"I only stayed on for several months. More of a transitional position me. Days were long. Typically 12 hours. Position was lower than my skills and experience. Management, at the time, felt more like it was just get it done and grow customers; although there were times of ensuring quality. I don't really have an opinion on the workplace culture except that the other technicians were great to work with. Hardest part of the job was working at customers homes and seeing how people live. They ranged from pleasant and enjoyable to disgusting and horrifying. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,there is not typical workday at this job. You get whatever assingment that comes to you. Management is only concerned about number not really employlees.
good,"this is my first job, great place to start off and even grow with. the only cons are having tour performance based on an angry customers interaction with you"
good,good money but an overall stressful place to work. schedule wasn't bad and hours aren't to late just frustrating having to take 80 phone calls a day back to back from rude customers
good,"Love the people I work with, benefits are excellent,heavy call volume with angry customer all the time the company cares more about themselves and not about the employees. In order to move up within thecompanyto have to know someone be well liked or be a family member of some one up in the ranks"
good,"We would video High School football, basketball, and soccer, then have them play back on the local channel. I would run either sideline camera or top side camera"
good,"A lot of exciting options but too much process and no flexibility. Good people, bad leadership."
good,Nice work flow.Steady paist to keep time moving.Job is very easy so not too much to learn just be prepared to work.Reasonable break time.Gone need gloves for breaking down boxes sleeves also to avoid paper cuts.
good,"The good things about this company are the benefits and the people you work with.  All you immediate superiors up to the call center director are nice friendly and always willing to help.  Pay is competitive for the position in the region, and some of the best health and personal benefits I have ever had.  "
good,Time warner cable has merged with Charter and become Spectrum. Things change daily. It's difficult to build loyalty with customers because you can guarantee a price that may change beyond you power
good,decent company younger co worker. good pay. but got to be able to adapt to change. I would defintley consider working with this company. great bonus and benifits
good,I stand in one spot all day. I greet customers and check them into our system so that the representatives know who the customer is and the reason behind their visit.
good,"Great company to work for, the people on the other hand are petty and they hate military service members. Lots of sad little people here that would only have fun ruining people's lives."
good,"We've only been Spectrum for a couple of months, so it's difficult to give a solid opinion. Everyone is very nice and professional.  The hardest part of the job is finding new customers on a month to month basis..."
good,"A fast-paced environment that is highly competitive, supervisors and management consistently working with sales reps to help them reach sales goals. Is a great environment if you're highly driving and competitive with yourself and others, and have previously succeeded in call centers or on commission-based salaries."
good,"All depends where you worked, and with who. did different jobs daily or weekly.some work was very heavy, orther jobs I really enjoyed. and very easy."
good,There is new leadership in place and it is very unorganized. They change things so fast that the company cant keep up.  They changed the compensation plane without any noticed and they pretty much cut my check in half.
good,"Was a great place to work, for the short time I was there."
good,Work there because you WANT to work there that's all I have too say. Just enjoy their benefits it won't be there for long trust me when I say that.
good,While in the midst of receiving back to back calls you are scored on calls which greatly impacts the rate at which you move up through the company. However the points to hit are very much to no ones understanding even management. Calling back customers etc trying to provide optimal support to them is a hit to your scorecard.
good,I would take phone calls and help customers with trouble shooting their internet connections.  I would also work on lowering their bill if they asked.  We were told we needed to up-sale them even if they couldn't afford it.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I don't really have anything great to say. The compensation is constantly changing but I am last to know.  I've been with the company 11 years and the only thing that is constant, if it effects you and your ability to your job, you'll be last to know."
good,"Most rewarding job financially. Management is almost always gone and never present to assist with issues. Efficiency and self starter attitude is must in order to succeed. Very little training on sales development, lots of training on products."
good,An okay job. Environment can be fast paced and stressful. Strict work hours leave little time to take care for outside life. Management can be misinformed.
good,worked in the collections dept before they closed down. great job for students. its is commission based so if you don't work well in the environment this isn't for you.
good,"flexible hours, good work culture"
good,"Overall I'd say it is a good place to work. There are great benefits (free TV internet and phone services) but there is very little room for creativity or thinking outside the box. You go to work, sit in your grey cubicle, and wait until its time to go home. I wouldn't say anyone is ""mean"" but all management cares about is moving themselves up in the company. It takes a lot to move out of the bottom of the corporate food chain."
good,"Very great work staff"
good,I started off as an Insight employee and I enjoyed working for them and the team work environment. Time Warner was a different world and had a very different outlook for the work environment.
good,TWC has great benefits but the job itself is simple but dealing with management can make it very stressful. Some of the upper management are VERY rude.
good,Good for entry level position you must be self motivated to advance . Management not the best  .Hardest part of the job is the mismanagement .
good,"The atmosphere depends on the department. Some can be great  and some can  be quite unbearable. I spent my time  in the call center and it was unpleasant. It was numbers driven and not conducive to a happy place. The ambulance has  made more than one trip to that  location.  The company's got a new face , Spectrum. so maybe  it has gotten better."
good,"good for a quick job if you can handle the stress of callers swearing at you constantly, otherwise this job is not for you. The HR team doesn't know what their doing either"
good,"During my typical workday, I am responsible for overseeing my own sales bucket .  I keep in touch with clients, update them on our progress and make sure they are satisfied with the promotional materials."
good,"Charter offers an excellent benefit package and free services. "
good,In the telecommunications world your environment is always changing. It's an exciting culture and great experience. However the demand required in the technical operations department is a little excessive in my opinion.  Most people end up working well past their scheduled hours daily and at least 1 day off weekly. So this is not a job for anyone with a family.
good,"My day started with checking out what my day was, if I was going to travel to Appleton Wisconsin, to train, mentor, coach or speak with classes or customer service agents. If not I will go into our system to  check their progress by auditing their calls and making sure they are progressing. "
good,Best for youth who want to stay in one place. Wages are very low for field technican. Not a environment for growth. Anyone apply can gain some knowledge of IT.
good,"needs to focus on core business, too many products in already very competitive areas. benefits package is outstanding though."
good,On a typical day I provided tech support to customers and techs in the field as well as customer service and account information.  During my time there I really learned how to deal with difficult customers and situations due to the nature and atmosphere of the job.  In my opinion the management definitely left something to be desired......they were either micro-managing unnecessarily or unable to manage or provide answers to questions to the people that were on their team.  I didn't have any problems with the co-workers. The hardest or should I say the most frustrating part of the job to me was achieving the advancement that I was looking for.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to share the knowledge and experience that I'd gained during my tenure with the company to assist co-workers and customers in resolving their technical and account issues.
good,"This is good place to work it you have no specialized skills and don't mind poor management.  There is very little in incentives and positive recognition but above average pay , free cable and internet make up for most of the cons."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,company is not stable enough for me. As a contractor I work long hours. have unstable pay. worked out in hot and cold conditions. It wasn't unitl I became a QC/ troubleshoot tech that this job became tolerable.
good,Time Warner Cable does a great job supplying customer needs and robust network infrastructure for their clients. They treat their employees great and with exceptional benefits.
good,Charter could value their employees more by changing some of the outdated policies and procedures used to gauge performance by the sales representative.  They have a very high turnover because criteria and metrics used to gauge performance is archaic.
good,"Call Center Environment.  Aux Times are managed very tightly.  come in and you call, or receive calls.  co workers very helpful.  supervisors, some better than others.  management hides in their offices."
good,"Inbound sales of cable internet and phone for new and existing customers. Sell to new people, try and upgrade for existing."
good,"Fantastic benefits and compensation. Commissions are great along with what they give you. It is just not enough to deal with the Verbal abuse from customers everyday. I loved my co-workers, and management clearly never sold a day in there lives at TWC. The expectation of how much you should be selling was a little on the unrealistic side."
good,"It's a ok place to work, wages are a little under compared to other companies. It's the only place I know that you can go from entry level to a decent position in 6 mos."
good,"Focus on quotas and numbers. Minimal pay for stressful, dangerous and demanding job. Great benefits and decent people. Advancement requires courses that you must take on your own time, that are like going to school in the evening equating to minimal monetary benefit."
good,in office on phones most of the 8 hour shift helping customers with repair issues mistly internet based. very mundane after a few hours and could get boring if it was a slow night
good,"Simply put, this is a great place to make fast money. However, the job security and leadership is questionable. I had 3 different managers in five years plus the quotas increased while territories decreased. If you are in it to make money and your goal is to move on to bigger and better things Time Warner business will give you a great crash course in B2B"
good,"I learned a lot about the telecom world.  To include Fiber, Ethernet, Dark fiber, HSD, PRI, WIFI and Hospitality services.  A good place to work to further your career.  The internal customers work well together and have a great teamwork environment."
good,"billing representative, escalations, personal accounts, discounts, set new accounts up for new customers. Hardest part of the job was when customers are so escalated, they call names and belittle the rep they are speaking to. Only met with your supervisor once a week to see how you are doing and how your calls are going."
good,Training is the fundamentals and the rest is learned on the job.  If you're not a quick learner. it will be very tough for a while.  Good compensation opportunity.
good,"Time Warner Cable, is a great company with excellent benefits, but with very little advancement opportunities, co-workers were very helpful, and courteous hardest part of the job is working fast and efficient, most enjoyable part of the job is realizing you have a job in the first place"
good,"A typical work day is never the same. Every day is a new experience"
good,Great product offering and excellent compensation. Door to door sales in specified territories often excluded sales that were available from other areas. Company does not deviate from their appointed parameters no matter what. This was cause for lots of lost sales or sales that you did not get paid for.
good,"answering customer calls regarding their services, billing, or equipment troubleshooting. answering a large call volume"
good,"This is a place where you can excel in assisting phone customers with tech support needs. Many are appreciative but there are a few who will never be happy with the support you give."
good,"My day would consist of answering the incoming calls for the video repair department, And work with the customer to get there cable tv back to working order."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"The supervisors and most of management were great. Working in the sales department became a ""catch all"" for all callers calling in to downgrade, disconnect or fix a technical problem. I assume this was to allow the more highly trained department another chance at increasing monthly revenue for the company, while lowering the amount of commission the company would have to pay out for each agent. Ethics are enforced only when an ethical misstep is not making the company profit. To succeed in this company, you must play ball and stick to ""the process"". The company will from time to time provide great incentives for sales metrics and I believe does distribute the prizes fairly to all deserving employees. This job is very much ""all about the numbers"" and if you are not able to keep up with the constantly changing goals, processes, rules and sales focus', you are quickly escorted out the door. Overall, this is a company that is often attempting to reinvent themselves and can and will change direction on a monthly and sometimes even weekly basis. As a result, employees suffer due to there being such an amount of consistent change. Also, keep in mind that if you take up sales in this company, there have been multiple lawsuits against them for attempting to underpay sales associates. You must always keep track of your own numbers on your own time because they will almost always be incorrect when it comes time for them to pay you, sales metrics and commission structure is regularly changing so pay attention and also, the time it takes you to log into your computer and pull up all programs"
good,"Welcome to pretty much free cable, internet, and phone.  Paid sick time and holiday pay.  Plenty of OT to take advantage of.  Employee Evaluations every year that have some kind of raise. These are about the only pros."
good,The job itself was easy and you make decent money.  Management didn't seem to know very much and told you one thing and when you did it someone else would tell you it was wrong.
good,"typical day of work would be taking calls in regards to customer not agreeing with the increase of their bills, while most knew they were on a 12 month promo. No one wanted to pay more than they were paying before. I learned that all cable companies have promos that that even thought they are considered promos, meaning that you get a discount on the regular retail rate, whoever created that number. you will not get the same promo over and over again. the management seemed to be helpful, but if your issues infringed on them getting their money you have to go .the co workers seemed to be engulfed in their on greed. the hardest issue with the job is making someone stay with services they don't want. the most enjoyable part of the  was the money and benefits"
good,"The Business Account Executive Position utilizes a high activity model.  This job is ideal for someone who has strong outside sales experience and are known for a one-stop close.  This position requires a rep to close at lease one sale a day.  Performance is judged on Installs rather than sales, which are often times are out of the control of the sales rep and provides an unfair performance measure.  This is not an 8-5 type of job and requires a lot of micromanaging however, if you are patient, strong earning potential."
good,"I wouldn't recommend DSR to just anyone, its really a life style. YOu only have 3 months to become and expert at outside sales, so... proceed with caution. Door to door sales isn't as easy as it sounds."
good,"Typically I spend my day managing approximately 62 Verizon Wireless cell site projects. I work with local jurisdictions throughout southern California determining their specific entitlement process. "
good,"On a normal day you wouldn't work anymore than 5 hours, not counting appointments. Management could have been much better."
good,"The job is quiet easy and repetitive.  Is essentially just cable and the challenges come with trying to keep yourself motivated to do the same job day in and day out.  Management tries to push services that quiet honestly people do not want or desire.  For a lack of a better understanding, they want to you sell everything we have to everyone on the phone, even the 90 year grandma in the nursing home that is only living off of social security.  Every now and then you will get rewarded with stuff from vendors or even upper management but they are still business as usual.  I would say use this job as a stepping stone for a future job, but do not expect to make a career out of it because the long term in the cable industry is cloudy."
good,Timewarner is a good company to work with overall. They offered really good benefits and competitive salary with commission/bonus structure.
good,Account Executives must be self driven andbe able to work without supervision.  Extremely competitive environment.  Must be able to create and maintain a business customer funnel from the ground up. Must be self managed and self motivated.
good,"There was a friendly work environment. I do not feel like the management team was well organized. They always seemed to be missing information or information was not accurate. Some of management does there job while others work off of favoritism. They do not work with you when it comes to work schedule. Not enough pay for all the work required to do, but people who are hired are professional. The work environment is nice, but unless you are friends with someone in a higher position does not seem like you can grow within the company."
good,You really never know if you will be employed one day & unemployed the next. Looking for a more stable environment. I enjoy my schedule. I work 4 10 hours shifts per week.
good,The role as Retentions Specialist is very demanding.  The ability to effectively communicate with different segments of the company is vital.  The ability to build repore with the customer is a must.  I enjoy the interaction with the consumer.  I also enjoy educating them on new products and services which will benefit the household.  I have learned so much about myself in this role.  I learned that customer service is definitely my strong suit and the ability to de esculate situations
good,"The work environment can be difficult to be in due to the high attrition rates and the ""hire anyone off the street"" attitude that is possessed for front line agents. The management provides little direction and at times seems to not know what is currently going on within its own teams."
good,"the work atmosphere is great in the field dealing with customers is great, the everyday challenge is great the feeling u get when you solve the customers problem is awesome."
good,job and coworkers are great  management does not assist with problems only finds a reason to blame employees   focus on how to help reps and not stress them out
good,"Monitor everything that you do."
good,You will work hard and be able to advance at your own pace.  Management will treat you well if you work hard.  I do not want to do this.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Charter was a great stepping stone to better positions in the future at other companies. I had a number of different types of sales training and the salary and benefits were great.
good,"Answering busy incoming calls to call center,  most of your income relies on selling new and existing products even to disgruntal customers your job is to upsell"
good,Worked with existing MDU properties to sign right of entry and bulk agreements. Called on these properties by either phone or email to sign agreements. I had multi-state area so travel was restricted. I learned to negotiate more over the phone with face to face being so limited. Of the 3 managers I had only one was significant in my development the other 2 were less hands on in training or development. The hardest part of my job was not being face to face with owners and developing that bond that would move the sale to closing quicker. It sometimes took a year or more to close the sale. The most enjoyable part of the job was making it a win/win situation for both parties so that each was benefiting from the signed agreements.
good,"just ok, normal day ,how to work with the public,one particulate manager was basis,co-workers were great,not having enough time to cover the area assigned,the people that i worked with!"
good,inbound calls for customer looking to purchase cable plans home phone plans as well as internet plans. Also tried to upgrade customer's on the plan they have now or adding on to there current plans now.
good,Explain and demonstrate products. Update software. Offer solutions to resolve customers cable issues. Contact techs to be sure cable installed properly.
good,Charter is a company that is growing fast with opportunity for growth. The team I'm on is a tight bunch that have worked very hard to get to where they are. The challenge is to balance work and life as there is so much growth and very little time to adjust.
good,"Fun job, but not much opportunity for advancement."
good,If you need to be seated all day this is the place for you. and if you are SALES oriented this job is for you... however the stress level is very very high. Constant changes to proceedures as with most companies when they find a better or easier way to do the job...training has changed over the years but is still there and help is always available to those that need the help...
good,going to a lot of changes with comcast right now its no a good environment to work in
good,Typical door to door sales jobs. Training regimen is intense and focuses mainly on sales techniques rather than product knowledge.
good,"Benefits are good pay is a little lower then the market, local management is great upper management is lacking."
good,"As I said above, I do freelance work for Spectrum Services Inc whenever they have work for me. It could be every week or every six months. There are no certainties, but I have been doing graphics work for them for so long I put it on my applications. Typically I could spend anywhere from 1 hour to 12 hours doing work for them, it all depends on what the client has asked them to make. I enjoy the money and I enjoy making the documents, One thing I don't like about them is that they tell me the day a project is due to do something. But the money is good so I don't complain."
good,"I enjoy coming to work on an daily basis, i get to interact with technicians from around the country.  My job includes troubleshooting which can consume a bit of time, but this is the hardest and the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"They have many people that shouldn't be supervisors. This place is constantly changing. I have seen many good things happening, and then suddenly, someone in corporate offices puts a stop to it."
good,"A typical day at BrightHouse is back to back calls with customers inquiring about their bill or concerned about their services not working properly. I did learn how to de-escalate an angry customer. The management is bad. They want someone that is going to dedicate themselves to the call center bending over backwards for EVERY single customer. Its one thing to deal with non-stop calls(And I do mean non-stop, no down-time except for your break of course) but then the management gets on you about your sales on top of it all. That was the hardest part of the job. Management would like you to find a way to build a rapport and sales some stuff at the same time. "
good,"I love this job, as far as schedule goes it's really not for me. The pay keeps me stable in life, the only problems are schedule and management. If the management would work better with you, or overall had a great work ethic and provide better or maybe even flexible schedules this would be the ideal job for me."
good,A typical day at work consist of repairing cable when outages occur & making sure customers are provided with the best service Charter can provide.
good,"Benefits are great such as low cost cable, in some cases free. Low cost for great health care. I rarely had to pay for Dr. visits. Bosses were great, as long as you were doing what your supposed to do. They have your back. However dispatch, located in Greenville SC, give you routes all over the area. Every job is different, some are quick and easy some are not. The jobs that are not, dispatch will call your boss. You have to constantly CYA, by writing down everything that went wrong. If you get hit with a bunch of overrun jobs, you could be fired. Even with something(s) that are out of your hands. Everyday tasks change weekly. When you get off in the evening your ticked off. It's hard to leave work at work. Puts a strain on family life. Very stressful company to work for."
good,Typical workday is pretty even pace. There are times when the boss commands us to drop everything to address a fire drill issue. This happens more often than they should in my opinion. Coworkers are friendly and content to be there. Hardest part of the job is not being given guidance on what to do to develop career-wise. Best thing about working here are the flexible hours.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,The work enviorment was great just the traveling and time from family was a concern.
good,The product was great!  Management was a challenge as they did not appear to value employees.
good,"Cable/internet and home phone free.Great people to work with; although, not much support from management."
good,The day flies by as everyone is always busy.  Many friends made at work it is a 24/7/365 type of business.
good,"worked for 4 years, slight raise each year (3 %), benefits are awesome (company vehicle, free cable, internet,phone) Some management is awesome, some are idiots. Coworkers can help you out in a bind. Stupidity is rampant from higher ups. Performance metrics are used to rate you for raises. No commission on in-house upgrades anymore."
good,Difficult place to work at. Management did not trust its employees .
good,On a typical day of work the dispatchers wouldn't have a proper grasp on the workload and multiple technicians would be forced to work outside of their scheduled area to lessen the workload in the system. This has occurred on multiple occasions. Overall the technician department is more for the young guy who has no time for themselves or family.
good,"While commission and bonus structure is great at Charter, the management and overall morale is poor"
good,"No complaints when working with them."
good,I was an employee for 5 years. I had lots of experience gained with this company. The benefits were good and my schedule wasn't too bad giving me 3 days off (not consecutive but close enough) in the week. One bad thing was trying to accommodate customers with lack of equipment due to shortage problems. It just led to more customer dissatisfaction in the long run. Not only equipment shortages but management expected the techs to fix everything the first time. How can you do that when you're not provided with all the essential tools to get the job done? You can't turn garbage into gold.
good,"Work in all element outside."
good,"a typical day at work... coming into work everyday prepared to speak with strangers that you see everyday either at the gas station, barber shop, doctor office, or even at the grocery store but will never know because you do not know their names... one click to daily updates to know what new specials and offers are available for eligible customers... ready to get the day start with a sip of water, wet the lips, awaiting the first beep of the day, indicating you have a call... ""thank you for calling..."""
good,A great work team and great insurance benefits. Unfortunately Time Warner chose to downsize much of their operational support team and my job was cut.
good,"Presenting information via face-to-face contact to potential residential customers. Demonstrate product features and channels while providing marketing and customer service information to subscribers."
good,"The employees are great, There's a lot of changes within the company, so there's a lot proceedure changes. The management team is very poor with communications."
good,A typical day at Charter starts on the phones and ends on the phones. Charter is a company focused on delivering an exemplary level of customer service. I work with Management every day to ensure we as a team are meeting necessary Charter business goals. I've learned how to multi task and I have a different respect for time management as that was a primary focus of my position. The most enjoy part of my job is being recognized for being consistently above average.
good,Fun place to work with great benefits but there is no job security with this place as they will lead you to believe.
good,"the job was ok to work at first, especially in training. Training was really fun and hands on it has to be the best training I've had at any job. But once you get out of training it goes down hill. It is a 24/7 call center and they have it to where you have to bid on shifts to work on holidays. for example if you get out of training around thanksgiving and christmas time you will more than likely have to work those holidays. They want you to at least work 2 holidays throughout the year, and people normally want to work the earlier holidays in the year. Now with the bidding for a shift for a holiday you CAN't work your normal shift like 9a-6p. you have to bid for a shift and hopefully you will get one of the shifts you placed a bid for. If not and you havent worked a holiday more than likely you will be backfilled and then you are stuck with a horrible shift like the early shifts of 4a-12p on Christmas really. Nobody wants to work on Christmas especially not that shift. And everything there is about numbers and ranks, there are goals set for everything they want you to troubleshoot a customers issue in less than 8 mins, and you have to at least troubleshoot with a customer even if they are adamate about not wanting to troubleshoot. to me it felt like you were just a number there, there wasnt really any one on one with your supervisor. I hated this job. You had a certain time to login into the computers and when you had to use the restroom you had a certain time to be back on the phone."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Fast paced call center with a ton of upset customers, When I was there the company had just lost CBS lineup, Tons of calls over this with not much info to provide ,was very frustrating"
good,"A typical day at work begins with a conference call at 9:30 am. You are then on the road selling door to door from 11am to 8pm and you do work weekends. You work based mostly off of commission. The guidelines given to receive commission changes frequently. For example 10 triple plays to get a check to start then 12 sales to get a commission check. You are not paid off of what you sell, you have to meet a minimum amount. Also if a customer cancels even after installed you most often will not get paid.  You are given  tool to help sell, however customer service and inside sales departments are given other deals to give that can affect your sale.  "
good,"Overall a decent work experience, and surrounded by good people"
good,"this was a great job where I was able to work in the field rather than behind a desk. the days went by fast, and the people I meet where amazing. I really enjoyed this job, some days it didn't even seem like I was working."
good,Not what you really want to do with your life... but if times are hard.. its a port in the storm
good,Time Warner Cable has helped me become a better Producer/Director and Editor. I was given the opportunity to work with the latest in graphics and editing systems.
good,A typical workday is answering inbound calls from subscribers and potential cable/internet customers.
good,Typical Day starts at 7am to 3:30 pm. I drive to designated work area and begin my day. I compare our billing system to the plant looking for unauthorized access. If found wrong I climb telephone pole and/or disconnect at tap.
good,"This company has great compensation and benefits.  Co-workers and local networking is a plus.  Great on the job training and internships."
good,I enjoyed working for Time Warner Cable and free cable isn't bad either!
good,This was a company take over from Insight. This department has had so many changes that no one really knows what the direction is anymore.
good,The company is great. i would prefer more opportunities for growth.
good,Was a good place to work. Learned about tech world and fast changes for cell phones.
good,In a nutshell I was led to believe that I would have a great opportunity and I would be able to move around in the company just to find out that once I was in 1 job it was very hard to get out.
good,Typical call center sales position but with really low pay. The health benefits are amazing. Management is very unprofessional and favored reps do not have to follow rules at all. It seems like they are just trying hire temporary workers and there is not much chance for advancement. The job itself is pretty easy. The hardest part is just dealing with different customer personalities but that is normal for any customer service/sales position.
good,This company is ok for someone who does not mind working when your off the clock. You will get call from customers at odd times and will need to accommodate them for the sake of your job.
good,"I work in a stressful high volume call center where I help customers•	with general billing and account inquirer’s, coordinated payment arrangements, with customers on delinquent accounts, taking payments, filling claims and complaints etc."
good,"Direct Marketing Solutions is a startup division of Time Warner Cable Media Sales dedicated to creating integrated solutions with a direct response focus.  With every client I learn new things in regards what is in the market place and what works best for each client. I work with a talented team of management and co-workers with a variety of experience levels.  My management team is one of the best that I have had the pleasure of working for and the co-workers are talented and unique in their own right.  I have established a great working relationship with each of them to a point they are finding ways to include me and my division in everything.  One of the hardest obstacles we have is overcoming limited budgets and achieving all the goals a clients wants, but can say we have done so on several occasions.  I enjoy the variety, strategy, customization, and presentation that goes into every campaign."
good,You will receive good pay and great benefits but the Media side is changing and in a restructuring period right now.
good,The call center was very high energy. I took up to 125 calls a day.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Overall the time I spent with twc was not bad. The biggest issue is that none of management seems to be on the same page. We were told no overtime for new employees was a management decision yet one of my classmates was allowed to work as much ot as she wanted while the rest of us were denied the chance. Also, many of the leads and supervisors seem to have different answers to the same questions and some were even unwilling to help other employees. The benefits were great! Although the bonus program changed monthly making it hard to focus on what you were actually promised."
good,"The management here is HORRIBLE. You cannot run an adequate Technical support floor without actual ""technically-savvy"" leadership!! Their supervisors/team leads know NOTHING!! There is a HUGE lack of knowledge there."
good,"Get to work and sign on to the computer, check e-mails for any new information. Sign on to each computer screen you will be using. be ready to answer incoming calls by 4pm. I have learned how to position all three Lines of Business in order to sell all three. To take control of the call. The management team is great and do all they can to help make you sucessful. My co-workers are fantastic. They do really care about you and share in the joy of every sale that is made. Tha hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers who are having problems with their services and do not want to hear anything but to have their services back up and working and wish to speak with a supervisor when there is no one available. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing at the end of the day that I did the best job I could. And I enjoy the pay!!"
good,"Every morning would show up to the store and pick up my work orders and equipment. Then I would put the work orders in order by scheduled arrival and then make sure i had all my tools need for install. After all the checks were crossed i would load up and head to my first install of the day. Would arrive at the costumers house and put myself ""on site"". Talked to customer make sure that the order form was correct and made sure that the TV's were clear for me to access. If everything was ok, then i would start outside locate their cable lines and test to make sure their getting proper signal. And after that checked out then proceed with the install. Depending on area i would either have to climb up a ladder to get to the cable hook-ups or there sometimes would be on the ground somewhere in back of alley or at end of street. After locating the hook-ups then I would locate that customers homes cable line and connect all together. Then i would proceed back to the customers home and begin to install the equipment the customer ordered. After that was complete and everything checked ok then i would proceed to the customer and show them how to use the basic controls and asked if they needed them to show them how to do anything else or had any questions. After the install and the how to's i would tell the customer to enjoy their day and thank you for choosing. The Hardest part would be sometime the bee's. But they always provided wasp spray, (just sometimes one would get you). Enjoyable part was the responsibility, and i mean that by giving work orders and let go to do your job."
good,"I was able to progress in various departments during my tenure within the company. There are advancement opportunities, as well as opportunities to further your education for every employee. I was able to learn about cable, hsd and home phone service and work for the internal and external customer while employed for TWC. I have been able to extend my management expertise and will able to take this knowledge to the next company I will be employed with."
good,My daily schedule consist of me going to residential customers homes and trouble shooting or installing all of TWC services provided.
good,If you are looking for work life balance it would be tough to find at Time Warner Cable.  With nights and weekends required it is a tough place to work if not in a corporate environment.  They are competitive with pay and the benefits are great but the mantra at Time Warner Cable is that things will change and I mean daily.
good,"A typical day at Charter was taken inbound phone calls from customers, I learn by working at Charter to get customers cable service activated. Management at the company was very demanding but overall they were fair. Co-workers were very helpful in assisting with a call. The hardest part of the job was  disconnecting customers service, because not able to pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting customers established with cable service in the designated time frame."
good,"I typical day consist of speaking with customers regarding billing,services issues, and selling of services."
good,"Stressful Work Environment with constant changes in required duties.  Also the commission structure starts out fantastic but they have changed it repeatedly.  Huge focus on draining money out of the customers pockets by any means necessary, lack of concern of customer satisfaction."
good," A typical day at work consisted of sitting in a cubical responding to a wide variety of customers dealing with a much wider variety of issues within, and often outside of, the range of support Charter provided to its customers. I learned how to deal with disgruntled customers by placing myself in their shoes. i learned how to speak to them and ask the questions necessary to ensure I would be able to assist the customer in spite of their understandable frustrations. I also had the opportunity to enhance my typing skills. Which increased from barely 20 words per minute to approximately 40 words per minute. "
good,not a place that i would suggest a place to work or to make a carrer
good,Learned many functions in my yrs at Time Warner.  Learned new ways to improve my daily functions. 
good,"I work as a network engineer for Charter, and its a decent job if a low paying one.  That being said, there isn't really a clear path to advancement within the company, and they do not value education or efforts to increase your own skill set.  Cable is a very niche industry, and the experience you gain at Charter will probably not carry over to the rest of the networking world.  It's not a bad place to work, but its a little bit of a dead end and compensation is less than great.  "
good,"Time Warner Cable has some of the most talented and dedicated people that I have worked with in this field. I managed a highly skilled team that took new product offerings and services from Engineering design to implementation. We also maintained, upgraded and monitored all systems. They say that if you enjoy what you do, then you will never work a day and that was the case for many years with this job. Unfortunately every shakeup with Sr management means they have to make changes to put their stamp on the company.  After several rounds of restructuring and layoffs, the company seems to be losing many of their most talented people as they move on to find stability. "
good,It has been a good company to work for but the hours are not ideal or flexible.  The management is very friendly.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and the sense of inclusion.  The hardest part of the job would be the strange hours and the inability to always help the customer.
good,"Dispatch and efficiently routes technical field personnel for various customer service calls utilizing multiple computer applications and verbal or written instructions. Assist technicians in troubleshooting and resolution of customer equipment problems. Schedule and reschedules service calls for customers in a timely manner. Maintain reports and other information on customer service calls and outages. Perform trouble shooting for field technicians in an efficient manner. Demonstrates excellence in communication skills. Prepares monthly departmental reports and submits to supervisor. Promotes good customer relations through telephone contact within compliance of established company policies and procedures. May communicate pertinent information including customer service issues, outages, etc., to other systems. Maintain a positive work atmosphere by behaving and communicating in a manner that works well with co-workers, supervisors, and customers"
good,Not family friendly at the location and management I was at.
good,hardest part of the job would be the irrate customers wanting something done that i was unable to complete for them
good,"I enjoyed my time there, I liked the people I worked with. I was able to get a lot of hands on training. It was a great place to get experience under my belt at. In the end there was not much room for growth though."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"time warner is just ok, dont have too much to say but thank God I have a job."
good,"Conducted training classes to all staff from employee to Directors in all locations for Sales, Service, Retention, & Technical support."
good,Great benefits was a bonus. Co workers were fun to be around.
good,Typical day started like any other we were understaffed so always had to prioritize the daily fires. Executive management decided to relocate to the East Coast.
good,I was a Sales/Retention by listening and identifying customer needs
good,The job wasn't what they described. I monitored the network and created tickets as needed
good,"Decent place to work some days Long hours, and co workers are enjoyable to be around."
good,"Good place to work. I like the work schedule, made a lot of friends. Advancement could be better. The work is challenging. Overall a good place to work"
good,I love and enjoyed working for this company but there rules and regulations make no sense and can keep you from performing to your fullest ability.
good,"Direct sales position is a fun job. You get to meet ALOT of people everyday. However, the company just went through a complete overhaul and the employees lost about $20,000 a year with no remorse what so ever. Management has no clue what is going, at least my manager doesnt, while transformations are taking place the sales reps are fed to the wolves."
good,"Good environment to work with, open to trying new processes for improvement, leadership team willing to learn better practice. Highly political organization yet flexible and willing to seek best practices and processes."
good,"hardest part of job work, salary does not equal amount of work performed/under paid"
good,"Job security is not the best, neither is the employee morale. It is very hard to maintain proper work/life balance as Time Warner consumes much of your time and does not offer much flexibility for vacations or personal holidays. Very strict attendance policy also, which does not waiver for any consideration of personal issues or health."
good,My work experience was good I received most of my experience from this job. I loved speaking with customer and resolving there problems over the phone at least half where amazed to see the alot could be accomplished over the phone. There was nothing to complicated at the job that I couldn't handle.
good,"This job has to do with patience and a lot of customer services. How to deal with people and understanding that everyone is not the same, but also follow the guidelines of the company. The environment is very friendly everyone knows everyone and is always will to give a helping hand. The hardest part is the competition be number 1 months in a row to gain the incentive you want."
good,The day to day work is repetitive and you meet all types of different people.
good,"Respectable company, but depending on where you are in the company you can feel the barrier for progressing beyond entry level positions."
good,"This job is very stressful, they come up with something new everyday but you you like drama this is the place for you!!!"
good,Ok company to work for.Has some pros and cons. but not a bad company.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"ok company to work for as long as you keep to yourself and avoid office politics. Usual call center drama, everyone is in  your business and they are quick to gossip."
good,"answer phone, troubleshoot equipment, deal with angry, upset, elderly customers. try to keep them calm while asking them probing questions. sometimes they will escalate and may have to keep them on the phone while waiting for help."
good,I really dont have many positive things to say at this time because I am stuck in a department that I am unhappy in. It's has become so toxic that I now have come to terms I have to move on
good,"Normal work environment like any other company that does cable television and internet and phone services, services certain areas for those who have not heard of the company."
good,I liked working with the customers and problem solving. i learned how to install cable and trouble internet services and phone along with cable services.
good,"nice place to work, good work life balance, no work pressure, enjoyed going to office, good team members, good salary too, no micro management of people."
good,Good benefits decent culture upper management needs to make changes that effective for everyone. Vacation time and sick time benefits were great. Overall this use to be a great company but a lot things need improved.
good,"long hours, very big on performance and productivity. its all about numbers!!!!! work/life balance is challenging. perfect job for young single people. employee morale needs improvement."
good,always changing pay structure and always changing job requirements. Commissions are capped which discourages top performers and work schedule seems to change often
good,"okay to work for but alot of stress on sales. Have to meet your goals once you are out of you RAMP period which is probation period. Commission based on installs, not sales"
good,"I've started off as a Time Warner Cable employee back in 2009 and it was a great company with lots of opportunities for growth, great benefits and perks but once Charter took over things changed. The new company just does not seem to be for the employees. It's good for a short term company if you are looking to get on your feet but not for long term."
good,management must learn to adapt...old policy of being in location with supervisor is a thing of the past! Then entire world works remotely these days..
good,"Recent mergers have added considerable demands on management to resolve and implement consolidation strategies to streamline operations.  Once more stability is achieved, it could be a very interesting, dynamic place to work."
good,You can't give up.  Have to be positive and determined.  Not a bad place to work but you will have to push.  That's all I have to say on the situation.
good,"Not very good pay have to take time out of personal schedule to advance in tech levels. Some senior techs where paid $30/hr while some other specialized fiber techs get less then $20/hr. But some good benefits health insurance very good pay is such an issue for all you deal with, will be constantly questioned if your falling behind on a job then give you overtime everyday to make a grade in a points system that management knows is not possible"
good,"Application tools are all over the place and there are a lot of redundancies."
good,"not for someone who have a family. long hours and late nights. benefits, growth, education, training and compensation are the best part of working here."
good,Good pay but little opportunity to advance. No comprehensive training. Administration doesn't help out at times. Most people are nice but favoritism can be an issue.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I didn’t like my schedule I was one of the top sellers and I wasnt able to get the schedule I wanted I would get out very late,   I wanted my schedule changed"
good,Don't really have much to say and would rather not have anything posted on the internet. I currently work here and am looking for a new place of employment.
good,Great company to start a cat tv career in. If you do your job you won't have a problem. Hard work but good money. Everyday is different it was not an easy job by any means but i am grateful for the experience.
good,"The benefits, 401K, free services, and pension plan are great.  Great place to work for people with call center experience that don't mind sitting for most of your shift."
good,Enjoyed my time at spectrum and learnt a lot from the technicians/engineers i worked with the contract time ended with a big contract and i stayed on to carry out various tasks but the opportunity to join my current company came up
good,"Benefits are wonderful but being micromanaged, pushing a product you might not believe in, living in a cubicle, constant rejection, no sense of community, chained to a headset is brutal. I've never done call centers before and will never again."
good,"It's nice to get a discount on your cable, phone and HSI. Sometimes there is mandatory overtime. Very fast pace place. You get pressured to make commission."
good,"I was hired during the merger with Time Warner Cable and Brighthouse Networks. I took over the work of 3 TWC employees who took a buyout and left the company. After two years I was still doing the work of 3 people with no relief in sight. After I left they broke my job up and distributed it among 4 other people. "
good,I definitely learned a lot from working here. I was no tech person but they still gave me a chance. I don't know who needs to hear this but the Spectrum TV app takes 2 hours before it starts working after you add it and if your internet modem goes out so does your phone.
good,"Company was a joy to work for before the Charter merger. Now the culture is rife with micro-management, metric-driven performance, and unrealistic expectations from senior management.  All jobs have been more-or-less centralized, so if you want to move into a different area you will most likely have to relocate out-of-state.  Pay is middle-of-the-road for the job title, but your title might not reflect your actual duties."
good,"Spectrum has grown since 3 company's merged together, The Resource Dispatch Center that I worked in had a large employee turnover, largly due to starting compensation.  My day was hectic and underbalanced.  I would begin with greeting my employees since I did not work the same schedule as my team.  As I would begin my daily duties, I would get pulled to cover a peer's work, or monitor and assist their teams, which greatly impacted my team's duties."
good,"Dont go into this thinking it is anything but a typical call center job. Good benefits, free services,but a typical call center job. I work in the billing department, so be ready to cursed out, yelled at by customers, threatened by customers, etc."
good,Decent pay and good health benefits. Paid training but its more sink or swim there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.....
good,"Good place to work. Really have to be committed to working there. Make your own schedule, at least 8 hours a day. Good commission and sign on bonus. Door to door"
good,I deal with replacements and force relocates. My day is paper work in the morning then go out to the field in the afternoon.I have learned a lot in the department I currently work for.
good,They micro manage too much. To many scripts to follow. Other sales people were not train properly. Many would lie to the customers and not help the properly.
good,Pay attention in training. Practice at home. Know your stuff because there isn't always gonna be someone to help you. Be ready for ALL WEATHER CONDITIONS.
good,"fast pace work is like a machine that needs oil"
good,"Evolving work weeks, Constant customer interaction. Fast paced and on-the-job learning enviroment. Must perform in all weather conditions. Also tedious driving schedule."
good,The most important thing that I took away from my time with Spectrum was my growth. I came in with the mindset of wanting to progress my career and I was able to accomplish that in a little over a year. Went from an everyday rep to a supervisor in about 15 months.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I have been with Charter for about 15 months and overall it has been a good experience. I enjoy working with the multitude of suppliers and engaging with all of my internal stakeholders.
good,Very flexible schedule with excellent benefits and ability to accrue leave.  Spectrum also seems to promote from within for career advancement.  Hours were good for positive work/life balance.
good,"At this location, it's weirdly casual. People are very familiar with each other and address each other in ways that make someone coming from a professional environment cringe. Definitely an HR incident waiting to happen."
good,Supervisor was incompetent. Long hours. Lack team support- to many chiefs and  not enough  Indians. Really not concern with what's best for the inmates.
good,"For 10 years a typical day was selling Spectrum, formerly known as Time Warner Cable, service to developers so that the residents of apartment complexes could receive service.  When Spectrum bought TWC, the drive was to sell bulk services to owners."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company, would like to go back. Training was 13 weeks I believe, did nesting for 2 weeks then went back to class for 2 more weeks to reflect on what we needed more help on."
good,Honestly not a horrible place to work IF you have a schedule that allows work life balance.  I was presented a schedule that is 4:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m.  and have had it ever since. Charter doesn't believe in site shift bids not allowing two willing parties to swap schedules permanently.
good,"The outside sales role is very challenging but when you hit your quota can be very rewarding as they have a great compensation package that rewards top performers. "
good,Exciting changes always in play.  New technologies and product implementation following a major acquisition provides ongoing challenges and opportunities.
good,"offers good health benefits, good amount of paid time off, and 401k"
good,"One of the best parts about working at the company is the free internet service provided. You also receive free cable and home phone service. However, equipment is not included."
good,"Very competitive within the company, they say you can move up in the company but it's really hard, it's up and down with the mood in the place, everyone is very nosy"
good,"Get a company vehicle , drive to first job, see supervisor once a week. Install and Troubleshoot  Internet, TV, Telephone. Each team is different culture. Your alone most of the week which is good. Your attitude dictates the day which is good."
good,Every agent gets paid the same regardless of their call center experience. Management is not organized. There is never enough floor support. Supervisors and leads are not adequately trained for their role. Given the opportunity I will not work there again because agents are taken for granted and are expendable even though we are the muscle behind the machine.
good,The structure of the company is unorganized. I have not been satisified with the overall culture of the company. It is very unpersonal and would not recommend.
good,"I enjoyed my entire time working for Spectrum . The management Team was ABSOLUTELY great. Only issue was not knowing, as representatives, what was happening next."
good,Working here can get pretty tough especially since charter took over time warner cable. It went from feeling like a mom and pop type of company to a soulless company who doesn’t care about their employees. Be warned.
good,The job can be slow some days or it can be job after job after job. Unless you get a supervisor that cares/gives you their personal number good luck getting a hold of them. If you have no family/obligations out side of work this can be a great place to work.
good,"Spectrum is a typical corporate environment, and along with that come the positives and negatives you would expect--there are certainly nice benefits but it can be difficult at times for a single voice to be heard"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Job reviews are not necessarily based on what was done but more on how long the call was, scheduling techs & transferring customers to their correct department when the automated system should have directed them to the correct department"
good,Working at Spectrum was ok.  I was originally a Time Warner employee.  Spectrum's culture is different from Time Warner Cable.  Spectrum wasnt as employee focesed as Time Warner.  Others may have had a better expereince than me.
good,"the hardest part of the job is not believing in the product that you are selling. I dont believe we are pushing a great product out, and I cant lie to people."
good,Customers are very stressful. Mangers don't explain what kind of customers that you will be dealing with on a regular bases. Micro manage everything the employees do.
good,I really enjoyed being able to meet new people everyday and help customers with ordering of their phone internet and home security systems.  I would recommand
good,"Decent place to work.  Facilities not great.  Laptop barely worked.  Improved on door to door sales.  Company culture sucked, but manager and director made it manageable."
good,...Challenging and rewarding if you apply hard work and perspective. All for a team effort to establish and succeed at set company goals. Day to day activities could include travel or a seminar in the work place.
good,Company as a whole is not a team player your fight with too many people for sales you have the call center you have direct sales you have business sales and you have outside sales that are contracted to set up location and sale too many hands and not enough coverage area.
good,"Spectrum is a decent place to work for those just starting out in specific industries. While you may not find the compensation to be as competitive as other organizations, there will be room for advancement with some bump in pay (alebit not big bumps). The benefits are pretty good. Management simply does what is passed down to them from the higher management exec level with little regard to employee impact."
good,The day is fast paced with sales but it is competitive and also if you don't meet your sales quota or a low in sales prepare to be micro managed until you do
good,"Liked working for them,plenty of Overtime.Good atmosphere & staff members were helpful. You can develop great skills & move up in position within."
good,It was Time Warner Cable when I worked there. Residential Retention was brutal. Customers cussing you out just for answering the phone. I had seven managers in seven months and moved desks seven time.
good,Its a very productive workplace surrounded by motivated leads and supervisors willing to help. you get customers on the regular basis wanting to remove services but with motivation can achieve to keep the customer
good,I really like this company and my position here but unfortunately the company relocated to another state. I couldn’t make this move but if it was closer might have
good,Now that Charter took over Time Warner and named it Spectrum its just gone down hill from there.  Charter/Spectrum is the cheapest companies I have ever worked for and they only look after the dollar.  If they can cut cost anywhere they will do it quickly. I hear now that it has gotten a whole lot worse since I left and everyone hates it there.
good,"Just trying to make more money"
good,"Integrity based workplace focused on customer service."
good,I worked there and got paid.The work there was spectrum related and the work there was for spectrum  Spectrum is a cable phone and internet company that I fix modems remote access
good,Good pay at first when they were time warner cable. When Charter bought out the company everything changed. Pay cuts and pension were taken away along with many other things that didnt make sense.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Spectrum is a company that is driven by numbers and stats. Not the customers, leadership is poor. Tier I rep does not have good and consistent support from tierII or management. The culture is very stressful if you value customer service and come from a professional environment.  $15 is not worth your health nor sanity. Do not get sick, the ADA or leave process is horrible."
good,It was a nice company to work for. I was saddened when I had to leave for a better opportunity for my family. Great benefits and wonderful co workers .
good,"I was a contractor so not the same as a permanent employee with the couple.  "
good,"Great people to work with. management has unreal expectations and are usually part of a Clique since most have been in that position for years. Company separated from top to bottom and upper management does not care what you think, although you may have your finger on the pulse of business."
good,the pay is not good for all the driving that I do. You get 500 leads a month and have to go to every lead and get sales and they don't pay you until you have eight sales for that month so if you get seven sales in that month you don't get paid a commision
good,Expectations include an emphasis on providing customer service while also developing technical knowledge. You are expected to maintain individual metrics for advancements.
good,Very stressful and demanding culture. Management places a lot of pressure on its agents and the environment feels as if manage is looking to fire agents before helping
good,"Its a fine job if you are in you 20's, being in my 50's im finding it harder and harder to do it. Lots of ladder work, under trailers, in attics etc. This is a young mans game"
good,Great perks friendly people learned a lot good training program very big company good benefits several locations various job options all over the country
good,"Typical day was taking calls and trying to prevent customers from cancelling services, down side management only cares about numbers making it very stressful environment and they would not allow advancement unless you were bilingual so you were basically stuck as a Retention rep unless you speak spanish"
good,"This is a good place to work out of as a beginner.  It is my opinion that it is not a place for someone who has a good amount of experience.  The salary is not living wage, but if you live with your parents, then you are ok."
good,Handled all escalated calls. Asked probing questions to achieve one call resolution. Used active listening skills to de-escalate the situation and be able to offer a solution that best fits the customers needs. Answered all billing questions and took payments for accounts.
good,Worked 4-10s. Training for the position was thorough. Overall a good place to work. Management were good and there to help you. Days can be long depending on the area you work in.
good,"Everything is fine, I am not sure why I have to do this. This is not something I want to discuss. What is the purpose of doing this? you need info from your candidates"
good,Never the same day twice. Enjoyed most of my time here. Enjoyed working with the public generally speaking. Opportunity to drive company vehicle home which was nice and complimentary cable and internet service at my home was a hue plus.
good,These people teach you to be professional liars. They are trying to make you push cable down people's throat. They have no set organization structure. you are paid based on how well you can lie
good,Company needs better direction and work hours for senior employees. More emphasis should be placed on working conditions. Better focus on employee satisfaction
good,You have to be an people's person to work in the outside sales rep position. The job itself can be fun but the managers can make it difficult and stressful. The commission is unbelievable. The scheduling is flexible and your able to make your own schedule.
good,"Working here is very fast paced. It's a sales position so you have to be prepared to be coached all the time in an effort to make more sales. I felt pressured every single day, I was an average seller. Only the top 5% of sellers get rewarded. If not you are monitored on every call to find out how to not take no for an answer. Although commission is awesome on top of hourly wage."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"the gameroom is nice. the people are friendly and so is the staff. their structure is not the most solid either after changing from bright house. is not as good of a company to work for,"
good,"I have work for charter for 4 years. Training new hires, showing them the companies program like JD.Edward, Chat and evening excel making sure they got the job done correctly and promptly."
good,"When I worked there it was 10 years ago.  Stressful to me. I liked the co-workers and the challenges.  However, it was not a good fit for me at the end.  Position was eliminated due to restructuring.  Many changes all the time no day was the same."
good,"Great products, bets internet service available, very fast pace, continually changing, certain areas have no room for career development which affects compensation. Benefits are good!"
good,Great pay lacks work life balance and leadership can improve this would make culture better that was the only down side leadership lack of caring for other employees seem like they were there just for there yo checks
good,The company had wonderful benefits to make a good career out of it.  I would recommend others with Call Center or billing Experience to apply for the company.  Because overall there is a good moral of the company as a whole.
good,"It's a good job, just not for me. I prefer to be more active rather than sitting in a cubicle. It is also just too far for me to get to on a daily basis. The schedule does not permit going back to school either."
good,It is a stepping stone job. This is not somewhere for longevity. They do micro-manage their staff.....................................................
good,good place to work and I enjoyed working with the people. I enjoy the job title and duties of the RF engineer. The company has great benefits and the holiday parties are awesome.
good,Climbing telephone poles and customer service is what your days consist of at charter.  Your co workers are great but the customers are another story.
good,Spectrum is a nice place to work for the most part. Although the job can be stressful if you have to leave work for an emergency every once and a while. if you don't do well with customers yelling at you all day then this job isn't for you.
good,"The hiring practices tend to be toward people that know. The positions are posted as a formality, because they already know who they want to hire! You can be a perfect candidate, with a proven track record, and it’s meaningless, because the concern is to hire my friend not who’s best for the role!"
good,"I like my job here, it's nice sometimes depending on where you are in the call center, what management is there, and if they find any bedbugs while you are there. I've been looking for a new job ever since we found out how bad the bed bug situation was and how many customers we have been losing."
good,Working anywhere is what you put into it.  This place gave me employment and I was able to take care of my family and pay my bills.  One just knows when it's time to move on.
good,I think the culture changed in a negative way when the new management took over. The pay structure changed as well. It seems that Spectrum was more focused on the wrong side of business. The manager made it more personal than professional.
good,"Got along with everyone, nice steady pace. The pay was good.  Great managers. Hard workers. Made sure you knew everything you was doing before you start working."
good,The workplace culture is set on the conservative side. The management varies but many leaders are very concerned about their direct employees and ensuring they are successful at their jobs.
good,A lot of lay offs have happen within the last two years so job security is not good. Over time is promising. Advancement is very hard to come back when applying for jobs within the company.
good,"good job not much to say about the job paid training work casual good work environment decent pay for the area, crew there can be helpful, paid time off as well"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"In my 18 years of working at Time Warner Cable/Spectrum, I learned the value of helping and assiting customers with their needs. How to be flexible and I got along very with my peers. I learned a lot of amazing things about the cable and internet industry. How to troubleshoot an issue if one arose. My specialty was making sure that the customer had a good experience when they spoke with me or if I happen to be the one working on their issue."
good,"It has been more than a decade since I worked for this company, which was actually under a different name at a time.  From what I remember it was a good, fun job with friendly people before the outsourced my job to India."
good,Being as this job was my second job within the communication industry I had a leg up compared to the other new employees that were hired with me. I was able to show my experience as a customer service representative and excelled where others had difficulties.
good,Paid training is included and benefits are excellent. Job is fast paced and you are working with customers most of the day. Learned a lot a valuable skills to take to the next job
good,"Work at spectrum was okay, not great. if you have the opportunity you should work elsewhere, but whatever. a job is a job, get it how you live it I say."
good,"A lot of classes and cross-training involved.  A lot of different variety of chanels, internet at high speeds and television services.  Instalations are all very professional and so are the call center reps."
good,Really not much to mention. Its a great company to work for. Many locations to work at depending on the department of choice. The culture is very relax in dress which also depends on the department your working with. Great incentives in motivation all employees to stay healthy such as 5ks and triathlons.
good,"Great Benefits."
good,"A fast paced environment with good team leadership.  The shift was long and tedious, at times.  The benefits and pay are competitive with comparable companies."
good,job was still very stressful but manageable. Did more of technical work and not dealing with customer bill increase or promise not kept by company. Very manageable.
good,"Company is a very sales driven organization, but rewards are great when targets are achieved.   Many talented sales professional are created each day.  Customer love Spectrum."
good,It is a fast pace work environment and not just in the call but in the changing of everything from how they're training you to the software that you're using. But if you are able to keep your cool and keep up with everything your hard work will pay off.
good,"Direct supervisor located in Louisville.  Opportunities for advancement or diverse jobs are limited to specific locations.  Once a certain level is attained within your specific job role, the only way to advance or move to a different job role is to relocate."
good,Spectrum has a hard time listening to their technicians or properly training them when new equipment gets brought in.we used to have proper training sessions and had technicians questions answered and addressed.now they hand u a pamphlet and send you back out to work.
good,After 11 years you learn that working at a cable company is nothing more than a constantly changing beast. I have seen many restructuring situations happen during my employment. Even with all these worrisome things the job itself was good and had a great work structure and amazing employees you worked with.
good,Very difficult to move up. People at management level are friendly however lack of actual management expertise. Spectrum culture is to hire mostly from internal candidates who usually do not have academic education.
good,Love the company and career but local leadership is working to correct some major opportunities. Once local issues are worked out this is a great company overall.
good,"Researched over 30 daily escalation issues for local, regional customer service, managers, and supervisors in 12 states. Experienced in cross regional management that includes a local 37,000 subscriber base in Memphis Tennessee and 5 national regions, spread over 12 states."
good,"The location at which I spent my total 6-month experience with Spectrum was uninspiring, at best. I can understand why companies looking to create new space for employees are focusing on the aesthetics and function of the interior. I felt that the environment worked against my outgoing personally, and creativity, making  achievement more difficult. My manager and co-worker were so pleasant to work with, which helped a lot."
good,"Good pay but very unorganized, never had enough equipment and the schedules were hectic. The best part was some of the people I met worst part was my supervisor."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Great learning experience for a someone starting off with their career in the cable service industry. A growing market with plenty of opportunities to move around the state or company.
good,"The company provides free cable, internet and home phone for those who currently reside within footprint coverage area.  This is an excellent benefit for working for the company."
good,"very fast paced and stressful. customers needs.the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.hardest part of the job was upset customers, and the things out of my control."
good,"I work as a video repair rep in one of spectrum call centers. Turn over is high, the call volume can get intense, training is lackluster. All can be attributed to poor leadership."
good,"I don’t know how important a job being fun is, but I remember a time I enjoyed going to work.  When there was a camaraderie amongst the team, and even management.  I was the cable guy, and I loved being that person.  Since Spectrum bought out Time Warner Cable, the company itself has changed to a point where it is unrecognizable.  Everyone is trained to “watch your back”.   There is no loyalty.  I was in management so I saw it from all angles.  When a VP takes an opportunity to attack a manager or supervisor on a morning conference call for no reason... I question who and what I am working for, and why.   I finally decided Spectrum did not have the same moral fiber, or integrity I did.  So I left.  I can’t imagine ever wanting to go back.  Not for double the pay."
good,The call center environment was a very close team based environment. This environment was not company designed it was personnel designed. Constant coaching and reviews is a staple for the call center.
good,it was a great place to work my coworkers were the best and the benefits were great. the hours were great and the overtime was available. Working there was the best experience of my life
good,"Agents are expected to reach outrageous performance goals with little to no coaching from management. Poor communication, the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing."
good,"To much of a high school enviroment typical call center "
good,"Decent place to work in the cable industry. Struggle to work are one combined company. Company culture could use some improvement. Otherwise, not a bad place to work"
good,Not that bad... The math/science of amount of accounts they give certain sales reps............Not sure what you want me to say here........I am indifferent about the job.The company .The culture the pay was good........................................................
good,"why would anyone even use this freaking service other than the internet. seriously cable is a joke anymore, and if you dont have direct tv youre a joke."
good,typical day. Lots of changing since charter still taking over twc. Go to work and get a paycheck. Meet people. Lots of events. Job postings to post out.
good,"Great benefits but you can make twice as much with other tech services.   Worked with others and starting pay was twice as much.  Once, you become part they will drive you to work and work all the time because pay is low."
good,"spectrum offer free cable, internet and telephone for their employees. The bonus are good but its hard to upsell which is required by management or will go against you"
good,Great people to work with. Other techs are great. Supervisors are great. Managers are good. Horrific corporate culture prioritizes policy and red tape over hiring the right persons and trusting them to do the work.
good,"a good place to jump start your career, may be lacking in overall development, however good place to learn new skills and life situations, would recommend a start here."
good,"Upper management will lie to you and stop you from making your own career choices to better yourself.  They pay at the lower end of the scale for what your job entails, they do not hire replacements and just add the work to your existing load"
good,Customer are not easy very hard job customer are extremely demanding and the level of stress is up the roof if you want the experiences you have to be ready
good,"Enjoyed my time with the company while under Time Warner Cable, but with the recent change to Spectrum felt undervalued as an employee. Picked up many skills and good experiences along the way."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Mostly friendly environment. Can be as challenging as you make it. Can be boring when receiving repeated calls for same issues, such as area outages and rate increases."
good,Good Job. Great Place to work. Chances to Get more hours. Chance to meet new people. Management is great. I would recommend this job to someone who was looking for a job.
good,"Fast past environment. There are no room for advancement, Quantity of Quality is what matters most to the company. Benefits are excellent. Friendly work environment."
good,"Typical day is take calls that are in queue, pretty much what you would expect. 9 times out of 10 you take a common call about payment extensions, making payments or general billing questions. Some customers can be extremely rude and it can get you down, this is what separates the kind of people that stick around. While you're waiting for calls you can really only read or talk to coworkers, because of access to customer info your not able to use your cell or even have a gameboy. People in Management are fairly nice and willing to help you with growing, most of the higher positions that become available are given to current employees and there is rarely an outside person hired. Benefits are good and you also get an annual pay increase based of call metrics. Shifts are only full time, either five 8 hours or four 10 hour shifts. When call volume is extremely low management offers you the ability to leave, also overtime is available frequently but not required. Every holiday is worked but volunteers to work are set up first, if not enough people volunteer there is a drafting process based off metrics. Recently on holidays they started having certain call centers close while others handled the calls that day."
good,"a very demanding environment with little or no opportunities for career advancement."
good,I am a formal Time Warner Cable Agent. When I was employed with the company it had a very nice environment. Management allowed their workers to work within the privacy of their cubicles.
good,"This was once a fast paced sales job with unlimited commission.  After they relocated the company to Auburndale and now Riverview, the commission has changed tremendously.  I live in Orlando and was expected to commute to Auburndale daily.  Once they relocated to Riverview I left the company.  Management is inconsistent.  One day they allow something and the next day it's no longer acceptable."
good,Working for Time Warner cable was amazing being that I am naturally good at sales I learned a lot of social skills and got great retention type experience
good,"Sell, sell, sell. All about selling. You have to be on point with competitive prices with every single customer. Product knowledge is key. Always stay on top of the competition. Know your cable, internet, and phone services and packages."
good,Spectrum took over an ok company and are making it worse. They seem to have little regard for customers and expanding market growth. The team that you work with will make or break  your opinion of the company and it vastly differs betweend departments.
good,I actually departed from the company before they actually converted from Time Warner Cable to Spectrum. so I can not really review Spectrum at this moment.
good,As a Business Analyst there is a strong drive for you to support the Project Manager. My team was good and everyone worked together...it is just hard when everyone likes you but your boss...no opportunity for growth!
good,"I designed, construct, install, maintain and repaired corporate and residential computer systems. I advise users regarding the technical direction of their computer systems based on their needs. I also recommend making changes to an existing system or installing an entirely new system when necessary. In addition, I was responsible for system security and data assurance, as well as the installation of intranets. I kept documentation, such as flowcharts, diagrams and reports. I also develop performance requirements and specifications, conducted evaluations, observe usability studies and direct programming."
good,"A typical day at work was enjoyable but productive."
good,"When you first start out, you are flooded with the notion that you're a part of a team and then reality sets in. Horrible shifts and poor time management for teaching newcomers. you're expected to know everything right out of training which by the way: you can pretty much ignore what you're taught in the classroom and just wait till you get on the floor because thats where you actually learn what your job is."
good,A typical day making sure techs are productive and meeting customers on time commitments. We hold daily huddles meetings to discuss any company impacting issues.
good,"Its a competitive work Environment, good pay. they train you in every thing you need to know about the job you are hired for. it's full of good hardworking people."
good,"As an overall, the pay and benefits were fair to poor. Free services were great if you lived in the footprint, if not you could stream. A call center is what it is, customer call when they are not happy. and that will go on I had a good shift that I liked, many new employees did not. The closing of the Livonia, Mi call center was hard on many."
good,"Hola, mi experiencia en spectrum fue agradable, aprendí a desempacar y montar las cajas en los raptors para que pasaran también pase por el arrea de las cajas de internet, Muy bueno eh sencillo."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Not your typical 9am to 5pm job. Overall the job offers great benefits and good incentives if you are able to meet your target and the company provides personal development training that will help you succeed in this kind of profession. Great co-worker!
good,"Spectrum is a good place to get your feet wet when is comes to customer services, repair and data entry, you must be able to accept to change at a moments notices"
good,"Spectrum came in and started to change things, you often wondered why fix something thats not broke.Other than that I enjoyed working there. Just wanted something new."
good,Spectrum is a fun company to work for. You are able to watch cable during downtime. The area is open and environmentally friendly. The focus is on providing excellent customer service.
good,"boss was great, the job was cool, but the company itself dose not care about the health and welfare of the employee.  Most (not all) routers have a power trip and over load the techs schedule. And although the upper management knew that we had really bad equipment that has been ""fixed""  it never worked and we were told to just lie to customers. I don't condone lying to the customers."
good,After 6 years and receiving a 4 out of 5 on job performance i have never received over $1 raise on a yearly review as an hourly employee. Spectrum does offer free internet/tv/phone for all employees starting day one of hire.
good,Not all what it is cracked up to be. Your day is spent sitting at a desk talking on the phone with mostly upset customers who are threating to cancel service.
good,"Honestly spectrum wasn't the worst, but the management was garbage, and the job was judged how many addresses you could complete per day which varied from person to person."
good,Seemed like a amazing career to start while in training. After training and starting work on your own you start to realize the micromanagement the company uses which can become very stressful. Loved traveling and meeting new people every day.
good,"Scan cable boxes and pack them into boxes, band the boxes and send back to recycled center . Pick up cable boxes that customers return to the cable center and package and send back to  recycled centers"
good,"Handles full service end to end billing related questions, issues and concerns ranging from general questions to payment related items as well as Cable/Internet/Telephone related repairs by troubleshooting with IRATE CUSTOMERS"
good,"A great place to work.  The company's culture is very inclusive.  The chances of growth is huge cause Spectrum is in 41 states across the country."
good,Nothing to add about this company.  I do not have anythin to say nor do I wish to share anything. I enjoyed the line of work that I did an I did anyjoy speaking to others over the phone since I am a people person.
good,spectrum commission is great. but the stress will get to you and drive you to need some time off in order to fully do your job at managements commands. When it was Time Warner it was a more manageable job and more laid back .
good,If your computer savvy and know about this industry you should do well. Co-workers were nice. Fast passed you have two weeks to catch on and then they want you on your own they may give  you another week to learn if you still are struggling they will move on and let you go
good,"This is a good job, but since the change from Time Warner on the employee side - things have gone down hill and expectations have become distorted.  Obviously the scheduling and booking people have never done the job, nor has the pencil pusher that creates the metrics."
good,"Overall this was a great place to work. Worked here 14 years as a TWC employee until the merger and was then played off, given and package and found work elsewhere."
good,I would still be working here if the location hadn't unexpectedly closed.  The work environment and colleagues were great.  The pay wasn't very good compared to how much the health insurance cost
good,"Most of the work is done outside so I'm outside in the heat, cold, and dark. Typical day starts at 12 p.m. and ends at 9 p.m. I go to different customers houses and troubleshoot equipment to get services working"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,spectrum has made major changes to company.  our customers are on the whole ok with the changes. we as employees have gone through a lot of changes as well.  My supervisor is awesome and the employees are great.  The leadership is doing the best they can with what they have.
good,This job is not a good fit for single mothers who are actively in their kids life. From the moment your shift starts your are expected to consistently knock on doors until the end of your shift which sound easy but can take a toll on someone for 8hours 6 days a weeks. Rather than giving the sale associate a task and to show their talent in sales it seems more forced and unhealthy.
good,"Spectrum is a good place to work.  They offer a full portfolio of voice, data and cloud services.  The most enjoyable part of the company is the true sense of teamwork."
good,Working for Spectrum taught me some great ways to actively listen to customers and really help them with their issues or concerns which allows you as the agent to assist in a  timely manner and leave the customer feeling satisfied with the quality of service through simply active listening.
good,"Typical call center, Drama, gossip. Management is really bad. Rules are really strict. HR is useless. The pay is decent, better than most jobs, But high turn over job."
good,"I worked at Time Warner cable before it became spectrum "
good,"Free cable, internet and phone how could you turn that down. Many awesome benefits and stock options. Nice enjoyable staff. Remember this is cable news but you could not tell that walking in the doors of the building. Staff and management is great to work with."
good,Nice place to work made some great friends. would recommend this company to anyone wanting to start their career and are willing to work hard.  Hardest part was leaving.
good,"Pay is good, benefits and felixibility are a plus. Very good place to build resume opportunity for advancement, opportunity for overtime and incentives for improvement"
good,"Because Time Warner Cable became Spectrum, I'm not totally sure how the company is now.  The pay was average.  I worked with some good people during my time there."
good,The work environment was stressful when I was there due to a high turn around rate. There is no room for advancement and the management is focused and meeting their agenda. Time Management is key in a call center and you cannot take too much time in the restroom.
good,"A typical work day, what I learned,  management, workplace culture, the hardest part about coming to the job, and the most enjoyable part about the job and I have nothing to day about my current employer"
good,If I had to go back I would. I don't like the pay. I liked that they paid for my education. They went with a third party and brought in a new set of rules.
good,"This is a good company, but sometimes the management can be very detached. Not all of management is this way but some management are very detached and willing to help you advance in the company."
good,Spectrum was a call center type environment and I worked in the technical support where I had to help with customers if they had issues with the cable box.
good,"I didn't enjoy my time working for Spectrum. There wasn't any real protection for the employees from dealing with customer abuse, the management didn't provide adequate compensation for a job well done besides cakes and candy, the benefits isn't all that great considering I'm left with a bill from my doctor and it wasn't covered by the insurance partnered with Spectrum. I just was very unhappy working there. The only upside is that the people there are so busy being abused by the customers that they have little time to start drama with their co-workers. I met some really awesome people while working there but other than that, I don't have anything fond to say. Wasn't for me but will work for others."
good,"Benefits and discounts are great. Compensation is decent. But when it comes to upper management, it's like the right hand doesn't communicate with the left, which can be very confusing for lower level employees."
good,"Great pay and benefits. Leads and Supervisor all very involved and willing to help you learn and advance."
good,This company is average....it is going to adjustment pains...from the merger.  What else do you want to know.  Why do you force us to answer these ridiculous questions.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Lately a typical day is very slow.  Very little traffic of customers coming into the store and the ones that do are only coming in to complain about the pricing of their service or to make a payment.  When it is busy the day goes quick but when it is slow, the day drags.  It is not very fulfilling to just take payments.  My job is sales but if you do not have anyone to sell to, you wont get to far."
good,"The first 2 and half years I worked here, I loved it. You could not ask for a better company to work for. You felt wanted, appreciated and needed. It was one of those jobs where you loved getting up, getting dressed and walking to that work van. Changes started happening and you could slowly see the downfall coming. Employees started being treated unfairly and management started making us feel as if we were just a number and replaceable. Teams lost all motivation due to new hours and work conditions. You can make good money working for this company and the benefits are great but the team and management environment is terrible. The new work shifts are also a joke, You cant take a guy who worked during the week and had every weekend off for years and throw them on a schedule where you work every Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. No more weekends off unless you burn your vacation. The work is easy, the people who run it are not."
good,"I was a legacy TWC employee before becoming a Charter employee.  "
good,When I worked there it was called Time Warner Cable.  It was a great experience and a great atmosphere.  Management was very kind and helpful.  Good place to be.
good,This company seemed like a great fit but the work culture seems antiquated.  For this to be a leading Telecom company that requires their office staff to come into the office is puzzling to say the least.
good,"Faced paced and high expectations.  Big team and collaborative environment, with solid producers needed from individual contributors and upper management."
good,Good money if you could sell. Stressful. A lot of drama working in a call center. Supervisors were ok. I learned a lot regarding customer service and how to deal with rude and disrespectful customers.
good,"Answering inbound calls, handling cable issues. Scheduduling trouble calls to send a tech out to get equipment fixed, I feel no one was ever on the same page which made the customers even more angry"
good,"I worked for bright house years ago before spectrum took over,. I heard that they laid off or fired most of the bright house employees and brought there own colleagues in from spectrum elsewhere"
good,"Made outbound calls to people.  Primarily tried to sell cable internet.  Hardest part of the job was making cold sales to people.  Work culture was good, management were very encouraging."
good,"Getting to make your own schedule and be your own boss. Education on all the workings of the company.  Management was great, Team players and always willing to help."
good,i did really like the people i worked with but the managers didnt know how to coach very well. i saw 4 or 5 people leave the company within the time i worked there.
good,"Good for fresh sales rep from college, no so much for experienced employee. Your sales are depended upon the tech installing your order correctly. Too many variables that can go wrong between a sale signed and order installed."
good,"The focus at Spectrum is not on ""are the customer needs met"" but on how fast can you take care of what the customer called about and get off the phone, making the customer have to call back if he thought of something else."
good,"Spectrum was Time Warner Cable when I worked there. It was a nice place and offered many benefits. Overtime was great around the holidays. Scheduling was hard for those with small children, but ok for the most part."
good,good company to work with and can gain experience on how to troubleshoot cable issues. Learned how to check cable issues. Work on both their techinical and customer care.
good,Spectrum was fine to work at but stressful at times and pay did not reflect the stress level we were objected to. Shift hours were good so it allowed to have a family.
good,its ok sometimes we would have to go way out of our way for meetings and that was crazy because of how much driving we already do as a representative.
good,"Good Benefits:"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,i loved working for the company they offered home garage of the company vehicle and the wages were competitive and fair. its stressful and fast paced but not overwhelming. most of the management stays out of the daily affairs. and about half the supervisors did a great job and really helped the techs under their supervision.
good,"busy days"
good,"customer service is not for everyone so always have a backup plan."
good,Spectrum is okay as far as call centers go.  A stressful job by nature. Calls came come in back-to-back.  Management does seem to be concerned.  Ok job.
good,"I have been with Spectrum since they were Time Warner Cable.  Since the merger of TWC and Charter, the company culture has evolved greatly into a more fluid structure; that is, we don't get communication about what is going on until last minute, and then we have to adapt immediately.  Communication about vision and direction is always changing, and about half of the time we hear those changes.  People hoard information, and there is a more tense atmosphere of uncertainty that now pervades the company."
good,"shift bid/ worked 8:30- 5:30 shift, store closes on Sundays, pay was hourly plus commission. very fast paced and very stressful, nonstop customers complaining about bills too high."
good,"The company was promising until after integration with TIme Warner Cable, and then top down communication became horrible and focus on getting things done the right way became secondary to appearances and politics."
good,Spectrum is hard work. If you're willing to work its a great job. They give you room to advance. I worked with a lot of good people. I had an injury and they were very accommodating when i needed temporary disability.
good,Time Warner Cable was excellent. This was a temporary assignment. The manager and supervisor were excellent. They were very flexible and worked with the employees and temps
good,Its a great job that pays decent. The perks of the job really help the overall job. It can be taxin to work in crawl spaces or attics especially in the middle of summer.
good,"When a family death occurred, was given 3 days of bereavement but because I was within my first 90 days, I had to split my time off, couldn't be with my family.  On top of this, they require weekly coachings which focus on what you do wrong.  They will fire you if you do not adhere to their business practices which are not always seen as ethical."
good,The mission of the company at least in the area I work is not customer or employee satisfaction but in fact how to make profits for the company grow by cutting salaries and extending work hours.
good,"I resigned from Time Warner Cable during the transition with Charter Communications.  I have no history of work experience to share.  During the first few months of the transition, I did not experience any negative impact to my job or the ability to perform my job."
good,"When I began working there, it ironically was the best job I'd ever worked for.  They started ensuring that we were properly trained to do our job.  After working there a number of years the environment deteriorated.  After the merger they gave us more and more responsibility, in order to tackle the problems that multiple companies have, which I felt they should have handled each company separately as it increasingly became more frustrating having to learn the various software and tools needed for each separate company.  During this time, because we were having such a difficult time due to poor communication skills and lack of training on these new tools, our performance as a whole dropped significantly.  They decided to micromanage us in order to ""fix"" the problem, which only made working there even more frustrating and stressful.  I was taking a programming course at the time and quit my job at Spectrum in order to focus on the class as it became increasingly difficult to handle both."
good,it was an ok starter job out of the military.. no room for promotion... was asked to leave my child at home alone so i could make it to work when they changed my schedule the day before.
good,"This is a good place to work for. If you work at night please be aware of the badge might not work, I got terminated because of it And they are very consistent on attendance."
good,Employees are certainly replaceable.  No loyalty.  Back to Back calls with no relief.  Customers are allowed to talk to  you any way that they would like and you have no recourse.
good,Go to the job site was not bad but keep the track and the runs was no that good the pressure  is big and they spect to us work so hard that we not even  have a live ...
good,"telling you more about a job I did over 8 years ago"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,This is a great place to work but salary may be a little low for some. There is plenty room to make commission so if you love to sale then this is a great place for you.
good,Free cable and internet along with benefits. It's a fast paced job and its revolving every single day. Lack of communication between departments. All new hires have a work horrible shifts
good,"Each month sales reps. are issue 500 leads. It's our responsibility to sell and install as many new customers as possible. Each day sales reps. have to devote a minimum of 6 hours in the field and can't go ho,e before 8:00 pm. The most enjoyable part of the job is in part the new people you meet and the amount of money you can make. The hardest part of the job is the late hours, the hostility of some people and the fact that you have to work weekends."
good,Company is working its way through assimilating the mergers of Time Warner Cable and Brighthouse Networks into Charter Communications.  Management is moving quickly towards being data driven but product development struggles with process and policy.   Company is all on shore which is a great benefit to the IT and Engineering departments.   Many of the voice and data products are behind the telcos but the fiber build out strategy is setting the stage for long term success when new products are finally launched.
good,This job was good under old management. Customer service has gone down but the price has gone up. Pay wasn’t very good.  Perks for my position were awesome.
good,"I work overnights with this company in a busy inbound call center, helping to resolve alarms for our customers. I've learned many new skills, mainly patience and the importance of staying calm in emergency situations."
good,making calls to current and new customers for service. I learned how to become more competent on phone sales.  the management was very knowledgeable and helpful. the job was fun and rewarding. the hardest part was learning all the different computer programs.  the most enjoyable was talking to people.
good,"Ongoing cable equipment issues always going on and there was part time fix for it making customer very angry and hard for reps to handle calls, with the lack of communication between employee and management."
good,I enjoyed working there and being able to advance my career throughout the course of 12 years.  They invested in the individuals strengths and fostered a great team culture.
good,"stressful job, but you can make good money. fast pace inbound call center. located downtown milwaukee. you get free services. you get 2 15 min breaks and 1 hour lunch."
good,"Overall, a company that financially rewards its employees, while treating them badly. No work from home, business-like dress code, top down scrutinization of every single action. All potentially service affecting work is reviewed by C level management . "
good,"Being a seasoned employee from Time Warner to Spectrum, the company change was not positive, lost wages, and higher targets made very difficult to achieve goals."
good,"I worked for Charter in Asheville, North Carolina, and also in Hickory, North Carolina. It was most definitely a learning experience. Up to that time, I had not worked in the telecommunication industry at all, so everything was brand new for me."
good,"Charter is a fast-paced organization and the people there are intelligent, friendly and results-oriented."
good,"If you have a family or another job that you depend on for income, Spectrum is not the place for you. It is consuming for one to try to manage their hours to work and have family time."
good,"Spectrum is a nice place to work. I happen to like how they do shift bids, the incentives are great, the vendors for lunch are good, and I like the way we get paid"
good,"Very rigid guidelines that dont entirely make sense and the management works on outdated methods that you never train on. The job itself is fine and they teach you everything you need to know, but be prepared to be doing things incorrectly according to the numbers."
good,this job isn't really for me the pay is okay the work load and the goals are kind of out of reach for people who are just starting . but overall its a good company to work for
good,good place to work with a lot of overtime if you want it with great benefits. Good training if you do not have any experience and they do offer courses for paid advancement.
good,I worked as a Dispatcher. I learned several programs and how to communicate with stressful customers. Management was very informative. The Culture is pc based.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"You will work a lot as an employee, but you will also gain a lot of knowledge. Great company to work for, excellent benefits and 401K package. I would definitely refer"
good,"It's a large company run with a 1970's corporate culture. Not progressive, not flexible. That mentality works for some, but not so much in this day and age. "
good,This employer houses a merry band of hard working people. My coworkers felt more like comrades in the field. Working for Spectrum is no different than  any other large company. The hierarchy is definite and apparent sooner than later.
good,"A typical day involves talking to contractors and working on the computer looking at maps. I also communicate with customers and give work to the contractors. I have improved my computer skills and learned how to bid for jobs, as well as how to map designs for the new cable. The management is currently poor. The culture in the workplace is always at a high-stress level. The hardest part of the job is all the computer work involved with the job; including making spreadsheets and the current system we use. The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with the customers and contractors."
good,"I could not complain about the work. Being with customers. installing and repairing telecommunication services. Love working with people, though management is a different story. Very hard to please"
good,Before the merger the compensation and management was workable. After the merger upper and middle management jumped ship as Spectrum acquired a lot debt from the purchase of Time Warner Cable and another cable company.
good,They were great to me when I was there as an intern. Really nice people and made me feel very comfortable. Was able to get out in the field and learn stuff about my craft at the time.
good,It was great when I initially began working there several years ago. As with any organization people and management and owners change. With change came reduced growth opportunity.
good,"Your experience will greatly be determined by the supervisor you will work with, which may change every few months.  Policies and procedures constantly changing."
good,A typical work day included 4 to 6 accounts all at different addresses.  I learned how to best manage my time to be the most productive. Management was at times supportive and other times not so supportive.  The workplace was docile and our team was cohesive.  The hardest part of the job was the weather.  The mot enjoyable part of the job was customer interaction.
good,Use to be equal opportunities for advancement based on performance. Has change and become younger get promotions and older get to work without opportunities for advancement.
good,"Decent place to work for. Voila, in view a humble vaudevillain veteran cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vestitudes of fate this visage no meer veneer of vanity."
good,"i did not have a good experience there, employees are over worked and under paid. i would not recommend anyone work there. They micri manage their employees"
good,.Long hours for the week and very competitive atmosphere.  It is stressful and you have to meet yous sales quota to get commission pay. Management tries their best to work with you.
good,Good benefits and free cable and internet . Company lacked good leadership and career advancement. Very stressful work environment and commission structure changed as much as the Texas weather.
good,"Since the merger the uncertainty has been stressful. This is my second position eliminated since July 2017. After 18 yrs it’s hard to start over."
good,Work was fine. They are not local anymore. I dont know how this company is to work for as this is basically a completely different company all the way across the country.
good,"This is a fast paced job with ever-changing rules, policies and procedures.  The call center has changed ownership several times and the technology advances at a rapid pace."
good,I like my hours but the drive for me was a bit more than i wanted. My manager worried about the numbers as he should but at the time they were difficult to hit sales numbers. I personal did great on the c customer service numbers.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I worked as a technician. I was given months of training before I started working. The hours were pretty terrible and exhausting, but that was more of a personal issue. Many people thrive in that type of environment. The work wasn't hard. But it got very repetitive and boring very fast. They offer a lot of opportunity to advance and learn more."
good,While working at Spectrum I met a lot of great hard working people that have taught me many valuable lessons throughout my career. I am thankful for those lessons and will keep learning along the way.
good,it is a very very nice place to work. And i got cable out of the deal so there you go. The place is good to work and Im just writing and here we are done.
good,Spectrum is a cool place with a chill environment. pay was good with commission as well. The staff were nice and always were willing to help when needed.
good,Working at Charter Communications was a great experience. I worked there for 15 years and worked my way up to Senior Production Manager. While working at Charter Communication I gained vast a amount of experience as a employee and manager.
good,"At times it can be very stressful with deadlines to meet"
good,This company provides lots of great benefits. It is a very sales focused company. I found that the environment is not quite what I was looking for in my career.
good,"As a customer service rep. you are answering calls at a really fast pace.  You login into your computer and phone system. You are helping customer with their bills,  service issues."
good,This is stupid. Stop making me write these mandatory reviews and allow me to continue with the task I am trying to complete. The first one did not aggravate me nearly as much as the second. So help me God if there is a third.
good,"I have not worked for this company since 2003, I do not know much about it anymore.  While I was there, it was a fun place to work.  Company was sold and my position was eliminated"
good,"Although they have good benefits, they are poor at training & expect you to learn the majority of your job functions on the fly or over someone's shoulder during outages. Not very proactive, extremely reactive."
good,I didn't enjoy the Sales Environment while working in Tech Support. I enjoy the satisfaction of helping others. The Sales just applied pressure and made myself feel that I was unsuccessful.
good,"Senior tech who used to work for Bright House Networks. Work environment before transition was worth coming to work everyday and always had an upbeat attitude. Post transition, management became less helpful. Workload is expected too much for the pay. Overall, decent job with room for advancement, but it is self-progressing. Have to take courses to move up in company."
good,"Good position with good benefits. Work can be challenging, you might not get the schedule you want as the business has weekend hours. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, but that is with all jobs."
good,"The title explains it all. The culture of the call center has changed between the migration from Time Warner Cable to Spectrum. We're paid less, the calls are more stressful, and management doesn't seem to genuinely care about improving the atmosphere."
good,"Great place to work, people were awesome to work with, benefits were good, and if you ever needed help with a job someone was right there to help, recommend them to anyone."
good,"Performance metrics driven call center, where every month reviews are done and if performance is not met , discussions are had about warnings and coaching opportunities, and eventually if numbers are not met leads to termination."
good,"New management after acquisition of Time Warner does not understand how to run such a large, diverse company.  Poor decisions and hastily completed projects cause duplicate work."
good,"It was a great place to work before the merger, now with the constant changes coming from upper management you don't know what the next day holds. No consistency"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Spectrum was a decent place to work. The environment is pretty laid back. Great benefits and room for advancement. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to assist the customers with their needs.
good,do not wish to talk about it. very stressful work place dealing with customers  was rough poor sups no help never understands it was a very stressful place to work for me
good,"CNN Digital has a great work / life balance. As the industry is constantly changing and so to is CNN with balancing technology, business models and of course it's journalism."
good,"not possible to advance in position no sick time no vacation weather depicts schedule , when it rains cannot work, subcontracted and always sent in circles"
good,"my review  Thank you for taking the time to read and evaluate my resume.  I have spent many years practicing and developing my skills in the sales industry.  One thing that I have always found to be the best method for selling is that people buy from people they like and trust.  If you are not trust worthy or professional then you will find this career to be very difficult on top of being very challenging.  As a seasoned sales professional, my attention to detail and follow ups have allowed me to give the best customer experience that I can.  I allow my customers to see that I am on their side and invested in their best interests.   I know that if they are not bought in or understand the value then they will not make the buying decision.  I hope that I get to meet you and I look forward to the next steps in this process for your company's candidate search."
good,i worked with my manager and supervisor for 10 years. And worked for them for 5 of them. So when my wife was diagnosed with a incurable disease. I asked if they could help me get a more family  friendly shift. They said they would do anything to help. Well they did not . in fact they blocked me from have a shift change and denied a promotion. when confronted about it . they said it would hurt there metrics to much to lose me . so i tried to transfer to another area . some how they were able to stop that too .so i had no other option but to find another job. its not like i could have went to HR about it it was 2 against 1.
good,I loved the cable job but it was just not worth the salary with the amount of work we do. i wouldn't mind to go back and work there if they offer more money
good,"Working for this company now is  very stressful you don't know day in and day out whether what you were doing yesterday will be different today , which is okay at times but not knowing if you did something wrong only until someone finds out and by that time you have been doing it wrong, meaning they are never PROACTIVE, THEY ARE A REACTIVE COMPANY."
good,Sprint was going under so much change and still is and I don't recommend unless you are working for a short transition since it is a two way street and you can always move on if you find a better contract before they terminate your contract!
good,ok job but of redundent but yet fast paced. you get 8 hours with and hour for lunch and job is number driven not really about making customer happy. its a job
good,This is a billing call center where everything that you do is looked at and rarely are you able to make everyone happy. It is rare to get more then one thumbs up during the day.
good,"Working at spectrum has 1 major benefit. Free cable and internet and phone. When talking with customers, its usually about some sort of price increase. Either from spectrums yearly price increases or if your still on the old Time Warner Legacy services, your promotion runs out. So you have alot of angry customers calling about their bill going up and there is very little you can do unless the customer is paying more than 220 a month."
good,"Time Warner Cable had a good business model and treated its customers and employees fairly.  In a environment of healthy profit margins, it is disappointing they could not fight off the acquisition monsters."
good,"The company was Time Warner when I worked there and they changed it to Spectrum. When it was Time Warner Cable, they had many statistics you had to reach certain numbers. I always reached my goals, but you had to really focus to reach those goals."
good,"Nice Pay, Good hours, nice benefits. It's a cable company, you deal with customers and technicians 8 hours a day. Nice work environment. Management listens to suggestions. Some benefits and perks of dealing with multiple personalities, duties, stressful work hours, and an abundance of work has been removed from the supervisors pay, so moral is lower than usual but it's work, gotta do it."
good,"learned how to stock"
good,not a good working environment . lack of communication and management skills   . when issues are brought up no resolution only blame and unfair actions taken to the work force . faulty equipment and system failure resulting in unfix able or recurring customer problems on a daily basis .
good,"Working for spectrum in the three different departments that I have worked at has been productive and helped me grow in many aspects. Its a fast multi tasked environment that I enjoy. I enjoy the troubleshooting while at dispatch. Enjoyed the administrative duties as a WFM admin. On my current role I enjoy the basic project management duties I have learned, invoicing reviewing cost estimates and a different perceptive of all spectrum has to offer."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I worked at Spectrum's Vancouver, WA billing call center. (Previously Charter Communications) The center probably has over 500 employees on site throughout the day with different supervisor teams from 10-20 people each. A typical day would be clocking in as soon as you get your headset and gear set up and immediately taking inbound customer calls. There is a very strict schedule with 2 breaks and one lunch period on a full time 40 hour week schedule that you choose from a list of available options upon hire. Depending on the day or season there may be opportunities for OT or VTO if you feel the need to take off prior to the end of your 8 hour day. Days can get very stressful just because of customers treating you like dirt sometimes. Other days can be great if you don't get any irate customers and you typically enjoy providing quality customer service. You will learn a lot about how Cable TV/Internet/Home Phone billing works if you're previously unfamiliar. The management I was under treated their teams well & tried to uplift & build their representatives however I have heard poorly about other coworkers under different supervisor teams. The workplace culture is of a typical call center, no real other way to explain it. The hardest part of the job for most people seemed to be keeping your emotions in check while interacting with such a wide variety of people. I personally didn't have any real struggles. The most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with the occasional very kind customer or seeing that the opportunity to take VTO & go home early was offered because of an"
good,Was great at the beginning.  However soon found out that they were constantly overbooking calls and never had enough employees working to cover the calls.
good,"Working for Time Warner can be very stressful and long days. Especially , when there were rainy days or blackouts in random neighborhoods. I was fortunate to learn alot about cable and wiring, which I shared my skills and longtime experience with other workers and new hires. The hardest part of the job was entering into homes that were not satisfactory to cleaning, but I overcame the challenge by working expeditiously with cautious. Overall, working for Time Warner was a great experience, I've enhanced my customer service skills as well as my wiring and electrical skills"
good,Great Benefits. Micro Management to the max. Taking time off is looked at as a weakness. Supervisors given minimal training on how to interact with reps
good,"Charter is definitely a good place to work, you are paid well, generous amount of time off and room for advancement. "
good,A typical work day is very busy and hectic. Customer service is always busy on the phone with customers. You learn how to manage you time and be patient.
good,spectrum is a cable company and is a decent place to work for but it has problems with managment. the cable field is a great field for someone who wants a challenging field.
good,Prior to Spectrum it was Time Warner Cable. The company was very competitive. There are friendly competitions between the employees. TWC gave bonuses for sales.
good,"Working around the clock to remotely troubleshoot and log end users issues in a ticketing system. Using phone, email, and Skype business chat as means of communications in a fast past environment. I did serve as a direct liaison between customers, field technicians, network engineers, and the IT department so that we as the second largest cable provider in the USA may keep our guarantee of 99.9% network reliability."
good,Being a field personnel is relaxed as you don't have to report to an office daily unless you're being micro managed...The fleet was severely outdated for 8 years before they slowly started replacing them and I blame local management for that as they should be requesting them but they were afraid of loosing their job... Seriously you think a customer wants to see you drive up in a junker vehicle so they'll expect that type of service... First impression is  important and you don't get a second one so let's do it right the first time....
good,Specialized skills required. Spectrum is wiling to train on these skills. Electronic components for specialty productions. Probably no longer called Spectrum.
good,"A typical day at Spectrum is basically taking calls and handling customer's concerns and issues.  Randomly call volume can escalate due to an outage or due to a trend with a specific channel, phone or internet service.  Everyday is different."
good,"I did my job, I liked my previous roles better. I worked my way up from the call center to employee account. I won awards for my work often. I have my picture posted in the Halls as the top performers."
good,"I worked as a Senior Technician at Spectrum.  I work 4/10 hour shifts per week.  There are days per week that I work overtime due to the lack of communication from the dispatchers.  Overall the job is okay, but it feel like there is no opportunity for advancement."
good,The greatest benefit of working here is the cable service. The customers are extremely rude and nasty for no real reason. ALOT of the customers are lazy and just really don't listen to any instructions that they are given but then want the moon and the stars for services like on demand.
good,"As a customer service rep you're on the phone taking back to back calls. A lot of rude customers. I learned a lot about troubleshooting internet & cable, of course. Training was long and exhausting. Hardest part of the job is letting people talk to you however they like. If you can mute people out when they fuss this will be a great job for you."
good,"within 3 months of being hired, my department closed and many people were laid off. Instead of being laid off, I was transitioned to another position. The position was less pay, but also less stressful. There was always talks of other closings and more buy outs which kept a lot of people on edge"
good,"Overall an ok job if you like sales, and quotas, it was a stressful environment to say the least, trying to meet quotas to get bonus checks on a monthly basis was kind of stressing, knowing the pricing was a major downfall because its over priced."
good,"It is a call center, there is a fair amount of stress and the pay is decent for what the job is. I worked there when it was still Time Warner Cable, I am unsure how it is under the new ownership."
good,My time at Time Warner I learned alot  I worked in different departments. Office became a family environment among the employees. It is a high pace job. Had to keep pace with new technology. Always new things to learn. My fellow employees were  like family. A plus free or discounted services for employees.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"It was a good place to work. The winter was harsh trying to get to work, but overall, the management were understanding. The people all got along pretty well."
good,"The beginning and end of days were questionable, and having one day off in the middle of the week is awful. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and interacting with customers."
good,"I learned that if a company is about to be bought, transition challenges are imminent. The most challenging part of the job was having 3 managers in less than one year."
good,"This job is extremely stressful. You will feel like all you do is work and sleep. You get yelled at, belittled and cursed out 8 hours a day by customers. There is zero time between calls. As soon as the call ends with one person, someone else is already on your phone line. They are strict with stats and if you don’t meet stats you get wrote up. And they take attendance very seriously. Only apply if you really need money or want free cable badly. I worked here for years. I would never go back. They’re always hiring because people are constantly quitting all the time."
good,"The merger between Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications caused lot of confusion within the various sales departments. Young inexperienced workers seemed to prevail. Low wages and lack of advancement was also an issue. My department, IntelligentHome, was told for months that the company was coming out with a new compensation plan. Instead, the company terminated the entire department."
good,"The work can be stressful, but the pay is adequate with numerous opportunities for bonuses. The culture is very professional and it can be a great place to work."
good,"When I worked there, it was Time Warner Cable, not spectrum, and it was my first real career job, after high school. I enjoyed it for the most part, but like any other company, there are bad days as well."
good,"Before Charter purchased Time Warner Cable, TWC was a great place to work. The management was excellent, the benefits were great, my coworkers were great. We actually got things done. It was done extremely well and quick, we had a very efficient team."
good,"At the time working for this company taught me customer service, how to work in a high demanding environment along with how to handle demanding customers."
good,"The training received was extensive. "
good,"It was over the phone repair work. You take calls, fix cable equipment. As with all customer service the hardest part was dealing with angry customers."
good,"Challenging and interesting place to work, but company put pressure on reps when matters happen out of their control, but they are rated accordingly, which can eventually cause them to lose their job...for example if a customer call back before 7 days, the rep gets a low score, and/or rating..."
good,Fast paced and ever changing! They actively and consistently support all efforts to simplify and enhance the customer experience. The role is to provide good customer services.
good,"Spectrum is a good place to work for a while, but is only good long term if you are looking to move forward, and that is a slow process. The pay does is not really commensurate with the stress and work levels, and the metrics are poorly balanced. Benefits (especially medical) are only so-so. But it is a good place if you can stand the first few years, or if you have the skills to move ahead into leadership positions."
good,"Due to the recent acquisition of Time Warner and Bright House Networks, Spectrum is still learning on what the best practices, policies, procedures, etc. should be. This not only applies to the company, but in all departments. With this, comes of course a ""not too friendly"" of an environment. I'm sure they will eventually figure it out as they work their way through it."
good,"Because of a Union dispute over health benefits and pension, I have been on strike since March 2017.  Parent company will not bargain in good faith.  Retirement hearing scheduled"
good,Currently on strike since March 2017.  Union dispute over health benefits and pension.  Scheduled for a retirement hearing in November.  The parent company refuses to negotiate.
good,"I loved working here , until one day the manager called us in and said  that they were making reductions in the work force and unfortunately i was one of the people that got cut .."
good,"Working as a dispatcher daily for Spectrum wouldn't be a bad position if we were paid for the workload that we put up with. We are currently correcting orders that others are messing up, and we are also accommodating same day appointments where we don't have the man power to do so. We force overtime on the technicians unintentionally and it isn't fair to them as workers. This puts a lot of stress on us trying to meet everyone's wants and needs. Things get overlooked being in this department and it is up to us as dispatchers to make it happen no matter how complicated or stressful the situation is."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Very stressful work with poor management. The work hours were long and they would mandatory one of your days off leaving you with one day of rest............................
good,"I used to love going to work. However, Management needs to appreciate employees, let them do their jobs, listen and learn from them, and stop micromanaging"
good,"Previously constantly laying off persons for various company wide objectives. Aging and Insurance usage was a factor in deciding who to keep at the company.  "
good,please stop please stop asking me stupid questions about a job I don't work for anymore. I worked for time warner I cant tell you anything about this company. Please stop Please stop Please stop trying to have me answer things about this company
good,"things I did not agree with, but working with my customers was great, I enjoy working with my customers specially helping my Spanish speaking customers. I enjoy and got along with my co-workers. I never had any issues with my peers or customers."
good,It's been over 10 years since I last worked for Charter/Spectrum so I have no idea what the current work situation is like. This review is irrelevant.
good,I enjoy my co-workers and my working environment but the training and tools I need to be successful in my role has been lacking. The leadership doesn't spend enough time learning each team members style.
good,"Great company and place to work for a "
good,Co workers and management are great.  The job functions can be difficult if you do not train and learn all aspects of the job.  Great job for college students.
good,"Big company with room for growth ..Workplace culture was friendly.,  Management was supportive, Learn a lot from new and expanding technology.Great place to work for."
good,Corporate Transition - Growing pains exist with the merger of the 3 companies.  All will work out eventually but in the interim things are somewhat stressful.
good,"Fast paced & detailed work placed, quotas make job stressful, excellent opportunities for advancement, variety of workplace incentives, detailed training"
good,lots of available programs to offer although at times very confusing to explain. affordable options available for clients to market their business. Available sports options for clients
good,"While I enjoyed helping customers resolve their issues, I did not like the constant pressure to try to upsell products that the customers may not be interested in having."
good,Great training but they were going through management changes so we were a remote location so we kind of got left behind after training. Great employees to work with.
good,A great place to work. It is fairly easy to be hired as an entry level agent and move up with the company. The call center is open 24 hours 7 days a week so schedules may vary.
good,"Processed payment with in-house computerized software package.  Balanced accounts"
good,company was much better when it was Time Warner Cable once charter spectrum took over morale became very low no time off phones for meetings or to discuss problems to try and make things better. no appreciation employees that had been there 7plus years have all moved on barely any tenured agents left but I couldn't handle the constant micromanaging to even good employees it also depend what supervisor you get.
good,"Management was very mature, overall the company was great, the hardest part of the job was knocking at 12 noon and knowing no one is home until 5pm or 6pm"
good,"They want you do a lot of work in a very short amount of time. You only get an hour to do one job. Which supposedly includes your drive time between each job. But unfortunately there is not enough time for each job, when you want to truly do the job correctly and be the best you can for the company and customer. Management will blame you for you being late or your jobs not being done properly, even though the route of the issue all starts from time."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,The job itself could be very demanding but they employed some very good people. Managers were very helpful as we dispatched Tech's for the entire state of Michigan
good,"I did learn a lot about tv,phone and internet product and have carried that throughout life.  It's really just a job if for nothing else. I was there when it was TIme warner so not sure how Spectrum has revamped their programs"
good,This was the second go round with Charter for me both times i was there for 5 years and the job moved out of state. Working as a dispatcher was a great expiernce.
good,The overview of job was good place to work. The work load was not overwhelming. The company provide good benefit was place that was good on moving around
good,The work/life balance wasn't great.  Long hours and little pay was the name of the game.  The managers didn't treat you well and your best interest wasn't taken into consideration.
good,Great staff with excellent potential for growth.  Great support team and excellent training.  Worked within a team environment and advancement opportunities are available.
good,"excellent place to work and great pay"
good,"I have nothing to say good about Charter Cable. TWC was alot beter to work for we had better benefits. Also people are worried about there jobs they do not know from day to day if they are going to have a job, It is very tense all the time."
good,I worked for a dozen managers and all were on point. This last one was retired in his chair he played video games and went places no one knew where he was
good,Very complicated order details and codes not enough support for dispatchers who need to move  extremely fast to answer phone call  and resolve technical issues
good,"OMG., I do NOT want to do this. I do not care about this place and you ar e REALLY wasting my time and frustrating me. This is NOT relevant to MY job search."
good,"Good place to work, Also a great place to advance to make yourself better and make more money. Great place to meet new people. On the job that the main focus to make the customer happy and explain everything to them."
good,"Handled incoming calls from customers with questions about service issues or questions about their bills, or adding/downgrading services. This position can be viewed as difficult at times since it does deal with customer service."
good,"This could be a great company to work for, but too many mergers, buyouts and consolidations make for too much micro management."
good,"Again, forced reviews of previous employers is something that is a waste of time. Make it voluntary if you want truthful results 100% of the time. Now please lets move on. I love how your robot thinks it knows what a quality response is."
good,"I worked for Bright House Networks for many years before we were acquired by Charter and turned into Spectrum.  Spectrum is very different from Bright House and I will forever miss the way things were.  Today, tasks are monitored and micro-managed.  In my department specifically, front-line supervisors are either inexperienced or are not willing to help their team, nor do they know how to deal with the changes or prepare their team for change.  When change happens, it's very sudden and not well thought out or implemented.  I worked my way up through an exciting career path into an amazing and well paying job where Bright House respected and cared for me.  Now Charter (or Spectrum) wouldn't even bat an eye my way if they even knew my name.  We are no longer a small-chain cable company with great customer service, instead, we grew into a monster that doesn't know how to deal with the massive workload it entailed.  For those of you looking for an opportunity within the company, unless you live in Denver or St Louise, you will not find very many opportunities outside of technician and customer service.  However, the entry pay is great and the benefits are even greater!  Healthcare, Dental, and Vision is inexpensive and well covered. 401k is matched dollar-for-dollar up to 6% along with a free 3% addition paid for by the company into a separate 401a plan.  Cable and internet are provided free with discounts to increased speed or phone service and on-demand programming. Everyone starts with 2-weeks paid vacations which increase 1 week every 5 years (up to 5 weeks total).  Paid Sick"
good,The front-line employee/Supervisor/Manager is bogged down by policy making it difficult to service the customer. Business Class was better than Residential in this regard but eventually became like Residential.
good,"There's tons to do at Spectrum.  As a seasonal employee, I felt like I was thrown in to the wolves.  There's not much consistency among the housekeepers as they'll tell you one thing and teach you something else."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,typical day is many projects and many groups competing for resources.  there are some gaps/challenges in the organization..not a lot of direction provided by management
good,The job is very fast paced and stressful  long hours lots of moving parts lots of different types of equipment to install also was physically challenging
good,great perks on sales. bonus and commissions a little lower than it used to be. overall not a bad company. the hours was the biggest issue. working until 1am or midnight
good,"I spent little time as an employee of Spectrum/Charter.  It was a significantly different culture than Time Warner Cable.  They did not allow for flexible hours, telecommuting, or a relaxed work environment, however, I did not work at a Spectrum office so I would suggest doing further research."
good,"At this time I have not worked for this company, I do want to let you know there commercials are very appealing, I certainly be open to work for this company, along with that said I would certainly be interested in the install portion of this company for starters, I would certainly like to learn the ins and out of what each department does on a daily basis"
good,Time Warner now Spectrum was a very competitive place to work.   Very stressful and male dominated environment.   Time Warner did have good benefits at the time.
good,"Since Spectrum took over for Time Warner Cable many Incentives are gone, more stressful, got rid of a lot of departments so career advancement is small"
good,"A typical day was receiving difficult calls that none of the customers service were working (.i.e. phone, internet, cable) Some customers did not want to pay there bills, or deposit that was due to get service by the credit check. I always had trouble my supervisor with trying to sell services because you have to sell products at least 15-20 per day."
good,Charter's management philosophy is a tops down philosophy. While this may work in many cases it causes there to be a lack of leadership and decision making by mid-level executives and directors. There seems to be a bias towards caution based on the need to obtain senior leadership approval for almost any action that is not routine.
good,"Great pay, competitive work environment.  Have to be flexible because things are always changing in a call center.  Great incentives like trips and gifts."
good,"Very judgmental and deceptive.  Not willing to respond to any more productive ways of accomplishing tasks that would increase productivity.  Lots of favoritism towards ""chosen"" employees."
good,"Typical work day would be 9-5"
good,Regular day go to customer homes to fix problems with cable or make install for customers mangers were good good working culture co workers were good good benefits.
good,Working there at the time it was called Charter Communications. You had to sale on every call. Selling a land line telephone was hard since technology took over.
good,Enjoyed the outdoor work environment. I loved traveling place to place which broke the monotony. Every location posed a new challenge and met new people.
good,"I enjoyed helping customers, although, making money, was, it seems like, my only priority.  I understand we had a quota to reach, but, my manager insisted that I spend the least amount of time on the phone with customers that had issues - especially if they weren't making ""us""  money.   "
good,"Definitely a good company to work for if you're looking for a full-time position, that provides full benefits. However, meeting all company metrics can be unrealistic and stressful."
good,The company allowed you to use you technical skills to try and fix the client's problem over the phone. If you couldn't you would roll a truck asap. The company had good benefits for those you needed them.
good,"A typical day for me involves a lot of prospecting to potential customers in an assigned area and follow-ups with interested parties. I am learning a lot of direct sales and marketing strategies to shorten sales cycles while setting accurate expectations. "
good,"For Syracuse, it is a good place to work. Only problem is if you want to grow and/or advance within the company you may have to move out of state. This is not for everyone."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Can be stressful at times but overall not bad to work for. Good benefits, good people to work with. Has career advancement options, flexible with scheduling days off or shift swaps."
good,"A typical day at work is busy. The management is ok, considering there has been drastic changes to the company. The workplace culture is a bit conservative."
good,"Time warner was ok, they gave you plenty of mandatory over time and it is definitely difficult to be yelled at all the time from customers and technicians."
good,I enjoyed my job with Spectrum. Very rewarding however the hours were long and pay was very competitive. Would definitely recommend to a friend or family member.
good,"If you want to work long hours in terrible conditions for pay that doesn't reflect that, then this is the company for you. If you're lucky you'll get a supervisor that will stick up for you in certain cases, but don't count on it. the only saving grace is the (almost) free services you get. It is a very rewarding job if you can get past all the negatives though."
good,"you will get an education working here. be on time every day, meet the metrics they want. Supervisors are pretty good, some personality needs some improvements."
good,Company has mature workforce and stable management team. Company is facing challenges with broadband video and mobile services. Satellite service providers are proving to be strong competitors in this market.
good,"Reviewed and imported employee time cards into the Peoplesoft payroll system via Kronos and spreadsheets completed and approved by supervisors. Checked figures for accuracy and necessary approvals. Reviewed payroll documentation for accuracy through InfoCentral audit reports and makes any necessary adjustments. Obtained necessary approvals. Printed and distributed payroll checks to clinic offices for on-cycle and off-cycle check runs. Communicated with the Human Resources Department to ensure the integrity of the payroll data including data related to new hires, terminations, transfers and rate changes. Made various updates as necessary."
good,"But due to the merger there have been many issues regarding management, ownership, and overall culture and morale. I myself have landed on a great team with great leadership. They have given me the opportunity to lead and to be lead, while giving me more responsibility than anybody anticipated."
good,"Great benefits. Free cable. Great compensation. Excellant location, close to my home and family. Paid vacation and sick time.  Great extra paid days off."
good,The company environment has recently changed a lot. It overall can be a great atmosphere. A lot of tenured agents. There are one point more advancement opportunities but that has seemed to recently change.
good,"Time Warner Cable was a great company to work for, with a great work culture that was fast paced, competitive and productive.   Team work was the status quo.   Once Spectrum bought the company the culture completely changed."
good,"Promoted sales of cable television, high-speed data service and digital phone services, Provided suggestions to save customers from disconnecting or downgrading services whenever possible"
good,Company is all about the bottom line which is numbers.  As a supervisor I was unable to coach or discipline higher performers while management would look for any reason to fire lower performers.
good,"Fast paced work environment with high call volume. Procedures are constantly changing, and management does a mediocre job with keeping agents updated on changes."
good,"I loved working for Time Warner Cable.  Charter has been a terrible experience.  Terrible communication, they cut pay, gave worse hours and made more work.  So, essentially I now work harder for less money."
good,spectrum is a a place for cold heartd ppl they dont put there customers first as well its boarder line harassment customer det upset when we dont what they want before we can proceed you first 5-6 min of your call is trying top keep the cutsomer with services that not and high prioritiy
good,There are great (easy) days then there are stressful (difficult) days interacting with multiple customers at their homes or places of business but even more crucial completing the work tasks necessary. I have the freedom of traveling from job site to job site on my own with no one to look over me as I work or to slow me down but there are various elements which can alter my performance. This includes the weather outside or the state of the interior and exterior of the house or building.
good,As a field technician your duty is really stressful dealing with irate customers due to lack of information by the customer service. The field technicians are always wrong in the eye of the company. They always find a way to blame the field technicians and they don't admit that the problem is the system.
good,it is a good company.  took by charter communication Inc.  have to move to Denver.  Not sure the company in Denver.  Hope they work out.  The earning will be low.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Very layed back work environment. Offer incentives and reward goals to keep things interesting. Everyone works as a team when needed and the trainers are amazing
good,good culture and nice place to work but have found it really hard to advance or move into position that I am qualified to do. At times can be frustrating
good,crew members were always the best but did not always have support from managers while in the field on sales calls.  Overall a good place to work if you are a go-getter!
good,Corporate level management needs to listen to the ground level employees and understand the needs of the agents. There needs to be a way that we can get an open form of communication
good,The transition from BHN to Spectrum was a challenging but rewarding experience.  Having been working with the same team for 30 years was an amazing journey.
good,The change from TWC to Spectrum was a little shocking.  Spectrum is an excellent company to work for.  The mixing and transition went very well and I would work for them again.
good,management helpful but work nearly non existent.  tend to be on hold with dispatch for an hour and a half minimum. piece work pay not worth the time wasted in a day sitting around and waiting
good,"Due to the size of the merger when Spectrum purchased Time Warner Cable , the transition for current Spectrum Reps was frustrating due to our inbound call center number was having a major affect om our commision an how we were being paid. Mid month changed goals to a whole new format while how your commision would be paid had not changed."
good,"I never actually worked for Spectrum, so I am not sure of the great updates they have made. Time Warner Cable was always very flexible with their employees which made it very easy to succeed at the position."
good,"Spectrum Outside sales is a cut throat sales job, not for the week of heart. Direct sales in general is very stressful, you work long hours, in the rain, snow, heat etc.The strategy is based on a 3 pass system and you are assigned 300 to 500 leads per month. The base pay is good, commission is great but hard to attain if you do not put in the work."
good,"Have to have a good attitude with people in general to work here. Calls are hard sometimes, but if you keep a smile on your face you will get through them"
good,"Expected to come in and complete your job. Answer clls make appropriate recommendations or information within first call resolution. "
good,Spectrum acquired Bright House Networks effective May 2015.  My dealings with Spectrum only relate to their takeover of Bright House Networks.  Therefore my contact with SPectrum hs been minimal.
good,"I really like the job. It helped me improve my English speaking skills and it also was my first job. I loved the culture, there were people from all over the country."
good,Nothing special regular retail management.most enjoyed cartoons.Overall satisfied with the work and pay too many years have passed cant remember many details.
good,"I worked here when it was Time Warner Cable in the Florence office and it was a nice place to work besides the sales quotas, and the different things you had to say during the calls, and how the monitored everything. Upper management was kind of typical for a big business. Benefits were great as in health, dental, vision, 401k. I just couldn't take being micromanaged. I'm sure it depends on the person. - Former Tier 3 Agent"
good,I worked at Time Warner as a temp job as an accounts payable clerk. I learned how to work in a big corporation with lots of other employees. I learned a great deal from other co-workers who had been in the field for over twenty years.
good,Spectrum has multiple locations. Each location acts slightly different. Some people fit in better in other areas. In network engineering they are doing a lot of work.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I am forever grateful to have been able to learn and grow in this organization, however, as many organizations do, it grew and was sold. I hope the best for this company."
good,"ever changing communication and entertaining company, both physical and mentally challenging fixing entertaining services like TV, Internet and telephone"
good,You are paid a low wage and treated as if you are easily replaceable. The company will say they respect your family life but then in turn work you seven days a week with low wages.
good,"I am just not a salesperson. This was a great company to work for, but it is greater for people who can sell. I'm not a salesperson, and preferred social services. There was nothing negative to me about the job. I enjoyed it, but needed something more."
good,"Provides a culture that thrive on delivering result, excellent service to subscribers and employee oriented. The work environment enable employees to share best practices and new ideas."
good,"•	Communicated effectively with customers to inform them of features, benefits and the use of all products and services offered by Time Warner Cable"
good,While working here i learned that the billing process for cable is very different. I had to explaining different things that were put on and promotions that have fallen off to customers. The management was not really ever seen. Hardest part of the job is telling customer that their promotion fell off and now their bill has sky rocketed. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to lower customers bills.
good,Over the years more and more was expected to the point that goals required by management were often unobtainable. At the beginning the company was customer and employee oriented. They became only concerned with the bottom line and the stock price.
good,It's hard to write a review when a company is changing day by day.  Which is why I'm here.  My job is not the same as it was when I was hired for this support role.
good,"As with most jobs, there are good days and bad days, depending on one's position. The people are great, but sometimes direction is confusing and hard to understand. Overall, though, it's not a bad place to work."
good,"Benefits are great and some perks with cable services. I worked for Time Warner before Spectrum took over so I am not sure if the benefits and perks are the same. There was a pension after 5 years vested, 401k and stock options. Discounted cable/internet and phone service."
good,"I worked as a tier 3 tech support technician in the middle of the TWC/Spectrum merger and Spectrum and the job was just fine. The pay seemed as though it was quite low for the area I was in due to costs of living but it kept me afloat. The work was generally alright but most of the time you'd be penalized for things completely out of your control. The free cable service was nice, but that was about the only very good thing about the job."
good,I worked for time warner. I do not know what spectrum is. But time warner was a good job with possibility to make good money and have good hours and home time.
good,"Free cable, Great pay and Wonderful Managers.. typical day of Retention is always keeping customers happy.. Learned CRM very well.. Hardest part of job was not able to offer existing customers the great benefits new customers were getting.. Most enjoyable part of the job was turning a disappointed customer into a happy customer with VALUE of his services he or she may have within 1 phone call.."
good,"Great work environment.  Great people to work with.  Upper management tends to micromanage leadership, which is a huge turn off but besides that, it is a great place to work and will be in the coming months as well.  Big changes are taking place."
good,"Merger with Brighthouse Networks and Charter caused many lay offs, lots of people kept in the dark about important information. Tasks and responsibilities added to other departments without adequate training or time."
good,"I loved working for Time Warner before the merge. Work was enjoyable, our compensation plan was great and they work with you on your schedule. Since the merge things just haven't been as enjoyable."
good,"Its an ok place to work but if you aren't one of the managers favorites don't expect to move up, even if your performance is exceptional.  They have several break areas where employees can relax, including a ping pong table, pool table and xbox one.  Holidays are usually catered if you volunteer to work and there are vendors there every weekday to purchase food from if you prefer not to bring your own."
good,Management was preparing to sell the company and decisions were short-term focused rather than strategic long-term decisions.  I found it difficult to focus only on short-term success.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Good benefits...at least when I was there.  Good health insurance, and decent pay.  One perk that I really enjoyed was the free Internet and cable.  Very fun."
good,"* High volume of inbound calls assisting customers with high"
good,"Its a foot in the door"
good,I use to work the phones and help customers with problems and concerns they were having with products and/or services. I also received training on different new products and service.
good,"Long days on the phone.( Back to Back Calls) You have strict metrics.  Most of your customers are angry due the incompetence of the company which includes  phone agents, techs that go to the house and just how the infrastructure is. "
good,"A typical day consisted of checking in techs with paper work, verify for correct billing codes, make correction if necessary, filing paper work. Taking any payments and applying to customers account and making deposit ticket.  Do daily and monthly reports. Handle trouble calls by phone."
good,"Cant complain too much. Decent company, decent pay for no degree. Have recommended and would again. Great company to work for."
good,If you like taking calls all day and management over your back for being 1 minute late from break. This the place for you. Free service though
good,Micromanaged on everything that is done. Rules are made one day and changed the next. Nothing is stable. People coming and going. Used to be great company before was purchased by Charter.
good,"Time Warner Cable is a great place to work but to much rewards and kudos go towards upper management so more often then not moral goes down. Wake up get dressed walk out to your van you took home, then head to your first job though your days are 8 hours they often overload you because they predict you will have a cancel. so you will typically work 10 hours of work in 8 hours and clock out for lunch but still work so time frames are not missed."
good,I feel the same way working at the CSR position as well as the Business solutions department. I hated working there and it made me sick to think of going there every day.
good,"very hard to advance, i had all my medical forms filed for missing work and they still fired me. was extremely hard to juggle work and home and the supervisors were very opinionated and one sided"
good,dealing with incidents in a great evironment made time go by fast. Great workers to work with. i would recommend it to anyone.
good,I enjoyed the opportunity I had to assist customers with bill inquires and the opportunity to help them decide cable and internet services they would enjoy.
good,"The pay is great for an entry level position. The benefits were awesome, there was even a 401k matching program which is always awesome! The training period was well paced. Managment could use a bit of work, the only reason I had to leave was due to the schedule after training, mine was 1:30 - 10p. I have small kids at home and this conflicted with my home/work life balance."
good,Long physical days / technology changes daily / managers are sometimes not qualified ....overall the work experience can be satisfying ... training is very good
good,I like the people and some management.  Training wasn't very useful and requirements changed when you were in the call floor from what you learned in training
good,"Great work environment. flexible schedules, the managing team excellent. Really professional group of people to work with on a daily, Have the ability to take on any challenge is important in the workplace especially twc."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I did not enjoy working there because it is a call center. I found that workplace style did not work for me. Some people prefer to talk on the phone for 8+ hours in their day, more power to them."
good,My job consists of eight hours of taking phone calls from customers who are having issues with their billing or equipment and need assistance in resolving those issues while at the same time maintaining a low call handle time and high customer service rating.
good,"the call center is ok"
good,"Overall the job was ok, but the constant change in required metrics was difficult to keep up with and some were unrealistic for the role. I was hired as a tech support representative/adviser, but I was constantly asked to sell products and upgrade clients. This requirement was disclosed at the time of hiring, but I was made to believe that it was not a metric that my job depended on. As time passed and metrics changed, this was no longer the case. Additionally, as mentioned, the metrics changed on a monthly basis. One month one stat would be required for us to meet at a specific goal, and the next month it wouldn't even be considered part of our metrics. This caused confusion and discontent between employees and management. The manager I worked under was very erratic and never felt like she supported me as an employee. I felt like she wanted her team to fail in some ways. She was very difficult to have conversations with, and not an approachable person. She made working for the company very uncomfortable and not enjoyable. Your manager should be one of your biggest cheer leaders who is there to help you succeed and if they do not then they are not doing their job. Their metrics depend on your metrics; if they are not effectively helping you obtain your goals within the company then they are not being an effective leader and manager. There was very little that I enjoyed about this job. The benefits were the best thing, and the only thing I would ever recommend someone to work for Time Warner Cable for."
good,"Stable job and fun environment. Fun work experience . Very fair, equality. Credibility good products and services decent salary"
good,Company issued tools plus company van with gas card. Able to take van home. Work week is 4 days 10 hours a day. 3 day weekends.
good,See my previous comments as they relate to this company. I did not work at Charter long enough to give an honest rating. I have no other comments. Time Warner Cable was a great place to work.
good,interacting with customers daily is the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job is making sure that the customer is completely satisfied with your work when a troubling situation comes about. The staff at Time Warner Cable are very energetic and great people to work together with.
good,"first technician to be promoted to IT coordinator.  Was a demanding position requiring a lot of hours to support all clients. "
good,I would like to say working for this company was a great experience! The job was a eye opening experience!  A great company to work for!
good,Timewarner was a great opportunity to work at but their management was very displaced. Upper management was being replaced too often so there was new faces everyday and the schedules were being altered to often.
good,My job was to retain customers and up sell them and become familiar with our products in order to sell them. The work environment was fun and everyone was a team player!
good,"•	Manage team of 25 direct reports to achieve daily/weekly/monthly goals"
good,"A customer care agent responsibly and efficiently resolves billing and technical issues for customers in a call center environment.  You must have the ability to multi-task, carefully listening and absorbing the customer query while executing data entry or scanning for solutions.  Each agent is trained and provided excellent on the job training while coached by a supervisor on a weekly basis.  Agents are held accountable for job performance via customer survey, first call resolution, average handle time, productivity and compliance scores.  There ARE consequences for not meeting base criteria with these metrics.  Burnout can occur due to the repetitious nature of the job and the constant drumbeat of unhappy customers."
good,"Constant changes. Great coworkers and excellent benefits package. You get courtesy services, the health,dental and vision benefits are decent."
good,"Each day is never the same and provides a great variety of opportunities to learn new skills, sales techniques, and project management. Co-workers are easy to work with and very knowledgeable in their positions. The hardest part of the position is juggling multiple tasks for the same project, but is at the same time the most enjoyable as it keeps the day moving quickly and makes you keep your tasks and projects well organized."
good,The money and benefits were the best perks about the job the stress level and micromanagement is the worst. If no one wants a triple play gold and just wants internet then let it be!
good,"TWC has given me the opportunity to expand my knowledge and to contribute in a meaningful way. My skill set and experience is appreciated. The team communicates well and works well together. This particular group has a great collaborative environment. I can't speak to any of the other roles at TWC, but I highly recommend the Compensation Department."
good,"Overall easy work, very manageable, easily to be trained, management was unorganized with unethical verbal skills"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Great company to work for and lots of potential for upward mobility, good benefits, but the job itself its monotonous and hard to get used to. Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the policy in place of not being able to end calls with rude/abusive customers. I did like having so much control over my own work schedule, such as being able to trade shifts with others in order to not lose out on hours worked."
good,A good day at work for me is overcoming a challenge. What i love about my job is I am given the space and tools to become successful.
good,"Its decent for family and people just beginning out.  Progression is a bit confusing, but doable.  Strong work ethic is required for this job and discipline to do the job correctly."
good,"i do way to much work for only $14 an hour,  the amount of work isn't worth that little bit of money. that is the worst part of the job because it is to much work on the body"
good,"TWC stands for things will change which is very true almost every month something changes. either handling of calls, new regulations, change of metrics. best part of the job is the free services."
good,"A typical day at work would be,"
good,Advancement limited  Job security up in the air Benefit options limited Salary fair but minimal Leadership not available. Overall great company both with merger environment and leadership availability changed.
good,Overworked employees with the incorrect compensation. Co-Workers were mostly OK. (A lot of lazy folks) -- I did enjoy my job for the most part. The lack of professionalism was disappointing. Team morale was generally low with everyone being overworked and understaffed. Benefits were a huge plus for working at TWC.
good,"Long 12 hour days.  rotating schedule."
good,"This job consists of direct customer relations and resolutions with a support team to assist with the most urgent matters. It requires the ability to empathize and relate with your customers, as well as product knowledge. Not just the company's products but other companies as well. It is understood that hard work is required to succeed and solving problems is a must."
good,"As a Sales Coach, I am responsible for educating, motivating, and driving sales behaviors within southwest Ohio division of our compnay.  A typical day consists of working with customer service agents to encourage and improve their sales conversations with the customer.  Every individual learns and responds differently to ways.  I search and identify each individuals strength to develop and build on their abilities."
good,"TWC micro manages, and pay scale is low. You do receive free cable though. Work day consist of working with customers, taking payments and making sales"
good,"Time Warner Cable has merged with Charter Communications! Exciting changes are in the works, but for now, Time Warner Cable will continue offering our current suite of services to customers in our markets. In the coming months you'll hear more from us as it relates to network, product and service improvements. Whether it is new ways to enjoy more shows with unrivaled picture quality, better service, or faster internet speeds, we cannot wait to show you what's next."
good,Charter communications was a around great company if your have sales background really no help once you hit the floor. Small call center with only one supervisor.
good,basically your entire day your answering calls from customer either wanting to lower there bill or troubleshoot there services. most people are angry for one reason or another so your going to be talking to rude people most of the day.
good,"distinguishing a day at work, If can see somethings that can be changed for a faster paste or making it even stress-free less. because their will be times of showing co- workers to work starter not harder. When the part of the repeating the process again and receiving lots more to do is when team communicates to a single oil refined machine. That in it's self tells management that their is joy sharing the best part of the job"
good,This was a nice placer to work for. The envoirment was laid back inside the call center.  The calls were rapid fire in most cases but the enviroment was nice so it did help reduce the stress level.
good,"its a call center, there is a big brother is watching vibe. At all times."
good,"A typical day at work was never a typical day. Every day was different from the previous. However, I did learn key time management skill and how to supervise my own workload. Management was not always helpful with daily problems and sometimes it seemed as if they were the cause of some of these problems. My co-workers were all pretty good people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with longer shifts than expected and unpredictable weather conditions. The most enjoyable part was the freelance nature of the work."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Seemingly a good job but you have to let go of your personal life completely. No time for yourself. Going door to door working against customer rejection and working against your own company. People are more apt to call or go online to get charter. Not wait for someone to show up to their door. So you show up to a lot of people that have already called and placed an order.
good,"good company to work for, good benefits, Company is going throw a transition. Hopefully will stay the same. it is hard to get in. since they hire temps."
good,I dont really have much to say due to working for a 3rd party company this job was not the real time warner.. so i cant give a review on a 3rd party company because im sure the real time warner is not ran like the one I worked at
good,Great place to work as well as a lot to learn. Has great people and leaders to give you the skills that are needed to do the job. Also it is a great company to work for.
good,"I work in the Time Warner cable business for 10 years. I started in the retail department selling cable services in the retail malls in San Antonio,Tx. I learned how to approach high volume customers in the mall, and convinced them to sign for Time Warner services. As the years went by I learned tech support and also door to door sales. The management was great, they made sure we were making money and delivering great customer service. Co-workers were real professional and everyone work as a team. The hardest part of the job was collecting the full cash on delivery from customers before getting them installed. If I couldn't collect the full c.o.d., I'll collect a percentage of it to have the appointment more guaranteed to be installed. The most enjoyable part of the job was able to meet different people everyday over the phone or in the field. Sometimes customers would appreciate not just to talk about Time Warner services just to have a friendly conversation."
good,"I enjoy my position to be pleasant and I enjoy tackling all assignments with dedication, hard work, and a smile."
good,"great, wonderful company to work for, great hours, good benefits,etc. A typical day at my place of employment, answer inbound phone calls. Customers  questions in regards to telephone & internet."
good,The hiring process was thorough and well conducted.  Our group was able to have significant impact on our area of the business.   We were well respected.  It was fun to go to work and be creative.    Unfortunately the company went through several rounds of layoffs which included letting experts in different areas go and having poorly staffed groups (Corporate telecom team dropped for 9 to 2 people).  Development staff was outsourced.
good,"A typical day at work was always an adventure, because you never knew what to expect.I learned how to come out my shell through all the customer contact that I made on the daily basis. Management usually were supportive of us technicians, and had faith in us, because we managed our own time. My co-workers were great team players. The hardest part of the job was predicting how a route was going to go. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that I was like my own boss in the field."
good,"Provided outstanding customer service to callers regarding their services such as home security, cable, internet, and home phone."
good,"I was responsible for taking calls from customers to assist with any cable , internet, phone as well as billing inquires. My duty was to retain  customers as well as bring in new customers."
good,"if your IA1 basically you would be doing the same thing as the IA2 but you get paid less. You already getting paid lower than other places. they definitely have a preference for male staff, however there are a few females that actually do a better job tan the men."
good,"this was a great tech support job, I loved the benefits and the job. there was a lot of growth with the company and it provided a good salary"
good,"I already reviewed my opinions on brighthouse, I do not need to review it again. The company has great benefits and divides up workload poorly because it has high turnover in customer service."
good,Charter will work you until you drop.  The expectations for so few employees is way to great.  It might be better now that they bought Time Warner Cable and Brighthouse Communications..
good,"I have directed others to time warner cable and some are still employed, no guarantee your job is safe even after many years of employment"
good,Very fun place to work. I am in charge of over seeing the cleaning crew at night .I make sure the building is ready for the next event . I employee over 80 people . We are a seasonal job.
good,"I had a great experience there but I am ready for something different, I want to use my education in a job. I met great people while working there management was okay, Nigh shift not so great"
good,"A typical day is checking emails and planning where you will go and knock your addresses for the day. Sell customers cable, internet, phone, and security systems. I see co-workers once a week at meetings. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday it can also be the hardest because you never know who is behind the door."
good,"typical day included answering calls about cable bills. often had meetings about procedures and policies,"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,the pay and benefits are great but if you are a person that cant handle getting yelled at this is not a job for you. you take calls all day from guests that are having issues with their services and you have to help them fix it. there are many guests that dont care how hard you work they will blame you if you cant fix the issue
good,"Come into office at 8:30am, go onto CSG to look up business' that I will prospect that day. Leave office onto the field by 11:00am. Knock on at least 30-40 business doors. Either close on the spot (one stop close), or get business cards and email them later that day. Return to the office by 4:00-4:30pm and send emails to prospects. Close. close, close accounts on a daily basis."
good,TWC good  is a good company benefits are awesome. I was employed with TWC for 5 months only thing I could really say is communication between employee and supervisor needs to be a lot better.
good,"I start off cycle counting the warehouse making sure location match up to the inventory. I personally do shipping and receiving. Label product if needed and put it away thoroughly in the proper locations and consolidate as needed. I assists with any questions on the floor with other employees, email and receive and product and email personal as needed. I may train or assists if needed. There is know hard part about the job I am use to the fast past environment. I learned to be thorough and consistent in routine and details to make my work and work environment easy. My knowledge gets me respect from my peers where they can relay on me and trust me."
good,"This job is more like a come up job , you work there for moment and you move on to a better job for your needs and wants. Great managers who takes care of you , you meet a lot of different people . I wouldn't let this job be a permanent job for your life , its too repetitive nothing new and exciting."
good,Management was good. HR unhelpful for anything. personal time hard to get unless you plan weeks in advance. Customers are horrible.
good,Learned a fair amount of computers processes from this job which helped with my own person computer needs. Hardest part was working midnight shift at times
good,"Time Warner is undergoing some internal changes, its is not the best place to be for someone who is entry level and looking to start a family."
good,I learned to be even more self motivated. I am team player.I also learned sometimes people need a ear to listen to them when they are venting. Everybody is fighting a battle inside that we know nothing about so be kind to people. We should always treat others how we would want to be treated.
good,"Ability to multi-task is a requirement"
good,Average place to work with average pay.  The pay here could be better.  Management does not have a clue what needs to be done.
good,"A typical day at work would be exciting one day and down hill the next. For those that don't mind siting a whole shift in front of a computer and can handle irate customers every now and then this may be the place for you. I learned customer services in a call center is much different than face to face, you have to be on your toes."
good,"Proven record of building business relationships with clients, managing life cycle, retaining relationships, In addition, selling  into clients various value added services based on needs. Fast paced environment with high level of multi-tasking."
good,"Fun company to work for commission based environment, computer sitting  for entire shift..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
good,This job requires you to answer more than 50 calls in a day or depending if your part time or full time. It can be stressful when dealing with angry customers. The management team will help you if you can't resolve a problem with a difficult customer. It requires patience and one must be quick on resolving the issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you hang out with your team.
good,The people that work here were awesome. So much fun sharing the floor with so many people. Always an interesting day when you clocked in
good,"the co-workers are the best, always willing to help in any way they can, built great relationships over 30 years and are still friends with these people. I love TV so it was always exciting to be at the beginning of all the new or improved options of media. It is always good to continually learn new things on a daily basis"
good,I troubleshoot with the best of them. I can get your cable up and running in no time. I will detail your bill for you line by line and tell you why its gone up. Some people don't like their bills going up.
good,"answer phone calls, troubleshoot phone and internet issues, learn troubleshooting steps and techniques, accept credit card payments"
good,Very great compensation and great atmosphere. Chance for self development. Be prepared for the hardest job of your life
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"This career was fulfilling in some ways, and others were disheartening. I found the work environment as far as co-workers to be fantastic. Everyone was treated with respect and courtesy in almost every observable interaction. It seemed, however, that expectations had been set too high at some point in the chain of command, and those heavy expectations spilled over to those below. As we continued to innovate to reach the sights of our leadership, the sights looked ever higher. For the representatives on the production floor, it is difficult to keep up with the changing styles of support, but it can be done. For the Lead role, we were tapped to perform several duties, of which other similar call centers within Charter had several employees performing. Over time, this caused an uncomfortable work environment. "
good,My co-workers became family. Fun to work with. Just not enough pay or hours. The store manager was a great boss. The discounts that we got were helpful. Enjoyed the customers.
good,"It really depends on where you land in the company is it is so huge, but certain departments have amazing and inspiring leadership where others have terrible bullying management. By transitioning through this company I really did learn the difference between Management and Leadership. All in all its stable and your coworkers are usually friendly."
good,Enjoyed the job but the environment was very poor.  Ask for help and people would complain about helping their coworkers.  Everybody is supposed to work together
good,"Charter has a good product and always seem to be evolving and is now known as Charter Spectrem. Good Product overall! Management was great, open and fair."
good,Cutting Edge mass communication company for a service provider. Usually will do anything to satisfy their customer. On the edge of technology to bring their customers the best experience possible.
good,"great team and work environment with great benefits with a ton of support.  "
good,"I loved the people I worked directly with, and had a great time while working here. Great opportunity to advance and move to other departments once you gain experience. "
good,"Shipping and Receiving,forklift operator, making deliveries in company trucks,inventory keep company trucks, ready for installers, supplying installer's with all the equipment needed to perform in house and all outside installations, maintaining warehouse cleanliness, packing,pulling orders wrapping and labeling pallets. Learned different cable installation equipment and devices! Management was good. Co worker we ok. The hardest part of this job was counting large shipments. the most enjoyable part of this job was hearing funny story's from our manager steve"
good,no chance for advancement without changing shifts. supervisors are greta. constantly have more work given and less time to do it
good,The opportunities at Charter are endless. Its all of what you make it at Charter. Plenty of training on the job etc...The new CEO is definitely are making lots of new changes within the company as a whole
good,"a typical day at work n"
good,"No opportunity for growth and development"
good,"On average Charter wages are lower compared to other Service Providers.  However, Charter does provide an opportunity to gain experience in skill positions that may not be accessible at other companies."
good,"Very busy, a lot of troubleshooting calls, not a lot of happy customers, several complaints. The schedule I was working was not a good fit at all."
good,"High call volume, you have to ask permission to use restrooms, the bonuses are okay and you have irate people calling when they don't pay their bill and it is"
good,going to customers houses to install or trouble shoot Time Warner equipment. I learned how to hook up and install equipment for Television and computers. management works with you to create flexible schedules. Co-workers will help you out if jobs get too difficult for one person. the freedom at Time Warner was without question the best part of being part of the team.
good,Management and staff work hard daily.  Managers were helpful and available for assistance when needed.  Job includes troubleshooting and sales.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Everyone there is extremely friendly and upper management is very accessible. Compensation could be a little better but they are improving. Great benefits especially if you have a family.
good,"Working here was like a rollercoaster, there would be days and sometimes months of where the job was very enjoyable and fun to work at.  While at other times it would be super strict."
good,I learned how to have more attention to detail. requesting copies of checks and imaging customers checks takes a lot of attention to detail. High levels of confidentiality is a must as well.
good,"I moved over 100 miles away. I didn't have time to attain my goals."
good,Charter is a good company to work for overall. The pay is decent as well as the benefits package. It won't matter how long you work there because everyone is replaceable. Regardless of missing work for major surgery they will fire you if you do not return by the time they want you to.
good,"Over all the people were great and I liked working at this company. I only had a issue with using excel and access to do all the reporting when there are so many other tools that would work better for such a large company."
good,"Always Be Coordinating."
good,"A lot of freedom to experiment and pursue projects that one likes. promotions are not very well thought of but compensation is pretty attractive...work life balance is decent, you have still work in an office but can work from home when required. they always use the latest and greatest technologies so it a great learning environment."
good,"A leading broadband communications company in the United States, Charter today employs approximately 23,000 and provides services to more than 6 million customers in 28 states. Headquartered in Stamford, CT, the company is focused on integrating the highest-quality service with"
good,Fun work place with supportive management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew.
good,"This was an interesting position, though I felt the training was inadequate, and left alot to be desired. This contract could go alot further if employees were able to concentrate and childish behaviors were not tolerated in a business setting."
good,Money driven and goal oriented. Had to meet quotas and working in a noise environment. Worked with leadership and many training opportunities.
good,"liked being giving my work load , and begin able to complete them on my own, also helping people. We would work al over town, and  I especially liked solving customers problems as it pertained to cable."
good,This is a cubicle job at best and scapegoat at its worst. Most of the calls are people with complaints and issues with their own services. You are treated as if you are the reason for their troubles and demand a lot from you.
good,The company only cares about specific numbers and doesn't really care about quality service and the customers who acquire them.
good,"I had a great boss and a lot of opportunities here. Best part was being able to help people over the phone. My team was respectful and like family,and the community feeling we great between departments."
good,"While the people you worked with were great, only so long you can listen to listen to people asking for cheaper rate. You get conflicting request from management, they want you to save customer but don't want you to use promos."
good,Overall the call center life is just not for me. Its for folks who are monotone and operates like a computer. They tell you when tyo take your break and lunch. Sit at desk all day long.
good,"Starting out they say TWC stands for Things Will Change, and they do constantly. Shift bids are mandatory right after training. Bids are not dependent on seniority but on skill and other metric points. The metrics change constantly therefore so does your bonus and commission no matter how many sales you make. You have to wear multiple hats like tech support, billing, customer service, sales, retention, etc. I don't feel the pay starts out fair for what the company expects of your performance. As for raises it not near what you expect yearly. A typical day starts out with logging into multiple programs in order to handle calls sufficiently, the calls are back to  back. Hold times and transfers of customers to other department are frowned upon. The most enjoyable parts of the job are co-workers (they are very pleasant), the supervisors, and being able to watch cable t.v. in between calls. There are many perks like getting free pens from HBO or  coffee mugs, free lunch every now and again if you are willing to stay on the phones for half of your hour lunch break, and many raffles to get you to get more sales. The  hardest part of the job is dealing with irate or unsatisfied customers because I take my job personally and if there is nothing that the corporation does to improve their service your hands are tied.  The supervisors are great to work with however upper management is something else. It seems that the promotions are for those who get in good with upper management. Honestly the representatives are the forefront and take most of the brunt but I personally would never want"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Inbound technical support call center."
good,A typical day at work included taking an average of 45 calls. Calls can range from billing to troubleshooting. The hardest part of the job is handling angry customers however the pay is the most enjoyable.
good,fun work place with supportive management not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. The most enjoyable part was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them
good,"Direct sales is not for everyone. its one of those things that either you can or cant do. if you don't enjoy sales thoroughly, I would say this isn't for you."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. It was my first real job and allowed me the opportunity to grow and expand many aspects of my life and job experience.
good,large company that puts more emphasis on turning a profit that taking care of their employees depending what division you are attached too.
good,Good place to learn and develop skills. Large company with good benefits. Typical red tape for a company of its size. Dealing with angry customers not always the easiest thing to do.
good,"Time Warner Cable, is a great company to work at, it has vast opportunities for advancement. As a customer service representative you are able to communicate with regional customers. It is a fast paced position and closely metered performance structure (like most call centers). Also as a big plus compensation and benefits are top shelf."
good,Fun and fast paced enviroment and I learned alot. My analysis and presentation skills were really appreciated and this was recognised through out the company.
good,"the days are long and very busy.  Meeting people at the front counter is wonderful.  we take a lot of payments and set up a lot of orders for tv, phone and internet service."
good,Company is going through a lot of changes. My division is a creative and supportive channel. We work with all sales channels and develop programs to better the training of all TWC associates.
good,"Charter was a fair place to work.  I worked in in the sales call center and in direct sales, both as a supervisor.  The call center is an ever changing environment, especially regarding hours.  Direct sales had a high turnover due to the job description for the sales reps."
good,"I would be on the phone taking back to back calls from customers.I would handle all billing inquiries,sales,downgrades, account closures and trouble shooting"
good,"The job did keep you on your toes, handling multiple problems daily that were all different.  Did not feel like a family atmosphere there because of the amount of people, just a number."
good,"Typical big company micro management.  Great benefits."
good,"On most days people will complain about how badly managed they are and how senior leaders cannot agree on anything. Compensation is OK, but work/life balance is important in the company's culture."
good,"Appropriate compensation. "
good,It is a call center with very strict schedules. You can make as much as you want with how hard you work. Everything is very micro managed and they expect you to go off a script for every incoming phone call.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I enjoyed providing customer service to the customers especially those who were highly unsatisfied and turning there day around
good,"Dispatcher for technicians, put equipment on accounts as techs put in customers homes, answer telephones and did some filing."
good,"typical day at work is going to each customers house and resolving any issues with our service they are having."
good,"A workflow schedule is assigned each day due to the amount of people that are in the department. The department is production based. "
good,When I worked for Charter they were going through growing pains with a new call center in WA.  Within short period of time jobs were cut.
good,"Work with Customers as they come in the store, whether it is: assisting with billing questions swapping out equipment or educating them on our products and services. Effectively communicate product and service information, feature functionality, billing procedures and equipment usage to each customer."
good,"Typical week involved  receipt of assignments, with expected completion times."
good,"This job could be so much better, stability is not there, change is constant, always contradict themselves, one day they want you to be unique, the next day they want you to be scripted."
good,Great work environment and lots of things to learn about laundry and the different types. I was able to transport linen around the area. I drove a lot and don't mind driving so that was fun.
good,"I really enjoyed the time, the team and leadership at time warner.  Everyone works hard to accomplish the goals that are at hand.  Time Warner values its customers and the way it treats its employees."
good,This company does well in work/life balance and provides multiple opportunity for growth. I would recommend this employer.
good,"On many different times, customer would receive information in the mail, that customer services agent was not aware of, which mean the customer had a bad experience, having to stay on the phone longer while on hold and they agent going to supervisor hopping they may the information needed for the customer. And many times the supervisor was not aware of changes made. They have good benefits."
good,At time warner the only frustration you may have may be with management and the way information is given to employees on such short notices.
good,"Ever changing and customer service oriented company to work for. Free cable, internet at standard speed, DVR, and premium channels for employees. Lots of room to grow and departments you can transfer into, after 6 months that is."
good,"Fast paced work environment with good benefits and decent hourly wage. Little room for growth within the company. Can be very stressful at times trying to meet performance metrics, especially with the inter-departmental communication problems. Day to day work as tech support can be extremely busy or laid back, for the most part it's a good job for students if they also need a job where they can study and work."
good,"During a normal day at TWC taking up to 35 calls over the mid west region, ranging from tech probelms, billing,  disatisfaction with company and service. Goal was to remain customers with some satisfaction and resolution to any of there concerns. Hardest part is when you do all you can to keep the customer and they decide to opt out, or there complete frustrastion with company and still decide to disconnect."
good,"I would get to work early, leave late. Benefits were good, but they kept upping our goals and lowering our pay. I would go in at 830am have a line of people all day, not enough people working to maintain what was expected of us. Hardest part of the job was just the constant line of customers and the expectations to take the 15-20 min per customer and the line of customers that would get upset over the wait. Most enjoyment part of my job was when I was able to make a customers day by giving them a good deal, extra services. They smile, I smile."
good,"Typical day would be around 5 installs or 10 service calls. Started out with four hour windows ended up with one hour windows, sometimes mad it difficult to keep appointments."
good,"Large Cable company with very sales orientated goals for all employees. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Great pay and benefits, but the company likes to micro-manage, and is always constantly changing policies and procedures while you are helping out the customer. Supervisors and Senor reps never take the calls if the customer is wanting to talk to a supervisor"
good,"My day with Charter would start with me going out canvassing the neighborhood I was assigned then, eventually I would start hitting my doors to interact with my homeowners."
good,"I am a dependable, dedicated, and hard worker who is looking for steady work within customer service. I have over 10 years of experience of excellent customer service and can adapt to any environment while working under pressure. I have taken over 100 + calls daily with experience of MicroSoft products."
good,This is a fun and customer engaged company to work for. Every day is a new challenge and this company takes care of their employees
good,"I enjoy design and develop circuit boards. Here, I work in my own small R&D lab, which has adequate equipment for me to perform my duties. The people here are nice and always available for help."
good,"Average pay.  Good benefits  Some Opportunities for advancement"
good,"Typical Day"
good,"I was there for training only. I learned how they have grown and, how the CEO and other management really interacts with the employees. I really enjoyed the people I trained with. The Hardest part was getting so much  information in a short time."
good,it was a good job dealin with installing cable and helping people with issue good place to work and be happy also good knowledge
good,"Benefits were fantastic, they were good on the 401k. Mobility they were not as opportunistic. Job duties depends, but predominantly the masses were customer facing and as such taking calls."
good,Management is not required to know your job. I learned to interact and direct and organize my workday to meet company standards
good,"Inbound call center. Offer additional services, equipment, and features. Meet metrics consistantly and provide wonderful customer service."
good,"I found the work environment a bit harder to wotk for but this company compensated its employees very well."
good,"This is a typical, repetitive, unfulfilling call center sales job. The turn-over is very high, which is why they are always hiring and training a new class every few weeks. The money is the only thing that kept me here for as long as i did because I was one of the few top performers that actually made real $$. Benefits are excellent. Your schedule and work/life balance will depend on how you rank amongst your peers, as you choose your schedule based on performance.    "
good,Great learning experience and wonderful colleagues. Constant traveling to the data centers throughout the week. Lot of hands on experience on the physical routers.
good,"fun place to work , good company a lot of perks great benefits easy going  graded by stats the hardest part of the job is when you first start an you have to get use to the systems the many system that you have to go thru"
good,"Time Warner is an ever changing workforce. there are many pros, and cons in my current position. The biggest positives are the company vehicle, and the technical applications on work."
good,"working daily troubleshooting cable telecommunications systems and transmission lines, and interaction with customers on a daily basis. good pay and benefits but a lower end salary in the industry"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Typical day at work was,  a fast paced environment, constant workload with customer contact.  "
good,"My experience at Charter was a learning experience. The professional environment changed rapidly but it had its rewarding moments. I think if there were occasional training on sales techniques, the company could possibly keep long-term employees and make a difference with the sales outcome."
good,"The overall benefits are great for employees. However, the verbal abuse received from customers can take a toll. The only consistency is change."
good,Good small company to work for. Benefits were limited. Was bought out soon after I had started there. Was a close family type office
good,"A typical work day at Charter Communications consisted of taking inbound calls for 8-12 hours daily.  I learned the foundation of how to be an excellent salesperson.  Management as this company was definitely in a growing stage when I was employed, but they did a great job preparing us with what resources were available. My co-workers were enjoyable. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep the same amount of enthusiasm from the first call to the last.  The most enjoyable part of my job was speaking with different people on the phone throughout the day."
good,"A typical day includes billing issues, sales of additional services and repair issues.  The hardest part was dealing with outages in during storms and also slow internet speeds."
good,Was a nice place to work and learn about new products.  Gain customer service stills and multi phone system.   Working with several different departments.
good,"This company has awesome benefits. Easy going Environment. Enjoyable part of my job is that I have great Co workers. ..........."
good,Team work among the hospital staff. Great customer services. A diversity of people working for a common goal to satisfy the patients.
good,"Working for Charter was good because all of the knowledge and experience I was able to gain. Management was not as good as it could have been but wasn't so bad. I got along with all of coworkers."
good,I would dread going into work due to the high level of stresses. The managers were on your back constantly about selling products and services to customers even if they had all three service including cable internet and phone services.
good,You're looked at as a number and not a person. It's all about . what you can do for the company. Pay was ok b/c on top you got commission but if you won any prizes you were taxed. Oh yeah cant forget free services.
good,"Working with customers in there home is both challenging and rewarding.  Creating personal connections with the customer helps provide a better experience for both them and me.  Trouble shooting television, phone, and internet services provides an enjoyable and challenging day.  Helping customers through a frustrating experience can be quite difficult, but taking the time to do the job right generally leaves them satisfied by the time I'm through."
good,the people that i had to deal with was the worst part. customers were rude and gross and the pay was not worth it. you have to drive really far inbetween jobs and the insurance and benefits suck.
good,"Good job and benefits. Supervisor expect you not have a life,but it pays the bills and feed the family. upper mangement disconnected"
good,"Charter provides trucks and tools with exceptional training. Day to day routines are always different. Reliable, quality oriented company with room for advancement"
good,"My typical day is troubleshooting problems with television, internet, and phone. Everyday is the same, but every house and customer is different. There are a lot of variances to the work, and change is possible daily."
good,Long hours as a technician with forced overtime. a lot of customer interaction which makes the time pass for the most part but can be very hard work.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I really loved this job!! The enviroment is super welcoming and wveryone is willing to help!  The only thing i did not like is the sales. they push you to sell their products which i understand its buisness, even though it is the billing department sales is a must and if goals are not reached   you get the boot."
good,"Very high commission based, overall fun place to work. Lacking a few things to grow within the company.  High turnover, which is regular for a commission based company.  Just lacking the growth needed to pay the top reps, and keep the top people selling at this comapny"
good,"A typical day would consist of constantly checking emails, while taking Tier 3 technical calls for customer that may have issues that lower tiers can not fix.  These could be phone number porting issues,  internet being slow/not working at all or even node/hub issues that we escalate.  I learned quite a bit about networking within the TWC hybrid fiber/coax infrastructure using some great software tools that can let us see what a customers modem is doing on the node, or if a node is overloaded and needs to be split for better traffic.  I would have to say that the co-workers I worked with are the best.   Everyone was always friendly.  The hardest part of the job would have to be convincing someone else that it is their hardware/software that is the problem and not out equipment."
good,A lot of attitude from customers but that was to be expected. Great pay but they had a grading scale for good customer service on your calls that was sometimes too much to accomplish. You may be written up or threatened to be fired if your grade wasn't improved.
good,"The criteria for shift assignment is skewed so that the new people get the worst shifts. Hours are from 8 am to 10 pm, 7 days a week. Most likely a new person after training will end up with the closing shift and work every Sat. Pay is $11/hr + commission."
good,"In my current position: constant changes, as I coordinate day to day operations of Residential and Commercial technicians for the entire  Charter Texas Market."
good,A typical day is receiving orders. Picking and stacking them so they can be ready for shipment. Learned how to pick and receive orders. management was okay. they didn't help much. you had to work with your co-workers to show you how things go. The hardest part of the job is when some one put something in the wrong place and you pick the wrong order.
good,Historically have enjoyed and appreciated all learning and career opportunities presented during my tenure as an employee.  Working in an Union represented environment with a 45+ year counter productive influence has proven challenging to attaining and maintaining superior KPI.
good,"Very flexible lots of room to expand, Good company for those who enjoy there work"
good,Charter struggles to be the best within an ever changing industry. They provide training and you work within customer's home's and businesses. Sometimes the customers can be rude or angry and you are the contact- so that can often suck. But mostly they are just a normal Cable Company.
good,"- Answering Telephones "
good,"Typical call center environment, answer calls help with billing, equipment and stop clients from canceling service. Adjust service and products add or remove features. Technical support assistance moving and transfer of service. Co-workers friendly and helpful. Worst part of the job was the angry customers, best part was helping an angry customer get there needs meet and keep the service."

good,"This job was enjoyable and challenging at many times.  There were many calls regarding new sales, making payments, and technical issues."
good,"this job was terribly stressful, working with the customers at their rudest times was maybe the less stressful of the entire job. management was poor no one was on the same agenda as to what was supposed to be our jobs as retention specialist. supervisors never wanted to assist with customers when it was mostly needed which made customers upset because they felt like they were not being taken care of. supervisors and managers were nowhere to be found when in need of help with work in general. but would write you up if you had to handle the situation the best way you knew how but it was not what was being asked."
good,"its alright, people are friendly and there is lots of room for advancment"

good,"Every day, a field technician gets to interact with customers, use all of his/her skills and abilities while troubleshooting problems and make a difference. I enjoyed seeing the smiles on people's faces when I resolve their issue."
good,"Overall a good job if you knew what you were doing, learned customer service, being in strange houses every day, communicate with subs on a daily basis ,  Management was not good, co workers would never help out, hardest part of job was having to drive to the shop every Wednesday and sit through a useless meeting discussing nothing important, best part of the job was being able to have the independence and freedom to go about  your business during the day as long as the company didn't throw more work at you without calling."
good,Fun place to work at. really like working there.fun fun fun fufn

good,"1. You must be tough to deal with some of the customers that calls the line."
good,"Help customers with over the phone cable repairs and billing concerns."
good,"Fast paced environment, constantly busy, 4 day work week. Free cable and internet service. Department relocated out of Columbus."
good,"An average day would be answering billing calls where most customers are behind on their bill so much so that they are interrupted/disconnected. So you review with them about their payment timeline and go over any specific line item questions they have about their bill. There is a fairly loose scripting that needs to be followed and the primary goal is to give the best customer service possible in the least amount of time. Overall good place to work, but not something I would make a permanent career out of unless you plan on moving up in the company. There isn't a lot of vertical advancement available for getting promoted. Overall, the management staff know the calls can be stressful so for the most part they do everything they can to help you get through the day in the most positive way they can."

good,Job has its busy and not so busy times.  I am a temp and have only been there a very short time so I cannot comment more on it
good,Company owner might want to pay attention to continuous revolving door with employment. Charter in years past was always known as a great place to work. It was up till 2012-13 when a dramatic change came. Not sure it was the best thing for the company to have a high overturn in sales department. Work morale is down because you are forced to sell Gold to every customer by any means necessary.

good,"Working at Charter, the Customer Service evolved over my tenure, and I really enjoyed that. Teamwork was also great and often fun. The computer systems were problematic, with often severe latency causing issues, as well as poor to fair software implementation where programs often clashed, pcs would restart on their own, and software pushes required the user to be logged I rather than being done during non working hours. Lower management were often great, team coaches tried their best to help. Mid Managements sole purpose seemed to push an out with the old workers in with the new, less expensive attitude. With the right middle management this company could be great, They have the best home phone service and Broadband internet in the area, their tv offerings are on par with most other providers, and without contract which is a plus."

good,typical day at work is to answer calls from customers that had internet or phone related problems.
good,lots of perks but a lot the goals that are set seems to change everyday
good,"Company changes CEOs so often that there is never a clear direction for very long and then it changes.  They make rash decisions, although if you can get through all the changes, and adapt it is a decent company.  Have to be perfect in every way, and make sure you are in the right crowd in order to advance.  Benefits are good, longevity can be good, but once you have been there a while they will start finding ways to reduce and replace you.  They were good to me while I was there.

good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Work week day shifts begin at 8am or 9am. Morning routines include desk management and email review. Shift starts when the first call is taken. After call volume is between 20 and 30 calls. Each call required knowledge of cable and media communications companies. Morning emails review call numbers from the day before and sales strategies based on competitor data. Co-workers would chat between calls when available. The most difficult part of the job is time of information sharing. Questions would be asked in a company online chat where some questions would not get answered due to volume or personal accountability. Communication between supervisors and floor associates could be extremely minimal to 100% hands on. The most enjoyable part was the interaction with customers. Having conversations about products from television to internet data caps, friendly customers seeking help and service made phone calls very enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at work"
good,"TWC has a reputation for having the worst customer service. This might be true, due to the lack of training, fast growth and poor management. With this said, there are many good people that will advance not because they are encouraged but because they would do so in any environment. Benefits are good but 24/7 call center hours can be difficult."
good,I've had an opportunity to learn what it is like to work for a nationwide corporation.  We have spent several years transitioning from regional mindset to a national standard.

good,I love driving warehouse equipment so going to work is not so bad.Working off the internet is a plus sometimes the bugs can ruin a good work day but when you're in a warehouse theres always work to do.So if I'm on the the computer I'm doing something productive.
good,"Time Warner Cable is a very good company to work for, benefits are great and there are many other perks to working for his company."
good,Mostly the fast paced work day helped me have a better undrestanding of multi tasking at a whole new level. But I always look at challenges as oppurtunities.
good,I like the job and people. Its a comfortable atmosphere and a casual dress code.
good,• Process and post payments to customer accounts on a daily basis.
good,Very big company with an interesting mindset. There is no in-between. You either love it or hate it.
good,"A typical day at work is sitting down in front of computer with the headset on taking customers calls....Ive learned how to multitask and stay focused on my work. Management is easy going and easy to work with...My coworkers are the best...Love the teamplayer aspect in all of us....the hardest part of the job is the troubleshooting and walk throughs we do with the customers, knowing that we werent able to resolve their issue over the phone....the most enjoyable part is buliding those relationships and report with customers...."
good,"I never have any problems with Charter(company). I believe if the manegement implant more the originals rules from Charter(St.Louis), maybe can be more pleasant to work. But Charter open doors for me and my family."
good,Information in a communication center.
good,"This company is very informative and productive, they offer training on a daily basis to better serve the customers and to better learn and sell the products"
good,telemarketing cold calls trying to sale a number of diffent products from getting donations for non profit organizations to offering high speed internet
good,"collections customer service position, assisted clients with there past due cable bill. processed billing information for accounts that were disconnected to restore service"
good,"ok company good benefits, lack of management good money there were times that times were good and lots of time that things were bad,"
good,I enjoyed working for such a marketable company. On the cutting edge of communication and television.
good,Typical day starts with a group meeting and whats new with the company's new services and products. while working there I learned that it's a very multitasked and very cultural diverse place to work for. Most difficult part of the job is sitting for those long extended period of times but when solving and receiving compliments from co workers and customers on a daily bases it made sitting there a little bit more worth it.
good,"I enjoyed learning how to assist clients with their billing needs. It was an excellent learning experience that I believe applies to any position that I have worked in, no matter the title."
good,"Unclear expectations, always changing structure and process due to high turnover of Upper managment, Vice presidents etc. In the office Mondays and Fridays out hitting the streets Tuesday - Thursday. Great office loacation in dowtown Akron easy commute for those all areas near the highway."
good,"Working closely with customers via email, phone or face to face. Ensuring that all task where completed correctly an in a timely manner."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,This is an ideal environment to develop a solid base of technical skills.
good,"Troubleshooting many electronic devices such as an HD DVR, Cable High Speed Internet Modem, Digital Phone Modem, wiring issues. Also dispatched Field Technicians to fix problems that could not be over the phone."
good,"This was a temporary job, most of the time it was more training than actually taking calls and assist customers. However it seemed to be a good place to work at."
good,"Again had to be signed in to your phone and be ready to take calls at the start of your shift. Had to initiate a sale on every call whether the call was for a complaint about the service or not, Management met with us almost daily to go over any changes which was again almost daily. They drove us to sell and came up with a lot of new ideas on how to produce. Fun atmosphere on most days. Other employees were always willing to stop and give help if you had any questions on something. Hardest part of the job was upselling when the customer was calling to complain. Most enjoyable was having a customer call back to recognize your good service for them."
good,sit at a desk answer calls in front of a computer good people you get a chance to talk to a whole lota people
good,Performed basic and moderately advanced installations
good,I did not like this job. It was not for me. Coworkers are great and helpful. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the weather.
good,Ability to work independantly with opportunity for growth
good,"During a typical I take in between thirty to fourty calls. Being in the sale department, one's job is to sell customers desirable products that will accomodate their needs. After determining the, one should create a need for other products so that the customer will bundle products. The company's primary product is cable and internet service."
good,"Good company that offers excellent benefits. Friendly atmosphere,nice break area,helpful staff."
good,"Great co workers and supervisors, Learned all about cable and products. Lots of free gifts and meals. Hardest part was explaining to customers that they had to pay for installation"
good,"This was a very good company to work for when it was under the Time Warner, Inc. umbrella with Warner Brothers, CNN, New Line, etc. After spinning off, it became a different company. Massive lay-offs, getting rid of solid, educated employees and keeping some that could barely read. Treatment of employees became much worse."
good,"This particular position is for a Facilities Clerk. The supervisor in charge of that department is extremely unprofessinal, rude, nasty, and gossips all the time. She treats her employess like indentured slaves and disrespects them, which is why they all try to leave as soon as possible."
good,Charter was an okay company to work for. The only downfall was that every 4 weeks they switched your hours of working. This was hard to deal with as a person who was going to school.
good,The job pays well but mandatory overtime with little to no notice m as makes it hard to enjoy the fruits of your labor. This is high pressure  sales with no room to breath so if you are not the type of person who can preform under pressure  or take being micro Managed then you won't last at this job.
good,"The first two years are tough as you will be training, expect long days and lots of over-time. Once you start working keep track of your daily work as someone will be also with you. Management is a joke, but at least its a job. Your pay raises and incentives are work based and are sometimes unreachable. There is a buddy system with managers here. Watch your back, do what your told and you'll succeed.  Your job should be a stepping stone to get into another position or another company. Average lifespan for a position here is two years, change job titles frequently or expect a termination letter."
good,I liked My job and built a long career however with New management and leadership things change day to day making it hard to get a grasp of expectations. one day you have a priority 1 and the next it is a 4 yet was never communicated. I liked the challenges but working with leadership that didnt understand the issues was difficult .
good,Go in ANY department but sales. Make sure you invest in 401K at your job. And make sure you miss zero days and every job unless you have a doctor's excuse.
good,Working for this company you meet some great people that become friends.  When working you need to be open minded about change and being able to work in a fast pace environment.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Spectrum does not embrace remote workers, they have trouble collaborating between operating teams.  There definition of a value stream  remains much as it did 20 years ago."
good,The training was fun and was told all the things you want to hear. Once you are out of training you are not treated as well. The money was great if u can sell they way they want you to. Which means you need to be heartless and scammy.
good,There are some really good supervisors there that understand the stress of high volume call center that deals in customer complaints. Mostly though the supervisors are under just as much stress and are limited in the help they can give. Pay and benefits are great but the work is emotionally and mentally draining.
good,Benefits and extras are great  compensation is average at best. Leadership moves very slowly on new ideas. Our department has a micromanaging feel to it.
good,"The Good: "
good,"The role was new to the company and job description developed as we went, grew territory by 500% over 3 years and took on mentor role for new hires by the time I left."
good,"The benefits are legitimately the best benefits I have every had. Free cable, internet & home phone and benefits day one. The pay is also there, you can make good money at spectrum. However, the focus on mobile and the hours can be overwhelming. People quit every week, they just stop showing up. The job makes you earn those benefits/pay. Most people here work to get out of debt. The calls can be too much as everyone is not interested in mobile or cable. Most want internet only, it’s your duty to sell them what they don’t have. Most don’t want it and if they don’t get it, it’s your fault. According to the supervisors/mentors at spectrum. It’s really a luck of the draw job, when it comes to hitting the sales goal."
good,"high pace, customer is always above anything else, large amount of training. expected to learn all new programs, and tools. tools change often as do policies"
good,Great income terrible leadership. I definitely enjoy working with customers and troubleshooting. The leadership is terrible and bottom line they are more concerned about numbers then they are concern about employees.
good,"Working as a billing agent is challenging, the customers are often angry and upper level management does not give you options on how to work with the customer.  "
good,Spectrum was a normal job that required your attention and time.  Speaking with customer is on a daily basis caused you to have to be sharp and confident in your work knowledge
good,"Unfortunately this was not the job I was expecting.  The hardest part of the job, was the prospecting.  This was small business sales, and it was door to door canvassing areas to find leads.  If your ok with that go for it."
good,Good job. metrics are heavily focused on. Pay increases have been stagnate due to particular issues. Management is ever changing. But the actual workforce are a group of good people
good,They offered tuition assistance and constantly trained you to keep up with changes in the company and industry. The growth potential was unlimited and there were frequent opportunities for overtime.
good,"management was subpar, too many policy changes on the fly and no communication when some would take place because you would have a new policy a week or two after another on how to do a package install for a customer or agent."
good,Spectrum currently has unrealistic expectations of their agents. Most supervisors are decent. Management will lie straight to your face. You cannot trust anyone there.
good,"8 hrs plus sitting down answering costumer's complains. "
good,"The job have its stressful moments. It is always advised to take your breaks and lunches to revive yourself. At once time, spectrum had a pool table before the remodeling process."
good,Started there under TWC culture was amazing job was amazing.  Spectrum took over by by bonus' by by culture.  There was a whole new world. They changed us to tech support from billing. They did not cut pay but monthly bonus' got cut out.
good,They pay has consistently declined regarding the commission structure and it changes often. So many people take advantage of fake fmla and cause everyone else to work required OT.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"job is not extremely hard. the worst part of it all is mostly the scheduling, the shifts are not ideal and most oftenly takes away any of your free time"
good,"Ok place to work. They're very strict about your metrics. Especially the ones you cant control. Pretty good management overall. Just shos up, be on time,  and you'll have a job."
good,"Provided customer service in a high-volume call center environment."
good,Overall this is a great company to start off with. Great benefits and 401k. You are guaranteed 40 hours per week. Some sups do care about personal needs (kids) Sometimes their hands are tired so if you happened to be sick last week and your kids get sick this week be prepared to get written up thdoncarecare how sickly your children are
good,this company provides cable phone and internet . you deal with some very pleasant people and then you have the very unhappy customers that you try very hard to please
good,"Never seen a cable company, that bought out another company that did the same thing, and now trying to reinvent the wheel of how it's done, and it's  messy. After take over, they have changed everyone schedules twice and I'm sure more is to come. After 3 years, over 60 people have quite in my area."
good,spectrum has great benefits and great place to work with pay also I love the job I do dealing with customers on the phone the job can be stressful at time
good,"It's the schedule and days off that I didn't like . I had 2 to 11 Tues and wed off . I hated that schedule,  and u have to be there at least 6 months and have a good score card to do a shift bid if its available.  Its kool at first but then day after day ,customers calling in mad and upset cause their bill went up .... I'm too happy for all that negativity.  Normal call center drama or gossip . Not to strict "
good,"Decent, no advancement. Jobs kept moving. Management couldn't do anything. If you arent part of the main building you dont matter. Not willing to move to MO for a job"
good,"Intense stressful working experience, i really do not have anything else to say and i believe this should not be an option as a required field some changes need to be made"
good,I worked for Spectrum a total of 8 1/2 years.   I held down 3 titles over the years.  At times the job was relatively difficult but there was always a very supportive net to assist between coworkers and management.
good,"There’s a reason why most people who work in the video repair call centers have only been there less than a year. It’s stressful, turn over rate is absolutely atrocious. The pay is great but I can’t continue working until 12am. It’s hard on my body and my soul to be screamed at by our customers. Many times we can’t even give them the resolution they need or want."
good,"My biggest frustration with Spectrum is career advancement. This has gotten more difficult since the merger a few years ago. My immediate management is good, upper level management is sometimes a bit lacking, but not terrible. The work environment is good, and I get along with all of my colleagues, at least on a professional level."
good,"I worked at Spectrum for 6 months. All i can say is be very careful of the schedule you pick when you're hired. They may tell you there's shift bids and that those arent based on tenture...but it is. It's almost impossible to get a shift bid and expect to get backfiled for holidays if you're new so i suggest you pick an optional shift for your sake. Culture is great, alot of cool people, competition is high, though the turn over rate is great yet  people are still neck to neck with each other notsure about favoritism and all that i coasted away from drama if there was any..as for the customers and job itself, people will be people as customer service goes. 95% arent bad trust me and some will even tell you awesome stories just take the ""unpleasant"" ones with a grain of salt and you're golden. It's a good job just wasnt good for me for personal reasons."
good,"If you are looking to find a job that delivers customer service, Spectrum is a great place to start a career. Spectrum offers on the job training with opportunities for advancement. They offer free cable, internet, and phone service to their employees. It is very fast past where you will assist customers across the United States with billing and technical needs."
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers but there were so many restrictions,  including time spent working with the customer to resolve an issue,  that I felt the company failed at providing good customer service."
good,A typical day at spectrum is billing questions and transfers to different departments cause most calls are out of your scope of support.I learned a lot about the company and I also learned a little more about call centers on a different level when it comes to change.The hardest part about the job is the emotional stress of being cursed out and yelled at on a daily basis no matter how nice you are to customers but they fail to realize we are humans to.The most enjoyable part of the job is when they do things for the employees from the employee engagement team or things that actually help and benefit the employees.
good,"I would highly recommend working for Charter/Spectrum.  Large company with room to grow, the company does invest in their employees and promotes from within."
good,"I have worked with firewalls, load balancers, three tiered application stacks, disaster recover, cloud migrations, enterprise IT infrastructure environments."
good,"I only worked there a few months before department was transferred out of State.  Local management was great, but corporate management seemed disconnected from the local office."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"The benefits and pay keep me there for as long as I could last. Very enjoyable being on your own all day in your van and getting the jobs done. Some jobs were easy others would be a hassle. Management were good people but it seemed like everyone was just trying to get through the day. I'd ask for something I needed such as a new tool to make my life easier and it would never get to me, ended up buying my own. Would ask to go to classes and they would agree to send me to them and never sent. All the other technicians were awesome to work with, after awhile I realized they where just treated the same way I was when it came to tools, classes, van issues, ect.. I had more respect for the company before I worked for them."
good,"Spectrum continues to evolve and grow.  There are opportunities for growth as long as you are willing to continue moving.  The downside about Spectrum is the company is not open to working remotely, even though it is a telecommunications organization."
good,"Everyday was the same. I got extremely depressed working at this job. This is the job where I’ve made the money I ever made without a college degree but this was always the worst job I’ve ever had since I’ve been working. I worked in retention so we would have to try and save customers from disconnecting cable, internet, and/or phone services with Spectrum. However, the company rate is extremely over priced and there was no wiggle room to help customers. If you lost more than 4 accounts a day after speaking to more than 50 people you would be on disciplinary action plans."
good,"Stressful and ever changing, customers treat you well most of the time but there are the bad eggs. Mix of good days where you're home on time and then nights where you can be out past 11."
good,"typical day was assisting customers , repetitive work , many different cultures , hardest part of the job was being on the phone for 8hrs and repetitive work"
good,"Time Warner was an excellent employer.  While onboarding, my manager made sure that I was trained properly on the vast networks.  At the time, digital was just beginning to gain in popularity with clients so I did not sell this as much."
good,"Phone calls are automatically in ear no chance to answer. Don't get chance to finish previous call and you have another. Have to track everything you do, or bad reviews"
good,My position at Time Warner was dissolved when Spectrum took control.I started out with the company as a installation contractor from 2001-2005 then went onto a permanent position in technical support. When the opportunity arose I applied and was accepted in the workforce operations department. I was assigned to monitor call flow out to the vendors and maintain a great service level. I sent out hourly excel reports indicating all of the call parameters from both local and out outsources.
good,"The warehouse field at Spectrum is a dead end. It is hard to move out of the warehouse within the company, and you can not move up in your area. You must apply to a different location to move up in the warehouse structure."
good,"This job is stressful, but there are perks to the job.  There are good benefits and the hours are flexible.  Goals are unrealistic and when one of the objectives is met, there is always another one around the corner that has to be met."
good,"Constant change, minimal training and expected to immediately use the what was trained without any consideration of adapting to the new tools. Over the top expectation. Most of the new hire training classes held 25 plus people and by the end of the training the retention was about 40% left on their own accord."
good,"Fast paced, competitive, highly graded scorecard, takes one year before you're able to move to another department. Management is alright and the standards change based on the supervisor and the team you're on. The choice of work schedules are not great. Expect to work nights and weekends and this is your set schedule. Beware of the recruiter. They give different wages and differentials to others as well as expectations. They can tell you that you'll be able to work days and weekends off but when it comes time to choose that goes out the door because its then a he said she said situation. The recruiter will not put anything in writing so that they can swindle you in to accepting under false pretenses."
good,Spectrum was very different more of a corporate business with cubicles. There was an 8 week training which set you up for success. They were based of metrics of surveys so if you were unsuccessful with getting the customer what they wanted the survey they took could show a poorly handled call.
good,This is a decent company but has a lot of turnover. Very stressful and fast paced. You do learn a lot on this job in the technology area.  Great co-workers but you are micro-managed too much.  The hardest part of the job is meeting metrics given and the dealing with being yelled at on the phone all of the time.
good,7 Days a week job.  Need filler.  Can't think of anything else to type.  Lots of characters left before I can hit submit..............................
good,"when the company was time warner cable it was best. Flexible hours, great commission pay and management was fun. Spectrum is the opposite. They operate by the book. not a fun place and to make really good money you have hit almost unrealistic numbers."
good,"Long story short.... should have stayed hourly technician. Work alot more hours than the 40 you are being paid. Have technicians working different schedules than you actually work so you end up working 7 days a week, answering your phone or emails. As a leader in fieldops at Spectrum you are essentially a salaried technician to upper management. Much happier before the Charter merger and policies and procedures were realistic."
good,"This is a great company I'm happy to work with, I had been here for the 8 years, this is a new brand before it was TWC, nothing is perfect so I'm happy where am I."
good,You have an opportunity to grow within the company and receive decent pay with good benefits.  I believe that the company is strict with it requiring the employees to sell their products.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Spectrum was a good place to work.  They have great training opportunities and there are ways to advance throughout the company..  The give great support to their employees to help for advancement.
good,There are a lot of jobs that you can do here at this company.  Plenty of freedom.  Great salaries. However some of the management is horrible. Great job to have if you're interested in saving money.
good,"When I work for Spectrum they were still Time Warner Cable, the job was a standard CSR job. Had to meet stats and up sale as well. The work itself was stressful but my co workers were good to work with."
good,Salary was great. Poor management which takes away from the pay. Too many changes. They don't stick to any policy. Supervisors lack knowledge to help.
good,"Your job will include deescalating calls, educating customers on new available products, provide billing information, reset wireless passwords, while overall maintaining a great positive attitude.  Very focused on timing and they will check on you to make sure you do your job.  Would I stay there forever, possibly if they had bonus and better growth opportunities. They are a ""you come to work, to work for us, then go home to your family, type of attitude.  Also, you will be expected to push out new products that you really don't know much about so remember to ask questions alot and make sure to repeat the new information.  Sometimes the growth is so fast only a few people actually know what they are doing and even they are too busy to help you So don't expect to the work environment to be too fulfilling.  Just get your money and look for opportunities to grow if you obtain better skills."
good,I worked for TWC prior to the change to Spectrum.  After the change over the stress level was unbearable.  Good job if you can handle the stress.  Good luck!
good,good company to work for  just know what you want and know what you are getting into so you can be successful. your job security can depend on if you get a good supervisor or not
good,During training we were told that if we decided to leave that they would do their best to keep you there..well..when I needed to leave they didn't even try...gave me a leave of absence and then took it away.. terrible place if you are having issues...
good,I was at Spectrum- Time Warner Cable at the time as they were preparing to be purchased by Charter Communications.  Pretty busy as we worked to bolster our sales agents to help meet demand.
good,"Typical day starts at 10am, and though you get off at 7pm that isn't guaranteed based on the job you're at.  The company provides excellent training and benefits.  The techs are like family and do get along great.  The managers keep track and check in on their employees but a lot is expected from the techs in increasingly shorter time frames."
good,Charter is a workplace that allows you upward exposure. It garners a culture where the business needs consistently challenge its employees to do more.
good,"If you need employment , with some room for advancement, plus great benefits.Spectrum is for you ....................................................."
good,"My department at Spectrum has been a great experience over all. However, because I travel over an hour for work and do not get compensated for the commute I make every day, it is becoming more and more of a hassle and I'm not making enough to cover my travel expenses along with my normal every day expenses."
good,"typical day at work fixing customer cable/internet/phone problems, climbing telephone poles, in crawl spaces and attics. The changes is hard to adjust"
good,"Spectrum overall is the worst job, the communication and lack of coordination is what makes it so challenging.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure our customer were satisfied and also great team!"
good,I would not like to comment at this time. The reason for leaving is due to department relocation to Wisconsin and was unable to relocate due to financial reasons.
good,"made my own hours and met lots of good people."
good,"This is a good job im sure if you do tech support or customer service, but I was a field tech for 4 years, they have no mercy for garbage pay. The company sets all these expectations and gives your more and more work for the same pay but does expect the employee to have expections. They recently had a pay raise and it was a joke to me and my position as a tech."
good,"Loved my job, loved my coworkers, but I couldn't stand the management. Working on your own, you wouldn't think that micromanaging would be possible, but they sure found a way to do it."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Call center life can be a roller coaster because there is never a dull moment. There are days when you can sell ice to an Eskimo and there are days where you can't sell water in a dessert.
good,spectrum is a great place to work except the company is so large they do not care about you and give absolutely horrible advancement opportunities... hardly never! pay should be better for the risk and what you have to deal with (customers dogs etc.)
good,Stressful because it seems that there are too many ways to do one thing which is confusing because all procedures taught don't always work they need to streamline their procedures.
good,"Overall experience was positive.  Company currently under going lay offs.  "
good,"I thought it was just in my location but my friends everywhere that have been with the company before they became Spectrum now hate it. It used to be fun. There's a lot of nepotism, lots of politics, management lies, false promises. People there have a crabs in a barrel mentality is disgusting."
good,It is a high stress environment that is not extremely forgiving if you can't keep up the pace. One month of training and then thrown into the fire to enjoy hostile customers that you have to try to sell products to. Management is even stressed so it stresses the rest of the employees out. If you're good at handling stress and enjoy selling and making commission then this is the place for you.
good,"Good place to work, nice benefits, but stressful and can be long hours including weekends, holidays, and after hours. Very little management training with most being online."
good,I needed a new career to further my time in that will have a better pay compensation. I am looking for work that I can stay with for as long as they need me.
good,Work life balance since the merge has been a struggle.  Charters outlook does not allow for growth or opinions.  The Company has shown they are not employee friendly.
good,Spectrum is a plans that makes you Financially stable to the point you can provide for your family and live comfortable. Spectrum also has grate benefits for you and you family as well.
good,A typical day consisted of assisting customers with their digital cable and communications needs. assessing and resolving any issues with current services.
good,I worked this job my last year in high school so it was pretty fun and entertaining actually working at a cable company. I was in hr dept so I just handled helping with hires interviews and  organizing.
good,Great people to work for and with.  Always work to do.  Everyone looked out for each other.  Great place for folks with families.  I was trained well.  Looked forward to going to work everyday.
good,"I wouldn't wish this call center on my worst enemy,customer rip off and no help for public,the upper corperate management and politics"
good,very fast paced and busy on a daily basis. The co-workers are great team players. The hardest is trying to get your regular work done plus answer phones and help co-workers about their payroll.
good,"The pay was not that great for part time work but the job duties were easy, it was stressful at time and the managers did more criticizing than supporting and helping the agents."
good,Spectrum (at the time Charter Communicaitons) routinely pitted outside sales reps against customer service reps to increase sales.  This is a common practice in cable TV companies.
good,"There are constant policy changes within Spectrum, fast paced, most changes happening due to merger. Employees are friendly and helpful. There are promotions within the company, however it is very helpful to know the management."
good,"The overall job wasn't terrible, but corporate management likes to micro manage everything.They constantly demand you do more tasks and give you less time to do them in. And mandatory overtime almost every week with a barely livable wage."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Working for Charter, in their sales, can be good money. If you're good at it. If you struggle they won't hesitate to show you the door. There's also not a lot of room for advancement from sales. If you're really good they want to keep you there, if you're not so great they don't think you're good enough to go somewhere else"
good,I was very unhappy with the hours. Having been there as long as I was I didn't like that your hours shifted based off of performance. Hardest part of the job was getting yelled at for something that was completely out of your control. (IE; Outages)
good,Average working environment. Sr leadership team does not seem to be 100 percent aware of challenges at from line level. Very fast past environment and flexibility is needed.
good,"Constant change is what you need to know about Spectrum.  Things move at a fast pace, which is great for the customer, but difficult for people working there."
good,spectrum  works their workers up and pay little money. Human Resource basically tries to convince workers not to better yourself. They are more flexible when works has family issues.
good,"In the beginning it was a good job, but when new management came, it was bad. Overall still a good job. It was at the warehouse in Spartanburg though.."
good,The company was better before the merger. It will improve I imagine once they realize the current policy changes didn't work in the past. The health insurance isn't as good as before but better than nothing. The pay is competitive. I'm concerned my department will be moved out of state sooner rather than later.
good,"Productive and well advance with technology, with the opportunities to learn best practices from other working groups within the nation. New upper management making poor decisions. No value to the employees even though performances were outstanding and positive results delivered."
good,"For the amount of work you had to complete it wasn’t worth the pay. The training was insufficient. I had to figure out most things on my own. The metric repeat system was kinda unfair. Customers would call back for problems you couldn’t control and you were responsible for the call back. Most of the problems were caused by spectrum’s cable plant. You can do everything in your power as a technician to get customer services working like replacing cable drop, house cable and install new equipment but on demand, missing channels and slow internet speeds were constant problems for customers on a daily basis. To me Spectrum offers a inferior product that does not work most of the time. But you a technician will receive most of the blame."
good,"Firm but fair management,"
good,"None stress environment , laid back. A lot busy work. But no hard deadlines . Happy environment . OT is optional . Great  space so far to work for. No Complaints"
good,basic work place field work mostly calm lots of changes with company. turn over rate high. employee work load no balance training ok if willing to learn low pay slow growth
good,"Work environment was competitive,sales driven and somewhat stressful. New employees come through the door making more money per hour than some employees that have worked for the company for 2-3 of tenure.The pay scale needs to be revamped."
good,Spectrum is not a bad place to work at; you just need to get out of the call center.  The call center environment is very stressful and more like a sweat shop atmosphere.
good,"can be good at times, worked many different jobs. Learned a lot from this company. Some of the management employee's are good. I enjoyed working with other employee's/co-workers."
good,When I worked customer service there were a lot of unfair metrics that we were responsible for like a customer calling back after you've fixed their cable or internet issue. If they call back within in so many days for the same problem then it goes against you. Many of those times a tech really needed to come out but that also goes against you if you have to send too many out. What if it goes out again within those so many days and the tech has gone out there...well guess what ..that may affect you. If someone answers a survey about you incorrectly (they record good things but punch in the wrong numbers rating you) well that goes against you...etc When I moved to another department....the entire vibe changed. The stress and the weight off my shoulders. I didn't feel ill walking towards the building anymore. We were assigned task and the day went by rather quickly with no stress.
good,when it was Bright House  it was  a good place to work  i was laid then so i don't know about Spectrum   it was a fun place to work the had great Christmas parties
good,"I find that being a care rep is the one of the weirdest experiences as all of the changes that are happening I find that they are happening so fast it's hard to keep up. As a care agent  you're role is basically billing questions, and being the bumper for when pricing changes or anything like a hike happens. "
good,I had a great Supervisor and Manager and some great team mates. And a good place to make good income. But Corporate HR was very unfair to me in the end
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"This company is the typical corporate giant. The employees are mostly a number and are expected to work hard for little reward. "
good,"Training environment was great, trainers would make class enjoyable, but nobody would tell you about the pay until you were done with training. Coworkers were nice and helped each other, which is nice when you’re new and have no idea what you’re doing with the system they use. Retention is a very stressful job to do here since you’re getting most of all the bright house customers asking for the new discounts, which most of the time they were either paying less than what we could offer(when their Bright House discount was still active) or pay more when their discount would fall off, we couldn't offer an affordable package since everything was so expensive. Customers would get upset and even curse at you most of the time taking their frustation on you. I think the worst part though was that you get no break on each call, at least to take off the frustration with a coworker, calls are back to back and if you decide to take 3 min break everyone including manager/supervisor would tell you to Auto In."
good,"very stressful job, having to deal with upset customers and answering back to back calls all day everyday. You are lucky if you get the off days you want. I think the pay is little for what we have to put up with."
good,"Stable company, decent benefits, rigid culture."
good,"Current merger has left a lot to be desired, but Charter is doing it's best to work through challenges of acquiring a company twice their size.  Their communication is lacking, but expected in their current state of the transition."
good,Get your career enrichment and experience to take you to a higher level. Great people that are willing to help when asked. Good technology thats easy to learn with.
good,The position of sales manager used to be fun.  managing a team of 6 members throughout the state in small markets but quickly tuned sour when expectations were not met due to unattainable goals.
good,Enjoyed meeting new people everyday.  Learning the ins and out of the cable company gave me alot of insight on the company itself and it's competitors.
good,As a field technician you come into contact with customers in their home. You install or troubleshoot their cable services and explain how to use them. Its a fast paced environment that you are constantly learning about. The job is never boring and always on the go.
good,"Offer extensive training for the Field Techs, and pay is competitive.  Decent benefits and pay for cable/phone/internet.  Would like more family/work balance"
good,"Love the production floor as they are my workforce that drive for success. I like the opportunity to try and manipulate mindsets individually or as a group because I am a lead (manager role) which can have good and bad situations.The good situations are working closely with the employees which is very beneficial for the outcome of the production floor, bad part being new procedures and information provided to the floor but no testing on the information such as repercussions or solutions based on what was given. To allot more time towards a particular process is beneficial and can lead to favorable outcome for the business which I do not feel is happening. The company future itself is uncertain for the cable industry, yet profitable it will soon not stay afloat as technology is going wireless which Spectrum is not competitive enough with pricing to shift the marketplace to continue business with the consumers. The company will not invest into new technology and firmly believes with the acceleration of technology that we will not support this being an ISP which I feel is the case with all ISP's. The customer thus becomes frustrated and blames ISP's as a whole for failing to provide assistance which I feel also makes the cable industry and dead marketplace in the near future. Only until customers become number 1 priority again and metrics are shifted to agents favor will there be a different outcome ever so slightly to the cable industry."
good,"A typical work day is the daily check-in call which gets old pretty quickly and they set their expectations so high they have a high turnover ratio of employees leaving and unfortunately, that is due to Office Manager.In my eyes a sale is a sale and pushing Triple Plays is not going to work due to the fact that not everyone wants a home phone.  It's fun talking and meeting different people, the benefits are top notch and the company pays half of your deductible.  You receive free services only thing you will have to pay is the equipment which will be about $15 a month for three televisions.  Charter needs to understand that raising the price after a year will make their new customers leave.  It should be about the customer's needs, not Charters."
good,"Job wouldn't be bad if commission structure didn't always change and never for the better.  The more successful you are, the better chance of your commission changing to limit your paycheck.  Work life balance is great, supervisors are nice folks.  Dealing with customers can be very stressful considering you are door to door knocking unannounced on their property.  You rely ALOT on the turf you are assigned, it can majorly impact your success."
good,"I enjoyed working here but it really is not for everyone, depending on the lifestyle you have, for me working 3pm to midnight was not ideal and working weekends took away from family time, but for people who are going to school or are single and/or enjoy working nights, this is great!"
good,"Not much room for advancement, long hours, over-time is always available, however. Training is adequate, although more and more tasks are added without compensation."
good,I enjoyed working for the company but is looking for a more paying job. The team I worked with was awesome and very helpful. Spectrum was a very good company and learned alot.
good,The job was fun but limited in career opportunities.  The pay was fair but not competitive.  Benefits was fair but could be better.  I did travel alot.
good,"High call volume callcenter. "
good,"While spectrum was excellent with benefits,they aren't family oriented, the chances of promotion is very slim if you aren't a part of the in crowd. Supervisors aren't on the same page."
good,A typical day working for the particular branch of Spectrum I worked for included starting work at 8am and working till you finished your final job; which could either be at the scheduled 5pm clock out time or well in to the next morning.  You had to work in all kinds of weather conditions and in dangerous work spaces.  I worked so much (not of my choice) that the apartment complex I lived in thought I had abandoned my personal vehicle in their parking lot.  My supervisor always had my back because of good work ethics and job ratings.  There were times where the customer would show genuine appreciation and thankfulness.  Those rare occurrences were what made that work day worth the rest of the turmoil.  You are able to advanced but you hit a wall if no positions beyond yours are available.  It could be years before you are able to advance once you've reached the final tier of your position.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,i have no review for this company. I didnt work for them. I worked for the compnay before they took over. I was out on SSD when they took over and they released me.
good,"Usually treats employees fairly, pay is very good. Small gym, lots of customer service appreciation events. If you need the money it is a great place to work, if you want something more rewarding in your life somewhere else might be better."
good,I enjoyed working with team. However the pay was insufficient and there was no room for growth due to company merging. I began to feel over worked. i started looking for other employment.
good,"Though the benefits are abundant, if you're not cold and a shark...you won't make it in sales. They require too much of a sales representative in my opinion."
good,"If you are looking for a job that has a set schedule and offers overtime consistently this is the job for you. if you can also handle being yelled at by people and handle escalated customers on a consistent basis its perfect, When it comes to attendance, be careful if your sick or out by any means they will ask you about it and a doctors note will not save you or help. you also may move desks frequently and share a desk."
good,"unorganized , everything seems a bit rushed , training is too short , should be longer , a lot to comprehend , they dont teach everything necessary that you need to know on the floor , has great benefits though"
good,"The people were great but unfortunately I would not recommend working as a Retention Agent; Any other position, in the company, would be great, but again I would not recommend working Retention if you do not like customers calling only to complain and curse you out for no reason."
good,"Stressful place to work, service is poor, and customers are not treated well.So when  customers leave there is hardly any likely hood that they will be returning customers. The service is also very poor which makes it a hard sell."
good,I very excited to start the job and I thoroughly enjoyed working for them until me and my supervisory started getting into disagreements and she purposefully tried to make an embarrassment of me after a mistake I had made a couple weeks of being on the floor by sending a joking email out to everyone on our team and all of the other supervisor's. I had broken my foot in about April and I kept requesting the day off so I could get the surgery I needed and they refused to give me the day off so I went about it myself and I basically got cussed out when I got back and was let go.
good,I liked Time Warner until I had to sell as a technical support rep. And you were graded on this. I worked there to help people troubleshoot internet related issues and cable t.v. issues. Once selling was introduced call times got unmanageable and the culture changed. At this time I tried a different career path.
good,"I miss working here just didn't fit my family. I liked the benifits. The people and atmosphere was friendly, easy training. Fun team meetings. Good management."
good,Company cares about sales and not how they get them. Individuals in upper management promote shady sales tactics. The pay out is very high if you are successful in getting the services installed. (which can be difficult) Great benefits. If transnational sales is something you are good at then this could be a very lucrative job.
good,"The organization has been in transition for the last year due to the merger of three companies.  Organizations and processes have been changing at a rapid pace and it is hard to communicate and keep up with all the changes.  "
good,"Spectrum has an work environment that makes you feel like any moment you could walk in to work and be fores. You have numbers you have to pass each month which would be fine if one wasn't a call back time when they have techs on  strike and constantly cutting lines and outageseveyday ."
good,I was expected to be to work on time and assist the agents and customers through out the days. I have worked at this company for four years I have had the opportunity to try different departments with in the company. I started out in retention in 2013 I learned the best sales tips and ways to retain the customer. I also worked in payment services where I learned more about the collection side of cable and the research of the companies equipment. I current work in the Serviceability dept where I research and locate serviceable addresses.
good,A typical day at work is very very busy.  There is not a lot of down time so the day goes by fast.. I love the management team I work for. I am always learning something new...daily.
good,I would only recommend this job to someone with tough skin. If you are sensitive do not apply. There are not a lot of breaks from the phones. You go from one call to another without a chance to catch your breath. There are a lot of stats you must meet. If you don't meet them you can be written up and not allowed to apply for other jobs. Also if a technical problems happens that effects your stats they will not adjust them. The most enjoyable part of the job is the connections you make with other employees. The healthcare is the best!
good,"Company was great when it was time warner. Spectrum no longer offers a good competitive salary, no retirement and it seems like they dont care about the customers any more just money"
good,"Currently, the company is experiencing growing pains from the recent merger and is also standardizing every last policy and procedure. They are also concentrating staff in certain offices and cutting staff if they are not willing or able to move to the new locations."
good,I enjoyed working a set schedule with weekends of. They were flexible with requested days off and very concerned with the well being of their employees. Doors were always open if you needed to speak to them on a personal level as well as with concerns involving work. Very understanding management and all around fair.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,The transition from TWC to Spectrum is a difficult period; change that is difficult for both it's employees and customers. At this point in time the ability to  provide repetitive and detached responses to customer questions is vital. If you find yourself connecting strongly to your customers or investing too much emotion into your work then it may cause issues.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact your co-worker become like family. It can a very fast paced, however the pay is excellent. It can be a very stressful place should you not be able to not take thing personal. They are great in demanding accountability for your own growth and development."
good,"Spectrum, Formerly Time Warner Cable, was overall an okay placed to work. I was given a 3pm-12am shift. A typical day included logging in via Kronos and taking calls from customers, usually angry or unsatisfied. My manager was great, very understanding, co workers helped ease any stress and were great team players. The hardest part of the job was de-escalating situations with customers, and selling but after dealing with it on a daily basis and having empathy it becomes much easier."
good,It's a good place for employment but no room for advancement. It all political like everywhere else. This place turned into a micromanaged work place. Its all about the numbers.
good,Company was fair and active in its work ethic. Currently undergoing a merger and a revamp of the ADDIE model for curriculum development. The workload is fast-paced and requires shifting priorities regularly.
good,I learned a lot from my experience here having to go to multiple homes each day and sometimes deal with angry customers definitely strengthened my customer service skills I learned that personal protective equipment is very important and should never be taken for granted seeing as how I was required to climb telephone poles and large ladders on installs I learned that paying attention to detail is very important especially when you are in a customer's home and I learned a lot about electronics having to install cable Internet and sometimes other appliances for the customer
good,Was a good job while was still run by Time Warner Cable. Since merger with charter the work environment has gone down hill. New parent company is not a employee friendly.
good,i dont reallyhave much to comment about spectrum. The pay and the benefits are great as far as being in the call center it is very interesting with the new takeover
good,"There are no breaks between calls they are constant, management plays favorites, coaching and development sessions every week, they set you up with attainable goals but your job could be completely different at the end then the one you were hired to do in the beginning. Good pay and hour long unpaid lunch breaks but very fast paced and stressful environment."
good,"Great job to start your career, very challenging at times but will prepare you for any obstacles that may take place in other workplaces.Fast past environment in the retail stores."
good,"Fast paced extremely busy environment, 80% of the time. Great medical and health benefits. Very generous paid time off (vacation and Holidays). I have learned that this company is ever changing. To accomplish longevity and staying power at a company like Charter,  you must understand that change is the only constant."
good,"Well, Time Warner Cable had its share of issue, but that has nothing on Charter.  What a company and a bunch of mismanaged Cablevision Execs to go along with it."
good,"I worked for TimeWarner Cable before it merged with Charter Communications. Spectrum is the name of the cable product branded under the combined companies. The work environment between the 2 companies was night and day. Benefit of working from home was taken away and you must be located in Stamford, CT to advance."
good,"Mergers nearly always have obstacles to overcome, and this one is no different. The level of experience that Time Warner Cable had does not seem of great interest to new Charter leadership."
good,"When we were Time Warner Cable, we had good direction, good management, and a clear plan on where the company was going.  Now that we are Spectrum, owned by Charter Communications, we seemed to have taken a step backwards.  Our video technology offerings are more limited, our packages are more limited, and our prices are increasing.  On our Enterprise part of the business, we are overworked and lack clear direction.  Our re-organization has caused a number of experienced, talented people to leave the company."
good,Some long hours.  Not a whole lot of support with questions.  A lot of conflicting messages (Hurry up and get done but take your time!) kind of thing.
good,"Going through a strike at the moment, company is trying to get rid of the union and benefits, was a good place to work before that all transpired. would of loved to stay there longer and there is lots of opportunity to move around schedule was great for me benefits were great. But now with call the corporate greed its hard to recommend anyone to come and work at a company that have no respect for the people that are working for them"
good,"The company as a whole was better under TWC, since the merger the company has gone down hill and encourages firing of higher paid employees. Working in other stores are far better than this location. This particular location is low in morale and management is not helpful nor do they treat their team with the respect that they deserve. Management is gossipy and reinforces a negative environment. The reps are great and moments are great when created in order to maintain sanity. The customers were actually enjoyable and fun"
good,"Balanced Team Builder"
good,As a new company we have had many changes that happens daily so it makes things challenging when supporting our customers. Something different happens everyday which keeps it exciting.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,The pace is balanced. Some days are busy while others are slow.  The culture is employee oriented.  The ability to make money and opportunity for overtime is great.
good,Good Teamwork  can learn many things from colleges sometimes work on various tools it's good to have various knowledge so that we can work on the tools
good,"While the Retention or ""Customer Solutions"" department is technically part of the Customer Service department at Charter Communications.  It is not a customer service job.  It is a sales job."
good,"Stressful at times, but overall satisfying work as far as the position itself. Company does not contribute well to workplace culture as they are not willing to delegate funds for any motivational activities for employees. Lacking job security."
good,"As a contractor, I have to furnish my own computer, monitor, etc.  I have to use the guest wireless network and do not have access to the corporate network, therefore I have to use Outlook Web App instead of outlook - which is not nearly as good.  I have to use a virtual desktop window to access sites that are only available from the corporate network and VDI is slow, cumbersome and has only browser and file transfer applications.  Contracts are only 6 months long at most and renewal is not usually known until a few weeks before contract end."
good,"I was responsible for making sure the techs and customer service reps had all they needed for the days activities. I would return customers calls that situations could not be resolved through other means. I would check previous days paperwork for any errors, than submit reports to my general manager. Order stock for offices and technical departments. I learnt so much from this position, responsibilities, team work, problem solving and working under pressure. Even with the office being under stressful situations, we make it a very enjoyable place to work. The most difficult part of this position would be when the offices were directed to different division and my position was eliminated. The most enjoyable part was the first few years of employment when the offices were smaller and more personable."
good,Managers good where im at. Business Class is far better than the residential side --been on both sides. Training is fast and not much follow up except emails and alerts but hard to find time to read them and practice with the work load time limits.
good,"Too much focus is played on the whims of the executives.  If the CMO says jump, suddenly there are dozens of emergency projects that sprout out of no where.  The people are all kind and the pay is highly competitive (especially outside NYC), however, it is a high-stress, low-reward role."
good,"1 White guy crashed trucks, cursed out customers, didnt listen to direct supervisor, kept filthy appearance, showed up late, and had issues with calling out some times. He would get threatened with paperwork but never anything serious. I am black. I had superior numbers, got acknowledged for good work, never had a write up, good customer scores, and missed called out 2 days out of the 2 years I worked there. I accepted a tip from a customer and got fired. 1st offense. no write up at all."
good,Flexible hours in general and great potential to make good money. Sales territories change monthly which means getting acclimated to a new area and new demographic customer base every month.
good,Bright house networks was a good company to work for. It offers complimentary cable services for its employees which was really good. they also offered a lot of advancement opportunities.
good,"when the company was time warner cable the pay and job was amazing spectrum took over or charter and went down hill bad ,from pay cuts to closing out call center with out notice"
good,"i enjoyed working with many different personality's on a daily basis .....incoming calls from 80 to 150 were an average, daily ....i do not and will not allow any of my customers to end our call on a angry note ....my ratio for happy satisfied customers is at a 96%"
good,"8 hours a day, 7:30am to 4pm, theres a variety of different jobs, I personally test and refurbush cable boxes and related equipment, spectrum is a pretty good place to work, good atmosphere, cant really complain, Just the pay could use a slight raise."
good,Good place to learn about the industry.  Good people to work with long hours. Big con would be how they grade you on job performance when they have    Bad equipment
good,I had my own van at the time and never got to work near were i lived i always had to drive almost an hour to my first job and the amount of job were just not good i was only getting 3 jobs
good,The biggest issue with this job was the unrealistic expectation of work quality verse work quantity. The Metrics the company grades the Technician on are unbalanced and lead to great stress while working. The expected norm is the Technician can provide the quality of service advertised while not providing the appropriate amount of time to do so in some cases.
good,"I do not recommend the new charter unless your a recent grad or trying to break into sales for the first time."
good,"A typical day is filled with individuals at their desks taking calls throughout the day, on their breaks many go to their cars or to a lounge to watch television."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Flexible schedule is nice but constant commission structure changes make the job stressful. You never know for sure if you are going to get paid what you earned.
good,"They do pay very well, they expect hard work but it's manageable, however consistent rule changing makes sticking within guidelines difficult, i was let go over policy violations from a year and a half before, management will find an excuse to fire you if they need to make cuts, i was the top agent when i got let go, my violations that i was terminated for fell off 6 months before i was let go. i felt cast out with no real reason other than i was making too much"
good,I've had a great career with Time Warner Cable and then they sold out to Charter. I want something different out of my professional career then what I experience now. I stay Very motivated for selling and want a commission structure that fits me!
good,"i was only there for about 3-4 months under Spectrum, the benefits changed after I left.  I've heard the new benefits are not great especially insurance benefits.  I learned a lot on the finance side of the job.  the hardest part of job are long hours sometimes, the most enjoyable part is celebrating birthdays and anniversaries."
good,"I was happy working for them when they were Time Warner Cable and as soon as Charter bought the company everything changed. The culture changed negatively and everyone from agents to supervisors were complaining about all the changes. The jobs changed  the responsibilities changed and I was not doing the job I had originally applied for. No job security there. Turn over rate is high. Also the company started treating their customers unfairly and started charging customers more money and their excuse was the merger. There is no consistency in that company, When you ask a question you get different answers from everyone."
good,"This is an outside canvasing position where you face potential rejection at every door.  However, if you make a sale, the commissions and perks are good; Charter provides good insurance benefits and I found some of the team meetings to be highly beneficial."
good,"When I began work at Spectrum, they were known as Time Warner Cable. Once the company was bought, everything went downhill. Vacation was redone, wages were changes (mostly for the worse), bonuses were taken away, and work load was increase. I miss what this job used to be."
good,"Time Warner Cable as a whole, was a great company. It waas recently bought out by Spectrum Charter. I would advise only to apply for this job if your used to constantly being on the phone."
good,"Time Warner Cable was a great company to work for that operated on an Enterprise level. The leadership was great to work with and we understood the overall vision for the company and its future. Charter taking over the company has been very unorganized and most corporate level jobs throughout the country have been eliminated or moved to Connecticut. The company's vision is not clear, especially with legacy TWC positions/services. "
good,entering into spectrum is a great beginning for anyone wanting exposure to corporate America. the long term is not for everyone and its my belief that you will know within the first year. overall the company is good. if you dont like change you might want to look elsewhere. i dont have any good or bad things to say other than that.
good,"Good benefits, nice experience and overall place to work for. Great training to get you fully prepaired for job requirements. Many great perks while working with this company."
good,"Good place to work as far as pay and benefits.  The center was about to close so did not give job security.  There were some people, not myself, with personality conflicts that created a hostile work environment."
good,"It's a fast paced sales environment. The work place is very competitive. In outbound we generally made cold calls. Either trying to upsell products, or deal with a customers concerns. The hardest part of the job was trying to speak to angry customers. I wouldn't let it discourage me. I would still find a way to work through it , The most enjoyable part about the job, was having the ability to help people out."
good,I loved my job and the people I worked with. Benefits were really good. I would probably still be there but I did not want to relocate my family. I have no idea how the change to Spectrum from Time Warner has changed anything
good,I had a good experience here other than the fact that it seems nobody had gotten paid a decent wage it seemed the staff was always willing to go the extra mile and help out where they could
good,The pay is ok. Everything is done by a metric system which is nuts because its not a sales position. Basically you get yelled at all day by angry callers. The management team on the floor is very unprofessional. They make you listen to your calls and even if they are good they will find something to nitpick about. Too stressful the pay is low for the amount of nonesense you have to deal with. You get a short 30 min lunch.
good,"Great atmosphere and company offers excellent benefits. Just undergone Charter purchasing company, previously know as Time Warner Cable. Tuition reimbursement excellent."
good,I  used to  like working at TWC till it was bought out. That is when  the company started to  suck. Spectrum laid off so many people. I wish that TWC would still be around I was there for 6 yrs.
good,Nice company if you are young and  first or second job. Would advise working in a one of the larger office  for advancement possibilities. Leadership tend to make changes but not think through how it will effect other departments  or include  them in decision making process.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Company is great to work for and provides excellent benefits. However the current management in place made need to be reposition to meet requirements of leadership.
good,"The training was great I felt very prepared for my job duties, the compensation was amazing, the disadvantages are the tight time schedules to get the work done in and the over abundance of hours you work."
good,Time Warner cable has good leaders who are willing to groom employees for the next stages in their career.  I've learned a lot during my time here.
good,"TWC was a great place to work with great people among various job roles.  However, the way they handle change leaves much to be desired among workers."
good,A great place to work when entering the workforce.Time Warner Cable is a great company to start building customer service skills.
good,A typical day at work includes installing new service and troubleshooting problems on existing service. I have exellent co-workers and good relationships with all of them! The hardest part of my job is the uncertainty of what I will be doing from day to day. The most enjoyable part is being good at my craft and confidence that I can do my job well!
good,"TWC wasn't a bad place to work, before the merger.  Charter has set unrealistic expectations upon the sales agents and supervisors and unnecessary pressure to achieve those goals without the training and much more importantly the tools to meet said goals."
good,Good. But sometimes to worried about numbers. Employees need not always met but overall a good company to work for good benefits good pay needs to look out for employees when having trouble and assist them
good,"Time Warner Cable was a great culture for the past decade - fine tuning its environment and organizational structure."
good,"they just don't know how to run a call center I'm sorry, the Management lacks the knowledge. as a representative we had to assist with issues related to internet and connections either port forwarding or simply enabling the wifi on a device with a 90 year old woman either way the managers knew nothing of the specifics on how to assist us assist the customers and that lead to unrealistic  numbers to met while they were limiting our means of troubleshooting."
good,There is a great chance of job advancement.  The CEO is very friendly and interacts with the employees. I would rate the work environment at a plus 10.
good,"Good place if you like call centers. Great benefits. Room for growth. Basically assisting customers. Great co-workers, always there to help."
good,Long hours with customers issues. Repetitive transactions. Base plus commission base was a plus but needed to work 6 days a week to feel any positive paychecks.Corporate environment with a retail feel.
good,"If looking for a short-term job or a Career TWC is a great place for entry-level or Professionals "
good,I saw some flaws in the company but it's not my way to bad mouth a company that can't defend themselves in front of me. I won't ever apply for this company ever again.
good,"I worked for the company 2 years as part of their Tier 3 departmebt. Had some good as well as some bad days. For the most part I believe the company is good but you must be ok with the heavy phone calls. Some expectations were unrealistic but all in all, you can do worse."
good,"Right now company is changing it's  name, hopefully for good of the employees. Great benefits. Salary plus commission and free cable television and Internet."
good,"Physically and mentally demanding pace. Unreal expectations for production with insufficient support. Benefits are good, your work schedule can be very difficult. Too much driving."
good,"Entertainment business, enjoyed to free cable, discounts on phone and internet service. Tickets to major events, outstanding staff meetings"
good,I have learned to be even more self motivated and to be a listening ear sometimes people just need someone to listen and vent too.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Did troubleshooting,installations in residential and commercial accounts. Worked with public everyday.Worked on your own and was a self rewarding job when you made the customer happy."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of many phone calls, calls would range from angry and rude to calm and polite customers. Throughout the day one may become stressed for the amount of work one has to put in on a call attempting to make goals that are set up from the managers, so the company puts together games and activities to help ease minds. I have learned how to be patient and listen to the customers, understand the reason why they chose to call in. Management was very understanding, because not too long ago they sat in our seats as well. My co-workers are my team members. They are always supportive and lend a helping hand at any giving moment. The hardest part of the job was trying to please everyone that called in, whether I could or could not. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving great compliments from the customers they pushed me to be the best person I could be, so the most enjoyable part of the job was hearing the smile of someone who at first was irate and disrespectful."
good,"a typical day at work is very hectic, there is a lot of work to be done. the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to have a career in Manhattan. The hardest part of my job is having to travel during rush hours."
good,"typical work days varied. Customers service reps out side of this office bend the rules too often in which customers will hang up and call back to get different answers that makes u look like a liar by sticking to policy, which is not cool and it effects your performance in a negative way. customers are never satisfied and know too much about policies in which changed every other month. but with change you do get used to it and the customer become just a thing u cant take personal."
good,"I enjoyed working for Time Warner Cable and was laid off due to Reduction in Workforce."
good,It is a very fast passed environment. It has great benefits and a major earning potential. The key is to make sure that you meet your sales goals and you will work there a long time.
good,"A typical day at work would  include taking customer service calls, and sometimes fixing repair issues via the phone. It would also entail resolving escalated supervisor calls. Should there be an outage, the necessary department would be notified, and those calls would be handled accordingly. "
good,"Start my Day with a Positive attitude working with Internal and External Customers coordinating services with Management, Clients, Vendors and Internal Departments.  Everyday its a learning process so I always have to keep an open mind. With that being said I have learned not to be partial, have patience, understanding, listen to concerns to implement the best plan that will work for All parties involved to include management.  I have great Customer Service skills, I am professional and elevate to the highest level possible. As far as the most difficult part of my job is when you go above and beyond and the Customer is not content. When you know you did everything that was within your control then you have accomplished your goal. I am an outgoing type of person with great communication and people skills so I enjoy seeing and working with my team and with my customers."
good,Management needs improvement.  Never take the field reps advice and recommendations.  To many changes to the sales compensation plan.  Promotions of products is not fair across the board.
good,"This company hav many flaws. The management needs to be replaced ""again"". The need to force sales when the job is tech suppport creates shady business practices."
good,"Would be a great place to work if everyone worked together, and more people did their fair share. It was bad, more often than not."
good,I have worked for Time Warner Cable for going on 10 years. I just moved from NC to CA and transferred my job.  I have found out quick that is not the same job across the country.   A lot of changes and the system of sales here in California is about 3 years behind North Carolina.
good,"The pay and work hours were great...above average pay for this area and hours Mon-Fri  8am-5pm.  The office environment was O.K. but a little outdated.  Management changed about every 2yrs., so if they didn't exceed budget then they were out the door.  HR was terrible to work with.  They don't stand behind their employees and everything is about business, you are treated as a number, not as a person.  Co-workers were out for themselves, so was management."
good,"Pros: Great place to work and the benefits are great.  Allow an excellent home/work balance.  Products work once provisioned."
good,"I worked for Time Warner 3rd shift.  While I enjoyed my role, the hours were difficult, as at the time my child was in elementary school."
good,I really enjoyed the job. My direct management did a great job. They were very helpful and a joy to work with. The part that was very difficult to deal with was the ever changing policies and expectations. I fully understand that change is needed to advance the company BUT it was done sooo.... many times and with a clear disregard to the employees.
good,at this job if you are not a person that works inside a building you pretty much don't exist.  management is ok.  The benefits they offer are one is the best thing they offer
good,They have great benefits.  They have great incentives.  They care about your well being.  They have opportunities for advancement.
good,"As an Rep, it wasn't easy to chat with unpleasant, unwilling to buy customers day to day while trying to get 20,000 triples a day. My commission went from being based on Revenue, Core Products, SIK's and Video Yield to Video, Triple Plays, SIKs, and Core Products which changed the way we were paid completely. Management doesn't care about anything besides you getting cores and not going over your lunch break."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Another day in Direct Sales. The more you do the more the company wants. Goals are not always easy to reach. Payout for sales is the dumbest I have ever seen. Co-workers are great because they all feel the same way. Hardest part of the job is getting through a day hoping there will be a supervisor position opening soon so you don't have to keep knocking doors to make a living. Decisions of where DSR's work in ""Special"" areas is based on performance, so even if you live nearby, it may not be you. Payout for sales needs to be fixed. Use your own car, wear and tear, fuel and never make enough sales to live because everyone else in the company, like the front counter or customer service etc is offering the same deals as you offer at the door. Direct Sales reps are supposed to have better deals. That's how it used to be. Needs to be restructured so reps are not chasing bull **** everyday and just out making sales like the company wants. If you want me to do this much work just to close one sale, pay me more."
good,I answer phone helping customer all day with video repair and/or billing issues.  Charter is all about the metrics and I feel not enough for the customer.  Charter is too compartmentalized to be helpful sometimes.  You can be bombarded by negativity from both customers and management at time.
good,"Every day work gives me more experience and makes me faster getting the job done. my co-workers some times class me to ask me to help them troubleshooting some problems which makes me very satisfied with myself .The hardest part of the job is caring the ladder "
good,"I would take a phone call every six minutes for eight hours a day. They take good care of there employees, yet it doesn't always feel like it. They need to change some policies on overly rude customers. To work in this environment you need to have tough skin and management that is willing to work go to bat for you."
good,"Charter is a nice place to work if you are young and not experienced. for those, like me, who have been in the customer service field for a while, we notice the horrible un-controlled structure of the company. The management is all over the place. Rules seem to be made up as they go along, besides the foundation rules you find in any company. We were constantly switched around from manager to manager who each had a different way of doing things in which you had to adapt. In my 9 months of working with charter I had 5 managers. "
good,"amazing benefits , shifts are not so great, opportunity for improvement  , pay rate is awesome , can get very noisy at times"
good,"This is a good place to work if you are a single person that wants to work hard for every order. You have to push to get everything installed, but you get paid very well, and they have good benefits."
good,good work enjoinment but managers are only looking out for themselves an will do anything they can to make them selves look good.
good,The day starts off right away back to back calls with no time to even catch your breath Sales and retaining tactics were a must which i have there was also a lot of micro Management which was bad for the employees it would make them feel like they were not good enough instead of encouragement very consistent of the same thing everyday talk to customers help them in any way possible.
good,"Sale sale sale word play is everything, tough but rewarding. benefits are great. I really enjoy the challenge on a day to day basis."
good,"Time Warner Cable is very structured in its processes. Its  ability to train, compensate , and evolve is very strong. You are always on your toes. I do not believe the company is very focused on the individual employee and more so on rapid expansion and the bottom line dollar. I am looking for a company that is driven and cares about the foundation of its infrastructure. The employee."
good,"This is a good job, the benefits are great, the people you work with are fantastic. I have good supervisors and managers. The problems start with the business plan they have. When I first started the company had just gotten away from striving for just the money and looking to help the customer. Not so much getting the sale but make sure the customer is taken care of. Now it is swinging back to the money comes first. I don't want it to sound like I am trashing the company as I am not, hands down between cable and satellite, cable is still the way the go and TWC is still the best bet, and we all know how philosophy will change but the human factor has got to come in to equation when dealing with the customers."
good,Time Warner Cable was a job with excellent benefits but very little job security.  The best part was working as a team; however these teams switched rather frequently and made the structure of the job a bit unstable.
good,"Can be a bit stressful but once you get more into knowing what job to do, it becomes more easy.The hardest part of the job would be to learn all the systems but the coworkers around you are very helpful to  make sure that you get on board."
good,"I enjoy working here most of the time, but we bear the brunt of the abuse when we change something, or when customers are having financial issues and we cannot bend over backwards to give them time."
good,"Project teams are not always properly staffed but the work is expected to be completed in a fast pace environment.  Process are not always clear so it is not a place for a novice PM.  To succeed you have to know industry best practices.  PMP with no experience will have a very difficult time.  However, an experience PM with a technical background can contribute immensely."
good,"Sort of a schizophrenic job role.  As the job title implies, the task was to retain customers who were calling in to complain about service, or completely disconnect.   "
good,"Busy, a number of needed reviews of Trouble Tickets resulting in many corrections from staff work volume issues."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,The supervisor was inexperienced and was hired a month before me. Was unable to relocate or contact him at times
good,Great job to be compensated for job duties. Fun company activities and friendly management. The hardest part of the job was the workload during peak season however the management and coworkers made it a fun environment.
good,This job was a great stepping stone in the IT industry. My only issue was the hours I worked. My days off weren't together ( Tuesdays and  Thursdays) and my schedule would change every 3 months.  Life/Work Balance were seriously lacking here. Everything became secondary to work.
good,"Overall Impression: Delivery Drivers, Greeters, Technicians, IT, Dispatch and other support staff are treated as second class citizens. Unlike the sales team, they are not able to participate in contests. They are not eligible for bonuses. "
good,it's tech support so you get yelled at all the time. I really don't want to write this thing but it's not letting me past without writing it. I hope I put enough words finally so I can move on..
good,"Our direct supervisors for the most part were great. With the exception of a few. Incredibly stressful job, no consistency, rules & regulations change constantly, commission goals are always changing drastically. Overall most employees there don't really like their jobs but they put up w the inconsistencies bc they pay well."
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,This is a good job to have when you are looking for another job.
good,Overall the company is a good company to work for but limitd growth opportunity within the training division.
good,"My supervisor at Time Warner was the best boss I ever had. I enjoyed my job, my boss, and my co workers."
good,"The job security has never been in jeopardy and the overall benefits including insurance and bonuses has never been an issue. The problem with this company is the communication and organization of daily work. It seems that everyone, including management, is not take responsibility on daily activities and passing the blame onto other people. There is also a lack of moving up in the company due to centralization of certain departments with no chance of relocation assistance."
good,"This is a typical call center environment. 8 hours of calls back to back assisting business customers with their internet, phone, and cable TV issues."
good,"The team I worked with was outstanding. The best part of this job was a client saying to me: ""Al, you are the bridge to your company"""
good,"Co workers are great as well as the befits provided. "
good,I worked for this company for right at 8 years.  I would have to say this company for the most part took care of me.  I grew up with this company and learned  a lot of very valuable life lessons as well.  I treasure my time here and all it taught me.
good,You definitely can make alot of money working with twc.  The downside is they micro manage very closely and they have shift bids every 6 months
good,"My previous employer was a contracting company that was a prime for Time Warner.  I gained much experience from this job that I'm able to use for the rest of my life. Being that it was a new project the hours were excessive and a personal life felt . To my surprise I was actually excited to accept a day with many points on the board. First this would give me a chance to show my talents and also help my co-worker who might fall behind. Also through the progression of my skills I was able to become apart of the Quality Control team. All and all through all of it, this was satisfying experience."
good,"I liked most aspects of my time at TWC. The benefits are very competitive and the focus on the customer has improved year over year although it lags far behind the competition. The company culture is such that direction changes are frequent and seem to be poorly planned and even more poorly executed. Quality of tools, urgency and proper process take a back seat to the bottom line."
good,"Internet modems with VOIP, routers and assist customers to set up a network for all computers. Troubleshoot, test and repair all problems that ranging from customer equipment to pedestal or service pole"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"TWC is great at striking a balance between life and work, with several resources at your disposal to help alleviate job stress, and also vice-versa, programs that can help you manage life changes, for free, through the business. Also, the commissions and bonuses are incredible, and certainly feel commensurate with your actual performance. The addition of several great contests and prizes also help to feel like you are truly working forward, and plentiful recognition for those who are able to do well also promote that sense of morale."
good,"Told need to work less hours, then same sentence you need to get this done by this date. Overloaded working nights and days few hours of sleep."
good,I loved the flexibility and loved the people. The job responsibilities were consistent with others doing the same function which is a positive and allows for teamwork.
good,"The hardest part about completing your job, is when the issue is not resolved, and customer are antsy, from this point I provide empathy and show concern and figure out the most convenient step."
good,"Typical work day Assisting customers with billing questions. Negotiating new promotions, Selling  products"
good,"Co workers were great but morale is low. Benefits are awesome. If you get a good manager, you'll love your job."
good,"Hot attics, high poles, and the condition of the work vans are all horrible."
good,I love this company because I help people and its great to know your doing something good but as far as upper managment goes sometimes your on your own everything else is ok
good,Very fast paced environment; great co-workers that help make the days manageable. Great Benefits!
good,"Excellent benefits, but high stress job. Typical call center environment."
good,"stressful environment"
good,This company will really enhance your customer service skills. The downsize to being a customer service rep there is they have a very strict attendance policy. No exceptions when caring for elderly or children.
good,"Excellent benefits, nice volunteering opportunities and nice cable service complimentary package."
good,overall good place to work when there was enough work to go around
good,The company is in the phase where it resembles a 'start up' Telecom company. This is a great place to get your feet wet learning state of the art technologies.
good,"Advancement Opportunity, good location, nice co-workers, helpful, challenging, flexible"
good,"A typical day included a morning meeting to talk about the previous days performance. It was also a time to role-play and talk about objections and ways to try and overcome them. An hour or so each day was spent in the office tracking sales, reading emails, and planning your day and setting goals on how many homes to solicit / customers to contact. About 4-5 hours each day was spent cold-calling current non-subscribers and trying to generate leads / close sales at the door. Another hour was spent on writing up orders or answering calls from customers and prospects."
good,"Life Balance... Great Compensation / Benefits"
good,co workers are nice very helpful...management not the best
good,Time Warner cable is a good starter job for anyone looking to get into telecommunications learned telecommunications and network
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,At work I will go install cable and internet in peoples homes. We work by our selves all day.
good,I worked overtime at least 20 extra hours a week. my checks was great insurance was not that expensive at all. Always opportunity to win bonuses and prices. love the complimentry services all free except phone 19.99/mo and boxes 5.00/mo. Just didn't care for chris blansit horrible man!!!
good,This was a good job to have. The people there really care about the customer. You were always busy on a daily basis.
good,"If you have patience, this is the ideal place for you. Great benefits, decent wage and fair scheduling will be the perks of work if you can overcome faulty management and obnoxious customers."
good,Great place to work for students who want to manage their class schedule with work while making a little bit of extra money.
good,It is a fast paced environment with great recognition and culture.
good,It was fun and ok. You had to be careful in what you do and say. You had to be on p's and q's at all times.
good,"have to explain bathroom breaks, cant be ill, work schedules are very different, coworkers are good people but no one is ever happy with most of the changes made weekly, you are treated poorly buy management as well as customers daily."
good,Working for the right supervisor Charter is a great place to work.  Recently there have been many changes that have led to a decline in overall morale.
good,"overall okay place to work, room for growth and open enviorment."
good,"Educate customers on our products and services and to enhance the image of Time Warner Cable. Handles customer service inquiries, payments, service issues and change requests"
good,Take incoming calls from our Business customers and resolve their issue.
good,The actual work was fun and challenging. I was given the flexibility to telecommute as long as tasks were completed and on time.
good,Busy call environment.
good,must be mentally able to keep up with all telecomunication advancements and new technology. Pay incentaves are very challenging to achieve. Training for advancement must be self tought and an enormous amount of uncontollable factors are based upon it.
good,"There weren't any typical days with this company, each day was different and unique in its own way. I learned to appreciate an individuals time. I met with customers and prospects at various times of the day and night, and each second was valuable to them. Management was young and inexperienced, but overall talented and nice. My co-workers were great, hard working and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was depending on others to provide the level of service that was necessary after the sale. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility and independence of the job."
good,"It seems as if your at day care, you are constantly watched for every move you make. The quintile compensation system sucks."
good,Billing and technical issues are most customer concerns. Patience is a virtue when dealing with multiple personalities. Constant change within the organization reaps little benefits beside monetary gain. Front end users should have updated performance reports daily to match the needs of the employer. Back to back calls can be a bit cumbersome when trying to catch your breath otherwise the environment is pleasing while the peers are much too enjoyable to realize you might be having a bad day.
good,"Typical day included answering phone calls to customers with outage issues or cable problems. Also set up new service and disconnect requests. Stressful at times during high call volumes but learned to take one call at a time and not to let upset people get to you and to just speak calmly and help them in any way you can to make them feel better about there problem and fix any inconveniences,"
good,"inbound call center for time warner cable, worked for the national help desk, handled internet connection issues, pc concerns and upsold faster internet to customers."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Overall good company training at my time there was not all that good in my opinion but it got better as time went on.  Management need to be more patient. I seen some people are slower than other but to remember once they catch on to it all they will be your star performer.
good,"The company is an okay place to work at. The pay is decent and there is help when needed. Metrics tend to be a little tricky and the chances for getting a morning shift are very slim. If you don't mind the headaches and late hours, then it would be an okay place for you to work at."
good,The job has its' ups and downs as does other jobs. The commission is good and the coworkers work well together. It is very stressful though and you barely have any control over your work.
good,"Its a good place to learn; what the life of a networking tech is. Its not slow and sink or swim is in full effect. The culture there is one sided / so is the unfortunate political group to the left. The smells of some can be over powering so bring sanitizer, aerosol and underarm deodorant."
good,assisted customers with their accounts and pushing orders through that may had failed online. I had to process orders that direct sales agents and 3rd party reps would place providing their systems were malfunctioning
good,My supervisor is amazing my lead I dont think cares about the customer. Theirs too much pressure on meeting stats not enough emphasis on the customer. Calls are back to back and customers are often waiting in que a long time and the IVR could be so much better but isn't. I have a love hate relationship with this job. As I stated my sup is amazing but my lead I feel like is only out for himself. I also feel like I'm treated differently as a woman. I have had sups.in thr past who where men and wonderful it didn't matter to them. This one ignores me.until all the men have their questions anderredm I plan to go to hr and if it doesnt resolve the issue I'm leaving
good,Good place to start if your just getting into the customer services field.Many leaders and managers great at helping you do your best.room for advancement if wanted.
good,"Time Warner Cable was one of the best places to work in Charlotte. It was a honor to work for them the first year there. Alot of people at the time (200-2017) was trying to get on with them. When i finally got a chance to get there it was wonderful people environment was fun an enjoyable. But as time went on. The culture changed, an the moral changed. It wasnt fun to come to work anymore. No more pots and prizes for doing good. ALot of the things and motivation that kept alot of people there slowly died down with the merger of Charter."
good,"As I mentioned, the job stunk.   One benefit was paid training, but then I was thrown on the floor.  The training was not applicable to the job I did."
good,I used to really enjoy my job. The job has became more about numbers than the well being and sanity of their employees. They're constantly changing policies that only benefit their numbers and not their employees or their families.
good,Great job with good pay and employees perks. The not so good part is the metrics kept changing when the company was getting ready to change from TWC to Spectrum.
good,"You get free / discounted services for working there. Typical call center, lots of calls & same issues over and over. Multiple calls from elderly people who can't get remote working daily."
good,Spectrum is a high stress environment and there is a lot of negativity involved with the retention role. They are constantly short staffed on representatives as well as leadership which makes it hard for the employees there. It’s overall a very tough job.
good,"☑️Decent pay "
good,Spectrum had lots of opportunities for advancement both within the department and outside of the department I worked in. Upper management could be more transparent and also could engage with the workes better.
good,The job and hours are very good for a person who is single and has lots of free time. Direct managers are nice but higher up they continually change things over again and make things tougher and tougher. They almost always offer overtime and advancement is given by online classes. Good job overall but high leadership is very difficult to deal with and continually add extra stress to the people on the bottom.
good,Management is phenomenal however the company hours to either move or take an advancement effect people especially with  families. overall the company is decent to work for i just wish that the shifts would float more instead of being so set in stone.
good,Spectrum is good company to work for if you are starting out your career in the IT industry or sales industry. It has good opportunity for growth if you you chose to stay with company.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Great place to learn new things and become more equipped in the technical field. You are provided with in debt training and have constant support to excel at your position. The benefit packages are great and you have different options to make more money with the company.
good,"great place to work, and great team of managers and supervisors. I just wasn't much into sales and sales people could use a little extra with their basic salaries."
good,"Overall good company to work for. Everyday is different. A good place to make some great income. The management team is ok but can be all about who you know to become apart of that team. The culture is not on one accord as a company, each individual section have different rule. Most enjoyable is the co worker."
good,Great job with mark dead lines to meet daily. Work closely with sales agents to submit accurate contracts for installation. Verify client services are installed and working properly.
good,"Spectrum has a great benefits package. In addition, there is upward mobility if you work hard to improve your skills. Education is very much encouraged!"
good,"Another company that use to offer better compensation plans but now has move from that. Time Warner re Outside Sale reps use to be  "
good,"Its an ok place to work and is a great place to make a live long career. They promote from within and give you plenty on training to further your knowledge in the industry, the pay is appropriate also."
good,"A great work environment with the people surrounding you, however; the job itself is entirely too stressful. The poor management leads to over-stressed workers."
good,Spectrum was a good place to learn grass-roots sales but being in a sales office did not offer room for advancement or career growth. They did offer tuition reimbursement which was good.
good,"Good opportunity for growth here, but the culture is a bit rough. The work life balance isn't great. The team that I am on is expected to work nights/weekends/on call."
good,Billing calls in regards to cable internet and phone services.Friendly workplace environment and support when needed. Supervisors helpful and benefits are amazing.
good,Spectrum is a good place to work.  They create a good work life balance and offer amazing benefits.  Management was continuously helping to move me forward in my career.
good,"Its a good company, but my position does not do much troubleshooting, which is the facet of IT that I really enjoy.  Overall its a nice place to work with good benefits."
good,Spectrum does a good job of employing people who care about customer relations. They have great technicians and most of the supervisors are top notch. The company is very veteran friendly as well.
good,"Training is good, the demand on your performance is at times a bit unreasonable. Direct supervisors are great, upper management is a bit distant from realities of what can and can't be done. Overall good place to work."
good,Professional environment. Leads are consistently available for support if needed. Supervisors try to do monthly events if not weekly for employees. Call center environment.
good,productive not a fun workplace very stares full no ping pong table in this house all ways on the go with you  will always find them adding more work to your work Oder
good,"You answer calls all day and try to resolve all customer's issues , service interruptions and billing discrepancies if possible. This is a performance based field that's competitive between workers. the best shine and the rest get left behind. every month you have the opportunity to be number one."
good,"Pretty fun place to work when it was Time Warner Cable. Charter merged/took over TWC and Brighthouse Network and formed Spectrum. The first year was business as usual but after the acquisition year ended, things began to change. Departmental consolidation and closures started to take place. Business practices were constantly changing with little to no notification. Management was changing more frequently due to severances, early retirements, or just leaving for other opportunities. Left the team having to figure it out themselves and resolve to a ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" mentality in order to get resolution for the customer. Not a bad place to work, just needs more stable direction."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"If you leave this place,  they won't let you back in. No matter what they tell you. I was one of the best they had. I worked more overtime than anyone that I knew there."
good,"They hired too many people at once and so we had to switch desks every day before getting on the phones.  Also, my supervisor took an unplanned leave of absence the day we actually got on the phones."
good,"This place changes policies every week. one week they tell you not to credit a customer the next week they do. its a stressful, confusing, flip-flop place. that's for sure."
good,"Decent company to work for but it lacks in one serious way..cross training for inter-department transfers..I started out as an Internet and Voice (Phone) tech support agent. I was transferred to their Video (Cable TV) side of business and wasn't trained on how to troubleshoot or resolve the issues that came up with TV, nor was I able to help customers that were calling in for Internet issues.."
good,A typical day was answering incoming calls in a fast paced environment from mostly unhappy customers calling regarding billing/service related issues. This was salary plus commission based. We were required to make a sales quota here over 80+% but it was almost impossible due the % of calls were unhappy customers or customers with past due balances.
good,"It's a call center. The call volume can vary, and it's nice when it's low, but can be stressful when things are back-to-back. However, things are released before they should be, both for the tools to support customers, and for customer features themselves, so you occasionally have to deal with explaining to the customer that nothing can be done right now. Management can vary, there are lots of new supervisors, and how strictly they adhere to policy or how lenient they are about stats or behavioral issues can vary greatly. Benefits are excellent and the free cable service is a plus, but it does take a certain kind of person to work well there."
good,"Don't expect it to be easy you will work for it, but if you make it then the money and benefits are second to none.  Lots of time outside.  Making quota can be difficult at times."
good,"The job was really cool. had a lot of freedom and autonomy....only until your sale numbers drop. as soon as your numbers fluctuate downwards, the freedom goes out the window and now you have to be babysat and monitored so your sales improve....im not a great salesman, if you tell me no, its a wrap, im not going to argue with you or force the product down your throat....i give up too easily...which is not an appealing characteristic for a salesman"
good,I was there before spectrum. When it was called Time Warner Cable. The culture in the call center was awesome the customers not so much. I was promoted to special program within 3 months.
good,I liked my coworker we worked together for years and worked well together the benefits were good and my hours were good. The buy out was stressful and a lot of changes followed.
good,good job. bad work life balance. Need more time for family and out of work things. issue with management at times. company is moving towards wireless business.
good,"Spectrum is just like any other job, however I have to say that management does help guide you to do your work and does provide freedom on how you get it done."
good,"Very strong and growing company with nation wide foot print.  Constant change at the Sales Manger level in my particular market."
good,Days usually start around 12pm with planning and then out in the field for at least 6 hours.  Expected to knock 60 doors a day.  Need at least one sale a day to receive best bonus.  Can be stressful and work life balance can suffer.  Compensation is outstanding for a sales job.
good,i enjoy working here until recently things have became more stressful taking away raise for bonus that get taxed so you lose more money that since merging with time warner cable. the hardest part of this job is working outside.
good,"Spectrum was a really good and fun place to work for but however when it comes to the HUGE shift bids I find it pointless . I do get that they want the employees to be successful in meeting goals but when it comes to their shifts changing every 6 months , I feel that the shift bids should be only mini shifts bids . A lot of employees has families or are in school so when that change happens it effects someone's daily routine at home or school . The pay was really good but I felt that some of the manger and supervisors really needed to put more effort into helping their teams . When one member of the team is falling then you do what you have to do as a team leader to show them that their is ways to succeed ."
good,Promoted very quickly according to my work ethic. Very nice / fun place to work.  My manager and his boss were very personable.  Enjoyed working there.
good,"Being as this is a company that was previously three separate entities, the customer base is horrible.  With the constantly changing corporate policies and what customers were used to in the past, your days were filled with nothing but irate people who were upset that their services were turned off because they had three months of past due payments.  Past that you were just expected to sit there and take the beratement and weren't allowed to defend yourself or the company because it would look bad."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"The job can be hard at times company pushing productivity can be too much at times, constant over time available.hard part dealing with difficult customers but over all a good job"
good,"day to day was what you would expect for a company that just finished a huge merger. I feel they need to empower the engineers a little more, but other than that was a good company to work for."
good,The job was enjoyable although you worked outdoors in all types of weather conditions.Only downside was working territory with loose animals running around.
good,"If you have ever worked in a call center before, you know how things work. Nothing has changed. If you haven't, be prepared to answer several calls in regards to High Speed Internet and Phone Repairs (TV also if you work in the TV Dept) It's an average place to work at. Nothing special."
good,The job environment was very United everyone went to work and to get paid there were little to no conflicts unless you were a superstar at you job or at what you did.
good,"long hours, hardest part of the job is there is no consistency, no advancement, the enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers through questions of learning their needs and helping them make good choices"
good,Working st Spectrum was fast pace and cut throat environment. i personally believe that the metrics and expectations are impossible to meet. the management and benefits we reasonable however.
good,"Four, or so years, and they dont train you. The managers tend to be good, becuase most are those who got promoted. The uppers kept on changing what was required, year by year. Lots of flip flopping without the required training to do it to their new standard."
good,"too stressful and with no purpose. outbound sales no longer exists since becoming spectrum back when it was time warner cable there was no individual training except maybe once a month and in a whole, just a chaotic environment. speaking with people was not the problem but I was not into SELLING over the phone and having a mandatory number to reach. friendly co workers and the pay was better but still not enough for a single mother. and it fluctuated too much. hardest part was just being on a dialer 8-9 hours a day."
good,"Compensation is good for what the job is. Some supervisors micro manage more than others, no real standards between teams. Hours cab be rough and customers can be mean."
good,"I worked for Spectrum briefly, primarily for Time Warner Cable and then was mergered into Spectrum. There was nothing under or overwhelmingly different about the two companies in the short time I was apart of Spectrum before leaving. Compared to other centers I've worked for, I did enjoy my center the most."
good,Get in good with the right people and you can have a laid back job with 4 days of work and 3 days off. Flexible only thing is ope 365 so tons of opportunity for OT but also missing time with Family.
good,Worked for company 29 years. It was a good career but I feel that I was getting to old to do the job up to my own standards so I retired. This is simply not a good job for an older person
good,"A constantly changing set of.tools and required metrics make for a juggling act of what's required and what's irrelevant."
good,It was a easy very communicated workplace you always have people to talk to you when you needed help if you did not understand a certain thing you were supposed to be doing the workers are more communicated with you than the management
good,Room for advancement. Promotions in 1 year.  Unfair to the tenure customers just as they are with the tenure employees. Are not willing to promote according to skills usually have to know someone to move from a position.
good,"It's been awhile, but when I worked for Time Warner Cable, the management there could have focused a little more on their employees and less on the numbers. Happy employees yields better results."
good,"There was little room for growth in my department. I learned a lot about payroll and practices. The hardest part of the job was not being  given credit for the amount of work I put in."
good,"Good work place, the customers are very rude and disrespectful, and I never saw my family because of the hours....The co workers and supervisors are great..."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"After Charter purchased Bright House going from a family owned company to corporate run company there were a lot of undesirable changes and a lot of people were laid off due to the companies departmental structure. Charter is a good company to work for, offering free cable services to employees, health benefits, etc."
good,i worked here when the company was time warner and was with them for about a year after they merged with charter. they do not give you enough time to complete the work they expect you to do. i understand what they want done however they need to understand what they want done takes time.
good,The company went thru a restructuring period where they layed off a lot of people and tried to force orhers into it in a they didn't want. That was why I left. But before that they were a great place to work. In fact still miss being there.
good,"Co-workers are great, job itself  is stressful and draining. Upper management is not very helpful and your always being screamed at by customers. The pay was great and the benefits were too."
good,Fast paced environment with back to back inbound billing calls.  Hardest part of job would be managing your own stress level and not taking things personally.  Management very supportive and wants all associates to succeed.  Computer glitches/crashes make things frustrating at times.  Huge benefits package that is difficult to ignore or match by other companies.
good,A very stressful job that you are constantly being yelled at and called horrible names yet you are not permitted to disconnect the call. Management throws orders out without regard to work load.
good,The engineering teams were great until the merger with TWC. After that there were too many political battles between the two philosophies of the legacy companies.
good,"Overall, the benefits are decent. I'm dissatisfied with the direction the company is taking. Spectrum does not give much opportunity for job advancement unless you are located in specific cities across their footprint. If you are unable or unwilling to relocate, you are locked into entry-level positions regardless of your level of skill or experience."
good,Not bad just a little stressful since it is a call center. Overall not a hard job. The PTO is very nice and also the breaks. They work with you if you need help with anything
good,"without notice, once spectrum came in and took over Time warner cable, was laid off and after 9 years of service, lost job with no option to relocate or change jobs"
good,"I’ve worked with this company since before it was spectrum. Once the company switched over, everything turned to rubbish. The management sucks! They fired all the old managers and basically told us that we’re just a number to them. I used to love my job at this company, but honestly with this new management. It’s really hard to want to work here."
good,"Processed customer’s payments, setup auto pay and process customers PC checks.  Process daily EFT, Bank Reports, Bank of America NSFs (return check), Bank of America credit and debit advices, credit card chargebacks. Stop customer from making fraudulent web & over the phone payments. Prepare and mail customer letters.  Assists supervisors with making changes on customer’s accounts.  Open and close customer’s digital cable, internet & phone account. Assist customers in making bill payments.  Schedule installations, reconnects, disconnect, and trouble calls"
good,"it was very stressful dealing with all the company changes and policies , also changes in the culture of the office was very hard to understand where things were going."
good,With spectrum taking over combining 3 companies there are constant changes taking place and no real end in sight it's difficult to do job effectively with changes taking place every month (sometimes every two weeks)  that often contradict what was done previously making it difficult to give accurate customer information and retain any good repor with customers
good,it was okay for the most part the direct supervisor was amazing and so were my team members very helpful and imformative as well trainer was awesome also
good,very stressful job working on the phone being chained to a phone with timed breaks no freedom at all. however free cable a lot of paid time off great benefits and discounts on so many other services from other companies.
good,Good benefits but low salary.  Work is repetitive. There is little room for advancement.  Basically the only options are being an installer or supervisor.  It is a good entry level job.
good,"plenty of jobs throughout the day to keep you busy and make the day go by."
good,"I FELT VERY MICRO MANAGED.  I was GPSed, they asked me to do more work for less money than when I started.   I had to justify every minute and contact"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Overall, the benefits are good, and they offer competitive salaries.  The culture isn't great, and policy changes all the time.  You can't work from home, and you can't wear jeans. It's not a casual environment.  The people I work with are great though!"
good,"When  it became will known that the office was going to have to close, the company was more than fair about allowing us to prepare for the transition to another company."
good,"Productive,energetic,must have the heart,friendly,respective,and always humble,be able to work with many people in one environment,be understanding anyone can make a mistake"
good,"Company is a great place to work.  Nice environment and everybody is friendly but the management there is bad.  I had issues of racial discrimination and harassment regarding supervisor and manager that was taken to the General Manager, only to receive an apology and swept under the rug."
good,Fast paced with opportunities to learn new skills.  Great place to work and build relationships with your team.  An industry that continues to evolve and change.
good,"This was my first job out of college, and proved to be a very supportive environment where I got to learn the ins and outs of making news for television. I'm sure the environment has changed a great deal since Charter took over though."
good,It could have been worse. The pay scale was unfair and management was much more likely to get rid of someone who underperformed than it was to re-train them.
good,"They try to have a very upbeat and uplifting environment inspire of the type of work. The management tries very hard to help you succeed, and takes care of it's employees."
good,The Spectrum company is a fast pace company and was very stressful. We would enjoy our job as we made contact with customers in the past. towards the end we were required to spend too much time in the office and not with customers and the quality of service was not there
good,I have over the years been very stressed as you were never allotted the time to do the job that was asked of you and is a very high stress fast paced environment.
good,"Call Canter  for video repiar which deals in biling, tech support, & internet services. Good Culture, busy environment, and alot of employee perks and discounts"
good,"Things started going downhill after Spectrum bought TWC. Company was fun and challenging in 2009. After management and corporate changes, things started going downhill. HUGE turnover in techs. Advancement wasn't easy."
good,"A typical day of work included taking incoming calls and assisting customers with various questions regarding service. Assisting online customers with placing orders, scheduling installation appointments and services."
good,"The change in the merger from (TWC) Time Warner Cable, into Spectrum actually changed for the worse. The merger caused disrupted customers, angry unsatisfactory along the company towards the technician. We lost structure within the new management in Charter and has caused issues. Other than that, the job has alot of up side to it. Benefits are well, 401k is great, dental and vision along with medical all very well. However, management has just slipped since all the old members have been fired/bought-out. Now the new management has no idea upon how to even handle their jobs."
good,"One customer will make your day and the other, dash your hopes and dreams in back to back calls, until that is that, you realize everybody is going through something in their life.  For the most part.  You learn to not take things personally.  A typical day at work was a roller coaster.  It was a lot of sitting.  A lot of listening.  It was an experience."
good,"good people and benefits but stressful and mentally exhausting and unrealistic stat expectations. If you like death threats, inappropriate comments and being cussed at this is the job for you. Your co-workers are the only good thing about this job so if you think you can handle the stress it is a good job."
good,"Going in 16 years with time Warner Cable when the merger was approved."
good,Nothing special or flashy.  I good secure place to work but little variety in my role.  I compile data from the 3 companies that recently merged together and produce the same reports everyday.
good,If you think you will grow in this company when you're working in the retention center than you better hope your buddies with your manager. Not even the 2nd week of training my trainer talked about how bad the company was as time warner but are going to be better as Spectrum (they still act like time warner) The information we learned in training was barely 50% right so when we got on the floor we had to re-learn the information on the go. In OJT good luck getting help if you're struggling because least once a week they may play your call if your lucky and critic it. Overall not the place for long term employment.
good,"IT organization is out of date. Still practices from 1980's are prevalent. Rather bureaucratic. Have to wait for days, if not weeks, to get approvals,"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,If you enjoy talking to people and have a strong work ethic this is the job for you. Working in all weather conditions may be tough but the compensation and benefits definitely outweigh the day to day hardships of a direct sales representative.
good,Become efficient and get in good with the right people. There is a culture overwhelmingly about what people up the ladder you can become good with. Your performance does not matter as much as meeting minimum requirements and knowing people.
good,I enjoyed working here. Management was super nice and helpful. My team mates were easy to work with. Everyone had the same goal in mind (to meet and exceed goals).
good,Its been alot of changes through out the years with Spectrum/Charter/TimeWarner. It use to be a relaxed culture in the golden days but its more strict now. Compensation has slowed tremendously since the changes.
good,"A typical work day is working with your team to accomplish a team goal of how many entertainment packages you sale. Have the luxury of working individually while also working with Skype Business chat to communicate with supervisors and trainers in case there is something you may not know how to do. Daily goals must be met everyday in order to be successful while employed, it definitely reflects in commission checks. Very fun place to work, the company does monthly incentives to recognize the heavy hitters by doing raffle giveaways. Things that are given are way never seems to amaze the employers of things of such TV's, Firesticks, Giftcards, money etc. Business casual dress code and the culture of the work place is diverse."
good,"Though the benefits at Spectrum are above average, the Direct Sales Representative position is a difficult position to work. There is a base salary, But, you are required to sell a certain number bundles before getting paid for any of your sales for the month."
good,its ok but the company buyout harmed good employees and external departments.  but all in all it was a good company to work for while it lasted.  good luck to those who are not affected by the company acquisition.
good,"Good coworkers and great fair balanced atmosphere to work in at Time Warner Cable. Time Warner Cable did not discriminate and was committed to diversity and representing all viewpoints. Company benefits were great including health, pension, 401k."
good,"Charter had recently purchased Time Warner Cable.  Since this, i have noticed many salary cap drops in multiple departments, and too many cost cutting moves that will continue to hurt the service level of what they should be striving for."
good,"They were a good Company had great benefits and extra's like crawfish boils, Weiner roast for Halloween,  big buffet for Thanksgiving and Christmas. HR Representative was very helpful in helping us cope with the coming layoffs. Pay was also great."
good,I was very happy with my job. I was with over 19 years. And been through several  merges. I was let go due to Specturm bought out Time Warner cable.  Benefits was excellent. Job Security was good. Had no problems with Management had no problem Job Culture.
good,"You work in Florida heat and humidity, attics and outside conditions. Management only worries about themselves, Very long hours for low pay. the only good thing was the benefits and the free internet and tv"
good,This review is more of a comparison to my role as a Tier 3 agent for Time Warner Cable transitioning into internet/phone repair for Charter Spectrum. The job itself is very simple however the workload under charter is much heavier and stressful due to the fact we are understaffed and they do not have intentions on hiring the amount necessary to handle the volume of calls handled.
good,"Spectrum use to be Time Warner Cable.  Answer calls, troubleshoot cable, internet, and phone.  Answer billing questions and take payments.  The management there is great and will help you when ever you need it."
good,"I only stayed on for several months. More of a transitional position me. Days were long. Typically 12 hours. Position was lower than my skills and experience. Management, at the time, felt more like it was just get it done and grow customers; although there were times of ensuring quality. I don't really have an opinion on the workplace culture except that the other technicians were great to work with. Hardest part of the job was working at customers homes and seeing how people live. They ranged from pleasant and enjoyable to disgusting and horrifying. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people."
good,My time as a call center rep was not the best of work experiences. The job was just not what I expected. Cold calling and upselling a product that customers weren't already happy with. Made for my work experience there very difficult.
good,Good company wasn't many opportunities to advance but great company with great people and work ethics. Also has great benefits with opportunities to get gift cards.
good,A typical day at work is taking calls for billing issues and taking payments. I have learned a lot at this company. I think management could be better.
good,"*A typical day at work consisted of answering calls from potentially new and existing customers.  I needed to be prepared to answer a wide spectrum of questions usually about billing, internet specs, television quality, channel lineup, phone service, and home security options, equipment specs, and general information."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Time Warner Cable Business Class had good benefits. Insurance, 401K and a pension plan after 5 years of service."
good,It was a door to door job. was barely in the office at all. Supervisors were helpful managers were stressed. Hardest part about the job was the summers.
good,"I log in and sift though most important e-mails first."
good,"My review may be dated as stopped working at Time Warner Cable shortly before they were acquired by Charter.  Overall, while there were elements I enjoyed and I was able to learn, I didn't feel involved enough in day-to-day operations as I may have liked.  I feel the internship positions would have benefitted by bringing people in earlier (rather than just weeks before the beginning of 'busy season"") so that they could be more extensively trained."
good,"Shift changes every six months. Best part of job promoting, coaching and developing call center agents. Achieving the goals set-forth were time cosuming  and challenging to produce good long-range results."
good,"Skilled leadership, demand for high quality sales reps, fun place to work. Customer service focused, call flow oriented, a polished and resilient business acumen is a must."
good,Cable Company looking to drive customer satisfaction across the board.  Providing simple and easy product choices for all customer segments.  Average place to work.
good,"managers are great, people are great but policy and procedures arent the best for accomplishing sales goals.  Departments dont talk to each other so customers get transferred all day and all random calls come in and hurt your performance at times.  If you can work thru the constant all day sales requirements then yes its not a bad position. The pay does sort of equal things out."
good,change positions often.  Management not bad.  everyone has to drink the water and sell services.  good customer service good training options
good,"I had a good experience, just their something that i really didn't agree with, but always worked around them. good environment, they do take care of they're employee's."
good,"climbing poles, crawling under houses trailors,nasty homes, dumb people. Deppending on where you are the managment could be great. if someone knows someone up top they will make it farther than the hardest worker."
good,"Work days here are unpredictable. It could be a slow or busy day, depending on weather, outages, and technical issues. I really enjoy meeting new people on the phones daily, and helping teach them how to troubleshoot, and give them a bit of independence. The difficult part of the job is having to remember the constant changes done. Due to my disability, it's a challenge for me, but I still truck through. I learned about patience, and to remain calm in the hardest scenarios."
good,"I love my coworkers, they make the balance of work and productivity a great experience. the customers we deal with can make the day awesome as well. The best part of work is the participation of our management."
good,I learned great customer service skills and learned how to make each persons guest experience the greatest possible and to ensure I was very fast and accurate so guests could enjoy what they came to our venue to see or listen too.
good,"a morning at TWC, phone calls ringing off the hook. people upset sad or just mean that their services have issues or just don't work. workorders for tech runs"
good,"I like my job for the most part, I just want to get paid more. It's very laid back and no micro management. There is a lot of opportunity to move up if you get in the right department."
good,Does not pay enough especially for a technical support job. It does have great health benefits and you get free cable and internet. But the pay does not match with the job duties.
good,"TWC was acquired by Charter Communications in May 2016. "
good,"Friendly staff, the training structure could be better but the trainers and mentors are very nice. Many schedules to choose from. To many changes going on at the present time."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"The company itself was awesome. Benefits are great and the upper management was great. But as far as direct superviors, (JM) initials. Doea nothing for his employees and makes his own rules and guidelines asthe weeks pass. Every week he adds more and k per after every meeting. Then won't help people out when they ask for help. Also criticizes you when the proper tools aren't provided for the job assignments."
good,"As an inbound sales rep, this job does not have any work life balance. The pay is decent if you can stay with in quin tile  1 or 2 for your commission check. If not then you will just be making 11 dollars an hour. To me the hourly wage should at least be between 14-15 dollars an hour"
good,"Management is pretty crooked and there is definite favoritism. This was tolerable only because 90% of time was spent out of office. Still, best territories given to favorites. Opportunity to make money. Great Benefits. Great co-workers"
good,"Typical day is within the cubicle, on the computer, making them hit their quota. Its always nice to work alongside people with interactive protocols."
good,Being on a computer speaking with customers was at times very tireing but good think we got provided with 2 - 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute luch during our shift.
good,I prefer to say nothing about the company. Great benefits and decent pay. that's about it. co workers are awesome and commission is great too . great place if you need fast cash
good,"When you are first hired into Bright House Networks, the training is top notch; very thorough and interactive. They teach you everything you need to know before you hit the floor at the call center. Afterwards the typical work-day consists of you taking calls and helping customers. At first it's really fun, you learn a lot very quickly then when you get the hang of things, stuff starts becoming a little repetitive. The main thing that varies are the interactions that you have with customers. Bright House Networks prides itself on their customer service, so the main goal is having a good interaction with the customer, sympathizing with them and making them have a good experience. You will be graded by a scale they call C.A.R.E. (Customers are really everything). At least when I worked there C.A.R.E. was always getting re-vamped which made things a bit challenging. Like having an invisible script. C.A.R.E. is probably the most difficult part of the job for most people. (Well besides the very rare super angry customer). The most enjoyable part of the job are the good interactions you have with people and the gratification you feel by hearing them sincerely thank you for helping them out. That and the co-workers were all great, it's easy to fit in with most people. Everyone that I met was very respectful and cool. Management is okay for the most part. When news hit that Charter bought Bright House Networks things started to change slightly. Last but not least, the attendance policy is the biggest con, one minute late and you are marked late. This happens three times within 5 months"
good,Great place to work.  Great co workers. There are opportunities to grow and learn. Not sure how things will go with Charter buy out.
good,TWC was just acquired by Charter Communications.   They will be closing the Herndon office and asking employees to relocate.
good,"In the Retention department you are taking calls from customers that are calling to either lower the bill or completely disconnect the services from Charter Communications.  Your job is to save the customer and keep as much retained revenue as possible.  This is a very performance and numbers orientated environment.  The management is looking at all kinds of stats every day.  It seems that management is always looking for something wrong, no matter how well your metrics are."
good,"I have been working at Time Warner Cable more than a year now. I've had extensive training regarding customer service and product knowledge. I don't believe management was always on the same page locally and enterprise wide. I work with a very diverse group of peers. The hardest part of the job is retaining strained relationship with unhappy customers. I can honesty state that the job is low stress, has a great commission scale, its a comfortable call center environment, has great incentives, and over all a great company."
good,"Multi-state company with good possibilities for advancement and relocation, customer service is of the utmost importance."
good,"OK place to work anywhere, but the best places are major metro areas.  This gives you the best opportunity for advancement."
good,"Receiving phone calls from new and existing customers and trying to sell our digital services whether it's to a new customer, or upselling to an existing customer. I learned that the more knowledge you have in regards to the products you're selling, will help you overcome those customers who may be hesitant on whether or not that they should buy. I feel that the management is great and they take the time to do anything possible that will help make you successful in selling. I love working and being around my co-workers."
good,I hate that I'm even looking for another job because I love the industry but it has to be done.  The company can't decide who they are and constantly changes directions.  TWC means things will change.  Management is so focused on having a process in place they never question the process.  Want to gain customers but don't watch the back door.
good,"The pay was excellent, advancement unless you wanted to be floor supervisor was non-existent, holidays offered in handbook were not honored after hire."
good,Talking to customers all day long about there services not working. Having to correct issues created by other  rep or technicians. In some case the calls are back to back with no break or just a few moments between calls.
good,the job was a good learning experience environment to work. it was very laid back and the place was clean.there was always alot of time to get work done
good,"TWC-BC is a separate company operating under the Time Warner Cable umbrella.  Typically one in the Account Executive role will go to daily morning meetings beginning at 8:30am.  Then we will do some cold calls or door knocking for a few hours, set appointments and attend appointments, then follow up and ensure we have enough activity in order to sell $3000 in new monthly revenue every month.  This is all new revenue which is what Account Executives go for.  "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Twc is a cover up they say a lot of things in the beginning but in the end do not stick to their word. They do not care for their employees as they say they do. They are not a team playing company..
good,"With the upcoming merger with Charter/TWC , the managers are  trying protect their positions, which means they come up with more numbers that employees have to meet. When I started they were more supportive of the common worker and there was a lot less politics."
good,"This company has great benefits when it comes to insurance, matching 401k, and free services. However,  management shows a lot favoritism which does help not much if you're looking for advancement and they don't favor you."
good,"I really like Time Warner Cable, but if you are someone who does not take change well then it is not the place for you. They are constantly changing regulations and how the work place progresses, some of these changes are for the better and some of them are not,"
good,"The job in it's self is good, but with the upcoming Merger what seemed like a employee/ customer focused environment, turned into a company focused environment"
good,"It was a learning experience. You have to be and stay motivated. If you put in the work, the reward was great. It was very fast pace and never a dull moment. You have to meet all of the set goals by the company and faced being written up if those goals were not met. You have to have an, Im a winner personality to truly succeed at TWC."
good,Charter Communications is a good company to work for in regards to pay and benefits.  The services they offer are top notch and easy to support and believe in.  There are many good people work for Charter and that helps make the local offices feel more like family.  However Leadership directives coming from the State and Regional levels are questionable at times and not open for debate.
good,Lacked job security and never new when I would be laid off which eventually happened. The employee benefits were good and family oriented.
good,Hardest part of the job is making sure you maintain the required qouta to be in good standing with the company. Things change alot but was able to go with the flow.
good,"Great pay. Hourly and commission for the position of sales rep. However,  the grading or tracking of your sales numbers are left to be desired. You are to try and sell Internet, phone and cable to new or existing customers. Ok,  problem is calls that you don't sell on count against your numbers. That means if someone calls and they don't speak English, it counts against you; someone calls and they have bad debt with charter, it counts against you; even if you get hung up on,  we'll you get the point. And of course, YOU MUST FOLLOW THE CALL FLOW. Other than that, wonderful coworkers, some cool supervisors and free legal cable."
good,"Typical day of 10 ton 12 jobs. You will learn trouble shutting skills of telephone, cable, and high speed internet. co-workers are easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is staying on track with the work load given each day."
good,"I worked at Charter for nearly two years. I started as technical support in the residential department and then promoted to the business department in which I had weekends off and they were a lot more laid back. Towards the end they started to enforce the ridiculous rules they have in residential, as far as QA goes. A lot of people started leaving due to the knew attendance policy as well. I got depressed working here, the monotony is brain numbing and I had to leave. The pay is the only reason people stay here, or they promote to the NOC."
good,"Customer service with Time Warner Cable can be a very challenging position.  Working in the field of technology means you have to be ready for changes at anytime.  Reps take a variety of calls regarding cable, phone and internet troubleshooting.  We use many different programs and resources to solve the customers issues.  Billing and payment arrangements are also a big part of our day.  Making sure customers know when their payment is due and if cannot pay what options they have to keep services on.  The hardest part of my job is to explain to customers that are in an outage why its happening and when services are going to be back on.  Sometimes as Customer Service Reps, we are not given that information.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I can help people on a regular basis with their entertainment needs."
good,"TWC used to be a good company before Rob Marcus took over.  The benefits are still great, but management is horrible.  I have learned a lot about Excel and PeopleSoft while I have been there, but I would like to leave while TWC is still standing and not consumed by Charter."
good,They are back to back calls with different types of issues and scheduling trouble calls. There are some things that need to be fix inside the company. I'm still not use to the high call volume of calls
good,"I love my job, I just do not like being micromanaged when I am a salary employee who understands how to accomplish tasks and be #1 in my field."
good,I have learned a lot working at Time Warner Cable that is relevant to my educational background. I experience technology that keeps me up to date with current technological trends.
good,"Clock in, review all emails, communicate to customer service and sales reps any new changes."
good,Many opportunities within the company but overall stressful dealing with the customers that call in. Opportunity to advance and move around within the company. It is a call center therefore you are constantly on the phone
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Working with a team is the best. Working to solve problems and helping one another. "
good,The management needs more training and better behaviorism.. Typical day consistent call volume. The most enjoyable things about the job were the customers.
good,"A typical day:  Really time consuming make goods on client orders for advertising that failed.  Answered calls and questions that clients may have had on their advertising needs and contracts.  "
good,"I was hired as a cashier and progressed into a lead where I would check in vendors, put orders away, cashiered and trained new hires."
good,"A typical day at work was logging into to all your systems with two computer screens, following a layed out work schedule. I did like the overall call center atmosphere, The management had to be the worst part of this job; Ver unprofessional things constantly changing without any notice or information until well after the fact. Everything the failed at the tried to push on to representatives of any level for their mistakes--Only bad thing I have to say about this company! The job was fairly easy if you had all the information you needed to do the job efficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a schedule to follow and  being able to help customers either with financial situations or if it was as simple as getting someones cable back on and working by troubleshooting and working with the customer!"
good,Work is sedentary with a dependance on programs updated within the system. I learned that new and bigger companies aren't always better. Management was great until I was assigned a new superior who worked out of another state (and wasn't prepared for the job). My co-workers were fun and supportive. The hardest part of the job was not having a family atmosphere once the new company took over. The most enjoyable part was working at my own pace (I do best given an assortment of tasks & being efficient in completing them).
good,"time warner cable is a fun job as a tech,however to much pressure to hurry which causes you not to be fully concentrated on job your doing."
good,Not a bad place to work. Problem with chain of command where people don't communicate as well as they should. Benefits are great
good,If you are money driven then this is the job for you. Good benifits and easy to go to the next level
good,"A typical day of work here includes creating and presenting sales reports, managing a team of 9 commercial sales people (training, coaching, and developing)."
good,"a typical day would be to open the store, greet customers, take payments, issue or return equipment, educate customers on our services as well as their equipment, address customer issues and concerns, selling and upgrading services, and at the end of the day, count and balance all monies and prepare the deposit."
good,"Engage in positive customer interactions, speaking to an estimated 60-100+ customers in a typical 8 hour work day.  Being a brand ambassador for the company's products as well as an advocate to the customer, matching them with the best products for their everyday needs.  In this position I learned time management, punctuality, and working as part of a team.  Everyday I improved my ability to communicate to individuals in both a professional and a human manner.  Management coached us to do better and reach for higher goals.  My fellow coworkers worked as part of a team, helping each other out when needed.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with a highly upset customer.  To find a resolution we would have to understand their point of view as to why they are frustrated, and show them the best resolution.  The most enjoyable part of the job was volunteering within the community as a company spokesperson."
good,Very conservative environment for growth.  Individual contributors are highly experienced.
good,"• Listen patiently and em-pathetically, track information, and apply consultative skills regarding our"
good,"Customer's calling in to add or buy products. I learned so much dealing with computers and the different programs."
good,Refined my phone skills and ability to multitask on a computer. Immediate supervisors worked close with employees to make sure they understood and how to improve day to day tasks
good,"A typical day was getting ready for the phone calls.  I learned that even over the phone people can be harsh, but understand why.  Some of the management were understanding and nice.  Others were just trying to make the quota's and didn't care about much more then that.  My co-workers were awesome.  We were a team, the more experience helped the new employees.  The hardest part of the job to me, was sometimes I had a hard time understanding the caller.  Also, getting a customer who wasn't treated right by another customer service rep.  The most enjoyable was helping those who were toss around and making their day.  And really it felt good that I helped someone."
good,loved learning a new industry and obtaining skills i learned there
good,"Great job for making decent money with great benefits. Health, Dental, and free cable and internet. Fun work environment with weekly, monthly, yearly incentives from money to paid trips and anything in between."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I was responsable to entrer all new address to the data base "
good,Working environment is very laid back and you do not get disturbed too easily. My supervisor is just awesome and makes it that much better to work and my team is great. The one thing that I did not like is the hours and having to work a weekend day.
good,"A typical day at work is making appoints on time, greeting customers, and battling the elements. Hardest part of the job is working hot summers in attics where temperatures seem twice as hot and extreme cold that make wiring outside tough on fingers. The pay could be higher for the level of responsibility."
good,"Busy work place, everything is based on commission. Call center environment, hour lunch is nice. Must meet quotas on a daily basis."
good,"I was hired to sell internet, phone and video options to small-medium businesses, but the territory given was small, over-saturated and very little demand left. I was given unrealistic sales quotas that could never be met and the closest I came was 50% and they never paid me for it because they let me go at the end of that month. I was told it would take up to three years to develop a good referral partner program and was expected that 20-30% of my sales generated from those partners; however, I was given 11 months to compete against our call center, 24/7 advertising on TV and other representatives in the area and not allowed to advertise."
good,Fast paced job.  Always learning something new.  Great working equipment.  Great benefits.
good,"A typical day at work would start at 11:00 A.M. either at the first job site, or the home office. Once on a job site, I would greet the customer, find out their problem, fix it, then leave. I would have an average of about 13 jobs a day that would average about 45 min. per job."
good,Very faced paced. Assisted with technical support. Set up trouble calls for customers with cable service issues.
good,Worked as a consultant and made good money. Met nice people there.
good,"60-80 calls per day, inbound regional call center serving TWC internet, phone, and TV customers.  Great co-workers, mostly excellent supervisors with only a single exception.  Irate customers dealing with inept or inexperienced installers and field service techs makes a technical support job difficult, at times.  The best part of the job is solving a problem that others failed to previously, and educating the customer so that they understand what went wrong.  I was told by management I had a rather large stack of unsolicited customer compliments in my employee file when I quit.  I learned a lot about troubleshooting PCs, network connectivity, wireless connections, OS configurations, driver/OS compatibility, virus/malware removal, and general customer service type skills, billing, account management, credits, marketing, upgrade/downgrade, etc."
good,Privileged to have had great co-workers. The benefits were very good and affordable.
good,Great overall place to work.  Plenty of overtime.  Knowledgeable  supervisors.
good,Excellence in Customer Service many advancement opportunites
good,If you just worry about doing your job you should be fine company great to work for if you don't get too overwhelmed with numbers and focus on the task at hand
good,A typical day starts off pretty fast up beat then during day u going to run into some issue u cant fix  it might be and outage on a pc software issue or a customer issue and that will change how some co workers act. The hardest part of he job is the bad  schedules and low pay the good part is the overtime .
good,"A great day at Time Warner Cable includes satisfying my customer base by meeting all needs when it comes to entertainment regarding televisoin, internet, and telephone."
good,"Time Warner Cable carries great benefits, and fair compensation, however, there are a lot of layoffs happening in the company as a result of restructuring that has been going on for the last few years."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I facilitated emails and monitored six contracting companies to ensure compliance with Time Warner procedures. I learned how to use excel and multitask. I developed management skills and learned to work as a dispatcher. I enjoyed helping people and making contacts within the company to learn about the different functions they have. The hardest part was having to be strict with the procedures and not being able to help people when I felt I needed to. I enjoyed the position, the status and the small team I was apart of."
good,"Retain customers by using knowledge of core products. Processing discos depending on whether or not we save the customers from switching to another carrier. The hardest part of the job was retaining customers because of the competition. The managers are helpful, and have alot of energy. The most enjoyable part of the job is depending on your performance you can win prizes and you can get a better schedule."
good,"The place has the worst customers on the planet, you will soon begin to resent every dimwitted person that calls in, on the other hand they have lots of employee events to keep morale up"
good,"I like to help customers resolve issues. When we first started it sounded like a great company, however things have changed alot they are letting reps go weekly. The management is not the best,we were to have weekly trainings and that has not happened. I come in and take calls from customers needing help with their services."
good,"Typical day at work i was to take inbound calls regarding cable.Mostly angry customers was to call in about billing but also focused on upgrading,cross sailing and sailing. Managers was active and involved. Co workers always had your back when needed advice or help."
good,Charter Communications is the perfect job choice if you are seeking a place where you look forward to the same work on a daily basis. This is a very large company and there is opportunity for advancement. You can really find out what you want to do and go after it here. They offer good vacation/sick days for first year. If you are attending school be warned: they will only accommodate your school schedule after 90 days. If you are in the middle of a semester it is in your best interest to make sure you can accommodate your school schedule around your work schedule. I loved the people and the management. Be prepared to deal with customers that are not always happy.
good,"In time Warner Cable, there is a lot of room to grow with the support of supervisors and the representatives there. I've learned so far there that no matter how much you think you know, there is always room to learn more. Co-workers there are great, being they're willing to help anyone out that's in need. The hardest part of the position i would say is knowing the person to where you can relate information over the phone and having the person understand you. It's something that comes along the way with experience but as long as you have the will, you'll be fine. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say is knowing that you have made the customers day after your interaction with them is over. Nothing is more satisfying then knowing you made your customer a satisfied customer."
good,"A typical day would include coming in 15 minutes before your shift, setting up your work area ensuring you have updated information about the current promotions; reading and answering all your emails; checking in with the supervisor. I learned how to handle a large volume of calls and maintain a sense of professionalism with the toughest customers. The most enjoyable part was feeling a sense of accomplishment when I would help a customer get a good deal and a great package that would meet their needs."
good,"My job as a Field Service Tech III was enjoyable as well as labor intensive at times. The joy and agony could be summed up in the type of customer I had to deal with and the work involved if a problem needed to be addressed. The gamut could range from a disgruntled customer with the quality of service experienced or integrity of the equipment to whether I had to go into a crawl space or attic replacing coax, phone line, or network cabling to climbing a utility pole to troubleshooting the cause of a s/n issue on a cable or internet service, or to even replacing a cable drop. Sometimes I would have these calls back to back, for which I couldn't wait for the day to end. "
good,The problem is that they have there reps trying to Win-back customers in areas where Verizon Fios has just been installed. Verizon has done a magnificent job marketing Fios and it is overall a much better product. This coupled with Time Warner Cables bad reputation and the fact that most of these Win-back customers had to pay outstanding balances which were usually high made it an almost impossible undertaking.
good,"I took calls for inbound sales 40 to 60 a day .I learned to transition call into sales that were not sales calls.Management was willing to help as much as possible. co-workers were great to work with very compatiable. the hardest part was getting time to call customers back time was not permitted . the most enjoyable was being able to help people for what they need for home entertainment,"
good,Was able to learn and apply the aspects of the cable industry and worked my way from a customer service representative to become the lead dispatcher
good,"Up till the day I was terminiated, the work, environment, and staffing were great."
good,I wanted more responsibility and Charter was built to prevent this.
good,"The company strives to deliver total communication solutions to companies through High speed data, business class phone lines, cable television, cloud services and fiber connections."
good,"This experience has help me develop many professional skills. Unfortunately as with many sales jobs, this position is not as secure."
good,This company offered great benefits and had an overall fun environment.
good,Good company to work for. Typical large firm. Cable Industry is in flux at this point and job stabilty may be questionable.
good,"i worked as a contractor in time Warner cable, they paid good but i had no time for anything."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"When I applied i was told I would be trained. Well all they do is have you sit in a class for 1 week and read. Then the 2nd week all you learn is ladder safety. You don't really learn anything at all (hands on) about what you need to do and what you'll run into. My ""supervisor"" didn't give me all the tools I needed, and I found out the hard way a lot of my tools were junky POS. When he had to leave for a certain reason for a few weeks, the boss that was supposed to replace him for a few weeks never even came to the office. Terrible organizing. Don't apply if you have no experience."
good,"Great staff, management is very solid. Vision for the company is very optimistic due to industry connections."
good,"Depending on the department, this was a great place to work. Great benefits and the new attendance policy is great. Would have stayed with them if they didn't remove my whole department."
good,working here was a challenge for myself.
good,Job can be very challenging but very stable. I have learned a lot from Time Warner Cable for the 5 years I have been a part of the TWC family.
good,I am like working for Time Warner Cable I am looking to advance in my career.
good,"People are great to work with. However, no support from upper management."
good,"Time warner cable id a good company to work for. It keeps you on your toes at all times. Time warner cable is a leader in wirless sercives. I learn alot about myself at this job,that I can work witj orthers,and with a team.Its alot of learning.It kepps your mind and body busy.Thers alot ways to improve yourself,promote within."
good,"Take home vehicle were awesome. Great benefits, but the pay was horrible!"
good,Flexible schedule allows for independent time management. Cultivating relationships and developing networks are critical to the success of your business as well as achieving company goals and objectives. The friendly work environment and willingness of others to help definitely helped shorten the learning curve and encourage success. The most difficult part of the job was the lack of a structured training program that provided the tools necessary to cultivate growth and development early in the process. What I enjoyed most was being able to develop trusting relationships with customers as well as resolve issues and erase concerns thus providing them with a wonderful experience.
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Time Warner is it's employees. Good management staff and good products. Each day is a new challenge and a new chance to better yourself.
good,Process daily report to increasing company revenue for equipment rented by customers.
good,Work 10 hours a day minimum.
good,Very strssful job very busy office lots of customer I felt some of the goals they gave us were unrealistic very hard to meet each month. no room for advancement in that office . co-worker were great I loved working with the girls but lead person as terrible.
good,"It was fun to learn, but they dont prep you very well for calls in training. Pay is nice and hours are okay. Shift bids dont help though, you could be working amazing hours that you need for a while and then get thrown into a new shift. Not very good job security."
good,"We would walk into the warehouse and grab equipment that we needed for jobs we were going to have through the day. Everyday was a challenge because we would walk into houses that we had to service not knowing the jobsite,everyone was different. Some jobs would be installs and some would repairs. There was no easy job so thats why training was pretty to tough. I learned how to figure out a job pretty quick to where we only had one chance to do things right because these were peoples homes we were dealing with. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was that our worksite were always different and everyday was something new."
good,Working your hardest and being honest was not rewarded. Misleading customers was secretly promoted and doing work for free was common. Time punches were done what some would consider illegally and more work would be added as departments were closed with no additional compensation.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,typical day at work was reviewing my route and writing it down checking my equipment returning broken equipment for new equipment. I learned how to deal with angry customers and how to hide cable on the outside so it won't be seen by customers. Management was good at times. Co-workers were good for help and picking up work if needed I would do the same. Hardest part was trying to crawl in attic spaces and crawl spaces underneath the house while running new cable lines. The most enjoyable part was working outdoors in the sun and rain and basically working on my own.
good,"Spectrum"" Great opportunity to make some some good money. Great office setting and laid back staff. If your great at sales then commission is good.A great place to develop a career in the cable industry. They offer great benefits. ... Working in the industry you can learn a lot about the technical aspects of cable and infrastructure. We are consistently evolving in the cable industry."
good,This job does not give out raises nor do they let you advance to a different tech level if your a cable technician. Been working for the company two and half years and have not received a raise yet even if your numbers are good and never had any issues at work what so ever.
good,"great benefits "
good,"main issues are with low pay and upper management. no issues with office management or anyone within local office, however upper management within company continues to add more and more work to be done at each job without proper compensation to pay rate. course work to advance as technician must be done online outside of work."
good,"Typical day at work has a lot of driving in NYC, great working with all types of company's in NY. Learned a lot about the in and outs of NYC. Management not a strong point due to changing company's and union battle. Workplace is fine i drive in every day and don't report to any base. I go straight to my jobs and go about my day. Hardest part of my day is travel and the most enjoyable part is meeting new people from all different businesses."
good,Spectrum field technician is an incredible job with many great benefits and options for advancement. The problem is management and the way they treat us. Constant micromanagement has been an ongoing issue and only seems to be getting worse.
good,Compensation is very good for sales.  It is high stress based on management's expectations.  Mandatory overtime is the worst part in my opinion.  The company doesn't handle employees that abuse time off.
good,"Providing great customer service, learning about new upcoming products, great supervisor that worked with us as a team. Sometimes our services were down due to unforeseen issues, explaining your concerns to customers."
good,Working in a call center is not for everybody.  I enjoy helping customers resolve issues and the fast pace of the job.  The most difficult part of the job is managing irate customers.
good,"It started out as a great place to work when it was Time Warner Cable, once Spectrum took over it was stressful and ever changing metrics. Got laid off and nobody saw it coming."
good,Charter/Spectrum has a solid foundation and is a secure place to work. The work is demanding but the pay is on par and they do promote from within. Heavy contract work force.
good,"Good company to build experience. Advance at your own speed, usually one year to progress to next level, test required. 6 levels to progress. Bonus and holidays paid."
good,"Processes are tough and very little support to help you from management. So much time spending on processes that it's tough meeting your objectives. The benefits and pay are good, and great people to work with."
good,"It was a great company until it switched over and they took away our commission and changed the pay structure.  the management was always willing to have coachings when personally requested, as well as team meetings and CE training when requested. they would listen to suggestions and pass along info to corporate."
good,"The following is a summary of my experiences with Spectrum"
good,Great place to get a lot of technical experience. Advancement is very possible at this company. They will help with continuing education in the position that you are in as well as future positions when they become available.
good,"The culture change since changed from TWC to Spectrum. More numbers base instead of people. Morale is down need better incentives to look forward to and someone to really listen not just say ""We will look into it""."
good,"My time at Spectrum was great. The management was caring, the environment was as fun as it could be (as far as call center work goes), and my teammates quickly became family to me. However, the business rules and regulations towards their services were very strict, and very rarely could we ever truly help out customers who are trying to either lower their bill, or to make a bad situation better by compensating in any other way. Spectrum truly doesn't 'help' customers, they give them information, good or bad, whether they like it or not. In the end, the phone conversations very rarely end on a good note, and  you go through that for 8+ hours a day."
good,"The job in the field was great!  Management not so great, way too much micro managing going on. Supervisors have no power anymore.  They have made it to where the employees always have to be afraid of being fired or made an (example) of.  My exit interview, I told my displeasure and she started using vulgar words against me."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"While the pay is good, but if you don't find a work friend quickly you can really wither away. You have to earn the good shifts through performance. Good job if you like being yelled at on the phone all day"
good,Good job. Great insurance/ benefits. Supervisors micromanage. Lack of structure. Goals seem impossible some days. Commission structure always changing. (Heat is up way too high in the winter it gave me headaches)
good,I enjoyed more than 2 decades with what was to become Spectrum. I chose to leave to spend more time with family. For all 23 years my wife and I had different schedules.
good,"Spectrum is undergoing major changes due to converging companies. I enjoy working with all of the staff. The pay and benefits are amazing for what it is, that being said, it is still hard to live off of. The toughest part of the job is the climate of taking call-after-call with very upset customers. Spectrum has a strict policy on attendance as well as schedule adherence."
good,"Constant changes within the work place, which is expected, but everything is closely monitored. You would have to be an individual who must be able to adjust and work hard constantly. Every mistake will count against you and so you must stay focused."
good,You spend most of your time working from 4-7/8pm. Most times you have to start your day early like around 9-10 am and still work late. No overtime pay.
good,"training is great you learn alot but being thrown into the phones is very stressful. Customers are always upset, the phones are constantly ringing its never ending."
good,"The job was awesome when it was Time Warner and Brighthouse, but when it became Spectrum it got very stressful and strick. A lot of employee quiting. Management  was different, everything just change."
good,"When i was hired into the company i was a Brighthouse employee. I handled sales, tech support and billing calls. Brighthouse treated there employees with respect and recognition was always given. When the company was sold to Spectrum there were some hiccups as to be expected when new management came aboard. Our environment changed slightly due to new guidelines given to help our existing customers adapt to the price increases or ""cost of doing business"" from Spectrums lineup. Overall as a employee of Spectrum I'd say it was a stepping stone."
good,Before the merger things were much better culture wise because we were a family owned organization.  Once we merged with Charter that family type culture definitely went away.  Overall Charter was a good company with good pay and decent benefits
good,"Spectrum is an interesting company. Their attrition rate is so high that they don't invest much in their current employees. Despite winning awards and breaking records in my training group, I was not offered any opportunities to match."
good,Fast paced ever changing team enviroment team change at any time procedures change everyday. No suggestions from employees.  No work from option. Short term disability company is not a good company.
good,"A good company, which gives you an awesome opportunity to earn uncapped omission. Would recommend to everyone who is looking in a good sales position."
good,"I had 500 addresses that I had to cover in a month by going door to door hitting 50 to 100 addresses daily trying to sell our services. Customer had to keep the services for 30 days along the Outside Sales Rep to be able to make commission. Had to have at least 10 sales monthly to make commission with $10,000 yearly. Only received $400 monthly for mileage reimbursement and our expenses for driving monthly was way more than that."
good,For the most part Spectrum was a fun place to work but the inconsistent work hours and constant hateful phone calls made it emotionally exhausting. If I was single with no kids it would be a perfect place to work.
good,"Its likely your typical call center job, they really care about you when you are there, but the callers don't. Great training, good environment, just people forget how to behave when they are on the phones."
good,"Enjoyed my job as far as going out and meeting customers and talking to them about their internet, cable & phone needs.  Hardest part of job is getting all your installs in."
good,"when I work it was Time Warner Cable it was a great working environment positive positive driven lots of music playing Raffles promotions it was a relatively great environment. For me it just wasn't the job.. just didn't like being tied to the phone for my entire day. If you are awesome at inside customer service sales in like working with a zip tone it's the place to be. A very sales motivated office lots of opportunities to earn bucks , swag and vacation trips.  I was just a little too hyper and needed a little bit more flexibility and freedom to move around otherwise great pay great people lots of benefits and perks."
good,"I had no problem installing or repairing services, even if it meant staying on a job later than usual due to the job description. The relationship with the prior manager at that time was making every thing difficult for me, his communication skills was very unprofessional and that lead to me being fired..."
good,"Spectrum a great company to work for. Time warner cable was a great company as well, taking care of employees, the  willing to help promote and always learning something new daily."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"If you have thick skin and are able to keep a professional demeanor throughout the day of speaking with frustrated customers, then this job will give you no problem."
good,"pressure of meeting and deadlines all the time moral was not good. every week there was a one on one meeting with your manager, I did not like spectrum because they did every backwards in my opinion."
good,I like the folks I work with. They are a great team. The job provides an opportunity to learn new things and ideas. The weekly work rules seem to change a lot.
good,"Expect to chat with coworkers and be ranked in your end of the year review in terms of teamwork, networking, and sociability."
good,"Spectrum gave you security in your schedule, no less than 40 hours per week and all benefits included. Paid vacations and sick hours accumulated. Work schedule fluctuated."
good,"A typical day at work would be to answer incoming calls and offer customers the best service available to suit their needs. "
good,Back to back calls non stop even on Holidays. Upset customers on almost every call. The company tells you to act a certain way and to keep your job you have to act another. I worked from home with TWC but no work from home at Spectrum. Spectrum put in a pay cap to all employees and added more work to the routine.
good,Great co-workers and direct supervisors. Health insurance not as good as it previously was. Although still get free services which is a great value. Other benefits we previously received we no longer do. One of the largest changes is in department relocations.
good,"Hard work and long hours, very rarely do i get an easy day.  Every day felt like the grinding would never end. When your excitement level gets to the point where you being to hate your work, then you know its time for a change"
good,"In the time I've worked for Spectrum, I've seen the atmosphere go from feeling like a family environment to something else all together different from that. It used to feel like you were working for a company that cared about its employees, but now is more concerned with the almighty dollar than its people. Spectrum is still a good company to work for, but the overall atmosphere has changed, and my current position will be coming to an end in the next couple of years. I would still recommend Spectrum as a good place to work, but I'm looking to make a career change, and I'm finding it hard to find a position at Spectrum that spikes my interest and will allow me to advance."
good,"Good job security but very little opportunity for advancement."
good,Busy and day goes by very fast due to fast passed work environment. Decent management and training at all times. Hours are not flexible at all for the first 6 months.
good,"Company is going through a merger, has a very old school mentality of working in certain locations, even when there is no physical meetings/interactions. They tote themselves as the industry leader in technology, yet have dated policies of where people have to sit in order to perform their jobs. Great place to work if your a manager or above."
good,I actually started at this company before the merger and there was a big change in environment. Management often seems stressed and not well informed of company business. Commision structure sucks too
good,"Working at Spectrum Requires a lot of multitasking, strong communication & negotiating skills. Stressful environment & very fast paced. You need to have a thick skin for dealing with angry customers. You are expected to sell on every call even if they're not a sales related call."
good,"Unrealistic deadlines. It always seemed that projects were a get it completed yesterday kind of attitude. The only time that any changes are able to be made is after hours. So there would be weeks of late night work, and they would still expect you to work your daily job."
good,"Spectrum is an alright company to work for. The pay and benefits are amazing but their is really strict policy and procedures so there is not a lot you can do to help you customers. You have to deal with people all across the country and most of them are not a pleasant experience. Otherwise the work environment is great, management is amazing, and you cant beat free cable, internet, & phone"
good,I was not a fan of policies toward customers. it created hostile interactions and there weren't great options to fix complex situations.  Overall it's a great temporary place to be if you are good at handling stress. There will be supportive team memebers who understand there to help you.
good,Yeah it was okay I guess... a little to corporate for me if I'd say so myself. Other than that management was okay I guess. Loved the work Culture tho.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"co workers were great to work with, If needed help on something good luck was very hard to get someone to assist you , overall was a good place to work"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was my early morning shift and my free services. I had weekends and holidays off. i have never worked late nights. i enjoy working at the company.
good,The only reason I am leaving spectrum is do to moving to another state were they do not offer spectrum. I tried to transfer in house but do to the fact this company is completely un-organized my transfer fell through after I already signed my new lease in a new state. Spectrum Charter is now losing one of their top employees do to their sloppiness.
good,"-Best part of this job was the flexible work hours. Was not a 9-5 job, and not required to work early. "
good,"I loved working for Time Warner Cable but when they were taken over and because Spectrum, too many things changed. Many departments were closed. And they stated to customers that the call centers that were out sourced in other countries were going to close and bring more jobs to the US. However before that they closed their small call centers that had people working for the company for many years. I would have never left had they not laid me off. I still don’t know if they closed their off shore call centers or not. It’s a very stressful job, so the work environment is everything to me and you just can’t have a close family type environment in a large call center."
good,Its a good company to work for but it became a little stressful at times dealing with the customer and keeping up with the stats require to keep our job. Some manager were good and other lack the motivation and people skills.
good,"Typical day is completing roughly 10-15 jobs where we bury the cable line, typically, by shovel. I learned some coping skills from this job. This job will throw obstacle after obstacle at you, and you have to push through it. Learning how to keep my emotions in check was very beneficial to learn. Management is shaky but I believe that's because it was the first year transitioning from Time Warner to Spectrum. Hardest part of the job is not quitting. You show up to certain jobs and don't feel as if you have it in you. Pushing through the want to quit is the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part of job was flexible hours but that turned out to be a disadvantage in the end because you have to make yourself work. Nobody is gonna make you go bury those lines and if you don't, you won't get anymore work sent to you."
good,Same types of calls each day and can be fairly stressful dealing with back to back upset customers. They do there best to be helpful to any one who requires assistance.
good,"High paced Call Center environment"
good,"The work days were long and hard.  Have to endure the harsh weather conditions such as 118 degree temperatures, wind and rain.  Some customers were nice, others hated Spectrum and their employees.  They only want you to make sales.  If you can't then you need to get another job!  Discrepancies with commission payouts."
good,"Wonderful people to work with.. not for. This Job was once very promising and rewarding. We became a strictly billing center and things no longer were interesting. We no longer have the ability to help, as much as I would like to."
good,"It's a nice place to work the benefits are not bad, they offer paid vacation and sick time. sometimes process do not make sense and they are not consistent with it"
good,"You work at your own paced within the limits of your work. You work on your own so its up to you how well something gets done. Do it right, you will have no problems."
good,"time warner cable prior to the spectrum merger was great. Now departments are being consolidated and moved to different parts of the U.S. job security is now a big worry for remaining employees. The benefits were great. 401k match, heath care, the works."
good,overall charter is  good company to work for. I would recommend business repair. Customers easier to work with than residential. You are on a headset all day. There is always something to learn on Business side you work with fixing internet/phone and cable services. I enjoyed working in a team with many members. Being an active listener helps with calls. Management in retention does not listen to the needs of employees and allowed bullying to go on. Other departments never had any issues with management. Recognition is always a plus at charter (spectrum).
good,"Worked there for 24 years and then after the Time Warner/Brighthouse purchase, they decided to implement the Time Warner way to do business with closing offices and relocating jobs to different areas in the country. Unfortunately, this decision has hurt the company greatly."
good,great compensation but difficult environment to work in; can be monotonous; goes through a lot of people i.e. churning; the new company has made significant changes
good,"Management and the tech were absolutely great at Charter Spectrum.    They were doing some absolutely amazing things."
good,This was a great company to work for when it was Time Warner Cable but Spectrum took over everything changed. I mis working for Time Warner Cable. I wish Spectrum didn't close our call center.
good,"Things were very relaxed prior to the merger. After the merger the stress tripled and the benefits were much worse. Overall, this is a good place to work and you at least have a slight opportunity to advance."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Can be very fast paced. "
good,"Answering calls from customers looking to pay their bills, technical issues, getting new services or rescheduling services."
good,work 40 hours a week and go home.  Go through the chain of commands to complete projects.  pay for your open lunches and snacks and coffee. just another day in the corporate world
good,"Very Good benefits and payment. Advancement Paths clear and achievable. A typical day at work includes getting a new customer on the phone every 10-20 minutes (in average). Most customers are nice and understand their services. Occasionally you can get a bad streak of very angry customers. 70% of the day people are nice."
good,Highly competitive sales culture.  Must have referral partners to truly excel at job.  Order management can delay sales cycle and sales processed.  Lucrative role if you surpass quota.
good,"As a contractor this has been a good experience.  "
good,"Charter Communications is still going through the effects of the merger with Timewarner.  It is very busy and seems a bit disorganized at times, but overall a good place to work."
good,Nice environment to work but management will not promote you after giving the best customer service you can. Favoritism is shown in the company and I don't want to work for a company that's not equal to everybody
good,"Overtime of an hour or more is expected yet hear no thanks, but be late by a couple minutes and they will be sure to let you know."
good,"My job at Time Warner was amazing at first. Once the merger began, so much uncertainty and policy change, took the excitement out of the job. It became about policy and procedure instead of assisting the customer."
good,Prior to Charter purchasing Time Warner Cable  was an excellent place to work and grow.  Once Charter came in they had a vision of creating 4 centers of excellence and expecting employees to uproot there lives and move to these locations.  They continue to move in this direction even though they are losing 80% of there talent.  Can you say Ego
good,Pay is alright make it hard to advance in smaller offices but overall a great job. Very social job and always customer facing because of this it has made me very good at de-escalating agitated customers.
good,This job is not for the weak hearted its very stressful and not everyone can do it but if you can you really learn what your made of you gain many new ways of thinking when it comes to problem solving you can move up here with the company you need to put work in and stand out from the others. people are nice management is not bad. I learned how to multitask better be a better problem solver I was never bad but this just added to my success
good,"Hard to give my review since I am not willing to relocate. However, while still working for the company, the management team that I work for is great."
good,"The job can be extremely rewarding, however, due to micromanagment, metrics and a disconnect between corporate and field employees, the job becomes very stressful."
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking payments, swapping equipment, setting up trouble calls and installations.  It also involves sales and trying to up-sell people."
good,TWC was a great place to work.  Their Shared Services for Accounts Payable has been a great experience all around.  I have done everything from answering phones for vendors to working with corporate cards.  The most difficult part of the job was dealing with employees that didn't understand the importance of timely expense reporting and how it affected their cards.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I could help employees figure out their balances.
good,A bit challenging. you really have to work for the commission. great benefits. free cable and internet. They pay you more if your bilingual.
good,Great benefits and great co-workers to work with.  Busy at times and can be slow as well.  Great customer base to work with on a daily basis.  Employees are easy to get along with.
good,"Great company to work for benefits wise. However the Management and their work ethics stands to be questioned. They are quick to shift work and blame on others if don't don't wish to handle a ""Irate customer"", and leave in the hands of the employees. If you not well versed in this area and not given the longitude to appease the customer and adhere to company policy at the same time, your job could be in jeopardy."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"*Outbound Sales position -B2B Sales"
good,"Great place to work. However, with the completed merge with Charter cable services, it is hard to determine if ones position will be maintained or ended."
good,"Loved working for the company, the pay was great and I was able to go in early and still have plenty of time in the day after work."
good,"Productive place to work, always coming up with creative ways to have fun. Management cares a lot about the employees, and always want to make sure their employees are happy."
good,"It's a good job for anyone who enjoys assisting customers over the phone with escalated situations. If you are tech. Savvy and can calmly assist customers, this job is for you. My biggest issue however is that there is no room for career advancement."
good,"Well I guess I do not have much to say, because time warner cable, has been sold to Charter. In the reail store, Raleigh market. The seem to hire within, only people that are fake, or brown noses."
good,"Answer phone calls from Time Warner Cable customers and handle their billing inquiries, troubleshooting, and service cancellation."
good,"Great group to work with. Met a lot of people during my time there. Upper management treated everyone like family. I was able to move around to different parts of the company, bringing my skills of customer contact to non-contact via phone."
good,Hard to advance if you don't speak spanish. Decent hours but summers will drain the life out of you. Company van was replaced three times due to disrepair.
good,"Recibía llamadas de los clientes y me daban acceso a su equipo , yo entraba y me ponía atrabajar , pero tenia oportunidad de escuchar mi música y hacer varias cosas ala vez, la parte mas difícil de mi trabajo era tratar con clientes pesados de mal carácter, o algún extranjero grosero, lo que mas me gusto es que pude aprender mucho y desarrollar mis conocimientos y crecer como persona"
good,I believe that self motivated professionals should excel in this environment. Freedom to set your own schedule and go after your results.
good,"A typical work day consists of being as productive as possible. I had an opportunity to work in a number of different departments, and as result I have improved my customer service and technical support skills. Management is accessible and in tune with the workers.  Interviewing for each position as if I where new to the company took some getting use to, but I am glad for the experience. There is always friendly competition going on between co-workers to be the top performer. I really enjoyed learning new things from my coaches and teammates."
good,Nice work environment. Pay is based off your commission and what you are able to sale. Lack in leadership. Benefits are excellent and retirement plan. The most enjoyable part of the job is being a part of a team that works together and willing to do what it takes to get the job done.
good,The position pays well if you are assertive with a sales background. If you are meek and can't handle abusive customer's than this isn't the place for you. You can do well if you are able to bypass the aggravation of incompetent customers.
good,this job was very stressful dealing with taking payment in high volume area and dealing with irate customers but I was able to adapt and mastered what I need to do left on good to terms
good,HR is horrible to work with you.  Management doesnt care.  HR means exactly what it says:  resouces out people like cattle.  They didn't care I needed of for religious reasons.
good,"TWC is a very relaxed work environment. Wonderful co workers and management.  The hardest part about my job would be myself, I'm a little hard on myself at time if I haven't reached my goals for the day. Most enjoyable part of my job is making sure my customers have exactly what is needed for their house hold"
good,A good company. It was fast paced. You had a lot of room for advancement within the company.  Good environment and the pay was good.
good,"Generally a good company. The sales department however lacks any type of long term job security. A recent change in how commission is paid  we penalize you by not paying you ANY commission if you have not met your sales quota.  In essence this means you could have a $1000 commission but if you miss your quota by one sale, you get nothing!"
good,Customer calling in mostly frustrated either yelling or swearing because they didn't like the company. I found it hard to take all the abuse from the customer who felt they had a right to talk and anything they and because we are customer service reps we had to take the abuse.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,It was a very competitive work environment . The one constant was  always change.
good,"If you like helping customers in various situations, this is the job for you. No call is the same and it can range from technical support to billing. You must be able to work in a fast pace environment as you use multiple programs at the same time. You must be able to handle stress as well. If you can't handle upset customers about various situations and take it personally, then this would not be the job for you. You must be able to be professional, courteous, and empathetic. You must be affective in team work as well. If these are strong qualities, then you will succeed and reap the rewards of commissions, being considered as a leader, and possible advancements in time. The benefits are outstanding. Great health insurance and service discounts."
good,A fast paced atmosphere with cable telecommunications information to relay to consumers. Changing of the guard (management) too often. A good networking tool. Very rewarding in assisting customers. High volume call expectancy.
good,"I worked there for 8years.enjoyed meeting new customers and helping old customers,working in the weather can be bad at times.my sup was awesome BUT as with anywhere there are buttkissers .The techs I worked with were great we always tried to help each other.their repeat service call policy is set up to make techs look bad.If you want to work for charter you must be able to change the way you do things from day to day because they tell you the way they want it today then in a day or two its differant"
good,"a typical day at work i may take 60 inbound call troubleshooting, internt and phone service"
good,"calls are taken the entire shift facilitating learning call control and de-escalation tactics. Management was poorly equipped to provide feedback on system use, though were always available for advise and coaching. Co-workers actively assisted each other in sharing best practices and providing information. Each day included a multitude of challenges that were only truly difficult when coupled with a lack of available support or information. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and speaking with new customers every day."
good,"I've been with Time Warner Cable for 6 years now. I recently relocated from Milwaukee, WI after the inbound sales department I worked for closed. I accepted a position in Austin that I'm currently not enjoying very much. I do not have the ability to pursue employment in other departments for another month (6 month department minimum). "
good,overall good job money was good & well worth it learned a new skill in a new field which was door-to-door sales
good,location where kiosk rep sell are drying up. new location for expanding required.
good,"Great sales training"
good,"A typical day at work is visiting my stores that are assigned to me and coaching, teaching, and training employees to sell my products. I also have to sell to customers on a daily basis."
good,I was responsible for all tech ops west of the Mississippi (half the company). Greatest challenge was finding personnel to fill numerous key positions across the 6 regions. Managed multiple upgrades and interconnects to integrate operations together from all of the acquisitions.
good,Interesting and dynamic industry with smart people to work with.
good,"The thing I love the most about this job is the fact that they have a great benefit package, yet sometimes low pay. The hardest part of the job is the strict policy for sickness, and occurances. Also, with the tenure of some employees and the politics in the work place it also doesn't allow much advanecment. I love my job with the company and wouldn't change it, but would like to change some aspects of the environment."
good,"Typical day at Time Warner was taken calls, customer upgrading services or needed their services moved to new loctaion. Customer calling asking how they can save on their bills."
good,Did alot of data entry work
good,"Every day you come in and assist customers over the phone with Phone, Internet & TV service's."
good,Good pay good benefits got along with co workers. Worked in different areas everyday.
good,"Everyday was an adventure, trouble shooting is never the same, you think you have it licked and it's something different, that's what so fun about going to work everyday. Got to meet new people everyday and leave them with smiles when I fixed their problems. That was the great part of my job leaving a smile on the customers face. Coworkers, we were all like family"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I come in happy to work and ready to tackle what the day has to offer. My co-workers and I help each other out with work load and issues. I am an efficient and productive employee; unfortunately my new position is not conducive for that. Lack of resources and inefficient practices are making me look for opportunities that are a better fit with my ethics and work practices.
good,"Handled escalated phone calls,worked directly with my supervisor, trained existing payment services reps on newly implemented procedures."
good,great employee benefits. has excellent opportunity for advancement
good,A typical day at work for me is assisting customers with cable and internet problems.
good,"Time Warner Cable is a good company to work for, you just have to find which department you feel most comfortable and confident working in. Every department isn't for everybody."
good,"Calls are back to back, you're constantly verbally abused by angry customers. Metrics are too strict and the only way to get a raise or promotion. When you are trying to advance, they act like they want to help and are on board, but then nothing happens. Agent thresholds need to be met before other positions open up, but people are dropping like flies due to the changes. Great benefits though."
good,"Physically intensive, hours MUCH longer than expected or should ever be asked of someone in this role. Benefits could definitely be better, but I've seen worse. The company itself isn't bad to work for, but the way the local branch is overseeing its technicians leaves much to be desired. Definitely not making enough money to have any reason to stay here."
good,"Flexible schedules, free cable and internet, great benefits and cool people to work with. Learn the tools and you'll progress. Great people and they provide parties and food routinely!!!"
good,"It is a fast passed and competitive atmosphere. Very diverse environment, and is always demanding that you are on your A game. It is a revenue driven company and it has great compensational benefits like commission on top of the salary pay."
good,Spectrum is a great place to get your CSR career started if that's what you want to do. They allow the customers to disrespect you and then you will get in trouble.
good,"great pay and benefits, but stressful to listen to people yell and scream about cable. full time only, hardest part is to tell them that they aren't getting what they think they deserve. call after call"
good,"They have great benefits, but i need a job that offers a pension.  Im searching for a job that will acknoledge my military time.  Ive built up my 401k but would like to recieve a gov pension for the added security."
good,"typical sales environment"
good,"Spectrum is a good company to work for, it is just a very stressful job, it is hard not to take the mental part of it home with you. some customers are great and some say some very nasty things"
good,"Spectrum wasn't a terrible place to work. There are difficult customers to deal with, which is unfortunate, but that's why they pay so well. They micromanage you in a way that is extremely overbearing. Overall, though, very supportive atmosphere and the leads are great."
good,Management needs to be better. Workplace is fine. People get along well except for few. There is a biased culture on treating FTE and consulting. The best part is in the morning while getting on to work there is music and fountains which brings up the mood.
good,"The over job is great, but when it comes to learning new material or trying to transition; the training should be worked on. we tried speaking with someone because we were not getting anywhere at one point and we relied on each other instead of the trainers in the room. Communicating with our supervisors and leads was a little difficult at times, but that is any job really. But besides that money is great, and is a good transition job, or someone trying to get back on there feet. I wish i could have stayed, but the hours i was working, i couldn't do my internship with school and continue with work as well. They are strict on hours, but they tell you that from the very beginning."
good,"Spectrum is fast paced.  Being a telecommunication company, there are always things changing/updating.  Spectrum has great perks with free cable/HSD/phone service and good benefits."
good,"It's a great place to work if you don't have any other outside concerns, ie family, health, etc. if you are sick and have to be out even if your doctor writes you out your job may be in jeopardy and then the job becomes more stressful than enjoyable. You are personally accosted on a regular basis and are not even allowed to transfer the call. When that call is reviewed, even when you were completely professional and empathetic with the customer, you are written up for not deescalating a customer who was upset when you got them and was not satisfied with anything you offer."
good,"good place to work some management can be better, good for team building provides company vehicle and offers free cable and great benefits. Can be a great place to work"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Work  half day Saturday. Check in calls and check out calls 2x a day. Weekly meetings. Monthly training. Metric sales based. Quota. If u did not get install, no commission"
good,Loved this company but the hours were killing me especially being a mom I could do the night shift although they did pay you extra but would loved better hours managers were a little hard but because they wanted us to do good in the team
good,Charter Communications is a good place to work. It offered flexible hours and free cable to it associates. It worked well with my schedule. I enjoyed working there.
good,"Productive steady work flow, Ive learned a lot working for the company fast pace environment great benefits as typical day of work is busy laid back work environment"
good,Stressful at times with a overwhelming amount of customers from time to time. computer systems is the most difficult part of job. They need to update their systems. Commission is okay but could be a lot better. Over all its a stable job.
good,"High paced call center work place. They offered a lot of overtime. A few free lunches, but the pay was not as I expected nor the pay increases. Never any down time"
good,"Decent working environment, good pay, good opportunities. Must be thick skinned and able to multi task as you will have multiple systems to handle at once."
good,"trouble shoot problems with phone,cabel,internet,install,phone,cable,and internet .make sure customers problems are all solved before leaving job site"
good,"The people I work with are like a big family.  We all look out for each other."
good,"Worked here for 20 years just like every company it has it's ups an downs but I enjoyed my job and the people here and I'm really going to miss it here. But I am looking forward to the new challenges I have in front of me and I'm ready to learn new things and meet new people.A typical work day is pulling orders for The technicians, receiving shipment, inventory and general duties the hardest part of the job was preforming my daily duties with minimal people the fun part was getting to meet and know different people.The culture was very diverse. I learned that teamwork is very important and to try new things that can help me along this journey"
good,"Work was stressful at times, but the positive family culture made it bearable. Technology advanced so quickly at times, it was hard to keep up. The benefits were excellent. Constant training kept us up to date."
good,"unexpected meetings. Must be out almost  all day after being in the unpaid meetings. and must be  willing to work saturdays. If you have nothing really to do, work here, they take your personal life away from you."
good,"Coworkers and management is quite helpful sometimes. Certain times when calling into the help line, I had an issue with certain managers being condescending and rude which is unfortunate. Some aspects are very flawed with the company such as credit to customer when Charter has been in the wrong. Increased pricing that doesn't help customers. Autopay issues that effect customers with added fees and being told you will be in trouble for issuing credit when it is guideline proven that they deserve that much for the error."
good,There are a lot of layoffs still continuing due to acquisition of Bright House Networks. Seems Spectrum is still feeling their way and making cuts. The acquisition was twenty months ago!
good,"This was the first job that i loved going to work and interacting with the people but hated the actual job itself ... When the job was time warner everything was better ( pay , customers and job site) after spectrum took over everything went downhill .. the services were worst , the customers became more biter . and the commission for us went away . SOME people were giving raises... others had to just deal"
good,calls are all ways there to keep us busy. several supervisors are really there for the team. it is a work environment with business casual attire even over night.
good,"spectrum offers excellent growth opportunities, and nearly unrivaled benefits. their system falters when it comes to surveys. a customer can cost you your job by giving a poor survey, when it actually Plectrum that they think their rating, and its supposed to be your performance they rate. They could use some revision on their training procedures as they to can malfunction and penalize you inadvertently, as their surveys do. The management is overall, very approachable, but while you may b acknowledged, that's where the resolutions end.  Overall I would recommend them job wise, because they are very good to their employees, but I would advise you be aware your job is never secure due to a customers dissatisfaction of their services (regardless of your personal performance), and structural quirks that really should be addressed at some point."
good,Job was decent it was pretty stressful once charter took over. The work life balance was okay but I must say the pay went down once charter took over. Just everything went completely wrong
good,"It's a good place to work if you like fast paced environments. It is a fast paced, multi-tasked job. You also have to be confident in the company, because you do have to constantly deal with people complaining about it. It just wasn't the right fit for me, everything they offer in the package is great, but the job to me at least, wasn't worth the benefits they offered."
good,Company has changed a lot since the merger. Changes in leadership has negatively affected employee morale. Overall benefits & compensation are good. Internal reorganization is still in progress and many integration projects still taking affect.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Things were much different when it was Time Warner Cable - I feel the values of the company are not the same, unfortunately.  Change is good, but not in this case."
good,"I absolutely loved all of my managers and was on a few different teams at different time throughout the day, the shifts are set once you get one, if you don't get one you like there are ways of switching with people or entering a pool to get it changed. There is always something fun going on and everyone is a team. The customers and call you took weren't the best its a billing call center so usually angry people that can't afford or don't want to pay their statements call in. Metrics are pretty strict and do change and it does make it harder each year to get a raise and the raises aren't usually the best. But the people and environment are awesome."
good,The bonus structure is great. Sometimes the mandatory over time is hectic and unfair. The hours arent all that great but there are shift bids every 6 months
good,"TWC provides food for employees often, has many cool lounge areas, managers normally help you when you need it, and it's a great place to work, advance, and make money."
good,"Great pay and direct management is very supportive. However the transition of Time Warner Cable into Spectrum has become frustrating. There are weekly changes that cause a lot of miscommunication, which in turn affects our compensation and work hours. Difficult to obtain efficient answers from upper management. The moral in the center is rapidly depleting."
good,My experience was ok. My co-workers were awesome but when you're clocked in you work and punctuality is a huge thing for Spectrum so stay on your P's and Q's. Training is fast paced but the trainers are great at what they do. The pay and benefits are great.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was were the willingness of the people to help one another"
good,"Answering technical phone calls to resolve connectivity issues has given me the experience to deal with any person at any level of difficulty. Company has lots of diversity which makes the work place interesting to work for. Irate clients are definitely a challenge, but people you work with are the best way to spend time in order to accomplish the job that everyone else is dealing with all the time."
good,"the opportunity is there to make money$$$. However, the call center is extremely loud, and supervisors ring bells like crazy. Annoying desk bells or order up at the pizzeria bells at once. If you suffer from headaches or ADD, I'd stay away. The loud noise would give me anxiety attacks and migraines. I was told differently when I was hired. Plus the calls are monitored and you have quality listening in, so it makes it very stressful, with the extra excess noise."
good,"overall a great place to work, job can be really challenging at times, when I worked there the position was hourly plus commission but now I believe commission has been cut. This job is very diverse and also has great incentives."
good,Spectrum has great benefits and compensation. Spectrum has diverse culture and cares about it's employees. A day at work is attending the customers with superior customer service. Also working as a team and achieving a common goal.
good,If you embrass change this is the place to work there is never a boring day in dispatch. There are always new processes and procedure to learn to advance your skills and to better serve the company.
good,"Thought the calls are usually stressed and angry subscribers, the pay, insurance benefits and bonus incentives were mostly worth the trouble. Advancement is largely based on your relationship with immediate management."
good,I enjoyed my time at twc and would recommend anyone that is for a job to go there. Also you get free internet and tv for working a twc what a great benefit.
good,"must pay attention to detail very well to be successful, know how to talk to people of all types. multitasking is what our doing 24/7 a day. I love how they take care of their employees. Very high turn-over rate if your not good at selling things to people you wouldn't succeed. u have a month training 2 weeks in the classroom with weekly test if you don't not pass you will be let go 2 week on the floor training where they basically listen in to your calls without you knowing to make sure your doing your job if not your let go also if you numbers aren't good basically if you are not selling enough for them you will be let go."
good,TWC is a wonderful yet stressful place to work. Troubleshooting customer's concerns is not a hard task but not being able to resolve an issue due to lack of customer education and fear of trying and therefore customer's lack of cooperation can be cumbersome.
good,Employement and pay is performance driven. Bonuses and commissions at time could be lost due to poor performance thus creating a high churn rate.  But the benefits package is great.
good,"wake up get dress for work get in vehicle and head to first job."
good,High volume call center tech support environment. Continual (mostly) self motivated learning on new product that may be encountered in customer homes that they purchased 3rd party. Most enjoyable part being successfully solving both simpler and more complex customer concerns.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Learned alot, diverse environment, hardest part of the job was being routed many technical support calls from customers already having all of our services then being held accountable for not selling anything"
good,Since 2000 this company has been in a constant state of flux first regionalizing then centralizing then moving to Charter.  Once this settles down should be a better situation.
good,Door-to-door sales of television and internet advertising space.  Daily overview of appointments and cold calls to include all follow-up and planning of next few days.  Obtained weekly and quarterly goals.  Was highest biller three years in a row (1.5 million a year).  Addressed issues if any were reported.  Maintained follow-up with all existing customers to reassure complete satisfaction of my work performance.
good,"fun. inventory control. I have never meet the CEO of my company. Although I see my Manager on a regular and we talk about the DO's and DON'Ts around here. I get a far yearly raise. I have some fabulous co workers. I enjoy my hour lunch period, I always take a nap."
good,"Interesting job, meeting new people and learning different sales techniques to help me reach my selling goals.  you work on your own going door to door to try and sell to new customers. Some days are easier than others."
good,was fun place to work when i first started. Towards the end they focused on sales of useless products to customer. This was a long time ago.
good,I have learned that sincere communication whether it be with a customer or co-worker stimulates every aspect of your business for the positive and exploits where improvements can be made.
good,enjoying going out everyday meeting and servicing customers homes. I take great pride in answering all customers questions and handling there technical issues.
good,The hardest part of this job were the hours I was working a 3-12 shift which was hard I have 3 children and my mom would have to keep them until I got off work which was hard for her because she works as well. The environment at time warner was very comfortable and family orientated we all got along well and the teams were strong. I learned a lot daily about the services and equipment. The managers were friendly and very helpful and always had a open door policy. The most enjoyable part where when we got to hear customer feed back surveys and when the customers would compliment the service you gave it made me feel appreciated.
good,All time is spent on the phone up-selling all products to customers. Best part of the job was the bonuses. Worst part was during training I was told to lie to the customers in order to increase production sell.
good,"I have never met a harder working group of people, TWC treated us to barbeques and summer sail trips on the back for a job well done."
good,"I enjoyed working at charter, they pay was good and they have great benefits, but the do treat their customers better then employees, employees get verbally abused on a daily but is simply told to suck it and to continue to keep your same happy greeting throughout the day. charter is not understandable when it comes to having sick kids they expect you to be there every day and missing work for any reason is unacceptable. Again working for charter was great and i would always work there again they need to make some improvement on how they treat their employees!"
good,TWC is a great company to work for there is alot of money to be made inside the company with sales and the CSAT(Customer Satisfaction surveys)
good,"Speaking with customers about billing disputes, technical and equipment issues. Fast paced call volume, working as a team to assist customers to resolved their needs."
good,"Day starts with viewing my emails and updates to Channel line ups, info about changes in services or fees. I then make myself avail on the phone lines where I take from 15 to 35 calls a day, regarding billing, service issues or equip outages. Primarily Customers that are unhappy with Cost, issues or just want to try another Company. My goal and  job is to help Our customers overcome these issues so that they are Happy again . I enjoy my peers and management they are very encouraging and fun to be around. Job can be challenging at times because of high call volume, and upset customers however the Job Environment is pleasant and the Management team always find ways to make the job exciting. Weather its free lunch, contest, prizes, movie days, snacks through out the day."
good,The benefits were great however the environment was not an industry that I would recommend for everyone.  The staff was great at some locations although at some locations too much emphasis on sales goals took an overwhelming precedence that it becomes hard for honest employees to survive.
good,"Long hours, independent, coworkers willing to help."
good,A typical day at work it varies. The topic in the meetings are too repetitive. Some supervisors can not manage. Example: He will give you encouragement and a minute later he will tear it away from you. My co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of the job is trying to get a sale when a customer doesn't have the funds. The supervisor wants you to manipulate the customer's mind and try to sell them something that they really don't need or can afford. The most enjoyable part of the job is: I love learning new things. I enjoy meeting new people and putting smiles on their faces. I love working with electronics and technology.
good,"very hectic, heavy phones with irate customers. not enough time to work out problems."
good,"Designing cable plant and preparing capital project plans for new and"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Learned much about the RF spectrum, coaxial and fiber optic transmission.  Great group of people but a bit short on compensation."
good,My roles at Time Warner Cable are to take care of our customers needs and wants. Everyday when I go into work I am required to answer the phone when a customer calls in with a question or concern. This job has taught me how to be a great customer service representative. Taking care of the customer is the most important part of the job. I work with a team of individuals that are great. We all work together to help one another if we have any questions. The hardest part of my job at Time Warner would have to understand that the customers aren't mad at me and that they are mad at the company or the services. I would say that the mos enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people when they call in. If a customer calls in and is upset its my goal to turn their attitude around by the end of the call and have them leaving happy they called and spoke with me.
good,Good place to work depending on your position. Very relaxed environment
good,"Charter is fast paced with the only thing guaranteed, is change,  There are many opportunities for advancement and growth within the company."
good,"The benefits are great, the hours are not so great. Its a 24, 365 day operational facility. Working every weekend, and holiday is not a good thing. The overall job, is average, a lot to learn/know.  "
good,Always engaged to lead in the strategic product area.   The role teaches someone to build business plans at a national level and develop flexible product strategies in the competitive marketplace.  The team was composed of team players who individually carry their load.
good,"taking inbound calls for bill payments , answering billing questions, adding services, removing services and getting bill lower and equipment ans service educating to customers."
good,"A typical day at work was working with disabled children and helping them enhance on there learning, life skills, and overall there everyday living. "
good,"A typical day as an instructor would be to initially prepare for the session to be given, treat all employees equally no matter their position in the company."
good,Job was ok. I enjoy my time there. I really would not like to say much about it it had time goods and bad. I had to resign because they would not work with me to do my inernship for school.
good,"Great out of college opportunity. Management was friendly, accomodating. Enjoyed my experience."
good,Call current outbound customers and offer them special promotions within our company
good,I made reasonable amount of money each week. The thing I did not enjoy about working here was that when it rained we had to miss work.
good,"time warner cable is a good company to work at when you first start. It can be a considered stable., but interacting with customer via phone is horrible. The thing customers say to you can rip you to pieces. the company protects there customers more than there employees., also to move up within the company its not what you know, but who you know. They move people up within the company based on there physical appearanace. Alot of differetn personalities within management, and corporate and you have to know how to remain nutural. I would not say dont work for time warner cable, but pick another position other than the call centrer phone position to earn money."
good,The money was good but job is stressful. You have to be prepared to handle getting cursed at by customers because it is retention. But overall I love the free cable
good,The racist and sexual comments from customers were not worth the 45 minute drive and $15 a hour. I can deal with a lot of hatred but it’s a constant daily thing there
good,"The company really tries to create a wonderful culture. They have events with food and games a few times a year. The pay is outstanding. The benefits are very good, especially if you live in a Charter network/territory. However, all of these wonderful things come at a cost. You may have to compromise your integrity. You will work tirelessly to take enough calls to make more money. The management will do whatever they can to push you and develop you. However, again, it all comes at a cost. Is it work it to hear negative things said to you 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week."
good,"You have a lot of opportunity for advancement here. They are growing by leaps and bounds. So if you are into working in the customer service field and have thick skin, you will do well here; however, if they don't get their sales depts. across the nation in order- stop them from lying to customers and doing things underhandedly just to make a sale, they aren't worth working for because the agents are nothing but punching bags dealing with the aftermath of their absurdity! Also, with all the csr agents must learn, they deserve way more money, at least $2 more an hour to start."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"You will wake up look at your work phone to see your route. Head to your first job and upon arrival speak with the customer about what the issue is. Then you began on determining what may have cause the issue. You may need to replace a few line inside the home, outside them home and/or the line coming from the pole to the home. You will have to work outside in all kinds of weather."
good,It is a good job overall. Second shift hours. You are well taken care of on the job and with benefits. The staff is great as well. You have to have the drive to sell. Your success rides on whether or not you take the tools they give you and apply them.
good,Fast paced work environment and good company. management is just poor. Positive attitudes and good benefits. Great discounts. Good security. Great employees who are helpful with any questions.
good,it was a great comany to work for. great staff and commision plans for all goals. i enjoyed the time i worked for the company. loved the hours and sales team.
good,I was very difficult working the last 2 years at Time Warner Cable (TWC) since we all new that the company was up for sale.  When the deal was finalized with Charter; they starred laying off TWC employees.  This was a real blow to everyone.
good,"If you are able to work with others, this place is great because while doing anything you will be working with other team members within your own team and that of different teams as well. You will have plenty of roadblocks so make sure yo always keep a respectable face with each and every person since you never know if you'll need there assistance or not."
good,"It was a job, lack of communication, no consistency, equipment goes down a lot, makes it hard for you to perform your job.  Changes job descriptions on you"
good,"I've liked my job at Spectrum so far, it's just not really what i'm looking to get into right now. As someone who's trying to get into IT it's not a bad gig to start off with but do note that this is VERY basic tech support that even if you've never troubleshooted a network before you'd be able to do it. Overall the job is pretty nice, pays well, management is solid it's just not what I want to do for a career"
good,"You go through two months of paid training when you're hired. Mentors and supervisors are super helpful and will always get you out of a jam. Some days are busier than others, but for the most part the workload is pretty reasonable."
good,"I worked at Charter Spectrum for a few (4) months while I was taking a break from school.  I was living at home, so I was able to save up a good deal of money with what is now the starting wage $13 an hour working full-time.  I really enjoyed the people that I worked with, especially my trainers and managers.  I worked in the billing department of customer service and I have to admit it was tough coming in every day.  It definitely is not the job for everyone."
good,"calls were under 15 minutes and required goal was to retain customers to best of abilities. acquire maximum customer base, and sustaining customer service to best of abilities."
good,Great place to work youll walk in log into your computer pull up all your systems. Handling customer calls all day 2 breaks 1 lunch unless special schedule. Regular call center.
good,"good Work place culture, Managers are good to work with, Compensation is Amazing. Free Cable, thats enough to get you in the door. They really go out of there way to make it work"
good,"good job and benefits pay is ok, only thing is the schedules are bad if you have to work the 10 a.m.-9 p.m. shift and off days are Sunday Monday and Tuesdays or Thursday, Friday, Saturday."
good,"Depends on the work site, but its a pretty nice place to work and the pay is AWESOME."
good,"Kind of like the wild west, big push from product to get things done and contractors sling code like they could care less about future maintenance. If you just want a job and make good money then this is the place but if you care about the quality of your work as well as others then look elsewhere. General design patterns are not used here because shortcuts are faster to code."
good,"Charter is a large company with large company scheduling, the intentional support of the staff is highly appreciative. In the position of customer relations coordinator the primary duty is tech support for internet and phone service."
good,Get as much done as you can as quick as you can. Constantly over scheduled and not given the time to complete jobs. I want to do a good job but always have to take shortcuts.
good,"While working at Time Warner Cable I learned how to deal with customers in a different manner then I've usually done. I was given the callers that were close to leaving our company so I had to do my best to make the customers satisfied, as they were when they first came to our company. A typical day at work was very upbeat but towards the end of the night, workers became groggy. I believe the hardest part of the job was when I did everything I could possibly do to help the customer change their mind, but they still decide to leave. The most enjoyable part of working with Time Warner was we all got along for the most part (The Workers), and we always seemed to help each other in any way possible."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Had a very good work environment and was able to learn the trade and have a good time doing it. The people within the company are freindly and willing to assist anyone the best that they can.
good,"Great place to work but very stressful. Highly sales driven. Great opportunities, and team oriented. Typical day involves answering calls regarding lowering bills or canceling services."
good,"Every day interacting with different people, troubleshooting and educating customers with our products is my passion"
good,"This job was educational given that I had no prior experience with working with a cable company and working with the tools and resources they had to offer. Other than that it wasn't really my sort of thing. I couldn't really take much interest in it other than learning new things. Great co-workers, great management overall just not the job for me."
good,"No Complaints, I enjoyed working there, they have a good benefits, fair carrier progression, good pay.  I would still be there if I didn't get hurt."
good,"Door to Door Sales "
good,A typical word day was calling about 80 people and attempting to collect unpaid balances on bills. We recieved commision for collecting.
good,"I was working in an inbound call center. It was stressful because the goals we had to reach were very competitive. During the sales position I was required to sale all three services on each account, phone, internet, and cable, even if they didn't want it. During the retention position, we were required to keep customers from disconnecting without giving to much of a discount, or else it would hurt your commission. It was stressful but we had the potential to make a lot of money."
good,"This is a nice place to work, great people great environment but the pay could be more competitive and it is not.  The free cable does not matter if you're not in the footprint."
good,I loved the moral of serving my country an the people you meet from all over the world. I was able to see so much an learn so much from so many people the constant being physically in shape I loved the dedication an respect you get an give was a great experience an the way it shapes you for always being 15 mins early to any appointment you have after you are out of the service still.
good,"Very little pay, but great support from management and incredible job security."
good,"Triple Play was very competitive in the market.  A typical day included neighborhoods in Queens and Staten Island.  In most cases direct sales depended on knocking on doors, greeting potential cable users, and trying to educate and close the sales in cable industry."
good,Installed cable for houses and businesses. worked outages and on-call.Worked well with co-workers and management.
good,"assist sales, retention and billing agents with the tools needed to assist customers as well as maintaining sales goals. take all escalated supervisory calls."
good,install cable tv digital phone and high speed internet in customers homes
good,self start  go to first job  company pays for everything needed for the job van and gas phone boots uniform hardest part is company politics give give  lots of gray lines
good,"Professional environment, courteous behavior.  Multiple projects as company is adding more lines of business.  "
good,working here in billing is not the best job but working with people who are ready to help when ever you have questions or concerns really makes the job easier. nobody wants to pay bills so when you work in billing be ready for a lot of angry phone calls. its not easy but you just have to remember not to take things personal. the pay is good for the job you do.
good,"While there is some enhancements that can be made, the overall atmosphere is pleasant, clean, respectable and is viewed as a very decent place to work at."
good,I have a very supportive manager and the team I work with are all great.  There has been a lot of turnover because of the merger and people feel insecure about their jobs.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"During my 1.5 years with Spectrum (formerly TWC) the company was in the midst of changing hands, so policies and procedures were constantly changing (almost daily) and it was very confusing even to supervisors.  In the beginning I liked the job a lot as call volume was lower and I got a good grasp on the variety of systems you use on each call. This job is not for the faint of heart as typically when a customer calls in, they are upset about something and it is your job to handle it before they escalate to a supervisor.  I really liked the company itself and feel they were wonderful in taking care of their employees as far as pay and benefits.  Within my first year there I received a few pay raises and had excellent pricing on healthcare.  It was the nature and stress of the job that makes it unpleasant. I loved my teammates and the in-between-calls fun we got to have at our desks."
good,Stressful work environment. But other than customers yelling at you because of all of the unnecessary changes that’s taking place to the change in company (which isn’t all the good or honest) it is a really good work environment and there’s always room for advancements.
good,"Start at 8:00am very previous days paperwork, monies and technicians.  verify all cash transaction. conclude report from the following day. Balance all account .  Take call from customer and other agents."
good,This company is a great place to work. I enjoy my co-workers and the management is awesome. They have great benefits and the work is easy. They restructured after they bought Time Warner and Brighthouse and they way they do raises changed. I was expecting to get a nice bump after new hire and troubleshooting school but it was only 5%. Hard to make it on 12 an hour with a mortgage and family.  This is a great place to get your foot in the door in the cable industry. The even pay for your school.  The pay is the down fall
good,"Great place to work, but calls are very difficult and very overwhelming. Customer's can be harsh and hurtful.  Supervisors and management are amazing and very helpful!"
good,"I enjoyed helping customers, and was given a lot of room to do so. The hours were good, the pay was better. It was a wonderful job to have as a summer job in such a beautiful city!!"
good,"Working at the call center gives you great benefits and pay, but the job duties are awful. The customers that call in are relentless and it does get stressful after awhile. Granted the training process is quite extensive so you will be prepared. Pretty difficult to move up in management but it is a straightforward process."
good,"I would normally come into the shop and sign in and get my equipment ready for the day. "
good,"I liked working with the senior technicians they were always supportive Working the Head End was certainly always an adventure."
good,"Pays a lot of money. A really great company to work for. Your day consists of people calling you for information or quotes on cable, internet and phone. Only bad thing is when someone calls for a quote and wants to talk to the wife or husband and you are counted off for not sales them at that moment and who ever they call back and speak with gets the sale"
good,It's a good job with great benefits. Staff is friendly too. Hours are decent depending on your needs. They are very good at hiring within.
good,This company has great benefits and takes care of their employees.  It is a fun and relaxed atmosphere. The managers are veery helpful and help you to succeed.
good,"Typical day...Outbound calls to customers"
good,The people that you work for truly care about your and your performance within the company. There was a open door policy with management and were always there for you.
good,"I worked as a field technician so my office views changed every job I went to.  I troubleshot customer's troubles from VOIP, High speed internet and digital cable service.  Every job was different.  I had to effectively troubleshoot signal levels from the tap at the pole to the inside of the customer's premise.  I had to repair and/or replace inside wiring from coax to cat 3 phone wiring.   "
good,"Beautiful facility to work in, fitness room on site. Hour lunches to allow for errands and work out time."
good,"Typical day: I take 20-30 calls from customers whose internet or home phone are having problems. As is to be expected, no one wants to call the cable company. Many customers are willing to perform the troubleshooting steps once I've reaffirmed their concerns and shown I'm listening to them. However, I have to deal with several rude, irate customers a day. As someone who suffers panic attacks, this is not a good work environment for me. I have gotten accommodations from HR to take time off if needed due to panic, but the fact is, this job isn't a great fit for me."
good,"Here they work together to reach a common goal... Their team oriented approach to satisfying matters which arise from day to day, inspires each employee to continue to participate."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"a normal sales cycle, with normal estress, great culture, with nice co workers, I just looking to relocate in FL"
good,"Flexible work schedules and good management.  "
good,it is a pretty good company.  Job security is pretty good there.
good,fun place to work. great people. the only thing is the change in pay scale. you never know how your money is made check to check
good,"Not a bad place to work, just don't have any other commitments. The company does not work around your schedule, essentially the shifts are done as a shift bid every six months and if your shift is poor then so be it, you cant change it."
good,the pay was ok but i found out i wasnt very good at selling cable
good,Nice workplace with minimum/no room for growth
good,"I have learned a lot here in my 14 years in customers service. On a day to day bases I would sign into the system, get prepared for the day and assist customers with their payment, equipment service and any billing issues or inquires. Enter new sales for customers. The hardest part is meeting day to day quota for sales. The most enjoyable part of working here is my co-workers and management."
good,"Customer service, create tam tickets for customers devices, installation of network	Security on desktop computer, upgrade customers devices, troubleshoot TCP/IP,For network problems, installation of wireless USB, charters cloud installation,			Active directory, high speed data and wireless access point, troubleshoot and repair"
good,This particular job just was not for me and dealt with severe health issues toward the end of my employment. I went on disability and due to not meeting quotas and all the days I was out prior to disability I was not necessarily welcome back.
good,Spectrum used to be Time Warner and now that Spectrum has taken over hours will change from 7am-7pm to 10am-10pm. For a family man those hours are too late.
good,It was my first job and it took a lot of getting used to. The customers on the phone were really intimidating so I learned a lot about professional communication.
good,"Pay is pretty low to start out, 12.50, but there is room for advancement and can be making 17$ an hour after a couple years. Management is good and the month bonuses are nice if you reach your numbers."
good,"I worked with a vast amount and diverse people, different cultures  are amazing something you don't see daily. Most of all communicating with the outside world."
good,"Everyday at TWC was a busy day whether it was on the call center floor or in class room training. I learned how to handle day to day customers. "
good,Its a fast pace environment and definitely room to move up within the company.
good,I loved working with my team of co-workers. My supervisor was very nice and forward when need be. He was able to see the places where one needed coaching and was a man of his word.
good,In the sales department you would have to hit your phone Internet and cable but they push the phone too hard on you and if you had the most phone sales that you would sell at the end of the week they do give you a prize That made it fun because it felt like a game that you’re playing but basically you were selling phone
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time with Spectrum. I was with Spectrum for me years and was able grow within the company, being promoted holding 4 different positions. It was family environment. I was looking to have a career with Spectrum. It was unfortunate that the call center closed."
good,A typical day at work always starts off slow and the pace picks up very fast.I learned a variety of skills and I enjoy meeting people.The hardest part of my job is having to disappoint a client or customer depending on their request and what is required according  to policies.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"This was an amazing job, But what I did got sent out off the country to be done. I enjoyed going to work every day and even worked overtime when could."
good,great company to work for this company has great benefits and it looks out for its employees. Time Warner cable is one  of the best companies to work for I have not worked for a company that has its employee best interest at heart.
good,"Able to joke around with coworkers with ease"
good,"Hot days , Rainy days . be prepared to work outdoors bearing the weather. The hours are great you work a schedule that's good for you. But even when its 90 + outside its unbearable."
good,"Completed a 3 week training course and knew less about the job than I did before I began. Although, the people, staff, managers, compensation, willingness to help, benefits all are 5 star."
good,"good place to work with hand tools and always doing great customer service, i learned a lot and good management also. everyday was required to drive a company vehicle in a safe manner which i always did that."
good,drove to Dayton from Sidney 3 times a week I learned how to listen to what customers wanted and needed and fit then with the best and most affordable for there needs all sales reps where very friendly the hardest part of then job is the hours and the cost of gas for the drive
good,The route was always all over the place.  Go from one side of town all the way to the other.
good,"Spectrum call center at 721 N Regional Rd was decent, but could've been a better experience. The constant changing culture and the expectations are difficult and the work is fairly monotonous. The pay is what I consider to be minimum wage of $15 per hour, but could be better and the benefits are okay from what I heard but I didn't use them."
good,very nice place of work but am a temp so i am looking for job security but the people are great and i thank them for a opportunity  and just would like a chance to be hired in
good,I never thought that I would work for such a big company. The managers and coworkers were ok for the most part. The schedule was ok most days but the hours were long or cut short.
good,"Its a great place to work, mangers are great in my department but I would have liked more time to learn more. Due to a short time there, I was not able to take in a lot of information."
good,This luxury gym just got bought by Gold's Gym... so much for the luxury.
good,"GREAT Company but an absolutely awful department.  Could be a great department if the leadership was really interested in fixing the issues:"
good,Young team with lots of energy.  Management technical skills are out dated and does not provided much support on advanced tasks.  Needs refresh courses for management.
good,Good job but could really use major improvements. The pay is great. Free services make it better. Great benefits. But over all it turns like any other call center.
good,Charter is an okay place to work. The major down fall is time off. As an employee you have no control over your time off and there are policy's unlike any other job I've had on taking days off which make it very difficult.
good,Executives have no idea what truly happens at the front-line level. They are kept up to speed by people who may or may not always be providing all accountable actions.
good,Thw work day was slow. The job duties were light. This was a temporary job that was for a digital upgrade. My co workers were friendly and showed me what I needed to know. The hardest part of the job was waiting in between customers to come up to the window.
good,When working there you have to have good customer service skills and the gift of gab.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,What I like about Charter the most is having the opportunity to help others. I enjoy the conversations I have with customers and establishing a personal relationship. The business knowledge I need to excel in my current position is everchanging and consistent. I enjoy being a personal business accountant to the customers and the desire to do my job well each and everyday.
good,fast paced and driven. must be in very good shape. most job are easy to pick up. will tear up your body over a period of time
good,I started with the company when it was time Warner then it switched to Spectrum shortly after the fired the whole call center. It just really sends that message that the company is not loyal.
good,"•	Analyze signal strength to ensure it is within range for "
good,"I loved it when it was Time Warner Cable! I didn't have much of an opportunity to work with ""Spectrum"", only during the matriculation period.  I took a major pay cut."
good,this place is full of hope and broken promises its a workplace of who you know more then what you know those who do good work will be compensated with overtime which are jobs your fellow co workers decline to do in order to leave early and get max reward with little effort or work. Union is a joke as you can see that the old timers aka good old boys are still on strike while the new blood is back to work and cross the picket line union is sub par at helping individuals. At times you ask for scraps and are given crumbs and are expected to be satified quotas are ridiculous since their infrastructure is dated and no one tries to make any improvements
good,good place to start but not to stay. start off at like 13 an hour then in abour 1 or two you making up to 21 maybe 22  hour. i just didnt like the benefits
good,"TWC NYC was a great place to work--and that's why you'd see folks w/ tenure working there. "
good,"We just input the data into the new router which the data were already program. It was fun to work, I learned how to work with others and how the router work."
good,Fantastic coworkers and supervisors. Management went from progressive and productive to draconian and panic-driven in the past year.
good,i switch from station to station with various duties i would pack and unpack i would sort and palotize and clean and repair products
good,"Customer service for call center, high speed specialist, and telephone service"
good,I need a sure income and if you don't sell cable you don't get paid. You don't get the training that is needed to succeed. You have a lot of invalid addresses and is driving around all day with no luck everyday.
good,"They keep trying to reinvent themselves with ""outside"" consultants instead of plainly asking the employees.  Internal focus groups would be best. They should also hire from within instead of hiring from the outside unless absolutely necesarry."
good,"Management only looks at you as a number.  There is such a high turnover.  Upper management keeps changing the policies to make the calls harder, but lower the talk time goal.  IT's a lot of stress"
good,They have vending machines in a pretty good sized breakroom with a Foosball table and Xbox One. It is sales driven however some of the tactics used for sales contradict each other.
good,"Really no different than any call center,  the biggest difference is just working for company directly instead of a third party.  That's why they are able to provide benefits such as insurance and comp services.  The pay is decent for cost of living,  that being said - you will earn your paycheck. High call volume (for video tech support),  work systems are web based - always lagging,  knowledge database is not current and more often than not can't locate correct info to help customers,  multiple cable box guide platforms which make trouble shooting a nightmare, web page not updated to new versions of guide (since we now service Charter and not Time Warner areas) unfamiliar with Charter systems. Training for the change to Charter was a joke.  Angry customers all day long, upset at price hikes, channel line up changes,  techs missing appointments. Major role ambiguity, with recent changes you get different info on procedures, my current supervisor is not engaged, always negative/ complaining about team stats,  but does nothing to improve the team. No consistent coaching or feedback,  no team environment. At this point I just do my on thing and can't wait to leave, comp services are great,  but after dealing with cable issues - the last thing I wanna do is watch cable. The thrill is over."
good,"Unpredictable work environment. Many shift changes, not very conducive to a family life. "
good,Nice place to work but not accustomed to atmosphere of pushing/bullying customers to keep services. I was also unaware at the time of my hire that a distant relative also worked there. She was there first so...
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"This company provides excellent training and follow on mentoring once on the job.  There are however unrealistic expectations as to tracking and jobs.  Customer based and service first.  However,  added services in the field are not reflected in the time allocated to perform work, nor does the time allocated always reflect what is expected.  This creates issues with productivity and metrics used to measure performance.  At the end of the day it is a high volume quick pace."
good,"It was a fast paced hard job for which I had multiple responsibilities of routing, scheduling equipment recovery and provided payment options for deliquent account holders. Customer service was paramount."
good,"day would start around 8..I loved working with my co worker with in my office..loved working with customers..the workplace culture of Spectrum was not pleasant. however before becoming Spectrum ,Time Warner Cable was an excellent company ."
good,"On a good day You only need to work on one section, I've learned to use the register and operate the fitting room. The management is ok, he workplace is very social, the hardest part is go backs when its very late and close to the time we NEED to leave, the most enjoyable part is leaving to go home"
good,"Call center environment.  "
good,"Very little training provided.  Basically you need to come into being an expert at the ERP system and excel otherwise you will be left to sink or swim. Management lacked in direction, you could say the same thing as someone else and management would not believe you whereas someone said it and it had merit."
good,"Maintain accurate records including time worked, daily logs, gas sheets as required; properly record all required information on data devices and/or work orders Operate communications device in accordance with company policies Operate Company vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. Clean, maintain, stock, and secure assigned vehicle and equipment, in accordance with company policies Utilize and become proficient with tasks, tools, test equipment and information that will enhance business results."
good,This position was okay. It was a lot of micro managing taking place which I don't work well with. The benefits was okay if you wanted free cable/internet.
good,"great people and benefts, learned to retain customers. loved dealing with customers and being able to earn additional money"
good,"The culture of Charter Communications is best described as corrosive.  The management views the workers as an expendable replaceable resource.  Rules, regulations and goals are changed at the corporate for some unseen benefit.  The same aspects are changed at a local level to target individuals.  Miserable place to work."
good,"Good Company to work for, decent pay, steady workflow, and friendly environment. TWC is semi-flexible with the times requested off, but overtime is always offered."
good,Good money for what you do.  Unfortunately the culture and morale within the office has drastically gone down in the last year.
good,"""Every job is a self portrait of the person doing the work. Autograph your work with excellence"" you have control of your day outcome go at your own pace which ever speed your comfortable with and always do ur best to make customer happy. and confident in the service they ordered."
good,"There has never been a job that I did not take seriously and did not put my all into. I take pride in stepping back to take a look at the work completed. Working with teams that have instilled in them the excitement and devotion to professionalism so the end game becomes effortless. "
good,"big call center"
good,A typical day at this employer can be stressful because of the lack of communication from upper management.  My Co workers were amazing though very helpful and the 9 week training was very helpful especially with the amount of information that is needed for the day to day functions of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was training.
good,I rather discuss in person. Their was a lot of pros and cons about this company. The company started to outsource and let go other the in house staff
good,Upselling is the hardest part of the job in todays economy did the best I could with the instructions that was given to me it could of been a very stressful job with the customers not being satisfied with thier services but I was working hard trying to satify the customer and their complaints I was a team player it could be fun with the incentives that were given to sell another person product the most enjoyable part was helping someone resolve there service issues
good,My first task is doing all the administration work:
good,this job is very stressful and beats you down coworkers are ok and like family but the job will take a toll pay is ok not all that great but it will feed your family
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Great company to work for, they truly try to cater to employees at all times.  However, job is hard and you are exposed to all outside elements, job needs to get done regardless. Pay is really not there, for the risk of getting seriously injured $15/hour is not enough!"
good,"They say you get paid 17.75hr but it’s 17hr and 75cents differential in dollars. Makes no sense, you get paid less because of that . No matter how many hours you put in the more taxes eat your money. The calls are crazy and back to back, your days off are what they give you and your stuck with it unless you happens to get a shift bid, which goes to the ones there the long will get first pick ."
good,"great benefits and compensation, has advancement and job security with great job culture to work for.  Lots of ways to ensure work life balance along with free cable services"
good,depending on which department you work for depends on your overall feeling of how great or not working here is sometimes they are great with making sure employees are taken care of and sometimes not so much
good,If you are a hard worker and dedicated to doing your job really well and you get luck to have management that doesn't allow you to be over worked. You can really grow here. It is a 50/50 shot.  In my 23 years my management has been good and bad.  My last position of 13 years my immediate was wonderful but upper management took advantage of us being salary employees and over worked us because they knew we cared about our work.
good,The company is going places. Manager practiced micromanagement style and was a gossip. Not a role I could thrive in. Work from home was permitted but frowned upon. Very secretive backstabbing environment.
good,"A typical day would be receiving inbound calls and making outbound calls depending on the account you are working on. Making sure you understand the product and can explain when needed is a must. I learned ALOT while working here and had 2 great supervisors who pushed me to be good at my job. I appreciate my job but there has been alot of changes and miscommunication among not just the department but the company in general. I transferred from another state due to family issues and had no access for 4 weeks in the system, then to find out our department is shutting down in 2 months. Talk about stress and a slap in the face. I enjoy my role however, it's hard to advance within the company."
good,"company overall did not provide any type of benefits, but co workers is what made the time worth while when the going go tough during those long days."
good,Spectrum was a seasonal job for the basketball season. It was a fun place to work and meet great people. If you have the flexibility in your schedule it will be great for you.
good,The job is difficult specially with sales. There's a lot of new rules and time restrictions on each call makes it difficult to connect with the customers when you only have 2 min to connect and pitch sale
good,"This is the most interesting and unique job I have had. As a sales representative, I travel approximately 70 miles daily to surrounding counties making presentations trying to close sales."
good,Its a dead end company with dead end jobs.  no advancement possible.  Communicaitons are one way top down.  no room for suggestions or change. no input accepted.
good,If you enjoy a faced paced environment and multitasking then this is the job for you. Every day has new challenges and tasks and the ability to trouble shoot and support your team.
good,"Customer sales and building quotes."
good,"Sub contracting company that deals in retentions and collections from work orders assigned from Spectrum."
good,I respond to customer's email on daily basis. I have to loo over their documents that was emailed over to do the approvals for their early termination fee.
good,Good place to work. Good benefits. Good entry level job. They give employees free services. Company truck with gas card.great place to learn a trade. Pay is decent.
good,"Great benefits and pay is good, but management is very poor to work with and lack of communication.  They try to make you worried about losing you job everyday know matter how good employee you are.  They have high turn over."
good,"Fast paced, great employees, but stressful days when systems fail or when the ppv glitches on game night. Lots of VTO when it gets slow allowing time to be freed up."
good,"No Advancement Opportunities "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I did not life working here. Lack of growth and older people in the company do nothing. The pay is horrible and the work does not match with the pay given.
good,Most of managers are busy covering their ends and not active in change for the better.  Accountability is one of the all time low. Everyone is busy passing the buck...
good,"schedules  lunches and breaks are not consistent,  pay not great with heavy work load. supervisors have no training to supervise employees. lack of training"
good,"Great place to work. good and friendly environment. having free services if great. Flexible hours, great support from team mates. lots of potential and no caps on commissions."
good,"WHen I got hired, BHN was just blooming. "
good,"Hiring top talent, responsible for building staffing models and forecast call volume and track trends for over 600 reps. Training and evaluating 30/60/90 day goals, Coaching to behaviors Vs Metrics, Development progression, Performance Management and Evaluations."
good,while working at bright house i found that the a lot of the draws presented while interviewing were not present when i came out of training. my position was not sale yet we were expected to attempt to up sell every customer even if they were just calling to pay a bill.
good,The amenities are better than most organizations that I've worked for in the past.  I find that the game room offers a soothing relaxation feeling for employees.  I like that i have a job
good,"So far my working at Time Warner Cable has been great. I had the opportunity to learn new applications, and also encountered new challenges, these and others have helped me develop my skills. Also with a good and flexible work environment, together with good team players,it made my job enjoyable."
good,"For the most part Charter is a fair company. However, HR is not about helping the employee. They work for management and it shows."
good,"Really fun workplace, a typical day involved taking customer orders and assisting irate customers.  I learned the importance of proper working when advertising."
good,Long days dealing with irate customers. Sales driven job in a low buying area. Very redundant work same thing everyday. Not all customers are bad to deal with. Great staff and support system in place.
good,"on a daily basis quality control, troubleshoot and install cable tv, internet, and  telephone. performed on call jobs assigned by the supervisor. I enjoy working with my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is the danger and nature of it but pretty much enjoyable and challenging."
good,Enjoyed working here for the most part.  Typical corporate culture environment.  Hard to balance work life if a single parent.
good,"Always work that needs to be done. If there is anything that you don't learn during training, the only people you can turn to for answers are the other techs. DO NOT ask their supervisor. He will not help in any way."
good,"Tried to create a productive sales force,but new Mgmt created alot of problems and overriding the territories in which the sales staff could work,which in turn created havok and animosity between them"
good,A typical day at work was to take evaluate outbound calls and provide skills to enhance communication.
good,The work environment became too militarily structured.   My assignment  was rewarding and challenging daily.
good,"Hard to get promotion. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Overall a place to utilize your sales skills and progress your "
good,"Assigned to residential areas maintaining a task sheet on next location to sweep.  Following protocol of 3x at each door at different times of the day with the endeavor of finding people home.  Management was never consistent.  Some were more micro-managing than others.  Always hoping for fair weather making it a pleasant experience which always adds to a more optimistic outcome for production.  Making sure dressed appropriately for weather and the elements.  Great relationship with co-workers.  Always ready to give helpful advice when solicited.  Hardest part of the job was facing the competition and overcoming objections which kept them from really listening and being receptive to the services Time Warner Cable offers.  Most enjoyable part of the job is when you find just the right opportunity at the right time and being able to offer them just what they were looking for, saving them the time and trouble of making a phone call and knowing I was able to save them money with their current provider as well as with us by saving them install fees."
good,"A day at work was taking calls all day on the phones and mostly troubleshoot with customer. Over the course of time I have learned that no matter what type of client I have on the phone my goal was their resolution. The people I sat around were pretty supportive; we always helped each other when were stuck. This job required a lot of good customer satisfaction as well as addressing them as soon as possible. Regardless of the fact, for me, customer satisfaction was my main goal on every call."
good,"Work day starts from the home and get jobs from seacore computer program. Be at first job by 8:00 AM and fix and install cable, phone, and internet products. Management was okay due to it was a self supervise job but if something needed to get done (broken company van) it couldn't get done. Some of the areas worked in major area issus nad if the proper report was put in it didn't get fixed nor could you get a supervisor to handle a customer if called was elevated unless it went to the higher ups."
good,Start at 8 am
good,"Great People could be very ""clickey"" at times real old building. Sr leadership was not great at all no vision. Real high turnover on frontline reps very ""cattle car"" type of company"
good,Ok place to work except at night. The night managers are redicouls they do not know how to be managers and are they immature. They allow bad agents to talk to the customer in such a disrespectful manner.
good,"From an employee perspective, very robust benefits package and 9-5 class work/life balance. The work environment is nice and employees are afforded nice amenities."
good,Antiquated telecom company. Processes over people (both customers and employees). Conversion rate from contract to hire is very slow. Would not advise if you are a person that likes to think outside the box.
good,"Metrics are extremely important.  I learned how to work in a fast paced environment.  Management will work with you to assist in reaching, maintaining, exceeding your metrics.  Inbound support centers are stressful, Spectrum is no exception."
good,"High volume call center dealing with Irate customers, do not expect to be here long. If you can get a job in field its a little better, but not by much."
good,you get to talk with your friend when you have down time. You get free services being an employee. You get to socialize with your friends if you have down time.
good,Spectrum is like most companies a place to work. The company did do a layoff. The job security is up to you. The job is stressful and must be able to work under pressure.
good,"No comment at this time, haven't received any assignments in over three months. Good pay, not enough assignment to give a current assessment ........................"
good,"commission based"
good,"Nice workplace friendly people but not so great management,.enjoyed pay fast pace but a lot of run around with customers and managment . When it comes to scheduling it's a mess of your not persistent but overall enjoyed working there and definitely reccomend."
good,"Great place to come and make some money, but they've eliminated a lot of the ""advancement"" positions that get you out of the initial, customer-facing positions.  Great benefits."
good,"A typical day at spectrum you basically try to get there about 15 minutes early. This way you have time you start your computer, check emails, talk amongst co-workers in the morning meeting and also get the necessities you’re going to need throughout the day. Some of the things I be learned why working for spectrum was patience and time management. As far as management my person manager was awesome. Spectrum is pretty diverse fast paced and competitive. The hardest things about is the fast pace. My most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity of the company. You meet people from all different walks of life and realize we’re all the same."
good,"Has wonderful benefits; however, is a high stress environment.  Stay in que most of the time, no down time at all.  Managers are overwhelmed with the stress of customers and employees.  Always had to have meeting after missing work, no matter if  you were in the hospital or not.  They don't care about sickness, they just need people there to answer phones."
good,"A more chaotic work environment I've never seen, though that just means there are plenty of things to improve upon.  The common narrative is that it was the little fish (Charter) that ate the big fish (Time Warner Cable) and the TWC people hate them, and presumably themselves now, for it. To say the merger was difficult, is quite the understatement, but that's common with mergers and acquisitions.  Pay and compensation is generous and talent is valued. Patience, grasshopper..."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Well, I don't have much to say about working for Spectrum Cable; it is a job that pays the bills.  The job I have seems that when there is a increase it always my problem and the customers don't see it through the eyes of the company."
good,Within the six years working there I have learned a vast amount about not only the business but the different leadership and management styles utilized to drive performance within a call center environment. Spectrum provides a lucrative compensation plan to drive the business.
good,"Great pay and benefits, but lack of culture and leadership. The can have a little more leadership training. Supervisor need more product and service knowledge."
good,"high paced"
good,The company is numbers driven and expectations are high. You have to believe in the product to be successful at any career in sales. if your unable to convince yourself then it may not be the place for you.
good,The best part about my time there were the people I met there and the lasting relationships even after leaving the company. The free cable and internet was a GREAT bonus !!!
good,"Working for Charter can be stressful because they require you to move quickly between customers, yet often do not realize the time it takes to respond to customers individual needs."
good,"It's a company that used to care about their employees, and I imagine at some of the locations that might still be accurate.  It is not, however; at my location."
good,The company is great and as a field tech you don't know what your day holds. Family does take a hit and management starts on one path regarding their opinion of you and will do what it takes to get the outcome they desire.
good,"Working as a door-to-door salesman has it's benefits, however also much difficulty.  You must be motivated, and great at managing your time.  Pay is completely based on commission."
good,"It was very stressful and extremly quick-paced.  But it was a great learning experience all around.  They worked with everyone's schedule as best as they could and I helped in many areas of the facility, not just what was in my job description."
good,Charter was a wonderful place to work until the merger of Time Warner Cable and Brighthouse Networks.  Management changed after the merger and the new management did not have the vested knowledge needed to develop a first class Corporate Security Department.
good,"The Executive team driving for results in my local market was wonderful to work with/for.  The middle management team lacked innovation and personal accountability.  I witnessed too many employees leaving due to poor middle management, shifting priorities, and unappreciated effort."
good,"There is no typical work day. So every day is quite different. "
good,Job culture is ok.  Hours are not favorable for workers on some days. No job security exists in my work capacity. Benefits are excellent but sales job function is too aggressive in my opinion.
good,Overall its a great place to start working. Networking. You meet new people ever day from different cultures and also businesses you can probably learn from
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,All they care about is productivity and numbers.  They force you to try to up-sell their expensive products to people who are mostly low income (depending on location).  There is a high turnover rate.  They still owe me commission also.
good,Just depends on time of the year but it can be fast or slow. no matter what though the management cares more about the numbers and what it looks like on paper rather than what a technicians abilities actually are.
good,"Job is very back and forth, jobs changing constantly. get ready for overtime with no notice. plus side is that it does pay well and you get free charter service."
good,"good place to start in the Media industry "
good,"Upon assignment of daily job sites, traveled to sites to provided building and consumer assistants to cable services and computer support to allow seamless integration with internet. Hardest part of jobs was the misunderstanding with management with the finer details of the work required with each differing site."
good,"This was my first job and I got this job though a class I took in school , Career Based Interventions. this job was very good for me because I could do this during school hours. the pay was alright considering I was only about 15 when I worked here. my mentor was very nice and very passionate about this job. I also found it very fun because I got to record school events and edit them. we placed them on channel 15 for all the parents and Springfield residents to watch. the hardest part would have probably been the editing or even the recording because you had to stand out in the weather for most of the events,"
good,"As long as you have great management, you will be fine. If the management only cares about themselves, your time at TWC will be short.The compensation is excellent, along with the benefits. Most of the people you work with are nice and caring."
good,"Time Warner Cable is a good company. The pay is low but they have very good benefits with many free services and discounts provided to employees. Unfortunately, the company merged with another which will take over the company with another name, so the TWC of old will soon be gone."
good,When I worked at TIme Warner the pay was  not good.  I had to advance to 3 different positions to get a decent pay.  They also like to Micro manage.
good,"Time Warner Cable was a great experience and introduced me to many new advances in technology. I learned everything about HSD, Video, Wireless routing, TCP/IP configurations and much more directly through my work at TWC."
good,"Stable company with great benefits"
good,I loved it but the chance to advance is slim to none and they dont really make you feel like they care. Will fire you in a second for literally ANYTHING.
good,"This job was wonderful as far as working with the clientele.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time here.  The problem was that the supervisor ""micromanaged"" the entire office - not allowing anyone to do their jobs.  Unfortunately, turnover in this office under that supervisor was tremendous - the staff completely turned over (by their choice) twice within one year.  She has since been replaced.  I would be interested in returning to this office with the new management."
good,"I loved my co-workers. They were very helpful to each other & to new employees. Management however, didn't seem to understand everything that was involved in doing our jobs; we were not given enough credit for what we did or had to do."
good,"working for this company was fun. met allot of good people on my route and was very happy. What i didn't like was that i was charged out of my check for everything that was or wasn't my fault. that no explanation was given to me or documentation detailing what was wrong. It seemed that no matter what precautions i took to insure a perfectly executed job, pictures or snapshots of reading once connection was made that i would find out once i got my paycheck that i was charged for a fail."
good,"Working for Time Warner Cable had been and adventure, I have really enjoyed working for such a commission based company. I do believe on some levels they really do care for their employees as well as their customers. It is a great company to work for however Sales is not for everyone you have to be ready for it as well as being hungry for it, it truly is a dog eat dog world in the Sales field."
good,"While working with this company it was stressfull, i didnt learn much except that the work place was very unprofessional. The management was just as unprofessional as the co workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management and the co works, the customers were the easy part. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay check."
good,"Office setting, 8 hour shift, 1 hour lunch, discount on cable/internet services"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Due to the merger with Comcast, you don't know where you will be in the next couple of months"
good,"My job would start out with getting our orders for the day and loading our vehicles with the proper equipment that we would need to complete the jobs for that day.  While working through out the day I learn how manage and discipline myself to be focus on the task at hand because there wasn't a manager standing over us making sure that we where but instead they trusted that we would do the right thing even when no one was around."
good,"8:30a.m.-5:30p.m."
good,"I did enjoy the job and the customers, however I was uncomfortable with the employer spending more time focusing on how long I was on the phone, instead of my overall quality."
good,"Very involved and endless duties, hands on experience for the wave of the future in communication. CO workers are helpful and willing to learn"
good,TWC is all about hustling and bustling and if your in the selling department you must sell. Were required to upsell on pretty much every call. if someone calls in by accident oh well you better try to sell them something.
good,"I worked with a great group of creative people and produced short video features for programming on Time Warner Cable's Local channel TWCTV. I was a one-man-show; I produced, wrote scripts, directed, operated the camera, lit the sets, and edited the video. Each production gave me the opportunity to meet interesting people across New England and the chance to experience places I otherwise would have never visited. In the last four years of my employment with the company the job evolved from a 9 to 5 workday into a position with less traditional hours. Video production is a career that often requires hours out of the norm and I understand that I will never find a position in this area of expertise that doesn't request the occasional long day of work but  Time Warner Cable   started covering local sporting events and I was asked to work late hours it least once a week. At these sporting events I was the Replay Operator. This assignment was not challenging and lacked the amount of creativity I find I need to feel satisfied."
good,A typical day at work for me would be coming in on time everyday and making sure my customers have a great customer service experience and are overall satisfied. I love my coworkers. Very helpful and informative. However the job could be very demanding at times.
good,"I enjoyed meeting many new and interesting people.tasks involved setting up wireless networks,installing digital converters and wirng  customers homes for digital phone services.my co-workers were very professional and help worthy.it brought me satisfaction  resolving customer's problems."
good,"I arrive at 830am, and check emails/phone messages and my calendar for the day.  I prioritize my tasks, and start working on deadline related items due each day by 10am.  I then start working on next priority (usually submitting orders, revisions not due for deadline, follow-up emails, and getting organized for the afernoon).  Lunch around 1pm, meetings are usually scheduled in afternoons throughout the week, and I work ahead for the following days.  "
good,"TWC was an excellent place to work in '08. They actually respected techs for what they were: TECHS! By 2012, upper management didn't care to hire personnel who even knew what an Ethernet cable was. I know this for a fact because I was tasked with training the new hires during my last year there. Very sad to watch the quality of service go down. "
good,Work Environment not in line with pay. Management was stellar. Not a lot of room to advance unless you wanted to be a lead or supervisor. Other positions were lateral moves.
good,"Spectrum was great, when they were bought out by lincare, it became hostile"
good,"Go in log onto system and take phone calls related to customer issues, billing, sales and service, technician's schedules."
good,Good Job for those who enjoy this type of work. Hard market due to servicibility issues
good,Time Warner is Innovative and diversified.
good,My typical day at work goes by fast due to the amount of work I have. I am always busy developing and analyzing new reports on a daily basis. What I love about my job is that they give you alot of opportunities to develop yourself to become noticed and give you the opportuniy to move up in the company.
good,"Very interesting place to work. I was the receptionist to the business offices and I never knew who was going to walk through the door next. From the mayor or chief of police, to sponge bob and angelina. I was seated right next to the studios so there was always filming going on."
good,Overall decent to work for! Great learning expierence for anyone needing experience in a call Center . change is by the second heavy inbound call volume!
good,"I am an IT Asset Management Specialist, working through a contracting company, so my views are a lot different from other people's. I wasn't paid enough, but I loved what I did."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,It is a good place to have your Host home.  Everyone is very knowledgeable and very willing to help with any questions or concerns you may.  We have monthly book reviews and monthly visits.
good,"Great place to work with decent benefits, however long stressful days have become the norm do to poor management and lack of replacing people once they promote or leave company."
good,"great benefits and pay,fast pace, things change often, can be very stressful at times, takes  customer service skills to complete job duties, must be able to multi task and complete trouble shooting come to a resolution"
good,"Although TWC had better benefits, compensation, and better rewards and moral... Spectrum is not a horrible place to work considering you at least still get decent benefits and reliable honest work. My advice to you is to advance as fast as possible which is not impossible, you can move up the Tier ranks very fast within 1-2 years if you have the drive to."
good,"Very fast paced environment, work independently and be open to change. Opportunities of advancement are based on the work you put in. Good place to start a career."
good,Working at Spectrum was a good learning experience. I learned how to structure and balance my personal and professional work life. I was able to learn entry level networking techniques and obtained good customer service experience. The pay was decent for my commute and living area. The time off and sick time was reasonable as well. Management and advancement could have been better.
good,"As a billing specialist, just about every call is a complaint from a customer. Very stressful when dealing with 80-100 irate customers each day. Played a role in my medical issues. Benefits are great. Free cable/internet service, good medical benefits. Felt lacking in resources or info required to perform job. Systems went down too often."
good,this location used to be a good nice family atmosphere  location to work...it is changing to cold and sterile location with the new management taking over.
good,"Favoritism runs rampant. Management only cares about there bonuses, The benefits are great. Training is good. Must like working with all types of customers."
good,"Should have left 10 years ago to try different fields, after being Laid off it's kinda hard learning new company info when trying to go into another field with no experience in that field then to start schooling again to learn a new trade."
good,"Great company, competitive yet supportive environment. Great management however very micromanaged environment as well. No schedule flexibility, accrued time off."
good,Spectrum is a great place they just do not hire from within or hire in general for that matter.  Many people have been contracted for over 2 years with horrible benefits and no vacation.  This company is apparently 80% contractors.
good,"3 legacy companies came together and little additional manpower was added to handle the transition and additional responsibilities. Managing all 3 legacy companies' E911, fallout, misroutes, etc. with one person."
good,"Daily routine was working customer escalations, work order management, outages, Fiber, etc. Management is definitely driven from the top down. Management would listen but, in one ear, out the other. Promotions are tenure based so unless you plan on working for a decade with low pay before you are considered for a promotion I suggest you find another job or, apply for the job you want initially because they will not look at you once they hire you."
good,"This position of Outside sales is tough due to weather issues. Others think the hours are tough. The turnover is VERY high and thus the job culture is rated LOW since you dont develop friends for long. Little time for socializing except during short sales meetngs. They buy lunch once in a while (this is a very good thing).  The queens ofc has very good supvs. and mgr.  Benefits are good. Possible to move up to another sales position.  The lower mgmt here seem to care and also honest. We dont get to know upper mgmt.  Nonetheless the sales numbers HAVE TO BE MET and the commissions are attainable, and you must perform or eventualy you are gone but even here they are flexible, understanding at first.  They will try to see that you meet your minimum.  Typical hours are start between 12pm-2pm. End at 9pm."
good,"I was lied to (yes, LIED TO - there's no nice way to put it) in the interview by the manager and one supervisor when I asked about the training programs available to someone who has never worked in Dispatch. The *ONLY* training you get is shadowing other reps. That's it, PERIOD. DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING MORE. No classroom training, no proper coaching, no way to self-monitor your productivity numbers until it was too late and you were being called into the Manager's office for (what they don't make clear) is a verbal warning or write-up. They were also fond of holding (what most reasonable people would perceive as) informal chats and exchanges on the floor against you as ""disciplinary talks"" or ""coaching"", even though no one ever mentions that to you, but you'd better believe that EVERY little thing a Sr. Rep or Supervisor talks to you about - even if it's not your direct Supervisor - WILL be held against you in the Manager's office. Count on it. It's amazing ANYONE survives long enough to get away from this gulag long enough to go elsewhere in the company."
good,My time at Spectrum has been great and my immediate team is amazing. The one area the company needs to focus on is the Top-Down leadership structure. While in an 8 month period the entire VP-VSP and multiple Directors left the company. This instilled a level of uncertainty among the teams downstream.
good,Great company to work for only because of the benefits and compensation. I worked a sales job for them and got paid great commission. Only thing is leadership is not stable. They are always replacing people with outsiders instead of recognizing who is performing well with the company and making then apart of leadership. No job stability whatsoever.
good,There are a lot of  opportunities coming in as an entry level Customer Service employee. Spectrum offers their employees great benefits and discounted services.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"great place to work, took a lot of my time which is OK. pay was good and some management was good. very fast pace and was able to make as much as i put in."
good,Working at spectrum with cool if I had the opportunity I would love to return I’m so grateful for the opportunity that I was given  The people who also work there are fun outgoing and very helpful  and would be willing to help no questions asked
good,Spectrum is a great company to work for in regards to career growth.  Internal promotion and growth are a large part of the culture. They offer very competitive benefits as well.
good,I enjoy this job but had to relocate. Work has slowed way down and that effects my pay. So I'm looking for something in my new area with a steady work load.
good,The pay is nice but the work environment is stressful. Most of the stress is from the management. The company is not what it use to be. Its seems as if there is no regard for the care of the employee.
good,I enjoyed working with people in the office. meeting new customers in person  or over the phone. competitive promo's for bonuses was a plus and challenging.
good,Not a bad place if you still have a job after the merger.  Great team and fair pay all around.  Efforts of work can be lost in the shuffle of so many projects.
good,"Time warner was a Union Job great benefits great working hours, great management team. Spectrum came in and is working on getting rid of the Union. If you are ok with no job security, 7k out of pocket and over 3k medical premiums Spectrum is your place to work."
good,"Not a job for everyone - very high stress - the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the front line employees "
good,Time warner cable  was the the best. Time warner cable had the best benefits and insurance ever!! Spectrum...not so much.. Time warner cable was a very big picture company.Spectrum..not so much. Spectrum micro manages even their best performers.
good,Had its ups and downs. Not alot of room to grow in the company. But is an overall great enviornment. Just wish they had the kinks worked out before they launch programs.
good,Very fast paced environment.  Ever changing policies and procedures.  Work in all types of weather.  Hardest part is dealing with customers that are frustrated.  Teamwork is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"the people are nice, the environment was okay, but the job security was not there, and no room for advancement. The managers were rude, and nasty okay"
good,"I learned how to use different software and applications in a timely manner for phone, the internet, and cable systems. A typical day at work involved arriving early to boot up my system and open all necessary applications, log-in to the phone, and check in with management via the Lync system. After login and time recording, my day began. I was given a half hour lunch and two fifteen minute breaks that were closely monitored and timed. It was an inbound call center for Tier III calls meaning that the customers have had any of their issues worked at every other available level first. I resolved the most difficult technical issues available. I enjoyed being able to help customers get connected to their services and build brand and company loyalty. My co-workers were kind and helpful and I learned system navigational troubleshooting from both management, training, and co-workers."
good,There is a great air of anxiety throughout the company. It really depends on which department that you're in. The benefits are pretty good.
good,"Customer call in to cancel service due to promotion expire and bill would increase, my job was to keep customer bill the same on new to promo to raise bill in 3-6 months , never to discount customer rate."
good,"Overall work environment is very pleasant , pay is great and health benefits were good. Typical day could be very stressful as you wear many hats in retention. The changing or rotating of supervisors happens on average about every 3 months and found out the sups can keep the big money makers and trade off the rest. Not that I was bringing in peanuts they just like to keep the long time employees on their teams."
good,"Typical day would be to go into the office at 12pm. Submit any paper work and attend any meetings. Map out my destination for the day in terms of area being worked. Knocked on prospected clients homes to try and sell them cable tv, internet, home phone and home security."
good,"At times overtime is required, They have good benefits overall, such as health, vision, dental and free cable, internet and phone.  However do not pay very much hourly."
good,"it is not for everyone....because it is a very stressful mental job. my position mainly focused with dealing with customer that had problems, so you need to be able to handle talking to upset people all shift. otherwise it really is not that bad."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"the job was underpaying for what the work required, management was decent, most enjoyable part of the day was the constant changing installs per home, nothing was ever the same."
good,"Nice place to work, relaxed environment, helpful co-workers, work includes interfacing with other department to assist completing customer installations"
good,"late hours. ok money once you move up. can be a fun environment. good if you like sports. too many young employees, their work ethic lacks. good clientele, respectable."
good,"Not at all a bad company to work for, and the benefits are good. The management cares about its employees, and morale is typically good."
good,"Typical work day in the Emergency Response Center, it taking of inbound calls for security systems and troubleshooting issues, as well as receiving active alarm signals and making outbound calls to notify and check if all is okay."
good,"The co-workers are great and so are the benefits. Free cable and internet, great insurance, there are also bonuses and commission"
good,loved my job here just the management was sporadic and the policy's changed all the time the coworkers were great the benefits were awesome
good,There is only one problem it is upper mangement and the things they do to get rid of people that have been at company for a long time and are making more then the starting rate. It does not help the company and customers. Or make you feel safe in your job!
good,"Charter, now SuddenLink, had amazing employees in Charleston, WV.  Some of the best people and very dedicated and hard-working.  The local management team was helpful, kind and motivating."
good,"The work environment is good considering that you will encounter many different individuals throughout your day.  Circumstances will vary but most experiences will begin negatively since you are there to fix a problem, but if you carry yourself properly and have the necessary technical skills the contact will become positive.  overall the job is interesting.  There are many things to learn about broadband distribution that you will pick up over time, even extended time as not all issues are normal or even repeated.  Most of the techs are easy to get along with and the senior techs are typically very helpful.  Some of the most difficult parts of the job would be tracing issues in attics and under raised houses.  Climbing utility poles can be ""fun"" as well!  The best part of the job is the feeling at the end of each day that you were able to help many people resolve their problem and get back to enjoying whichever services they were cursing before your encounter."
good,Great company to work for with excellent staff and a great environment.  Very flexible to balance work/family life.   Management is very helpful.
good,this is a very fast paced environment with a lot of stress.  It is not a flexible place to work if you have a family of your own. 8 hours of inbound calls
good,TWC has great health and free service benefits depending on where you start with the company there is room for advancement
good,While i had great people to work with and other wise friendly bosses the management that took over was less than productive and ultimately resulted in the demise of the department.
good,Very busy office setting with not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"Time sensitive appointment scheduling field work."
good,"Assist with routing work, answering dispatch messages, assist techs with adding/removing equipment and services from customers' accounts."
good,"TWC sales department is a revolving door. Take a week off and you will definitely see 5 new faces upon your return, along with a few people terminated. It's definitely a hamster wheel with strict deadlines and quotas but GREAT perks and benefits!!!! Did I say GREAT**** perks and benefits? Also, if you live in the market, your cable , internet and phone services are free of charge."
good,"The day begins at 8am-5pm Sun-Thurs, not including O.T. Daily jobs consist of trouble calls, rewires and installs of cable, phone and internet for customers. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"TWC is a nice place to work, with great benefits. "
good,"Lead with over 8yrs of experience in leadership. Dispatch’s and Lead agents. Manages’ metro and all outlying work areas to maximize technician productivity and divisional measurements. This includes measurements to drive high job completion, accurate & on-time routing, & competitive comparisons vs. the divisions in the Region. This includes all work types (service, SRO’s, disconnects, installs, and restarts/upgrades/downgrades)."
good,"-good place to work."
good,I would not recommend this position unless you are looking for a call center job.
good,Great company just becoming not competitive in the Austin market and the manager was new and not great. CO-workers were awesome.
good,Both a great and hard place to work.You have to be a self starter to be able to handle the stress.
good,Good coworkers on average.  Poor cascading objectives established annually.  Struggling though centralization.
good,"Pay is decent. Company is fair, Micro management is the worst I've ever seen."
good,Very good company to work for.  Co-workers are all very nice. I would recommend this company
good,it was fun day at work  managment was good co worker was good deal with people spilling beer all over the place i enjoyed meeting new people.
good,I made every effort to learn as much as I could thru my years working at Time Warner
good,"Typical day at work is placing orders and quotes in Salesforce and doing day to day account management. Also, making cold calls on the phone and going on set appointments with potential or existing customers. What I've learned is the Telecom space is extremely competitive in the Greater Cincinnati  area and have to put emphasis on your account support and availability to customers. Management is supportive and willing to contribute to whatever it takes to close the sale. My co-workers are fantastic and are also supportive in helping me any way they can to be successful. The hardest part of the job is being able to be competitive with the ILEC. Their 100+ year history makes it difficult to penetrate large Gov't, Healthcare and Education customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is winning a deal in such a competitive market. The commemoratory in the office is excellent."
good,I started  my career at Time Warner as a Customer Service Rep and was promoted to Administrative Assistant. My immediate manager was a outstanding person to work for and afforded me opportunity to grow and develop. My co-workers were like family. The hardest part of the job was renewing multi-dwelling contracts on small units. The most enjoyable part of the job was establishing relationships with a diverse group of clients.
good,Good company but the call center job in itself is not an enjoyable experience.
good,Daily Call Center Operations supervisor and team responsibility consisting of up to 25 direct employees'.  Performance management through calabrations with Quality Assurance and meeting Call Center metric expectations for the region.  Promoting Sales and Up-Sales of services and retaining current clients with approval of promotional options.  Working with company to build reliable and maintainging ethical employees' along side and partnering with Human Resources.
good,worked at Detroit Metro Airport for 11 yrs. Called on 26 stores per day . I worked two days a week. the most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people. I was never bored with my job nor did I find any part of this job difficult.
good,"Ok company.. The compensation does not equate to the work in my opinion .. Yes, you get free cable.. "
good,"Time Warner Cable has been a great place to work. With processing Commissions, Supervising Payroll and Accounts Payable functions, I have picked up a great deal of efficiences; especially when it comes to efficiency and database usage. Over the last 10 years, SQL Server has become my favorite software of choice to process huge data sets, streamline calculations, handle increasing complexity and requirements. Utilizing Access Databases has also served me well in that I have been able to help multiple departments streamline processes, create business driven reports and assisted in various data collection scenarios. It is especially interesting when I have been able to link Access to SQL Server utilizing the strengths of both."
good,High expectations but fair compensation. Opportunity for advancement
good,"Install cable, telephone, and internet services. I learned about to wire a house and hang a drop line as well as gaff a pole. Management was average. Co-workers were helpful when I needed it. The hardest part of the job was troubleshooting when you think you have done all you could do. I enjoyed meeting all kinds of ppl on the job."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I learned how to conduct business in a timely manner and how to deal with different personalities while doing it. I learned how to train new hires and still get my work done as well.
good,Assisted with customers with phone issues and while in sales helped customers set up the services that best fit their needs
good,Answering endless in & outbound calls.
good,"I learned a great deal during my time in Master Control and Audio. I had only heard of the concept of mix minus when i started in the company. Over my time here, I have learned mix minus like the back of my hand. I have also weathered through several major changes to workflow and equipment additions/changes. I was the operator who switched Capital News 9 over to YNN at 5am a few years ago. I was part of a team that helped launch a 24 hour news station from its roots as a alternate to the QVC shopping network. The job itself was intense as I worked my way up from monitoring 4 markets to monitoring 8 news channels. The most enjoyable part of the job is sitting in audio and mixing the audio to create the news story. My coworkers were an interesting mix of personalities. I was able to get along with most of them."
good,Good for some extra cash a month but you have to put an extra effort to meet with deadlines.
good,"Good company to start off with, if you are looking for a good entry level position. Training can be iffy at times, though."
good,"Some recent changes have been made allowing technicians to be technicians, and not sales force. Very repetitive work, (for me) not very challenging."
good,"Typical day of work is just maintaining and fixing plant issues within Time Warner. Going from house to house resolving customer related issues. Most enjoyable part of job is being on the road. Co-workers are ok, no complaints there. The hardest part of the job is getting stuck on a job and not getting help or falling behind without help to move calls. Management is ok.."
good,"Time Warner Cable was a fast paced work place environment. I found that the most difficult part of working for the company, is there were a lot of unethical practices being used towards customers. However, overall I did enjoy working the company and greatful for the experience learned. Moreover, I did enjoy the incentives and recognitions cetificates they handed out for employees who did their best work in the company."
good,I love the aspect of being given a job to do and left alone to do it. I love the flexibility I have to balance my work life and home life. I enjoy people and the diversity of it all. I feel I am appreciated and allowed to take initiative to get things accomplished. I am trusted.
good,I learned how to deal with and assist a wide range of personality types.
good,There is no tolorence for lateness so getting there early is better than risking being late. I like talking to people and helping people face to face so the part of being a greeter is what I liked best.
good,"I worked in Collections, it was fun working with the customers and internal customers."
good,"I found for my brief time there, Charter Communications, was an wonderful place to work. The customers were very nice to communicate with, the personel were professional and fun to be around."
good,It has its ups and downs like any job. The job isn’t for everyone if your upbeat and are comfortable billing try it out. It is a friendly and supportive work environment.
good,Bonus checks are great.  Free service's are a plus. I don't like the shift bids.  The location is good and the free parking is a plus.  The attendance policy is fair
good,Laid off after 2 months due to reorg for a year contract.  This would have been a dream job but leadership went in another direction and didn't honor the contract.  Leadership did not even try to find a place for my skill set and was laid off right before the holidays.
good,It was a decent place to work at. besides the process of exiting from hr i would highly recommend working there. filling in the required characters now
good,"Good benefits, great training and equal opportunity. Training is very thorough, they really make sure you know what your doing before they have you work on your own. Safety is a priority with this company."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Working at spectrum was very pleasant and interesting experience. Job security isn't really strong which is something you will have to deal with regardless of they tell you.
good,Spectrum is great company to work for. The company will help propel you into learning the basics about the cable industry. I have learned many skills about cable and communication skills.
good,The ability to aid individuals in their social lives. Making media available to new housing developments. Providing customers with an entertainment resource.
good,"The benefits are amazing, the training program is excellent. Management cares to the extent they are allowed. The compensation is competitive for this position."
good,The Opportunity to learn the evolutions of today's technology and chance to meet new people. Progression and raises at your own pace also on job training.
good,Good company to work for. Benefits are excellent.  Open door policy is great and company's willingness to help you advance your career.  Training is excellent as well.
good,The work itself is challenging at times. Feels micromanaged at times. The pay is just ok.  The break room is pretty nice. Lunch is easy with plenty of food trucks coming in.
good,"Spectrum is a good company to work for, but it is the poster child for corporate america. You are a number attached to a name. The rank and file are awesome. Anyone higher than supervisor has lost touch of the rank and files needs."
good,"Spectrum, formerly Charter Communications, has been my work home for over 16 years.  Per my resume, you'll see I've held several different positions during my tenure.  Some moves were of my own choice while others were not.  However, in those instances, the department I was in was being moved out of state or phased out, but Charter found another position for me within that location, so that I could remain employed.  This scenario occurred 3 times for me."
good,"They have nice facilities: nice cafeteria area, play room & serenity room. As majority of call centers, it's a stats driven job, meaning your supervisor can easily drive you crazy if you're not meeting the goals for some reason. Plus, you have to deal with unhappy customers sometimes."
good,"Life in the cable world is not as easy as most think, you have to deal with all the weather and living in new England you have to deal with temps in the single digits in the winter and temps in the high 90s in the summer. the ability to work from heights and small spaces are a must."
good,company is not organized and as an installer/trouble shooter directors make job harder to complete tasks and jobs in a timely manner. mandatory over time given with no notice.
good,Overall a good company to work for. upper management was an issue but all the techs direct supervisors were very helpful and encouraging. A work vehicle is provided which is a huge plus
good,Spectrum is a good place for personal development and growth. Coaching plays a big part of the development of agents. Very satisfying witnessing others personal growth.
good,"Very focused on performance and fun.  Great facility and work environment.  Frisbee golf, Ping Pong, Bean bags on site.  I would recommend to anyone, good pay and benefits."
good,Spectrum was an okay Job mangement was all over the place an it was alot  that could have been done but they all seemed over worked. The training part was great and very hands on.
good,"company paid services, company vehicle...company provides all tools and training. they provide all uniforms including boots and Carhart coats and overalls."
good,"The people there were really competitive, the compensation was only commission based, which was very stressful because if you did not make a sale then you don’t get money for the day."
good,"Good benefits and good pay. Fun place to work and a place you can really make a career if you want too. Can wok all over the U.S"
good,Being that i was the only female tech in western New York the support from my male colleagues was satisfactory overall it was an ok experience i wouldn’t recommend females enter this field
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"This was a great place to learn and develop skills in the telco world as a new sales rep. Management is tough but fair, but company becomes stagnant after a while."
good,"The company gives autonomy to people and promotes collaboration across multiple teams. "
good,"Great company, who cares about you and your family.  Benefits were good, and they really took care of the top reps on the pay side of things.  Great free Internet, and Tv service"
good,Allows individuals to self promote. Company has great benefits and very competitive compensation. Company has has a leadership team that has true knowledge of the front line employees.
good,"Position very challenging and stressful which requires constant problem solving and conflict resolution skills, limited grace period allowed for skill development, expected to master job requirements quickly and learn as you go"
good,It was a good place to work. The only problem was that they do not give you enough time to do the task that is required from you. They need to give more time per job!
good,I originally worked with Time Warner Cable and separated from the organization during their contract negotiations with Comcast.  I enjoyed working with my team and peers.
good,"In the Enterprise space, leadership is supportive and dedicated to developing employees.  It pains me to look externally for options, but my family did not adjust well to the Connecticut move.  I like my job, but I do not have the autonomy to climb over hurdles as I have had in the past."
good,Spectrum has great benefits and stable hours.  Call center environment with little down time and constant oversight of personal metrics.  Pretty easy if you are used to the call center environment
good,fun working with people at or around my age. The one thing I learned is to have patience with residents. the work place is so relaxing and the employees are very welcoming
good,I love to work with others! I don’t enjoy having bad days off but I like what I do! It’s only tough that in order to advance you have to ya a test! ( not all of us are test takers)!
good,"They offered good training and great benefits. Work overload. Good team to work with, and management was very open door. Overtime was good while it lasted."
good,they help you to be better at  your job so people micro mange you but other than that its a great company  to work for ... not to mention free cable and internet .
good,"The leadership in the Clarksville office is great. It is hard to say the same ofr those higher up, as it can sometimes be difficult to find help on the job when you need it."
good,Administrative support to Engineering staff.  Scheduled meeting and made travel arrangements.  Good benefits and good pay.  Answer phone and conveyed messages to staff.
good,"I enjoy working at the company benefits and pay are competitive. They offer nice breakroom with massage chairs and game room with TV's, pool table, game station's. I love the employee appreciation program"
good,"Great place to work"
good,"appropriate questions, clarifying the issues and expressing oneself clearly."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Working here is fun for the most part. The people are great, the management is 20% great. The money is the focus. Hit your metrics and you can make well into six figures per year, with a GED or high school diploma."
good,"●   Fix video related issues."
good,I have nothing to say I would have stayed but they wanted  our department to move out of state. they are a good company other then not keeping up with the cost of living.
good,"Onsite cafe, showers, volleyball court"
good,", troubleshooting product issues, setting up new services for new customers and researching customer accounts for inconsistencies while providing timely feedback. troubleshoot internet and phone prepair"
good,"Good money poorly managed, great room for advancement, always changing, hardest part dealing with irate customer with not support to back you. WhAT THE CUSTOMER WANT THEY GET TYPE OF THING"
good,Overall this is a great job to work for and i enjoy my time here. there are some downs but thats with any call center. I do think that there can be some improvements.
good,Working at spectrum can give you a chance to experience technical support life along with the customer service. The hardest part of the job is sometimes you have to deal with customers that are a little aggressive but it comes with the job.
good,Typical day at work is assisting customers questions about bills and issues with account. Very stressful and fast past. Calls come back to back with no time in between calls. Expected to stay on the phone and you will be reprimanded if otherwise. Pay is good and free cable is a plus. However listening to customers yell and be little you all day can be mentally tiring. If you don’t hve thick skin the job is not for you. Advancement opportunities are very limited. Job security is a negative as well if management feels you don’t fit they will let you go   Turnover rate is Terrible. Within the last week and a half at least 20 people have quit of been fired and that’s the norm.
good,"They expect many hours from Managers and Supervisors and continue to implement small ideas with minimal results.  Each department operates in silos, practically guaranteeing that the root cause of customer issues will not be adaquately addressed."
good,"Since merger, information has not been disseminated from the top-down efficiently. System outages occur frequently effecting the agents commission as they are still expected to take calls."
good,"Work my assigned jobs.Outdoors and Indoors. Traveling in company vehicle from work order to work order. Assisted other technicians as needed."
good,"Products are always changing and evolving at Spectrum. Projects come and go on a monthly basis and there is always work to be done and opportunities to be involved in all aspects."
good,"I would go back and work at Spectrum now that they have changed hands from Time Warner to Spectrum, management at Time Warner was lazy and only cared about there own stats, they could care less about you as long as you were making them money."
good,"On a typical day of work you started your first job at 8 am. The expectation was to do 8 jobs in 8 hours but with this expectation there is no way to take care of the customer properly. Here I learned how to work on my own, how to get my own process, how to troubleshoot using the tools they provided. I learned the ins and outs of the coax cable system. Management at Spectrum was really good, they had more of an understanding when it came to life outside of work. They took more time to come out and help you succeed rather than just sit in an office and bark orders. The workplace culture was a lot more of a family. We all worked together. Hardest part of the job here again was dealing with all the weather elements. I really enjoyed everyone I worked with here. It made the job enjoyable along with building relationships with customers."
good,"It was a typical sales job. Management always wants more, but the people were good. The benefits were great. Due to the buy out there was a lot of uncertainty of how things would ultimately work out for everyone."
good,"I worked at Charter - Spectrum for about 8 months. The management was lovely, my co-workers were all nice, but working in the billing department is difficult. People are often irate. If you cannot handle people yelling at you for 8 hours in a day, I'd highly recommend skipping it. That being said, you get free TV services, a 401K, amazing insurance opportunities, and a complimentary life insurance policy. The new minimum wage for Spectrum is $15/hr."
good,The job requires a lot of multitasking as well as attention to detail.  It often goes from fast paced to extremely slow without a moments notice so that days are hard to predict.  Metrics are strictly monitored so it can be stressful when not meeting.
good,Spectrum is a good company. Great benefits. Great pay. Amazing opportunities to progress in the company. Very thoughtful activities to celebrate team successes.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Spectrum is truly an awesome place. The company is currently going through a growth faze and so it has its ups and down. The most detrimental factor about spectrum is that its parenting company Charter communications truly does not care about there employees.
good,"I do not know much about Spectrum, when I was employed there is was TWC. The management was not the best, very greedy, no empathy, they were not held accountable, and home life was never taken into consideration. It was very cut throat and more of a show then a great place to work. Everyone was treated as a number, not a human,"
good,Great place to nurture an understanding of hard work. If you enjoy the outdoors and a sense of independence this is a great job for you. Great mix of technical know-how and customer service.
good,"Very nice people who work here. Opportunity to work autonomously, but with direction when appropriate.  Unfortunately, within the corporate office there is no telecommuting allowed, although many job functions would support telecommuting - if only one to two days a week - which would  improve productive time and eliminate the long commute most people have working here."
good,"Pros:"
good,"A good place to work with lots of growth potential in technical areas such as IT.  Co -workers were really nice people, professional but like a family atmosphere.  The pay could have been higher compared to the national average but bonuses made up for lower base pay."
good,"Although I only worked for the company a year, having to leave due to family illness, my experience there was a good one and they are organised, well structured and professional."
good,I really wnjoyed working for charter Spectrum because of all the benefits it had. They are an extremily big company with unlimited room for growth. I appreciate the opportunity they had given me before I made my Career change for more money.
good,"supervisors are ok, lack of communication when launching new promotions for sales. job is really stressful but makes up on the pay and commission. overall good place to work and have a career. They promote from within."
good,"Great place to work, easy going fun environment. The staffs made sure that the shared areas were comfortable and filled with different games that the staff can connect with each other."
good,i like my position but there is know room for growth. i want to advance in a company especially when i show the potential. yhis job has taught me alot. i get along with all the employees. i show the initiative in this position. im not the type to get use to what im doing an thats it. im the type who looks for the challenge an if i have ideas i share it.
good,"good company, need new management, legacy cable mindset is keeping the company from moving forward. need new product managers and product marketing folks"
good,I loved my job at Spectrum. I loved the flexibility of working from home frequently. I loved the sales I made. I did not like the churn that became more prevalent as the mergers became more solidified.
good,"company offers unlimited overtime for call center positions. call centers for billing was just a tough position, comes with good days and really bad days. company allows for advancement after a year of staying in one title, so if you do good for a year in your title you will have higher chances of moving up and out of the call center."
good,"Company is changing daily with minimal communication between corporate departments. "
good,"Its a call center job. If you have ever worked one you know what to expect. Did have alot of fun with coworkers. Overall, not a bad place to work. Met alot of interesting people."
good,"You're going to be a cog in a machine where one gear turning you is a large corporation with all of the strict rules that come with that, and on the other side of you is the angry customers that will let you have it one call at a time. Most people know this going into it though, so no surprises. Great people to work with and good pay."
good,"Being a cable technician for Spectrum is a fast thinking, being able to have good people skills, working on my own and be responsible, and keeping up with your cable technical skills. A typical day i greet the customer explain what i going to either fix or instal. I must be constantly moving so i make sure i hit my appointments on time. Time management is key for this job. Managment is great always giving good guidence and making sure they support us with anything for the job. The hardest part of my job can sometimes having to run very long cable areial drops to customers homes in rural areas."
good,Good place to start a life - good pay for the work you do- very flexible hrs- cant complain there- it is very stressful so if youre easy to break this isnt the place for you.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Great opportunity to grow and advance.  Honest hard working group that I worked with.  Wish company growth afforded to keep grassroots workers locally.
good,you are handled to tools to make your own paycheck. the break room is a fun get away with a pool table ping pong and gaming systems. there is room for promotions
good,"Good company to work for, with good pay and good benifits. Like a lot of employers though, there only care about production and quantity over quality."
good,"everything is good, good people, good work, good management, they have your back, we are all very happy working together. not everyone likes each other but we get along"
good,Selling is a problem for me now. Decent to work for but if you’re not selling you’re not of value. Tried to get out of selling and stay with the company but I wasn’t allowed. That left a bad taste in my mouth.
good,"You will be provided technical training, and for installers you are provided all tools and a company vehicle. The training, while adequate is very fast paced."
good,I do not have a rating for this company at this time.  It would not let me pass the prompt without typing something so I am typing this.  Thank you for your time.
good,"I choose not to write any review for my time at spectrum since is was 2 years ago and the entire environment has changed since then.  However, this system won't let me move forward without something here."
good,"The hardest part about this job is taking back to back calls. Because of that, the management does their best to provide you with activities to assist in making your day enjoyable."
good,Nice work environment. Company relocated to South Carolina. Managers and co workers are great to work with. Company has good career advancement opportunity.
good,"low pay. strict schedule with no flexibility, high score standards, not much time inbetween calls like usually back to back and up to 10 seconds. lots of lame management, strict business""casual"" dress code, no sneakers, no jeans etc. ""church"" clothes or 1st interview clothes lol."
good,coordinating and mentoring workers out in the field. delegating jobs assignments and signing approvals for daily work out in the field and in the office.
good,Good place to learn the cable industry. Manager was great and understanding of work and balance of personal life. Was strict and fair. If looking for place to grow into.
good,"A typical day in the TWC/Spectrum technical support department consists of taking anywhere from 40 - 60 phone calls depending on the call flow. Phone agents are expected to be self motivated rather than be continually reminded to keep on task. "
good,"I started training in Charlotte NC, moved back home once I was ready & started installing cable at home. Being that I'm a contractor I don't get any benefits & that sucks."
good,very busy from the time you walked in to the time you left. Talking to technicians and customers and making sure everyone was on the same page. The management was good ..
good,You spend a couple hours in the office and the remainder spent in the field. Training never stops it's ongoing. Management is very structured. Very professional and respectful workplace culture. The hardest part of the job is making quota and the most enjoyable part of the job is when you exceed it.
good,"A very fast paced working environment, good management, the company also has good discounts and bonuses for employees. They provide room to grow and advance your career."
good,"While there always seemed to be something to do, much of it was self imposed busy work.  The merger has put a strain on resources and they seem to be chasing too many goals at once."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I liked working here. I worked in the Customer Service Inbound Call Center and ALL calls. I was  able to take in coming Sales calls since I was good at what I did. If there was more Money, I would have stayed."
good,It was a good company to work for. Takes care of customers. Goal driven company. Will do fine if your goals align with theirs. Great benefits. Free Service.
good,Fast paced environment. Technology/policy changed frequently. Must be adaptable. Learned how cable gets to all customers and the maintenance required to keep service going. The hardest part of the job is to make sure you are up to date and aware of all policies. The most enjoyable part of the job is hearing customer's satisfaction.
good,"Spectrum has a well established formula for it's service department. This creates an environment where each technician should mostly have every resource they need to complete their work. Unfortunately, this is overshadowed by the very heavy handed quotas and disciplinary techniques used based on these quotas."
good,"Nice Place to Work.  Great Co-Workers and Management.  Good growth potential. while working with cutting edge technologies.  "
good,"Clocking in, verifying a cash bag if I get a register, setup at a station, pull up billing systems, qmatics, Outlook email, and whatever else would be necessary throughout the day. Collecting payments for billing, educating customers about there accounts, billing issues, equipment, adding or upgrading services, down grading, saving with retention, or completely discontinuing services."
good,"take into consideration any building issues that may need to be handled, manage team to answer receptionist desk and split the floors to handle all seating needs or any type of misc requests the employees on each floor need"
good,"Phones are high volume, one thing is customers can be very nasty when they call in.   All calls are monitored by QA and you are graded on this.  There is always training, and they do have weekly meetings and one on ones, They like to feed you pizza, chicken wings, candy, soda etc.. so plan on getting fat.  Aside from the yelling customers it is a good company.  You also get free cable, internet & phone."
good,"As one of the largest employers in the area, Spectrum provided me an opportunity to work back to employed dignity. I was previously underemployed in the Detroit area and needed to revive my work life. As a third shift employee the work pace is manageable and not excessively stressful. There is a plethora of opportunities in other departments."
good,"Always went out with about 7 to 8 jobs per day. Either installation or technical issues at the customer home or outside on telephone pole."
good,"In my opinion, Spectrum is all around, not a bad place to work. Spectrum offers an excellent benefits package to its employees. Spectrum has a very diverse workplace culture."
good,"Not  a bad job, but very stressful as is any customer service call center. Would recommend as a good job until you figure out what you really want to do with your life, unless you make it to management."
good,Cable is actually a technical job and you do have to use your mind when installing and troubleshooting. This could be a great job if management didn't micromanage everything. They get on you for everything and it makes technicians feel uncomfortable and most don't usually last long even though the pay is good.
good,"The work can be stressful at times, but the benefits are hard to match. We get cable, internet, and phone, free, health and dental ins, 401K, and more."
good,"work timing is flexible and work load always more. Sometime you have to work saterday and sunday also, Balance between work and family is difficult. learning scope is more with new technologies"
good,I was a contract employee with an implementations team. The work was fun with good overall management. The company culture was quite open and free allowing employees a wide degree of responsibility.
good,Typical day at work in life of a dispatcher is filled with jolly good mornings.  I learned to work in a fast paced environment and team work and and consistent active communication is imperative for this position. I do not bring personal problems to work nor do I take work home it keeps balance.  I feel that workplace culture is not toxic but could use improvement.  The hardest part of my job is trying not to overwork technicians in situations where that may be inevitable.  The most enjoyable part of my job is building rapport with my technicians and colleagues.
good,"i work front counter. In office by myself. Do computer work. File paperwork, do audits monthly. I am in customer service so handle customers everyday. I also have a sales goal i have to meet every month."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Great call center, you just have to your life secured, Job advancement is left only to a select type of applicant. Know that you will be in the position you apply for ."
good,I enjoyed working here because I learned how to properly multi-task while answering multiple calls and having to take proper documentation of each call. Also because I was part of the retention team (goals were to try and change a customers mind who;s intentions were to cancel service) I learned a lot of customer service and sales skills
good,"As a Direct Sales Representative you will be expected to reach monthly objectives typical of most sales positions. Supervisors are normally available to lend assistance, their success depends on your success."
good,"like any other job that primarily depends upon commission in order to generate any real profit, the job is what you make it. You have to be hungry enough to overcome any obstacle such as weather, constant rejections, or failed leads and aggressive enough enough to keep pushing even when you are not seeing results.  The opportunity to make great money is there, but you will be advised to not let your obligations become an obstacle.  If you are content with all of that then this is the perfect job for you."
good,I never worked for a company named Spectrum. You are asking me to write a review. Sorry. You are insisting that the review doesn't meet your standard and I need update it.
good,service compared to price. selling a service that does not work as promised to the customer.  consistent rate changes make it difficult to exceed the customers expectations
good,"A good place to learn from experienced supervisors and fellow workers with time on the job who don't mind mentoring  or answering questions and giving you the proper  aspects of what your duties and what is expected of you are."
good,"This job was contract work out of state. The living arrangements that they set up were great, the pay was great, it was just tough being away from home."
good,The job was enjoyable.  You had a different task and location each day.  Problems to solve.  There was a good 401k and overtime available.  But the company and union havent been able to come to an agreement in over 9 months.
good,Somedays would be smooth and relaxed but there was other days that was back to back calls through to whole shift and it would be stressful. Other than being stressful it was a good job.
good,I worked in the receiving department. A job which I got through a temporary hiring company. The company was a good company and the people and management was nice.
good,But apparently I have to fill it out so I am just taking up space at the moment to get passed these screens and that's my answer. But I think my opinion is not a factor because what may not work for me may for someone else.
good,Often sales incentives would drive me to carefully work with the customers objections to acquire the sale. I liked the team-spirit involved with making sales and also helping the company overall. I won prizes and that was fun. There was always team meetings and that felt good for the souls who were committed to making sales as well as helping the customer base and the company overall.
good,The winters were harsh but the summers were good.  I was paid by commission and the checks were inconsistent. This was mainly a night job when people were home.
good,I worked when Time Warner Cable was transitioning to Spectrum.  The pay went from great bonuses to barely enough to live on.   They always adjusted the sales goals to where no one could obtain them without violating their integrity.
good,"Working for Spectrum, I found that our call center employees were getting paid the same amount, if not more, as those who were out in the elements installing the services.  This was very frustrating to me and the major reason why I chose to leave."
good,Spectrum is a good company to work for good pay and good hours. Only downside is it's hard to grow in the company. Other then that I would recommend anyone to work here
good,great place to start where they will let you work in all areas of the EMR which in turn expands your skills set. You will also gain experience in training offshore support staff.
good,This was a good place to work very career driven and great benefits they allow you to choose if you want to work holidays for extra pay of just take an extra day off
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,It is usually a very balanced job. You can get a good number of jobs one day and be very slow the next. The pay is okay and the benefits are great. The management team is okay as well.
good,Its a good place to work if you're not in sales. the environment is sttressful on a day to day basis. If you dont like dealing with people attitudes this is not for you.
good,"Spectrum makes an effort to be fair and listens to feedback.  The job is very physically demanding in the DSR role, with long hours in the field as well as before and after hours organizing for the days tasks."
good,"My work day was intense, thousands of manufactured items were assembled, packaged and shipped daily. The work place culture was upbeat and one on one in my area, the production area. Most difficult part of the job was making sure all deadlines were met and they were.Best part of the job was the interaction with the crew, we worked hard and had a lot of fun."
good,"So the review for this company is kinda all over, There benefits and pay were rather good and very very nice, job security and advancement were also easily accessible my biggest issue and why i quit was mangment/polices they are a very very deceiving company"
good,"Spectrum is great place if you're looking to work in fast pace, often stressful environment. The hardest past of the job is is not having consecutive days off"
good,"Been a part of a few takeovers in my 22 years with the company and this was, by far, the worst. Management seemed to make quick decisions without reviewing consequences and job security was abysmal."
good,Not a bad place to work primarily. It would be nice if it paid more starting out compared to Bell. Management is okay. Customers and Logistics is my major complaint.
good,"overall a decent company"
good,7:00 am Meeting boss to pick up materials needed for the next few work days. Arrive on job site approximately 7:30 am. Determine which floor is least occupied by other trades so that you're not working on top of one another. From there begin knocking out tasks for the day. Get off work around 5-5:30 sometimes later depending on how much work I have gotten done or when the deadline for the job is. Normally take lunch 12-12:30
good,Its ok.  Good job but ownership has changed so we are yet to find out all the changes that will come with that.  That is the hardest part.  The rest is typical big company perks and challenges.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you can deal with, repetition, angry customers concerning their bill (while company was TWC), Using scripted lines you have to repeat at the beginning of every call."
good,"is any system by which some members of society act in an organized manner to enforce the law by discovering, deterring, rehabilitating, or punishing people who violate the rules and norms governing that society.[1] Although the term may encompass entities such as courts and prisons, it is most frequently applied to those who directly engage in patrols or surveillance to dissuade and discover criminal activity, and those who investigate crimes and"
good,Good balance of family and work life. Would recommend to others looking to advance their resume. Areas to build your technical knowledge in cable industry as well.
good,Back when it was Time Warner Cable it was high school all over again. I'm sure just because the name changed doesn't mean the atmosphere didn't. People played favorites and if you weren't on a specific supervisor's team then they couldn't help you.
good,"Had a great time working for them. fast paced and challenging. lots of training, great staff, you learn a lot on the fly. Most days is repetitive and long, but rewarding"
good,"okay , "
good,"Hostile takeover, We were purchased by Charter and told either move or by let go. No transition period and no intrest in learning how to take over our day to day operations"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Overall the job is great if you can get pass the management. most the management team don't care for you as a person. they just care if your hitting your numbers. i have no care for your outside life and family. you do get free cable!!!!!1
good,"People are enjoyable to work with,  A typical day for a sales Representative is about 8-10 hours including office time, follow up calls, meetings, and field time."
good,"Although the merger was completed a little over a year ago, the organization is still experiencing growing pains. Hopefully everything will be fine in another year."
good,"●	Telecommute "
good,"I enjoyed working at spectrum, despite going through manpower. Good and laid back company. Easy work but can be difficult at times. Good money if you're hired in through spectrum."
good,"You are your biggest obstacle in success with the company.  If you have a desire to learn, succeed, and a good work ethic, you can be greatly rewarded."
good,"The transition to Spectrum, and the months after the buyout was completes  was a little bit of a concern to the existing employees, especially regarding job security."
good,Monthly focus changed daily.  Liked the pay structure.  management very approachable.  The few would ruin it for the masses.  Coworkers liked to talk about each other.
good,"Good place to work and explore"

I have successfully worked remotely for TWC for many years, but Charter's belief in the water cooler effect has led to letting everyone go that is not able to move to a corporate location.

Technicians in the field have their concentration and efforts pulled every which way, with different departments demanding different sometimes conflicting things. Upper management is often completely out of touch with what their employees are dealing with. That being said direct supervisors were doing a fantastic job of making sure the technicians had what they needed, often going above and beyond to ensure everything was taken care of.

good,"Great company, great product, great place to work if your in a position other than outside business class sales. It is all about the numbers, if you achive them you can make money. Sales Management are all ex- One Communication people. Dogs are treated better than outside sales executives. You are micro managed, must report numbers everyday. Too may sales meetings which take away from time you need to sell. Poor expense compensation - low money for gas and NO money for hotels or out of town stays. Territories are poorly planned out and awarded. Turnover is a a all time high - over 80% are let go. Cannot upsell current customers, they want you to sell only customers with no service. Inside sales who receive calls and the deal is nearly 70% done when someone calls are treated weel and sales - well like I said, like dogs."

Whenever there's a problem or I need a question to be answered, Our supervisor will always assist us with whatever it is we need. I get along very well with my co-workers. We are like family. We help out each other to make the job that much easier. The hardest part of the job is is dealing with unruly, intoxicated and obnoxious people. The most enjoyable part is getting to see games and performances of your favorite team or artist. Also each team has a little gathering before work. We have food and beverages."

You check in your progress and plans for the week on Mondays and utilize the rest of your week with complete freedom.

I managed over 8000 homes and clients, providing top to bottom customer service, account management, tracking installs, booking and product knowledge. I also set up promotional events in building lobbies, public parks and at community organizations. My co-workers were eager to learn from one another just as much as they were willing to lend a helping hand.

good,"If you have no self respect and can work like a robot, this job is for you. But if you have a heart, you may find it nearly impossible to succeed in this company. If management doesn’t like you , you will know."
good,Good job to get on your feet. Your off weekends. There is a lack of mentorship and guidance from some of the supervisors but there are only a few who genuinely care
good,"When you clock in be prepared to work. If you work the call center then you will be taking calls all day, and helping customers of all kinds. I learned to deal with all types of customers. Happy or irate, they all had to be helped, and treated with respect. I miss this job, and would return under different management. I love people, and the people in this office as well as the customers respected me as their leader. I learned to do your best regardless of the circumstances, and treat everyone fairly. I would recommend this company to anyone in a heartbeat. It is the best place to learn, and grow into good old fashion customer service.I really enjoyed helping the customers understand their bill, and the services they have on their accounts.To see their faces light up when they came to the office, and ask for my help was extra special. This was 10 Years ago. I left in 2009"
good,"Overall it's a great job with a lot of opportunities but micromanaging really kills the job. It's a very customer-facing job where you will deal with all types of weather. Pay progression was incentivized in the past but all promises when I was hired were restructured so most employees have no desire to progress anymore. Overall they have good benefits and its very team-oriented. Downside you don't really see or talk to co-workers other than on your equipment pick up days. Also, the hours can get long and frustrating some days and how to make or break these times really depends on the manager. From my experience, the X military managers understand the NEED to take care of your team and will foot the load with you to show some compassion really makes you value the job. Other managers will just head home and have you call or text them once done and only give verbal aid. so all in all its hit or miss and you may rotate who you're under."
good,Aggressive fast paced call center. high stress and high call volume. facility is nice but the tv and phone products are quickly becoming obsolete. Staff is friendly.
good,"There are a ton of great people that work there and the company does more than most do for it's employees.  It doesn't feel like a family but it doesn't feel like a room full of strangers either.  Generally positive, leadership that tries hard but there is a focus on results.  don't be lazy and follow he rules and youll be fine here."
good,I have had many opportunities working for Spectrum and would recommend it to anyone.  I am only looking for something closer to home and to see my family more often.
good,Good company with good benefits.  The leadership could benefit from some training on how to lead people.  The culture seems to be everyone out for themselves.  Senior department leaders don't have a lot of interaction with employees
good,It is a great place to work. The staff does try to compensate for the fact that you are working with public that is upset because a service is not working. The down side is the dealing with cleaning up mistakes by other groups in the company that do not give proper info or try and sell services to cust who do not need them.
good,Spectrum was a good job. There was plenty of advancement to the next level. Management is always wling to help you out if need be. I would recommend working for spectrum besides you get free cable once you are employed by them.
good,Spectrum use to be a great place to work. I was there for 11 years before I left. The merge with TWC has changed the company completely. Its not fun..
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I had the opportunity to work with a great group of talented people when I was at Spectrum.  There was a lot of work due to the merger and new technologies being adopted.
good,I've worked at spectrum billing for a year. We constantly hire new representatives because current employees leave. The company would rather hire and train new people than correct the culture issues that cause everyone to quit.
good,"Towards the end of my career with Spectrum expectations were at an all time high and almost unrealistic. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I got to work with each day and that was the most difficult to come to grips with, when deciding to leave. They were like family."
good,good pay easy to learn if youre willing to learn however attendance policy is too strict . I wouldve continued to work there if I could however due to health issues I had to stop but this didnt feel like all the other typical call centers I worked at before.
good,"It started off difficult,  but I willed my way through until I was able to believe in my abilities. Didn't allow myself to detoured or distracted. Stay focus, then I learned not to take work home and home to work. Overall, great pay, benefits, and resources to get the job done."
good,"My overall experience was good here. Good, practical managers. It was a very diverse office too. The commission is good money, but the hourly pay is terrible. There is mandatory OT every week too which gets old. They have great medical/dental benefits, 401k and free cable/internet/home phone services. "
good,Spectrum is a typical call center workplace. It is very important to show up at work each and every day and to be on time. The management gives plenty of feedback on the positives and negatives of your performance.
good,"Independent work environment. Learn new thing out in the field to help improve you traits. Troubleshooting internet connectivity on personal devices such as PC desktops, laptops, TV and video systems, gaming systems, smart phones, and other devices daily."
good,"its a good place to work money wise but you don't want to hurt yourself while doing it. Very hard labor Climbing polls carrying ladders etc. You get some good and bad customs because they want what they asked for and and they where suppose to provide that for them and most of the time they couldn't but, it may of changed since then."
good,"Company takes care of you and family.   Good base pay, plus commission off the charts.   Average 11 hr/ plus avg sales rep will make about 1200 - 2000 in commission/month.   Stressful environment. Definitely a sales environment.  Turnover rate is low after first three months of employment.   Great benefits and free cable and hsd. You definitely get paid for your hard work."
good,It was a hard job but very much a fulfilling job helping customers out with their tv. I never left a job undone. I loved my customers and the other employees. Pay just wasn’t there
good,"While spectrum is an overall good place to work, things change daily and they tend to be a little bit laxed on giving the information in a timely manor."
good,"Amazing benefits, I would recommend working here for the benefits alone.  The healthcare is insane.  I had a good manager there as well, so that made things easy for me.  I liked the job overall."
good,"OSR work every Friday and Saturday. Having low cost Home services perk is a bonus (20% discount)"
good,A very nice company to work. The constant calls can be unnerving but overall not too bad. Have to have the right attitude to make it work. Very updated and plenty of support.
good,"I made good money, met great people, but like all call centers, you are on production and also getting surveys on your calls. I think that the pay was fair and also great value overall"
good,"I love working at Spectrum. It really depends on your supervisor if you’ll love the job. There are lots of changes. So now it’s becoming more STRESSFUL. Now all they care about is mobile, but you get paid more off selling core services. If you can handle stress go for it. The money is there to be made. Benefits are great as well."
good,"Like most call center jobs, they are very metrics driven - they want you to resolve calls in the shortest time possible, not always easy to do when you have to walk senior citizens through restarting a modem or setting up email. If you like to talk, are a little tech savvy and can deal with angry customers, its an OK job that pays reasonably well by local standards, with lots of OT available"
good,"The company gives a lot of care in the mentor and leadership area once you are on the floor. The initial training however has a lot of challenge and organization to meet and adjust. It is quite disorganized and not methodical at all. "
good,A typical work day is pretty busy with ensuring your team is doing what is expected on a daily basis. By doing this I have learned how to become a more well-rounded supervisor
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,At the start of the day I research the pending work orders for the day and assign escalation jobs to supervisors in the office and to myself. ensure technicians are routed correctly and give needed support to our workforce coordinators. I have learned to properly coach and mentor employees as well as balance an employees need and the business need as well. Writing down tasks and completing them in order of importance has helped a great deal so no dead lines are missed. The workplace is open an enjoyable to work in. The hardest part of the job is keeping priorities in check. It can be a struggle to spend time in the field working with and mentoring my technicians and also keeping up with the administrative work. However the most enjoyable part is seeing employees advance in the company and meet with an irate customer and work to find a resolution to the issue. I find this very enjoyable.
good,Fast paced work environment.I learned how to troubleshoot cable issues on cable plant and house wiring.Management is fair with employees.The most enjoyable part of the job is every service call is different.
good,Positive Workplace. Challenging work environment. Mid to high stress. Weak on supporting work life balance. Great opportunity for learning and education.
good,Had a great experience with this company. Love management my team and had a wonderful time- reason I left was seeking more income for my family & purchase a home
good,"Spectrum as a company is amazing to work for. Their benefits are phenomenal, the tuition reimbursement is top notch, and the perks are great. However, if you have an issue with a manager, supervisor, or coworker their internal ability to handle it is severely limited. Like many jobs, if your boss is great so is your job, but if your boss is not amazing they can truly make work unbearable."
good,Fast packed environment. Calls do come in back to back. High stress job. Muster be able tooltip task. Handle high volume of calls. Provide professional demeanor.

good,"Spectrum had me working as a contractor for about 100 days.  Enjoyed the work but when it came time to onboard, the contractors were released.  Would have liked to stay on and felt the program warranted the efforts."
good,"I day at Spectrum is busy. I go in around 8:45 am and work with customers all day, do tasks around the office, and hit my sales numbers. I enjoy going and educating customers about my companies products."

good,"Spectrum as a whole is a good place to work, nice clean environment and the appearance of guidance.  Unfortunately they are struggling with new policies and procedures which have them focusing on issues that don't or shouldn't impact an agent or sometimes its just completely out of your hands yet you are chastised for performance when its ultimately up to someone else whether or not you are doing your job."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Great company overall but every year we lose more with no end in sight. Pay is less every year. The offers we get to sell get worse. The products aren't advancing compared to other telecommunication companies.
good,"Starting from the basics of data, a well developed path, one can encounter when the goal is to grow. Potential of reaching the dream, is real. The entire staff there is to support and encourage to succeed."
good,dispatchers are friendly and very well aware of your route. Helps with jobs on your route as far as moving jobs around and adding them. good place to work for.
good,"A typical day as a technician involves driving to a job, phoning and answering phone calls, time management, meeting your jobs quota, installing and demonstrating products to customers and much more"
good,very busy work. non stop work. a lot of meetings. great teamwork. flexible hours in some positions... great benefits.  promotions from within ............
good,"The work day at Spectrum rewards employees who fully engage, since there is little downtime.  It is important to maintain a sense of humor, and stay flexible, in a high pressure environment."
good,In terms of money spectrum is one of the better companies in Charlotte.  The merger of Charter and TWC brought tons of jobs to the area but plenty of headache too.  There is no structure or accountability with in the departments.  I found this to be true every time I moved to a new department within the company.  Luckily the money is good enough for them to keep people.
good,"I work taking care the wireless boxes and modems and connect all the outputs and inputs and make sure everything work, and check the channels be working correctly"
good,Since the company changed from Time Warner to Spectrum it became a stressful job environment. You always had to worry if your department was going to be shut down and unfortunately mine was shut down.
good,"Long hours with no recognition of making golds accomplished in advance."
good,Value the work is great. The value of the job is not as much as it used to be in the three decades worked. The culture has been less on local needs to cooperate needs.
good,"This job requires a lot of time and dedication. Not meant for those who like to have a normal calm day. It is constantly changing, and continues to grow rapidly. Great opportunity for those who like a fast paced environment and like to stay busy. The direction of this position is at time unstable and may change from one day to the next. Communication is key to being an effective leader, which I believe most of leadership has. Overall, love what I do and people I work with."
good,I have been a field tech for about 2 years. I have been in alot of different homes and seen all kinds of people and places. the management is decent there are times when the communication isn't there but the every other tech had your back and so did the supervisor when need be. Long hours and some days just were horrible but it has times when you wouldn't want anything else.
good,It was a fun environment to work in.  There was a ping pong table in the break room and a basketball hoop.  They recognized a lot of holidays and provided us snacks. For example we had snow  cone day etc.
good,"Free or reduced cable, internet and phone services. Great health, dental and vision benefits. 401k and retirements advantages as well. .. Cons are hot seating."
good,"My experience in Dispatch was really great.  I loved my Dispatch/Field Services manager and she was by far the most knowledgeable and driven person I have encountered in Dispatch/Customer Service/Management.  Supervisors in Field Services were very competent but did not seem to really enjoy their jobs nor did they have a passionate drive to improve the department.  It may have been because of complacency and years of stress as most of them were supervisors for 10+ years.  They were kind to us but only invested a tiny part of themselves into their positions.  My manager was excellent and I feel that maybe below her if they swapped out some supervisors the department would run better. Maybe put some supervisors in place that are highly driven to succeed and create better teams with more interaction and training. "
good,Job was fun when it was Bright House. When it became Spectrum the job went down hill. It was all about the bottom dollar. Techs were pushed to do more without receiving more pay. Supervisors hold grudges. Customers hate you. A LOT OF BIG BROTHER! Dot your I's and cross your T's
good,"Commission based position. Highly Competitive salary. Commission structure and goals change constantly. Employees need to be flexible as schedules also change on a regular basis.  You need to be focused and able to learn new computer systems, be self motivated, and keep up on new company policies, guidelines, and procedures.  We are all responsible for our own performance, which dictates your salary.  "
good,"I started my career with Charter at the call center as a CSR. There were a lot of advancement opportunities within Charter. I transitioned from the residential side, to helping small/medium businesses, to hospitality/educational businesses,"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"good work environment"
good,"Sorry, I do not have a review to write for this company. This company will speak for itself once you work for them. I would recommend working for them."
good,"i had great leadership so my experience may differ.  i really enjoyed working here.  overall great people and team members. if you do well with sales the money is great.  to be fair, i was in sales not a customer service role."
good,Spectrum has a fun and modern work culture. Management is very supportive. The hardest part of my job was the volume of phone calls i received. The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction i received when i was able to help a customer get their equipment back online so they could enjoy their internet service again.
good,"Spectrum as a whole is a great company to work for. I have on the other hand had some issues with my local leadership. Each individual location's hiring and advancement is under the purview of local leadership, which means that there can be a very homogeneous culture. I am not the only one who has noticed that up until VERY recently (and that still is only 2 people out of a staff of 20 supervisors), the entire management staff at my call center has consisted of entirely middle aged white men, while the staff of the call center who they are ostensibly hiring out of is MUCH more diverse than that. It just seems like the ones who are always ""the most qualified"" are the middle aged white men, largely with a similar (military) background to the upper management that is hiring them... "
good,Lots of great benefits for the company but since the merger they are still going through some growing pains. They need to compete with local more up to date call centers
good,Es una buena compañia pero no hay estabilidad. Y como se trabaja en la calle cuando llueve no se trabaja. Y en invierno el trabajo es muy minimo. Y a veces paran el trabajo
good,Arrive at my desk and log in. Receive and transfer call  n regards to cable and internet service. Giving excellent customer service and troubleshooting equipment. The workplace is very relaxed for the most part but still business minded. Job is very easy cant tell you a hard part about it. The most enjoyable part is when i resolve a customers issue.
good,"Just a typical call center. High call volume, irritated customers, long queues, and little to no real help from management. like all call centers, heavily micromanaged and forced to comply with metrics. my particular manager was awesome and pushed us to advance, but his manager and above were hands off."
good,I ran the IT Operations Support team which brought new challenges every day keeping work life exciting.  I really enjoyed the majority of the twelve years I was with Time Warner Cable then Charter Communications.
good,Spectrum takes care of it's employees and enables them to take care of their customers.  This is a great company to grow with and allows it's employees to paint on their own canvas as it pertains to their career progression.
good,"Provide support to multiple users on a daily basis such as passwords reset, backup for databases, Provide any IT tech support for users from desktop, laptop, and printers issues."
good,"I enjoyed my time there,learned a lot about cable and how to deal with customers.I was on the road 90 percent of the time,as i made deliveries all over the state."
good,Ok to work for if your not in the union cause they treat their union workers is horrible  ok shifts and benefits but horrible management  customer service is worst
good,"I worked for Time Warner Cable not Spectrum. It was a good job until the tech support job became billing, sales. You were graded and competed with the sales department, very company and not customer orientated."
good,You can make good money if you are good at talking to people and building rapport. Good Benefits and work schedule. Great Incenitive program and rewards.
good,"Great job, actual work itself is fair. More and more paperwork, less and less time to complete tasks, expectations getting further and further out of touch. Management has lost its connection with employees and morale is at an all time low. I work in a position that has had very little to no turn around for years, but as of late it has been constant. Poor management and lack of listening has led what was once a great position and company into a slippery slope of disaster."
good,"Since the merger, it seems things are always in flux. It can get very frustrating. I believe that the desire and goal is to provide excellent customer service, but in the mean time sometimes the concern for the people actually providing the customer service."
good,"good leadership"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Spectrum is a pretty decent company. I did not work with them too long when they switched over from Time Warner Cable. But the only problems I had was where they switch our shifts to make some mandatory one of the other shifts and that made a lot of people have to quit, resign, and  or find other places within the company to work because the schedule did not work for them."
good,"Company offers decent benefits."
good,"Handle Inbound contacts from potential customers and business partners via telephone in order to process order entry"
good,"Typically you work independently but fast paced and very cutthroat at times."
good,"Tier II phone support for Time Warner Cable Roadrunner Internet service, cable TV and phone customers. I also received calls on billing inquiries and accepted payments."
good,"Not much room for advancement, you need to master all the knowledge you can as there is no additional trainings to help you expand your brand. The pay is good."
good,"youre everywhere with not enough time to do certain jobs.however, in a sense, you're your own boss and it is satisfying work/ Meet new people and the pay is good starting out. There is lots of room for advancement. With the takeover there still are a couple of hurdles, but nothing major"
good,"The hardest part of the job was when others would not be doing their work, which would put more work on the ones who were. It gets really business sometimes, quite stressful for short periods of time. Overall good place to work."
good,The training environment was the best. I learned quickly and we had fun. When i started taking actual calls the system that we used for billing is called ICOMS. Thus system is very difficult and hard to learn. Ive been there for 4 months now and i still havent adjusted. this billing system and codes needs to be made more user friendly.
good,"If you are bilingual and like to help people with their internet connections and configurations  this is a great place to work."
good,"regular call center, managers are available when you need them. lots of communications when it comes to changes. Training is provided, co-workers are great t work with. Difficult part of the job is not being able to always satisfy the customer customer the way you want"
good,I love my role and would plan to be here for years to come if there were clear growth path.  We are currently missing several layers of leadership and its affecting our day to day work.
good,"Spectrum required focus and dedication each and every day. There was a high emphasis on achieving and exceeding sales quotas and as a Supervisor I spent most of my day helping my Account Executives to make a sale or two each day. I managed a team of 6 - 10 Account Executives at any time and I was responsible for coaching, mentoring and holding them accountable to do their jobs professionally and with the highest integrity. Supervisors were coached and mentored by their Sales Managers and Branch Managers were coached and mentored by their Directors. The Directors were coached and mentored by their VP's and so on. It was fast paced and required each person to be 100% committed each day. The Quality of the Sale was also important, along with the satisfaction of every customer."
good,Great product advantage through technology advancement and reliability. Great accelorators after exceeding thresh-hold. Great support through training and management
good,"I personal liked the job , it was fast paced ,I learned a lot while i was there .. job had its ups and down but I persevered . Want to find something where i can learn and grows as i go along ..."
good,"A typical day at work consist of creating routes for technicians, dispatching, trouble shooting, preventing late or missed appointment, random projects & creating help desk tickets."
good,If you are into telecommunications this is most definitely  the company for you. If you want to advance in the company you have many options within. The environment in the office is pleasantly competitive no where near cut-throat. Anything you achieve you are recognized.
good,TWC marketing campaign was very successful in marketing TWC a household name within the businesses in their respective territories. They had a successful rate of return on their marketing campaigns with building owners and property managers.
good,"The management team was instrumental in ensuring a smooth effective sales team. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,A typical work day is come in clock in Sinister computer wait for a call and come in as soon as the customer issue and follow the best route to resolve what's going on
good,I liked the position of installer that I had while working with great individuals. We had the support we needed and learned quite a few things working here.
good,"Management was not very responsive on my unit, very in and out. Staff for the most part worked well to help each other out. Not a fan of 12 hour shifts."
good,Is a good company to work for as a contractor but some of the contracting companies are crooked and don't report you taxes. Meaning you haveto deal with the IRS.
good,Wearing a face mask for eight hours was  not fun due to the lead dust that would accumulate in the air...Also having to shower before leaving for home Company rules. also had team players all around to help each other when a machine breaks down.
good,Great Beneifts and pay was really good if you put in the effort.  However changes to company policy and atmosphere really provided a stressful work enviroment.
good,Typical day at work was non stop phone calls. I learned patience and how to handle selling services strictly on the phone. Learned how to interview customer and offer service needed. Management was good. Very upbeat and supportive. Had little down time except for lunches and breaks. Hardest part of job was being tied the phone but was very rewarding when customer needs were met.
good,"Great place to work.  Paid by how much you put into your duties.  I would go back if I didn't have to go door-to-door. Great self-paced job.  Work when you want to, giving you the ability to have a great work/life balance."
good,"Incredible cable discount, but not much opportunity for advancement. For a cable company, they're not very fun. However, that greatly depends on the department you work for and Manager."
good,"Had a great culture and work environment when it was Time Warner Cable. Things changed rapidly when we were acquired by Charter.Privileges like Remote work eliminated, lower salary."
good,"Charter is a great place, I have worked there for 10+ years but since the merger with TWC things have changed which is influencing me to look for a new position."
good,"was not employed directly to Spectrum   worked as outside contractor   am leaving due to Spectrum taking my position in-house, and not offering opportunity to apply/keep my position w/them"
good,"Go out to assigned territory create your own leads, follow up on new customers and manage new installs on a daily basis. management was not in a fully staffed but worked hard to align themselves with the reps and get the job done."
good,"Good in the short term (2-4 years), lots of learning opportunities, prepares for next big job move.  Lots of corporate bureaucracy, making it difficult to spread your wings and really make a difference."
good,"There's some good points, and not so good points.  It mostly balances out.  Benefits are pretty good, but some improvement regarding the overall work environment wouldn't hurt."
good,Great benefits including free services. Can be stressful with all the call complaints about service and the company. Hours aren't typical and can be hard to get the hours you want. shifts based on seniority and performance
good,Our office was a part of the merge Spectrum just went threw the road has been extremely bumpy. With all the system changes they only allowed 1 day of training for that which was far beyond insufficient time for us to learn a completely brand new way of input customers orders. I enjoy my colleagues I think we have a lot of great people here. The management is okay it more so feels like they are just here for the paycheck. It been two months of consent overtime and what's rough is they make it mandatory for us to be here but sometimes the supervisors aren't here. Leadership is leading by example at least that's what I have always thought.
good,"competitive pay, not bad company. not any culture most men stick to themselves or in own groups. management is consistent. all around great company and stability if that's what your looking for."
good,"Good place to get your foot in the door.  The call center in Buffalo was not well kept, but the personal are nice. Good benefits and decent pay. The biggest curve, is dealing with customers."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Time Warner Cable was good to me,Spectrum-not so much. Productivity is their main focus and being on time to calls is very important too. I learned how to troubleshoot tv and internet effectively and the art of doing a neat and clean install. The toughest part about the job was climbing ladders in dangerous alleys, at night."
good,"Charter Communications... at the time"
good,"Day to day tasks involved driving to customers home , business or hotel to install or service video, Internet and/or telephone service."
good,a great day at work is being able to provide great customer satisfaction while being able to have a high rate customer end a call very satisfied and happy while meeting all goals and numbers of the companies expectations. Work is not hard or difficult its what you make of it and staying focused and being positive is the goal to a successful day and career path .
good,Nice pay but management is so corrupted that many people are there today and gone tomorrow. Needs to work on this one thing and this will be an awesome job.
good,While working as a Retention agent we only typically speak to angry customers who are upset about prices or problems with their service.  Who are calling in to cancel.  In order to save a customer you have to be willing to  listen to them and find a solution.  You cannot save them all but your commission pay is based on how many you save.
good,The culture at Spectrum Sportsnet overall is geared toward a positive work environment.  The team and the on air product are the two most important factors every day.
good,"Charter Communications has been one of my favorite organizations to represent in my career.  For 4 1/2 years the culture was focused on providing what our customers need in a manor that was fiscally and ethically responsible.  The product/service worked very well and the customer, management, and employees were all pleased."
good,"Time Warner Cable was generally a good place to work."
good,"Hooking up and servicing customers, customer education with all products and troubleshooting when necessary. Very enjoyable if you enjoy making customers happy with excellent service."
good,Great company to work for before the company merged with Time Warner and did away with the department I worked in. Started as a field technician and was promoted to quality assurance department.
good,"Great place to work.  A lot of changes forth coming due to changes.  Would recommend working there, however would advise to wait while all the changes have taken place."
good,"This job will prepare you for any position you'll ever want to take on. Being put in front of every single door in a neighborhood and seeing people in their everyday lives really gives you a grasp of how many different walks of life people are from. It's an eye opening and skin thickening experience, most certainly not for the weak minded. If you want a challenge, give it a whirl, the worst that happens is you get a couple doors slammed in your face and nobody buys your service, but if you don't try you never know."
good,I answer calls and assist customers with their account; whether it is billing or troubleshooting their services.  I go over their bill in detail and extensive troubleshooting.
good,"good pay with good benefits including death benefits. plenty of room  to transfer to other departments. Co workers all work together. Management is very fair, good career."
good,A typical day at work is full of excitement and gratification. As an Analyst for Charter Communications we are constantly performing matrix reports and tweaking the Commission process. This involves maintaining and administrating commissions for our SMB Sales Reps in Florida market. One of the most important things I have learned through my tenure here at Charter is that teamwork is a crucial part of success. One of the most challenging aspects of my career here at Charter is in regards to consistently updating and tweaking our comp plans in regards to our Sales Reps Commissions. We are now three (3) companies merging into one (1) .
good,"Good communication, excellent management.work as a team help each other always on time and schedule I always communicate to the management ."
good,"Answer billing calls and transfer calls to proper departments depending on the request of the customer. Process changes to services, adding or removing tv channel packages. Processing adjustments for various verifiable issues. The hardest part of the job is helping irate customers. Most customers are very nice and are enjoyable to speak with. It is a very clean and positive environment and have developed several long lasting friendships with other employees."
good,"since the merger and acquiring billions in debt, they are cutting commissions and other compensation.  Some times in business you have to ""do more with less""  They want you to do everything with almost nothing.   The company has gotten very very top heavy in recent months."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Interesting work place with different opportunities. Portrays a very positive work environment, and encourages employees to give back to the community."
good,Sat at a desk answering phone calls which had internet problems and help them fix the problem. Account information input and looking up deals or packages to better suit my customer needs.
good,"work on your own, out of a van, in all weather. you climb poles using a ladder, and install cable in houses, working in basements, attics, and crawlspaces."
good,"Was a good place to work. Worked mostly independently and did great at my job. No complaints with work for over ten years. Was able to work from home time to time, but changed drastically in a couple of years."
good,A typical work day consists of prioritizing initiatives and meet business goals. The work environment is progressive and they value a positive company culture.
good,"each day offers a fast pace environment with many different customer interactions.  To keep up with the demand you must be a quick thinker, show empathy and have a sense of urgency."
good,"good environment, just hard to move up or get  a decent  schedule. Holidays are now bid only and with little tenure its hard to get any time off."
good,"This place has taught me a great deal. More than any classroom could have even taught me. I have learned some very amazing skills in customer service, office administration, business, teamwork, computer knowledge, spreadsheets, finances, you name it. I do not regret one day at this job. It has truly prepared me for my future in any field that I choose."
good,Worked as a supervisor in two different departments.  overall a good place to work.  good benefits... long time ago though
good,Any day was filled with a variety of duties in which aspects of the job could range from simple billing to de-escalating customer situations. Nice variety of duties
good,"The compensation is wonderful, but the culture to thrive and succeed is thwarted by sink or swim attitude by management"
good,Help customers with payments and promote new and existing  products. Along with solving problems with cable and internet issue  in a timely manner
good,"Charter communications was a job i greatly enjoyed when working there. It could be very stressful at times, but as an overall job it was definitely my favorite job i have had in my life so far. You took calls all day when people called in and helped them fix their internet and phone issues. Hardest part of the job is talking to people who have no sense or respect for others. Most enjoyable part is not only the pay but the benefits, the pot lucks, the team challenges in the building (like decorating pods or making a team flag) and just the general people that worked there."
good,On the technical side of the house the climate is more relaxed. Everyone has a job to do and is allowed to do it.  Micro-managing does not exist. Ninety-five percent of the employees are great people who are willing to assist their fellow teammates to get the job done.
good,I handle escalated calls as a supervisor/lead. I handle Office of the president complaints as well as social media complaints. I have learn to work within a team environment rather then working alone. The hard part of the job is to fun a resolution that works well with the customer and adheres to the company policy.
good,answering and helping customers with their cable. i learned how to troubleshoot cable boxes. the hardest part of the job was to try to keep the customer after they have their mind made up that they do not want cable any more
good,I've only worked there for a few months but it's a really fun work environment. the managers are really nice and coworkers are all friendly
good,So many changes over the year has made the company increasingly difficult to stay positive about the future changes being positive
good,A typical day at Brighthouse Networks is very business oriented.  Everyday your goal is to resolved all the customer needs with ones call which is called one call resolution.  I've learned to have patience and treat the customer how I would like to be treated. The management team was very understanding and informative in the Auburndale office and the complete opposite in the Riverview office.  My co-workers were friendly and easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job is to mask your feelings on multiple irate calls.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Very difficult to get time off .......................... only if you're and agent supervisors can take off a week no problem . ...........................
good,"4 years in the field.  job is very stressful but satisfying. management is constantly taking new approaches, some work well other not so much."
good,This is a good company for those attending college and need some good work easy on the body. I advice anyone who is just starting a career after high school to work for a security company.
good,If I was in another position at the company it would have been a company for life. The only thing I can say is training is awesome there.  Everybody is extremely nice.  They make you feel like their call center is like no other. Once out in production it is no different than any other call center. That is when I no longer liked working there.  Not to mention I gained 30lbs in 6 months. The benefits are the best part about working at Bright House. If my personal happiness was not important I would have tried my hardest to stay. Bright House has the best benefits out of any other company I worked for.
good,"Your hired as a customer service representative but sales is a huge part of your job, if your're not into selling this is not the position for you"
good,Bad managment and no work life and work you like a dog ... I have nothing else to say about this company  hours are can range till midnight if you have kids they do not take doctors excues just a fyi
good,"TWC was a great company to work for. The positives were the stability of the job, the compensation, the benefits. The negatives were that the managers expected a lot and treated the customer reps as if were in high school again.."
good,"A typical day at TWC was taking about 60-100 calls per day.  I learned how to work under pressure and in difficult situations that sometimes required to go out of the scope of my job position.  The management was strict but fair at some points.  The one reason I decided to leave were due to the changing policies that were being implemented with the merger with Charter Communications.   These policies were making it difficult to help customers in certain situations that were not uncommon.   The hardest part of the job was having to explain to a customer, that because of a certain strict policy that was implemented, I was unable to help them.   The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to resolve an issue that had been on-going for a customer.  Being able to help someone in need is truly gratifying."
good,A great group of people that love helping the customers.I enjoy the opportunities to liaise between departments on the customers behalf.
good,Good pay and benefits. There is a lot of change. The company is currently merging. The schedules are from 5am to midnight.
good,"Typical day is helping customers with their cable and internet service. Taking phone orders and walk in customers as well. "
good,"No review necessary. Some very good people. It is sad to see a ""Corporate Culture"" be more important than the folks themselves that do all the hard work."
good,Its a good place for students to work if starting your employment career. Just dont stay there too long keep searching for better.
good,Time Warner Cable is a good place to work for people who are driven by money and prizes. It is not a job for everyone but the people who do the best have a very thick skin.
good,charter is a great place to work at. the work is easy and anyone can do it. i learn to be nice with customer from all of the place. co workers are there to help you do your job better. the hardest part of the job is you will get a lot of rude people and they take it out on you but you should not take it personal. the most enjoyable part of the job is solving the problem for the customers.
good,"On a typical work day I spend a lot of time answering questions in our group chat. We are also given various projects by management. We're often given projects in areas that we don't necessarily have any sway over which is frustrating. Recently the entire group of leads lost the sales commission making us the only group in the Customer  Service department to not make any commission off of sales. We were told this was to put us in line with the other call centers except the other call centers moved the sales game responsibilities to the supervisors since they still make sales commission and are thus more motivated. So we are regularly doing work we are not compensated in-line with our counterparts at different field location. That's the biggest issue with the company is the inconsistency with management. The company is great, the benefits are great and for the most part the job has the potential to be very interesting. We get to work with agents to make them better at their job, any time there is a change (which in telecommunications is often) we get to train the others in the department which is a fun challenge. This is a very relaxed atmosphere for a call center. We encourage the agents to be self-motivating and responsible for themselves and their calls. There are no handle time limits on calls and there is no scripting which makes it feel more caring for the customer and the agent. The biggest challenge is the senior management doesn't communicate well with each other. There 5 managers and 8 supervisors. If each are asked the same question one would get 13 different answers"
good,"Challenging  company but with a great growing opportunity.   High level editorial standards which has given the company the reputation it has in the industry."
good,"Great benefits to go along with low base pay. Commission is fair, just depends on how much effort you put into your work. I enjoy the position overall, but am looking for a better compensation package."
good,Charter was a great place to work with wonderful benefits. I worked with some of the most amazing people over the 15 years of service to them. I loved what I did and being able to take care of customers was what I took pride in. I planned on retiring with Charter; however plans changed and now I am excited to see where my new adventure leads me!
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,The health benefits are wonderful. Good location to shadow other departments if interested in moving to another position.
good,"It was a great company with wonderful benefits."
good,I loved working there in the beginning but it did get to be too much and is definitely not for all people.They had catered lunches Monday-Friday which is nice so you didn't always have to eat out of a machine .
good,"This is a good company to work for. Amazing health benefits, prizes for sales associates. Call center isn't my first choice, but TWC offers a lot of opportunities for moving up within the company."
good,great company to work for. vendors provided special incentives to employees through monthly contests to bolster their products. sorry to see them leave the Houston market in 2007. Comcast replaced Time Warner in 2007.
good,"Great company to work for but too many changes in salary and compensation plan so it is time to look elsewhere. Now looking for a new and challenging managerial/sales position, one which will make best use of my existing skills and experience and also further my personal and professional development."
good,assisted techs over the phone on repairs appointments for phone and internet also assisted phone and internet repair rep 1 with advance issues.
good,Fast paced call center environment. Not great ability to move up within the company but the commission is great. There are metrics that have to be followed and it can be hard but if the managers can give better direction they can all be met.
good,"Structured environment, time sensitive position, fast paced environment, ability to adapt to various situations quickly,ability to multi task"
good,Working for Time Warner Cable overall is good. Our back end processes could use some help to improve customer satisfaction.
good,"It was a a good company to work for, direct leadership was wonderful, VP level and a above was not. Compensation was also very good."
good,"I typically start my day with a good amount of billing related calls. After my lunch hour the calls continue with billing related issues and payments, By 5pm the majority of calls are based around trouble shooting TV issues. Overall the environment is well rounded with intelligent help available when needed. "
good,laid back area laid back as long as you complete your work you are good to go if you mess around you will get fired. but overall a great place to work
good,Great place to work. It's a typical customer service job. People got big balls when they talk to you over the phone. Enjoyed the benefits.
good,Overall Time Warner Cable is a great company to work for. If you plan to go anywhere in the company you need to hit the ground running or know someone. There are a lot of opportunities to advance but there is also a lot of competition because it is such a large company. (They tend to promote from within too which is great)
good,A Good Job to have I learned a lot at this company. A day at work was very physically demanding with many deadlines to meet. It required good planning because you will be alone and the work orders must be completed by end of shift.
good,I started here in 2010 and built myself around a need. This company did not have a functioning Incident Management Process. My success here catapulted me into Analyst and Supervisor roles and eventually into a Manager of people role.
good,"Managed a team of 15-19 representatives in a call center environment.  Everyday was a new challenge and learning the different personalities really enforced the need to treat and coach each team member as an individual.  "
good,"An ordinary day would consist with a variety of technical troubleshooting, billing questions, and sales."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"It's very hard to keep up with the constant changes in this industry.  The hardest part is navigating through all the screens an know what it all means while your being cursed out over an outage that you have no idea why it happened. Because we live in the ""I wanted it now"" world people today have lost their minds. Supervisors have your back and are very supportive here. They know the public is hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving for the day and Green Time!!!  When it's slow which is rare, you can send an email to leave early but it's first come first serve.  It is what you make here. You can make a lot of money here as well. They have many incentives. Not easy on a daily basis that's where the supervisors come in.  They are like your own personal PR person rooting for you and guiding you. They want you to strive! If you do they do! OH yeah I forgot, shift bids, you will be working a shift you like for 6 months then whamo! You have to try to bid for it again or it might not be there all together! Now you have to rearrange your whole life again!  Benefits are great. Great coaching skills they give you with regards to customer services that can take one far either in or out of this company. Treat workers with respect, fun atmosphere, challenging. If you can handle constant change and the screaming public and trying to sell at the same time then get a therapist and sign up!!"
good,"Typical work day consists of; writing copy, producing, following up on pre-logs, post logs, cold calling, existing client follow up, impromptu meetings, education on line and then in person, proposals, closing of existing proposals, entertainment with new and existing clients and much more..."
good,"I had a meeting every day at 10:00. We would get everything together and then just go out and make sales. Door to door just wasn't for me. I also received little training about most of the products, so i wasn't confident in my sales."
good,"A typical day would include the following:"
good,"benefits are great, but supervising staff is not that great."
good,Working here was a learning experience. Co-workers and supervisors were great and really motivating. Strong sense of diversity. Very busy incoming call center from all kinds of people with different backgrounds and level of knowledge of cable systems. Rather rewarding to succeed walking a customer through a video issue.
good,It's been a good job so far but the micro managing has taken it's toll on alot of employees and it shows with low morale and alot of techs that were there for a long time deciding to part ways with the company.
good,"A typical day at work is answering calls from low brow customers all day over basic cable phone and internet issues. I learned nothing of value from the job because I had extensive call center history with a variety of cable and internet companies. "
good,The company as a whole is a wonderful place. There is still room for improvement with some of the management.
good,"TWC offers a nice working environment that makes you feel like less of a number than most large companies.  You have the opportunity to learn all aspects of the cable industry, from management to the technology that drives it.  The lower management cares for the people's success and drives them to it. As you look farther from your current position, though, decisions seem to be made in a shotgun approach instead of taking each department's needs into consideration."
good,Really enjoyed working there when it was Insight Communications. They really cared about their employees.
good,"Charter Communications is a very large company, with that being said the individual is often seen as the number and not the employee. While my pay and commissions were great it could not outweigh the corporate decisions that were made conceding my job across the company. My job was to sit in an office and convince people to not switch providers, ultimately I was not told that this position was going to be experimental and because of that my job was sent back to a call center."
good,"I am the Senior Agent and second in command Team Leader so my day depends on which duties my Operations Manager would like me to fulfil. "
good,Love working with all the networks and getting to see your ideas get executed.
good,"Nothing was ever typical in the office.  Since I was always on call, I worked any and every shift possible. Morning shift consisted of a lot of troubleshooting of various items (i.e. Cable box functionality for customers, Video On Demand assets failing). Afternoon shift consisted of providing additional coverage for the morning team, troubleshooting new issues and preparing for overnight maintenance work.  Overnight shifts was mostly maintenance work to ensure system stability or to implement new software in the system. No matter what, we all had to run systems/server sanity check to make sure all servers/devices were functioning properly."
good,"I love TWC. It's tough to battle customer perceptions of poor service. Part of it is TWC's fault, but part of it is simply the industry."
good,"Call center work"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Compensation and benefits plan are great. You do have to deal with a lot of upset customers but there are also plenty of customers who appreciate the help. Management and policies do change regularly but thats expected with a large company.
good,Taking care of the subscribers problems with their cable or internet connection was a daily routine.Also upgrading their services or offering promos in order to give them a better rate was something that was plus since you actually noticed their smile over the phone.Overall I enjoyed my time there management was nice and so where my co-workers.the hardest part was the weird schedule.
good,Taking a high volume of calls on a daily basis. Managers are always willing to help. Co workers are very friendly.
good,It was a great place to work aside from a few mishaps with management and trainers.
good,i loved it they give you a van to drive cool people and bosses the company went under  thats why i have no work there
good,"You are pretty much on your own after 30 days.  The cable industry is a bipolar business for sure.  However, this jobs success is directly related to your tenacity, attention to detail, and your commitment to work hard..."
good,I always looked forward to coming to work. Every day presented new challenges and opportunity for growth. Co-workers worked together to accomplish the mission.
good,this is a great company with great benefits the workers are very dependable and the inmates are respectful
good,"I worked for a third party franchise for Verizon it was wireless communications, a typical day would be just helping and selling phones all day. I learned a lot different computer skills at this job. I only had a fun coworkers they were alright to be around, it could of been a lot more uplifting at work. We could of found ways to make it fun."
good,"Arrive to work, sign in, take opening inventory, serve and greet customers, prepare and serve food, cash out customers, ending the night taking inventory."
good,"Good Environment to work, fun and work is respected. good work is recognized, ideas are heard and open to change processes."
good,Great pay but wasn't a permanent position. I gained more skills for my future endeavors.
good,I people I had to work with was very interesting. I did like the over time and the prizes i won.
good,Had a long career with the industry of cable television.  Learned a great deal about the industry.  Formed great frienships with my co-workers.
good,"Time Warner was a great company until the bought out another company, and then things started going down hill."
good,"1st 10 yrs did door to door sales and worked closely with rental agents and apartment managers."
good,In home and commercial repairs.a lot of customer contact. New opportunities to learn more about internet and phone. New management every week. Co Workers would help whenever needed. The hardest part of the job was the lack of contact with co workers.The best part of the job was customer contact.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Good benefits, ok pay. LOVE my co-workers. Worked here for 5 yrs, much better now that I have moved departments. Call center has high turnover."
good,No comments at this time. I work 7 days a week at this position
good,"Substantial amount of change occuring, centralization, and movement; unfortunately leading to unstable work environment and low morale"
good,"A company that thrives on numbers. No core value, possibly could spend a little more time on TLC for there clients"
good,answered phones customer service environment sales and collections all day long.
good,I have learned alot working at Charter. I have been assigned mutiple projects to advance my knowledge of management and commnications. It is consistently changing to stay in competitive with competitors.
good,TWC is a great company to work for. Very technical and. fast paced. Great place to work if you love the technical world and wish to work with cutting edge equipment and software.
good,"Sitting at a desk, taking none stop incoming calls for tv, internet and land line sales."
good,"Installs and provides customer education on all Bright House Networks issued equipment and services, HDTV configuration, Surround Sound Systems, Gaming Systems, Wireless Networks and connection of personal computers and devices utilizing the internet to connect to BHN services."
good,"sit at your desk all day, 2 15 min breaks, 1 hour lunch..."
good,Very fast paced & busy environment that had interaction with all facets of the company
good,"I liked it because i worked my own hours. I was able to work with public on a house to house business to business daily. I learned how to deal with a variety of different people. Managment was good in 1986 when I started at Centel Cable. But as the business grew being sold at the last Time Warner AOL, it was no longer a family based workplace. The hardest part of the job was going into homes where the people were less fortunate, it could be sad. The most enjoyable part of the job was when all the sales reps got together in one certain area and we had a contest. By that we knew we werent alone."
good,"I would go into work, start supper, then pick up the ladies from day program. Even though the ladies liked a stricked regimen, no two days were ever the same. The management was great, they seemed to know what they were doing. My co-workers were part of the hardest part of my job. I was young and just starting out I needed to learn that each culture did things differently. They cooked differently, they spoke differently, what may sound one way to you, may not be how they meant it at all. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ladies. They made me want to come to work every day."
good,Interacted with residents on a daily basis. Ability to set my own schedule. Worked with minimal or no supervision.
good,Time Warner is a good company on a daily basis there are many things I enjoy like profitability of the company and some of the benefits of the company. The major drawback is the middle management of the company being stuck in the 9 to 5 or punch the time clock mentality.
good,"What I liked best was all the training they provided you with on all the systems and procedures. If there was any problem with a technician, your supervisor was always right there to help out. I loved this job and it's too bad I had to be in a no fault car accident and lose this job, since I hadn't been there long enough to qualify for FMLA."
good,Working for TimeWarner Cable has been very enjoyable. My co-workers are great and the atmosphere at work is excellent. TimeWarner Cable offers great benefits and are constantly keeping their employees trained to the up-to-date technologies pertaining to their job.
good,A typical day at work for me consist of pulling reports for an internal database and working them from an excel format as well as multitasking between working escalations and task will while working in a timely manor in addition to preforming at a high level.
good,"Answered incoming phone calls from customers looking for quotes, to establish service, customer service issues, etc. Management is always supportive, although assistance can be hard to come by. Co-workers are always friendly, polite, and make the day more tolerable."
good,Training department was excellent in their instruction.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Great place to work far as for job security. Just wanted to move closer to home
good,"Is meeting a diversity of people some a challenge and others easy to get along with  at the end of the day a since of accomplishment. "
good,"Establishing and maintaining a professional positive relationship"
good,"Decent place to work, but is full of cliche corporate BS.  Great training and advancement opportunities.  Usually promote from within and will train people for said promotion."
good,"Customer service was great, learning new things about technology was also fun , wanted to become trainer but was not flexible enough with my doctors schedule"
good,Co-Workers where great. Supervisors where excellent. The calls are back to back and become overwhelming only negative thing I can say. And if you have smaller kids make sure you have a plan if they get sick because upper management don’t care if you miss work even with doctors notes.
good,Laid Back Enviroment and Very Professional...Everyone is Always Happy..Dress Up In Business Atire Everyday with Great work benefits that are offered...
good,Not a bad place to work. Was better when it was Brighthouse. Very good job security since they're always hiring. Promotion opportunities aren't bad. Pay and benefits are good as well
good,"Very fluid environment.  Typical day is analyzing, adjusting resources and making decisions to meet our customers needs.  The hardest part of my job is balancing available resources with the workload.  The thing I enjoy most is the confidence management has in me to make decisions and execute our plan.  The trust they have in me to lead my team and achieve our goals on our own."
good,You have to be motivated by money in order to be able to stick to this sales position. The money at Spectrum is GREAT but the job itself is not for everybody. You will not know how you feel about this job until you actually do it.
good,The job is stressful and it is demanding as far as call center work goes but the compensation is very much worth it. you get compensated for the effort you put in. Management is one of the most helpful and approachable that i have had the experience of working with.
good,Typical day consists of helping current customers with technical issues regarding hsd or phone. Training is thorough and provides you with the knowledge to succeed within the position. Managers are very helpful but often have favorites leading to unfair treatment in some instances.
good,"Charter Spectrum is a good company to join for someone who has a lot of free time and willing to work a lot of overtime. They have good benefits, and a lot of bonuses. I wouldn’t recommend it if you have a family and want to spend it with them most of the time. It is long hours and a lot of lifting and physical work which can be very vigorous on your body."
good,"Has a multitude of benefits for your family and retirement needs. Work culture could be better, but overall it's good. HR can be moderately difficult to engage."
good,"Spectrum isn't a bad place to work IF you want to be there. There's 8 weeks of paid training. The benefits start right away. You even get a bonus until your commission starts. They value your feedback. Overtime is pretty much unlimited. It's a positive place to be. My issue is feeling like a chump at a call center. I have dreams & the majority of my time is spent selling cable. The hours suck when you have kids at home. And, the mandatory hour or hour & a half of overtime that sometimes lasts for over a month just makes you realize how much time you're sacrificing to make someone's dream come true. So, don't get stuck. Use the great commission & overtime to pursue your passions. Keep your eye on the prize. Take the great coaching with your supervisor & apply it where you're going."
good,"Nice place to work, a lot of room for advancements and improvement on your skill.  Enjoyable work culture.  This is a company that is always will to help the community."
good,"I've been in the industry for almost 2 decades now, and I have seen the evolution of it go both up and down.  When we became Spectrum, I felt as though good things were coming, but now have seen that I was wrong.  The work is getting overwhelming, and the salary be get paid for what we do us lower than what it should be.  Especially since we are the ""face of the company,""  I feel that we deserve better than what we are getting.  People take us for granted, and it really isn't fair to us."
good,"Helpful co-workers. Some supervisors better than others.Some days can be tedious, others stressful.  Not for everyone, but not the worst place to work"
good,"Great company to work for, with great benefits. Depends on what position and who your supervisor is, in my personal experience it was the reason I decided to leave, along with several others. That manager was removed shortly after, and I have heard great things about the replacement the company selected for that position."
good,The everyday work at this place of employment was much like any average call center.  The benefits that come with the job are excellent.  Their health coverage was the best I've ever had with an employer.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Environment was great , management team was very helpful. In the down side changes where made without any information on dates. programs changed from one day to another. on the positive side good benefits,, sick time, holiday pay, personal day."
good,"Didn't work for Spectrum but Time Warner. If it's still the same management and supervisors as before it must still be a bad place to work , as they were of no account."
good,"I did well working there not a lot of activity and had down time for the hours i worked, although not to leanyent on life balance but overall was not to bad had paid training and help whwn needed on the floor"
good,"Spectrum/Charter Communications Core-Backbone Operations Support Center is a 24/7 break/fix organization supporting routers, switches, Optical Transport systems, firewalls and load balancer solutions from a wide variety of vendors.  These devices are used to transport Video On Demand, Broadcast, VOIP and High Speed Internet across 42 states from Hawaii to Maine."
good,Management is great the work load does not fit the pay if I could get payed more to stay I would love to stay with the company that has shown me so much
good,"best thing about the job.. we got free internet, tv and phone. calls are back to back . schedule adherence is a must . its easy to when rewards. u may get burnt out on the phones"
good,"You take calls left and right all night, they are open all hours of the day and there’s little support for when you are on the phones. It’s good pay but it’s very stressful."
good,Very high paced work environment. Great pay and benefits. Requires a lot of training and constantly changing company protocols. 90% is done on the phone and computer; requires high level of these skills.
good,Everyone was very welcoming and helpful which made it easy to ask for help when needed.
good,"cool place, busy, stressful, constantly changing, competitive and room for growth if able to compete with other agents going for similar positions at the company"
good,I have worked for Spectrum for a couple of years. Spectrum is good overall. The pay is ok. Of course I wish it were more. Could they ever pay me too much? I don't think so. My complimentary services are the bomb. They always work for me. Not to mention my family. Most of the time I feel sorry for Spectrum. It's a decent company that has problems finding decent people to employ.
good,"Success is achieved by having a complete work system of Prospecting, Appointments, and Follow-ups.  Tracking daily transactions is also an important element of my sales system."
good,I enjoyed my job it was stressful because you wanted to make a lot of money wit bonus so that drove me to succeed but I enjoyed my co workers and management it’s was good
good,"High volume inbound call center"
good,Good base and comp plan but they will over hire to the point that it is all but impossible to hit sales goals consistently.  Management will focus efforts on those they want and neglect others that need help until it's to late.
good,Co-workers were great.  I was able to learn a lot in my 10 year with Time Warner now Spectrum.  I worked with a lot an good people that were always will to share their knowedge.
good,"This is a typical call center environment, always busy. The company gives good benefits including free cable/phone/internet, good medical benefits and 401k."
good,"good pay, great training. Always outside but that's what it is. Not for someone that is lazy or that just wants to skate by doing minimum work. Great opportunity to advance within."
good,"The typical day consisted of speaking with 30-50 customers, over half of who were well beyond irate. If you can handle being yelled at for 8+ hours a day, this is a fantastic job. But the fact that you are being judged on someone else's work, is a little asinine. If the tech doesn't do their work efficiently, and the customer has to call back, you get dinged against. It's frustrating, but if you keep your head up, their $15 an hour pay, and amazing health benefits, totally make it worth working there."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Decent company. Stressful due to high call volume. Good benefits if you're single. Good 401k. Some managers and supervisors are good some aren't.High turnover.
good,Great place to work with great benefits. High expectations of employees and incredibly quick pace for changes. Day to day expectations to meet dozens of stats can be stressful. Be flexible to the changes and understand you will be asked to focus on many tasks at the same time.
good,"Overall the company has some growing to do. their training programs are only supplementary to the weekly emails so they only serve to take people off of calls. Non customer facing roles (call center for me) are expected to dress business casual. The communication between departments is hindered by the idea of ""staying within your lane"" so no 2 departments will have the same answer to a question which leads to miscommunication between the company and clients. the merging of Time Warner, Bright house, and charter leads to further communication issues. there is no set standard of services,tools, back-end infrastructure between the 3 companies after 3 years. maybe when things are cleaned up a bit."
good,"secure employment, good benifits i am a lineman, i climb poles and work on the system. i work on the cable, internet, and phone services. work arount power lines"
good,"A great place to work for a reliable a job day, pay, benefits, and hours. Advancement is possible, but slim. Raises occur on an annual basis based upon  your performance."
good,It was very important to be a quick learner in order to maintain a position at BrightHouse Networks. Supervisors were always eager to assist and help with any issue you encounter.
good,The work shifts varied.  I learned the skills of working with people from all walks of life. Management style changed as the supervisor's changed every six months.  The work place culture was fun at times. the hardest part of the job became keeping up with their quotas and the most enjoyable was working with the people.
good,"Good company where you can move to different positions, if you are willing to put in the work and wait for your opportunity."
good,I enjoy working working for spectrum and appreciate them providing for my family. I like the free services: internet/ phone/ cable tv. If I didnt work there I would be paying over $300
good,I would not recommend working on salary or commission. Hard to make commission door to door and you will work more than fourty hours a week on salary. Other that that is was good.
good,"The company as a whole is not a bad place to work. The benefits are great and they offer an ample amount of days off consisting of personal, sick, vacation, and holidays (be prepared to work some holidays). No occurrence system! Good people to know and the support from the leads was great! I liked my supervisor too. "
good,"The pay has gotten a lot better since I left here, but it is all dependent on if you are willing to take classes and pass the tests for that raise. Long days with lots of overtime, no guaranteed set time that you will be off. Must be able to work weekends."
good,I have been with TWC since I was 18 and worked my way up the ladder by being a good team player and staying on top of learning new updates. Its a stable work place with room to grow if you put in your due diligence
good,"My peers where great to work with, also the management team were great. They kept you informed with new technology coming out and how to de escalate a hostile conversation."
good,I worked there for many years. They take job very seriously. Not very flexible for school employees. Very stressful and always changing. Strict rules apply.
good,I like that they give you the option to leave paid for the day as long as you do your job and get 2 sales it definitely gives you incentive to do well and always work hard
good,"every morning as you walk in coffee was ready and you got to great your fellow team mate with a morning huddle. everyone was friendly but the hard part was the scripts we had to fallow, I would sell but supervisor would always say I left some of the parts out or I didn't say enough, but I loved my job I just got injured and had to go on workmen's comp. then my position was cancelled so was not able to go back"
good,"It's a great company to work for, with locations throughout the United States. Spectrum Reach is a great division to work for. They focus on providing an easy-going atmosphere conducive to career growth."
good,"8-9 hour days"
good,The culture depends on the location you work at. I started in Cincinnati where it was 100% about the sale. I now work in Hi where sales is only about 60% of the sale and the rest is administrative.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,It is a good place to work.  The department that I worked in had a manager that mico managed his entire team which made the job experience not a good one.  They discourage working from home even when it is an option.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with spectrum, since leaving there I have helped three people get hired with them as inbound sales representatives...the commission was good, culture was fun, my only complaint is that I have not been able to get rehired!! I did not think I left on bad terms, or that I would be blacklisted but after applying 3 different times and not getting rehired it seems safe to say i'm not getting another chance unfortunately...if you enjoy sales, enjoy talking to people and work well in a fast paced environment you will do great...the opportunity is definitely there to make money...I have personally seen and heard of people getting rehired after doing shady things to get fired, so I was def disappointed that im not getting rehired when I only left because my unpaid fmla 12 weeks ran out and I wasn't able to return to work in the allotted time"
good,"Working at Charter was a great experience, however you never knew what was coming next.  Management liked to be very secretive with what they did.  You just never knew if you were safe or not ."
good,The pay is good it matches the environment like in many call centers there is a league of  untold injustices. Use the employment here to go to school get out when your done
good,"Supervisors and leads are great, but their is an obsession with numbers.  Thankfully, most supervisors are reasonable (this may not apply to every Supervisor/Lead), and with their help, I have been able to have decent numbers.  "
good,Company was not staffed correctly for the service area that was covered and work load was always more than could be completed in a standard work day. Job required long hours without much compensation.
good,"Great Starting point for sales. It's a tough grind, but doing door to door sales gave me a solid foundation of new acquisitions. This is a tough position since you are out in the elements every single day."
good,"Charter Communications was a job I probably learned the most from, because after 2 weeks of training you're all on your own. Days would get hard and you would need help but they provide you with a cell to make a call anytime you do. Managers there had no problem coming to wherever location you were to assist. The hardest part to me was trying to stay focused working out in the rain and such.."
good,I have no comments. Looking for a Job now. It's a good place to work. salary could have been higher for all that we put up with. They could have placed us somewhere else or even given us a notice of closing down.
good,Company is focused on working and promoting from within. Skill sets are developed to help their employees to succeed from bottom to the top. I enjoyed my time with the company when I was there.
good,"You have to have thick skin, and great customer service skills. Charter is a great company to work for, if you can get along with your supervisor. I would recommend someone to work there."
good,"Spectrum has a wonderful benefits package.  The company takes care of its employees.  I loved working for the company.  However, I was felt that they did not want female field techs.  I applied for the job 5 times, I was working as an outside Auditor for the lines so, I already lifted the large ladders and worked with the Ingress equipment.  I love working outside and I drove 2 hours a day for months.  I volunteered to go on special assignments outside of the state and was praised for my work ethic.  I feel like the company was skittish about being responsible for a woman going into homes.  I wish it wasn't so, but that is what it is.  I and 16 others were eventually let go because the company decided to discontinue the Audit program."
good,Working at Time Warner was great! When the buy out took place the option to stay in town was not encouraged but rather relocating to Colorado was the only option. I was not able to re-locate due to family reasons and therefore had to find employment else where.
good,"Overall average place to work. The pay was competitive, however the procedure was awful.A typical day at work was always challenging as getting things installed and scheduled."
good,"A typical day would be heads down programming on new programs or enhancements to existing.. Also,data reports requested by management for migration purposes or cleanup. Results normally in excel format.,  All projects had an estimated time but in cases where that time was put in jeopardy where job priorities changed management was very good with working with you and re-adjusting times."
good,"very stressful dealing with the public but this is not a reflection of the company as this would be the case with any company that you work with the public, great benefits and pay"
good,Honestly spectrum is a great job with great pay. Like all jobs the management is shaky sometimes. They do require a lot of you but its worth it all in the end.
good,The call center atmosphere was very fast paced. You need to know how to deal with all different customers. Troubleshooting many different issues and explaining things so all different types of people can understand.
good,There were many departments handling any given order and they were so segmented that it led to a great deal of duplicated work as each department received different instructions and reported up through different chains of command. It was infuriating to someone who wants to do their job correctly and efficiently
good,"The department in which I worked for, Strategic Accounts, was very relaxing, no micromanaging and there was always work to be done. The work day went by pretty fast because there was never really down time nor was it work that was impossible to get done. You had a daily goal and if you were at your desk, doing what you were suppose to be doing then there was no reason why you shouldn't have met your goal and or exceed it. My manager was great and very understanding but far from a pushover. She always recognized exceptional work and if there was a day that she couldn't be there for whatever reason you were always able to reach her. Hardest part of the job was having to clean up behind people's mistakes because it seemed to always be the same people making the same mistakes. Maintaining your frustration was the hardest part but easy at the same time if it makes sense. A typical day at work is getting to work a few mins early, logging in, checking emails and processing Contract Buyouts. Towards the end of my contract I was moved to escalations and handling all Better Business Bureau issues."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,During my time there ive meat and made some really good people and friends. The people are very friendly and helpful. Its a great work place environment. It also has alot fo room to grow career wise.
good,If you like competition you’re at the right place can be stressful if you let it but the co workers don’t help it either and you’re stuck at your shift once hired for 6 months
good,"which is good if you are a account executive, but if not that culture and pressure pours into all departments.  good team environment and benefits.  just all depends on your department of work"
good,"The Call Center was a fast paced environment and change was always happening as fast as technology. One moment I could be on a Supervisor call.  the next I could be upselling a product or service, the next I could be assisting with training the new hires.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to diffuse situations and come up with a creative resolution in a fast paced environment."
good,"No comments at this time. Self starter motivator, self employed."
good,"Went through many job responsibility changes at Charter, including handling training coordinator position as well has HR Coordinator position for 2 years."
good,"Unlimited commision. Mileage reambersment for miles tracked to your turf. They provide the necessary tools to do your job. Tablet, phone, and uniform are issued."
good,Great pay . Had to leave ronso not being able to change my shift . I had to wait till a shift bus came in place which could happen once every 3 months . The call center on became stressful once the callers policies were changing without notice and they were calling in agree with the reps . Training I feel DIDNT cover or prepare us properly enough .
good,"A typical day at Spectrum for me is, coming in to work checking on my team members making sure they are logged in ready to go. next I would check my calendar and email for my daily activities. next I will review my attendance (coach instances) followed by metrics. Coaching are conducted weekly where calls are observed to determine behaviors necessary to assist better the customer experience."
good,"Talk about the skills you have that you believe you will utilize most in the position."
good,Spectrum is a  job where to get out of what you put into it. The harder of a worker you are the better your going to be. They are very fair and it is a great work environment.
good,fast paced and steady ..highly stressful at times. very little to no training on new  upcoming products or services being offered. and very little to no team structure..
good,"Assisted customers with technical support for DVR's, remotes, boxes, roku equipment, billing questions. Was busy at certain times of the evening shift and weekends. Some Holidays were mandatory."
good,After working over 10 years for Comcast Business and Residential in Retention and Sales.Spectrum position gave me the opportunity to learn more about dealing with Consumers directly in outside sales.
good,Loved my last job with TWC/Spectrum.  The unfortunate part is that once we merged the changes began.  My position paid well & the discounted services were nice.
good,"It was an easy place to work. Lots of friends,  but if HR decides they don't like you, watch out! There is a lacking in certain management areas, lot's of people wandering around with no direction."
good,"A typical day at work, Spectrum provided good ethnic skills, team meeting and keeping up with customer point or view. "
good,Fast paced environment needed to keep pace with competitive threats. Need to be on your game to deliver results. Company was customer focused to ensure customers stayed. Getting customers back is not easy
good,I left because I was promised opportunity in the oil fields and have regretted it every since. Learned a lot and had some great managers and some just OK ones. Training provided was top notch.
good,"Love The Company But The Culture And Leadership Has To Improve....There Are Plenty Of Bright Spots Including Comp Plans And PTO, However Leadership Is A Chain Process And To Many Times Reps Aren't Given The Respect They Deserve!!!"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"nice place to work just needs new management, people are nice in stores though. everything is about sales that is all they care about. there is no job security at all"
good,"Brighthouse was such a better company to work for... Spectrum destroyed moral within workers.  I wouldn't recommend working here unless you like to be stuck in the same job. More work less pay, too many changes and everyone wants to be a boss."
good,"Compensation is lower than market.  Benefits are good.  Supervisory experience is ok, but if you don't hang out and gossip with them, you are last on the list for any good assignments, time off the phone, etc. Disappointing that background and experience don't overcome the fact that I wasn't in the clique..."
good,speak to customers back to back calls. Assist customers with questions that they would have about their account. As well sale customers on new promos and benefits
good,Working for spectrum was laid back but when it comes to sales very competitive managers were there only to support sales and pushed up selling and to get more customers
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my client groups. They are a joy to work with. I am no longer sure of the culture of this company since the merger with Time Warner.
good,"It's a high pace high call volume, providing excellent customer service to irate customers and finding packages that will better suit customers' needs and budgets. The best part of working for Spectrum is finding solutions to customers' issues/concerns."
good,"good experience working there. friendly environment. great trainers and supervisors. Caring company. took inbound calls, helped customer troubleshoot there cable equipment."
good,Great compensation packages. Good environment. Wonderful management. Not much opportunity to switch roles. Schedules were not very flexible and based on seniority alone not work life balance needs
good,"Really nice people, not so cool corporate culture but I guess thats normal. The volume of calls coming in will probably get better when they hire enough people through."
good,"Direct managers are great."
good,Enjoyed the fast pace culture. Would not have left had I received career advancement. Overall great place to work when I was there the culture is changing because of management.
good,"Always moving,never stops. 10-12 jobs a day in your route. Lots of drive time miles and miles and miles of driving. Long nights,early mornings of nothing but work."
good,"Great company, but management was cut throat and did not keep promises and could not be trusted.  Also, they did not know the EEOC rules and regulations."
good,"-A typical day is pulling and completing assigned reports, taking calls assisting other sales departments. "
good,Overall a good company to work for with good benefits and work life balance. Job advancement is something the company needs to work on. The company is top heavy with too many resources at management level and not enough resources assigned for the people who actually do the work.
good,"The local management is easily the most supportive I have ever worked with- more than willing to help when things are going south, and they do what they can to keep morale up. You also get an abundance of time off, the free service is an enormous plus if you can get Spectrum service, or already have it, and the pay is high, with management laying out plans to make it higher."
good,schedule is a 4 by 10 work 4 days out of the week but long hours. Each shift is 10 hours only they're not if another employee is falling behind your left picking up the slack.
good,"Overall company is good place to work for, When changes are implemented they are slow tedious and burdensome.  Considering where this company is now compared to Time Warner Cable it is a top company too work for"
good,It only becomes difficult when customers become extremely upset about the quality of service they have received and you need upper level assistance to resolve the issue and the actual steps that need to be taken are foregone to avoid getting involved on the call. This puts the customer and the service rep in compromised positions with the biggest disadvantage going to the paying customer.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,A typical worked  was taking forty plus customer calls about Internet and phone issues.I learned that you can never have too much patience  when working with customers.  I found ways to explain complex issues and terms in plain English.I learned that  you need to calm person down before resolving the issue; this way he or she learns how to resolve the issue in the future. Spectrum also helped me fine tune the art of placing the customer's interest first.
good,Learned Basic Technical Support Skills. Required to Multi-Task while talking on phone with customers and/or other departments at same time to resolve issues or provide answers to questions.
good,"Good place to work like nteracting with customers is good  ,bad weather and system outrages bad, and saving people money when possible is rewarding overall a fast growing company a leader in the communication industry"
good,"I started working with them when they were Time Warner Cable, they got bought out. The new management brought in a lot of problems, trivial rules, and laid off many good people."
good,I enjoyed working for Spectrum.  The benefits were great!  We had a diverse environment.  Work Life balance was understandable. Had to leave due to layoff.
good,Start off from home. have your own vehicle from the company. I've learned how to stay safe. Coworkers are always willing to teach for the most part.Hardest part of the job was working in the winter. For some people was to climb up the latter.
good,"I had a part-time position while I was enrolled in college and the time was perfect and I was able to do my homework in the cafeteria before I punched in. I learned a lot about price matching, bundling services as well as scheduling and booking service appointments. The workplace was casual dress with prize incentives. The hardest part of the job was up-selling the services and trying to convince a customer that they needed something that they actually didn't just to arrive at your quota for the month. The best part was meeting and working with a lot of different information fa as getting the job done and we never worked longer than 8:30 pm on weekdays and no longer than 2:00 pm on Saturdays."
good,"offers lots of benefits. good coworkers and management. upper management does try to show appreciation for the work done and for the workers with dress down days, activities, free lunches. can be very stressful mentally. is a fast paced job."
good,At spectrum I installed coax cable in houses. Ranging from cable boxes to home phones to the internet modems in homes. That involves driving a company truck and using layers to climb poles outside
good,It was great until I got laid off. Coordinated change tickets most of the day. A lot of teamwork and communication between departments. Loved my manager. Flexible schedule.
good,Spectrum (formerly Time Warner Cable) was a good place to work. Good management staff and a professional atmosphere. They look out for their employees.
good,the job at spectrum was very easy. the only problem i had was it was very hard to get a morning shift and they did shifty bids so if you wasn't preforming well then you didn't get a chance to change your shift.
good,"Assist with current accounts, billing, & more. Love the engagement with others & customer. Great benefits. But some things would have been different in management."
good,"Customer call response, Data entry, customer solutions, Great management, good pay, lively work environment, opportunity to excel, fast paced environment"
good,Typical work day consists of anywhere from 40 - 50 hours per week.  The company is in the process of relocating several job roles from St. Louis and other states to a new building being built in Stamford CT by 2018
good,Working for Spectrum Business was a great experience. I loved how our supervisors and team were able to work together smoothly efficiently to help customers.
good,workplace culture is awesome. all co-workers there get along well and work well together.  trainers are very good. upper management very accessible and helpful
good,Time Warner Cable was an experience that I will never forget. For the almost 11yrs that I was there I can say not ony did I grow professionally but also mentaly. The most enjoyable thing about the job was that Im very competitive in sales and I enjoyed the thrill of the sale. Also all the people I had the chance to talk to.
good,"Working with the company, ( Time Warner ), was a really good experience, as the opportunity for personal growth within the company was great. Generally the workplace environment was very good until the company was acquired by Charter."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I would work long days and hours going door to door trying to make sales to reach my quota and make my commission every month. I learned how to read people and communicate with people a little more than I did I also learned a lot about cable and also the cable company. The most enjoyable part of working at spectrum was meeting new people everyday.
good,"A typical day comes of me coming in loading up my programs and then dealing with customers issues. A lot of it is customers upset, but its a matter of resolving the issue and making them feel like they matter."
good,"I enjoyed the work experience at Spectrum. I have been a part of the  sales culture for many years and Spectrum fits the sales culture perfectly. As a Business Account Executive for Spectrum my job was to sell various bundle packages of internet, cable and phones via telephone, email and canvassing."
good,"I enjoy working for Spectrum. The typical day usually starts off with receiving your work details for the day. The time frames and duties of each residential job are laid out in an app for easy access. Management is easy to get along with at the local level, the rest is corporate. Almost everyone that works there gets along really well and generally works well as a team. The hardest part of the job is when certain apps go down/become unavailable as well as the transition from Brighthouse Networks to Spectrums/Time Warner Cable's new hybrid system. The work shift is not desirable as well as the low pay for the amount of knowledge and expectation there is for someone to be a good technician. The most enjoyable part is being able to resolve an issue that a customer has and being able to work in new environments daily."
good,"Good and hardworking with excellent communication skills."
good,"I love my co-worker & supervisor  they are awesome. I get started at 8:45 am opening my computer, getting pans out emails, opening the door at 9:00 am  we close at 7:00 pm  with a 30 minute lunch. I work with the public which i love all the faces i get to meet and see. The down fall is we are open late and miss time with my family."
good,"At times you will be dealing with irate customers who scream at you over the phone. The phone calls can come in back to back, so you may work several hours without a break from the rush."
good,a nice place to work when tools are cooperating. selected managers are good and are very interactive with agents. lots of potential growth if connected with the correct people.
good,"awesome place to work, teaches you a lot towards cable wiring. Management is fair but generally biased to senior workers.Personally I cannot see myself ever progressing with this company or line of work, therefor I must find else where to utilize my full potential and have possible opportunities for career advancement."
good,I currently work with the residential side which can be stressful. There are a lot of angry people that you need to calm down before they can even tell you when the issue is that they are having that I get to fix. The fixes are usually pretty simple as long as you know what you are doing...it's the people that I don't want to deal with anymore.
good,Better training and more time for hands on held help also would like to have been able to be assisted more on things I'm unaware of than poorly treated
good,"Better than an average call center."
good,"In the IT networking groups, departments are siloed into specific areas. Advanced Routing, Core Routing, Architecture, and Access Routing. Each group manage specific areas of the network according to documented standards and procedures."
good,"Overall one of the best jobs i have ever had compensation wise, there is always room for improvement. But overall I enjoy the work, and management is always right there."
good,Its stressful and wears you down. in 2 years ive taken over 27k calls and even the good customers start to irritate you. Definitely dont get paid enough.
good,as an auditor i spent a lot of time looking at cable/internet hookups and i only fixed the ones that needed attention. I viewed roughly 125 hook ups per day and would only have to fix about 1-2 percent
good,"Every day presented new and unique challenges; my leadership team was excellent. Jo security with this company in the CFL area is up in the air, thus the reasoning for my job search."
good,"Field in-bound helpdesk calls over the phone or on client sites (when needed)"
good,A typical day is knocking on doors in an assigned area to sell the features and benefits of Spectrum products. Work your area at different times of the day to catch the most people at home. The hardest part of the job is the availability of good addresses..Talking with people out in the field is one of the best things about this job. There are so many great people that I get to meet.
good,"my position was accounts payable coordinator, which involved lots of detailed paperwork, dealing the upper management and vendors. the hardest part was meeting weekly and monthly deadline, which was challenging and I enjoyed it."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Time mgt is important, Upper Mgt is willing to listen.  Salesforce is used daily, good training programs, hardest part of the job is internal competition."
good,Honestly with Twc we had alot of great benefits and more spectrum took over and some of it was lost. Its an ok company better than a regualr 9 to 5. Real corporate vibe by the book kind of work.
good,"I've worked for Time Warner Cable for 12 years now. Due to the recent merger, we are now Charter. I enjoyed my tenure as a TWC employee and intended on retiring from here. I've grown both professionally and personally, while working there."
good,"you have to be a quick thinker and be efficient with knowledge, you will also want to learn the computer system because either it will be your friend or a complete night mare."
good,"If you work hard, this company gives you an uncapped commission plan to help you reach those goals.  The culture is built around driving success and growth."
good,"Spectrum is a productive place to work."
good,It's a great company to work for especially at a young age.  I use to work for Time Warner Cable so some of the new changes the spectrum has now I just don't agree with.
good,"Charter was a great place to work, especially if you like working outdoors, the management was very understanding, as long as you were an honest hard-worker, your work day was pretty much 100% autonomous. I learned after leaving the company that they were one of the lowest paying cable companies compared to the other television and internet giants."
good,Way too much politics that go on nowadays with the company. The opportunity for career advancement in this company is slowing down a bit. I love the type of work that I do with the company but I can do without the extra drama where management wages war on employees.
good,"Not the same job it once was. Lots of changes to pay structure and culture of the building. Processes became fragmented and communication lacking. In all, still a good job with good pay and benefits."
good,Spectrum is a great company it was a great place to learn and gain knowledge. Management was great as it could be being in a call center environment of course their is a lot of micro management but overall great place to work
good,"Overall okay company. Decent benefits, department managers were lack of knowledge a lot of times but tried to be strict.  I was told during a review once to stop having side bar convos with techs calling in like how are they? or answer when they asked how my kids were etc...  Even though out of the entire department I received and took the most calls... so I was most productive but still was disciplined for sidebar convos while I was doing my job helping the callers. "
good,"* you must be focused and hard-working"
good,"It was an experience. Glad to have worked for the company.Great culture and overall great management. I would have loved to worked for the company longer, but my department was laid off."
good,Being able to help my reps achieve their goals and seeing them develop over the year. Having fun along the way with them as we continue to be a top team
good,"Overall, this has been a great place to work. A lot has changed recently with the conversion to Spectrum, and I will go over some Pros and Cons. "
good,Spectrum is a good company to work for with many benefits. There is much growth potential within the company. There are many different kinds of jobs to fit many skill sets.
good,overall the work atmosphere is good. The management is very helpful with keeping updated on current information. A typical work day is answering phones helping customers with various duties. The most enjoyable aspect of the job i would have to say is the rest of the employees that i work with on a regular basis.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Haven't worked under Spectrum too long due to the transition. Previously Time Warner Cable was a great company to work for and I would assume the same from Spectrum.
good,It was great at first for many years. Like a family. Buy outs and merges and everything changes.  Enjoyed my job there extremely. Was laid off in recent merge. Miss my former position.
good,Productive work environment that never gets old and challenges one daily. A great place to home your skills in both customer service and technical expertise. If your looking for a foot into the ever growing telecommunications field Spectrum's a good start.
good,"Charter was a nice place to work. Management could of helped more on installs issues, because thats how you were paid! But over all, this company has great benefits and does seem to care somewhat about the employee."
good,"Typical workday includes multiple video application support to include several vendors technology which at times can be overwhelming if you are not comfortable in a fast pace environment for learning new products/applications/software. Management and workplace culture were great until after the merger.  Now, it's about the quantity of work or issues resolved and not about the quality of work or performing root cause.  The hardest part of this job is the lack of information pertaining to the supported systems.  You have to be well-versed in multiple platforms in order to navigate and bounce from servers to servers to figure out what systems are applicable to what you are working on.  The most enjoyable part of this job entails interacting with people from multiple department across the entire  footprint."
good,"I worked at Xerox full-time (Less than a year)"
good,"I have learned that working with larger companies can definitely have its benefits and drawbacks.  With larger companies, comes many layers of supervisors, managers, directors, senior directors, etc."
good,I worked at rms the pay/commission was amazing then out position moved to texas so we got divided into a different department they said that they would combine the last 6 months of commission we made into out pay rate they lied everybody in that department made the same even the people that wasn't hitting commission goal got the same pay rate as the one that achieved beyond goal
good,"Loved working for TWC; loved the people, the projects and the workplace culture. Following the merger of TWC with Charter Communications the decision was made to close the Herndon office and either relocate personnel to Colorado or North Carolina with thousands of employees being given departure packages. The employee morale has plummeted in Herndon."
good,"I worked at Time Warner Cable for well over a decade, so I can't truly attest to the culture at Spectrum (because I was laid off soon after Charter bought TWC). But despite being highly financially compensated and having great benefits, I felt like I was in a dead end job for years. This is largely due to the lack of vision and innovation that began to take root as more and more AOL employees began to join the ranks of TWC."
good,I really enjoyed working for TWC. it was just the work schedule conflicted with my church schedule at the time. and the customers were something special.
good,Great company when it was Time Warner Cable. Really know very little about the new company. Since we are now dealing with the merger it can be a little frustrating in the not knowing.
good,Very busy and fast pace. lots to learn. average pay. Systems was easy to learn. management was available to assist. Had option to earn bonuses through up-selling of products and services.
good,I learned lot of good things form this comapny like good some new technologies and hardwork etc. Here workplace culture is very nice I enjoyed the workculture here and the managements are highly coparative to the employees.
good,I was a Supervisor at this company. The company overall was great to work for with the focus being on representatives first. I enjoyed the coaching and the development of representatives. I really liked the interactive approach that was encouraged in order to build the employee.
good,"Great place to work, very stable company. Was hard to move up because new opportunites where limited."
good,A good medium sized company to grow personally and professionally in.  I was able to learn a lot about the international oil and gas industry.  A great office dynamic for a small group.
good,Safety is my major concern. Climbing ladders in the dead of winter and going into strangers houses constantly. Management team is great.
good,its a good place to start in customer service but the compensation aint that great plus they dont have raising plan . the environment and culture are good . the breaks and lunches are very short and sometimes you need to skip them to hit the phone calls target and reduce your talk time.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,The benefits at this company are truely great. It's okay to start in a lower position because you do have a chance to work your way up within the company as long as you don't become complacent.
good,"good place to work. Excellent benefits. The training that you are given is excellent. Ability to relocate and advance in the company."
good,it was a fun job because i was by myself and wasn't always in the same place everyday every job was a new house and a new person and I'm a people person and like to hear what people say and I've learned a lot sometimes from talking to them.
good,"Standard office environment. Management is top-down and fairly rigid. Good health insurance, but underpays their workers. Raises limited to 1.5% to 3.5% annually. Salary positions can expect 60 hour work weeks at ~$60k per year."
good,"Being able to work in the office and also go out and meet the customers makes the whole process work so much better. The customers like to put a face with the name. I have learned a lot about Time Warner/Spectrum Enterprise. Being on the Healthcare Enterprise team has been a challenging and great learning experience. I have met many great customers and gained relationships and earned their business and repeat business over the years. The hardest part of the job is competing with your own company, where other sales people can sell into your vertical. The processes sometimes delay the projects and this puts a strain on the customer. I really enjoy the feeling of helping a customer and knowing that you have the right solution for their business. It builds confidence in yourself and the products you offer to your clients."
good,The merger with Time Warner Cable has hurt the atmosphere at Charter Communications. Profits has become the main focus not employee work life balance.
good,"Good pay, good hours, very informative and educational also great training, travel and challenging. It's a great job to have, fulfilling"
good,Time Warner is being bought out and a lot of uncertain changes being made. Right now not to sure how things are going to be.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was coming into work and knowing something new would probably come up in the day's work. There was never a day where you did the same thing twice.
good,"As an Account Executive B2B, Sales Management let me alone to run and get sales.  Good account Executive can make a very good living at Charter Communications."
good,"Being able to connect with different customers daily is a good change of work without it ever feeling routine, work hours are always great even with more added, and the team is very well organized so that everyone never feels alone even though you are responsible for yourself management of jobs, time and equipment."
good,I enjoyed this job until winter came along. Work vehicles would often get stuck on ice in alleys and climbing ladders on ice and frozen ground is quite unnerving
good,Coworkers and management were good to work with. Company changed compensation every 6 months (not in employees favor). Company created more hurdles making our jobs more difficult. Company compensates well. Must take rejection and close sales. Must be a problem solver. Not a job for lazy or unambitious workers.
good,"Nice building , Nice kitchen. Clean rooms."
good,"Company overall is good depending on the department you are in.  My group was really strong and excellent team players, always had your back.  Were very customer focused. The challenge they have now is the instability of jobs due to the Charter acquisition."
good,"Time Warner Cable has some fantastic people working for it, the environment is typically fun and enjoyable.  They are quick to adopt new technology and implementation is fairy smooth with few if any issues.  As with any company, management can be a delight or a nightmare depending on whom your under.  Mostly, they tend to micromanage a little too much and have issues trusting their agents to do their job in the most effective manner.  Overall a good company to work for with fantastic benefits and competitive pay."
good,"Due to the recent merger/acquisition in May 2015, it is not possible for me to provide a review of the company, the management/leadership at this time."
good,"Time Warner was bought out by Comcast so it was the same call center like world, but Comcast had brought on more positive changes to the company. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Great Co-workers and overall good job. Union busting management. Managers need more training on actual job. Could use longer training program.
good,"The hardest part about the job was operations and inconsistency of information. Your co-workers are very helpful with making sure you understand how to maximize your results. Can be stressful depending on the person, doing the job isn't the problem it is adjusting to new methods on a daily basis, if you aren't used to that. Money is good but was a lot better. Opportunities are available depending on which what you're strengths are. A typical day a work is being on the phone consistency trying to install happiness in every home without giving up too much.  Turnover is extremely high for many reasons."
good,"Long hours made it so it was hard to see my wife and kids. But the pay and advancement opportunities are awesome. Free tv and internet are a definite bonus,"
good,"Was a good experience for customer service "
good,A good place to work in media sales.  Good training and lots of good products to sell for TV and Digital.  Great downtown setting and staff.
good,On a typical day of work you can always learn something new at Time Warner Cable. I have learned not only how to be a leader but also how to develop other employees into leaders as well. I enjoy coming to work and helping customers with there accounts and services.
good,Bright House Networks really cares about their customers and it is a focus at all levels each day.  It's great to work for a company that shares my ideals.
good,I work to save customers. I educate customers on the features and benefits of their services and help them to lower their bill. The hardest part of the job is trying to help someone when they don't understand the quality of the product. I love my coworkers!! Best part of the day is helping those customers that feel lost and stuck. Knowing the they have options makes it so much better for them.
good,"A day at work consists of going through maintenance tickets to see what needs repair, adjusting or attention to. I work closely with internal and external customers. The management team is very helpful and approachable with any concerns or ideas. The best part of the job is I have a fair amount of freedom to solve, conduct and create any type of project, idea or issue."
good,Working with others in the group has been great and I have worked with some really great people. I've made some good friends in the process.
good,"Good bunch of people to work with. Hard, dirty work at times, but not impossible to get fast and proficient at the job. "
good,"Charter is an overall good employer.  Pay is good, benefits are excellent.  Not thrilled with the hours and I HATE selling."
good,"Great organization to work for. Need  to believe in uplifting hard working employees, empowerment and work ethics. Management needs to push employees for career advancement."
good,"I spent seven years working at charter and the environment was great for five out of the seven years. i have heard that it is better now, so i may try to go back."
good,Compensation and Growth opportunities are great. Incentives are great. Fast paced environment with high expectations and goals that change often. Competition is encouraged.
good,For self motivated individual this is a great job. You are mostly working by yourself. If work is completed to everyones satisfaction then you rarely see your supervisor
good,a typical day out in the field can be quite intriguing. I've learned a lot about technology.Our management is kinda out of wack and work on the fly. Most co-wokers are fun to be around and enjoy their positions. The hardest part can be dealing with irate customers or working in hazardus enviroonments.The most enjoyable part is satisfying a customer needs.
good,Time Warner Cable is a great company to work for and it gives employees the ability to advance within the company. My responsibilities we providing access to employees that needed it. I was also responsible for issuing corrective actions.
good,"I have had a positive 11 years at Time Warner Cable and was able to advance and try out different job opportunities.   The team here is dedicated and goal oriented.   The hardest part of my job has been achieving my current sales goals against a strong Cincinnati Bell competitor.  I love the benefits, pay and meeting new people."
good,"Very busy face paced work environment. Customer service, sales, technical support. Face to face contact with customers."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"My tenure at Bloomfield College, was wonderful, as I was working in the Residence Life Department in which I deal directly with the Resident Assistants, and  Graduate Assistants."
good,"This company is not is not bad but it depends what dept you work for.    Each manger or supervisor chooses who they want to give special attention to.  the rules change as they want.  If you have a family and really don't have any child care then this is not the company for you,  Not a family orientated company. They do give special awards to best sale and initiative to do OT.. The pay is ok but you can move up after 6 months."
good,"TWC has been going through a lot of changes in the past 5-10 years including regionalization and potential merges which has caused a lot of change, but not always in a positive way.  Some of the regionalization strategies took away authority of local management to truly create efficient and effective process and made jobs more difficult for ground level employees."
good,"The company isn't bad to work for t all great health and employee benefits. Great community involvement, I must say they try to make work as fun as possible and our picnics are very nice, I do feel like they go all out for the employees. However, I don't like working on the phones in a cube farm so I don't fit here now. I worked for Bright House since 2003 and in 2013 my entire department was laid off. So after being off of work I am happy to be working and to be working at Bright House.  Personally I would like to be doing something else. I have to drive from Hudson to St. Pete everyday ts a long drive and I wish the pay made up for it. Again, this is not the fault of the company Pasco County is void of any kind of industry so if i wasn't driving to St. Pete I'd be driving somewhere else an hour from where I live."
good,"typical day here is usually busy and fast but makes the day go by fast. worked with new tools for troubleshooting skills. number driven, daily weekly and monthly goals."
good,"- Charter provides good exposure within the organization and is under a great leadership team. Culture is fast paced and competitive."
good,the hardest part is also the best part of the job and its the customers they make your day some are nice and some are unreasonable
good,"before the Level 3 acquisition we were a  smaller company with great teammates and stable work environment."
good,all week you get your jobs on a tablet drive to them and do as many as you possibly can. you go to the main hub twice a week for stocking up on supply and for a weekly meeting.
good,"Answered phones, filed contracts, sorted mail, helped out with billing, Paid bills for all surrounding areas. Very happy working with Time Warner."
good,"Answered inbound and outbound call, which I helped the customer either get new services or upgrade their current services."
good,As a typical CLEC (competitive local exchange carrier) it was always plagued by financial issues. The leadership team had great vision and empowered employees however the investors changed hands constantly. A typical day at work consisted of team work and open communication with co-workers of all departments.
good,"I have been at Time Warner Cable going on three years, coming from another telecommunications company I felt a sense of ease into the new environment. I wanted to start from the bottom and work my way up as I did at my previous job. Being at Time Warner Cable for almost two years I was promoted to Lead Care Representative handing escalated calls and situations. Also, assisting agents with their development, questions and needs. I conducted training classes to educate and assist agents in their learning and development."
good,I enjoyed meeting the various high profile people coming in for interviews on the cable network. My hours and the occasional overtime were great.  Everything went downhill when the first wave of employees were laid-off last year. I was doing 18 hour days and rarely had a weekend off. Not every employee left was a team player and that made it very difficult for the rest of us. TW no longer has in-house security otherwise I would still be there. It was a great job.
good,"worked 5 days a week plus overtime, different customers every day, some polite and friendly and some out right hostile that couldn't be pleased.  drove long distances in company vehicle and did worked with different situations everyday.  Great benefits, but communication between customer service and technicians left something to be desired."
good,Charter is a great place to work. It is a constantly growing company that offers great opportunity for their employees to grow too.
good,"I have always enjoyed the task of delivering a quality product to the customer.  Like  any large company producing in volume, there will be set backs which made it more exciting to find the kinks and work through it.  I enjoy working, learning and teaching with my colleagues for the more information shared has always delivered a better product."
good,Great place to work at and the management was great at attempting to assist in getting any issues resolved so you get paid which is always a plus! The hours were a little harsh
good,"Nothing here is stable but change, even when they know that it won't work for the better of the workers, stockholders and customers, makes you wonder where this company is heading, good thing the products and services aren't expensive"
good,Fun place to work with supportive management. Its all about the numbers and keeping up with the daily quota. I loved to install Internet and cable TV in customers home.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Each day at Charter is different from the last.  Each day brings its on challenges. The key is to priorities work and have a plan to complete each task on time.
good,The job itself is stressful being a retention agent however Time Warner did a great job of making it fun and giving us plenty of incentives to make our work easier. If you follow instructions easy to make a good commission on top of the solid base-pay. Advancing isn't easy but in such a big company you can expect that.
good,I liked work out in the field meeting different people each day and building professional relationships. Out side of management my co workers where team player we will help each other out on jobs that wasn't completed. The hardest part of working in the field is working with the weather
good,"In this position you are constantly doing the job of 6 people at one time.  The day flies by, but it can be very stressful.  Co-workers are enjoyable.  The most enjoyable part of the position is networking yourself with other engineering departments."
good,"I gained some great experience in understanding the sales process. The only negative aspect was the poor ethics by management and the ""once the customers buy the product ignore their problems"" attitude the management and staff had."
good,"•Handled escalations from customers to find a immediate resolution to problems such as cable outages and delays in construction."
good,"A typical day at work involves building and testing ds1 thru 10g DWDM circuits. Working with internal design engineering team, field operations, project managers and offnet carriers when necessary."
good,Sales support is greatly lacking after the sale and no one is on the same page. Management is not very helpful and they micromanage.
good,This is a call center enviornment. Management does a great job allowing for a work life balance. The position itself is more of a entry level position for Networking/IT support. The Business side of the company is growing and has lots of potential to expand. One of the more difficult things to adjust to was that the company usually hires internally and that makes it difficult to get in at a mid career level positon.
good,"Provide support by answering inbound calls and determine customer needs; "
good,"The best part of this job was definitely the environment. Everyone is just so friendly and welcoming. One thing I must say, if working for this company, be open to change. With technological advances being made on a daily basis, it is crucial to be open to change in this line of work."
good,"This was my second call center job. I enjoyed working there. The other agents were nice - I've never seen so many well-behaved young people in one place!"
good,Dailey rallies to motivate individual teams. One on one sessions with direct supervisor help with focus and enhancing potential skills. At times lack of proper/timely communication when it came to decisions that came from higher up supervisors.
good,Solid place to gain experience in Hunting type sales. Wonderful people who love their jobs and are willing to help. Frustrating process of installation. What you sell you don't always get paid on due to post sales process.
good,"A good place to work, great benefits. They have locations every where so in theory you can work any where in America. Some departments are better then others but in this day and age having a job a great."
good,"Easy place to make a lot of money. Very aggressive commission structure. Lots of coaching to help agents. Only one good manager, the rest are busy stabbing each other in the back and being scared of anyone below them who shows any desire to move up. Great place if you wanna sit in a chair and take inbound calls until you retire. If you want to advance your career, go elsewhere."
good,"Each day consisted in a Fast Paced Enviroment deligating job responsibilities.That Teamwork is a Necessesity so that your job ran smoothly. Wasn;t an admirer of our Management team due to meetings every day and no one to reach out when issues arose. I Enjoyed working with my co-workers, we were a tight crew. deligating work load to Technicians right before lunchtime."
good,"I am over the Routing and Quota or point allocation portion of the department and that covers over 1,000,000 subscribers. I have learned what it is to be a leader and what being a succesful leader entails. We have a new management team in the department and we are still working thru the fundimentals of what everyone needs to handle to be successful. I have 4 other Supervisors who have been in the positions for longer than a year now and they are the core group of team leaders. The hardest part of my job on a daily basis is having too many hands involved in the same things, my current manager has not assumed her full role yet and taken over the department. Most enjoyable part of the day is helping and working with my direct reports and the rest of the department."
good,Enjoyed working there until Time Warner sold Time Warner Cable. Pay and hours of worked changed. Being in sales referrals are a way of life and they did not want you getting them.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,On the phone taking orders for people's cable internet and phone needs. Learned sales and the E3 process. Management and co-workers were fun a relaxed. The hardest part of the job would have to be the the computer system. The most enjoyable part would be the perks.
good,Utility service run from a union standpoint. Seniority is given preference over performance. Technology is state of the art and they strive to provide customers with a good products and services.
good,"The first job I had in which I received paid time off.  The management was pretty flexible when I was dealing with some health issues, and made it very clear that I wouldn't lose my job because of them.  I was being considered for a promotion to Q&A when everyone in the building got laid off."
good,taking incoming calls for services and billing matters.  Also making sales for new service or upgrade. I learned to deal with both way communication in technology in cable boxes & internet modems. Management was too focused in productivity in believe in micro management daily.  Though coworker was helping each other to deal with customer & knowledge.  The hardest part was to deal with ladies who is not familiar with how it works refuses to trouble shoot and enjoyable part of the job was appreciation when successfully resolved the issues
good,Great Company great benefits. Management is a little poor depending on the department. However there is oppritunity for advancement in certain departments. All in all great minus the management and ability to advance.
good,"I was very excited to work here, however, it is not for the feint of heart. I was Tier 3 support, ( highest form). You are very micro managed, customers can be very nasty sometimes which can put quite a damper on your day. Although you could have pleasant experiences with people, and a sense of accomplishment from this job, it is quite rough. Nice staff and coworkers, great pay, and benefits. Beware though it was a bit traumatizing for me. It was my first phone job, and thats not quite for me I see now."
good,"still very much employed for this company, a lot of opportunity for growth."
good,"Account Executives call/conference/visit businesses who use telecom (internet, phone, video, and IT)...which is essentially everyone.  Management is open door and great in numbers. Coworkers are supportive.  Culture is positive.  The most enjoyable part of the job is building your own business.  You are given room to implement your own style and build on what management teaches you.  Hardest part is keeping your pipeline perpetuating."
good,"typical day at work, would be come in login to computer and start answering phone calls,I learned excellent communication skill, superb problem solving ability ,efficiency in de-escalating of situation, great saling ability.and great multi tasking ability. Management is really only there to help theirself.Co workers are great."
good,Solid company with good benefits package.  The MAE team was newly formed in 2012 and presented integration challenges inside of the organization that were successfully overcome.
good,"a tipical day is based in position, for an account executive it start in the office and end in the field."
good,"Assisting customers with billing concerns can be very stressful.Working as a retention representative,you have to mange time good and also be a problem solver.Management seems to be consistent but at the same time no one seems to be on the same page.The hardest part of my job is being micormanaged.The most enjoyable part of the job is ending the call with a happy customer."
good,It's an enjoyable work environment with excellent benefits.
good,Co workers are great typical day is stressful if unable to establish rapport with customers hardest part of the job is no ofption for career advancement
good,"Company is very fast paced, constant equipment upgrades and project management oriented. "
good,"This job was very stressful at times. There were days that no matter what you try, the customer could not be pleased. I am by nature a people pleaser, so this was hard for me."
good,One of the best places to work as far as co-workers.  I loved the people I worked with and for and miss them very much.  We were a close knit bunch and most all departments felt this way.
good,Time Warner Cable is an ok place to work but leaves much to be desired. Not very competitive with salary and not very stable. constant layoffs all the time.
good,"customer service calls are one after another, can be exhausting but overall good company"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Time Warner Cable is an excellent company.  There are many passionate employees that work there and care about their job and their customers
good,"Overall, this is a great starter job. Management is very helpful in teaching the skills needed to perform in this fast pace environment."
good,"fun"
good,I feel the job is essential and they make it known but the salary is hard to live on. There is very little room for advancement. Some management likes to pigeon hole you and will not allow you to grow. Some management pushes you to exceed. The hours change frequently and it can and does create havoc with your family each time a new shift bid is released. There is inconsistency between the two call centers as well.
good,"Outstanding training program for new hires, as well as continuous training to help you be the best at your job."
good,"Really cool place to work, but there are changes on the horizon."
good,four ten hour days every other weekend good company to work for
good,"Everyone embraces you to succeed.  We never leave a customer wanting more without delivering.  Hard work in the field during all weather conditions.  No excuses, more new customers, more money, production and profit"
good,This employer provided me with great benefits and compensation. The sales commission was very favorable and most of my co-workers were friendly.
good,"lots of good people, but uppper management seems to be making it up as they go.  Good company with a lot of potential, but really frustrating at times."
good,"Busy, starting between 8:15 am and 8:30 am."
good,"Overall a great company to work for, but some of the metrics for the quality scores don't seem customer centric."
good,Every day is different with a bit of a challenge; this is what makes the day exciting.  Your opinion counts and with that new processes are established.   The support from management has your back which allows you to do your job effortlessly.  Many of my co-workers have become personal friends.  Sometimes getting other departments on the same page can be difficult but once they are there - things go very smooth.  At the end of the day if we can meet the customer’s needs we have achieved what we set out to do.
good,"Great benefits, but my area lacked 360 degree management - no accountability for management, and training was rarely provided - in my area - no knowledge share."
good,Mostly work on you own witth customers fixing and installing cable services.
good,"Within this company there are limited opportunities and the need for growth is what currently plays a factor to an ambitious individual to seek other avenues for personal growth.  The work is steady with minimal change.  One can become complacent in this position.  Although the leadership staff is implemented, the gaining support for team moral and productivity tends to fall short due to non-process, procedure structure. Currently the schedule is what identifies itself as the most rewarding which is a M-F 8 am - 5 pm / 9 am - 6 pm shift."
good,"manage customer interactions over the phone daily and in a timely manner."
good,Loved the location of the call center.  The people were nice and some were very helpful.
good,"Progressively advancing technology company provided constant learning; through mergers and acquisitions, experienced both privately held and corporate cultures."
good,"Organized ciaos."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I learned people will not perform what is expected of them, but what is indeed inspected."
good,"Fast paced callcenter. Decent pay, met some good friends working for Charter."
good,A typical day was stressful and challenging. My co workers were fun to be around.
good,"steady work, very relaxed atmosphere many opportunities to advance and training is superb. Great place for young people."
good,Time Warner Cable is a great place to work for. They keep there employees updated on the newest and upcoming company products. Time Warner Cable also offer employees a number of  benefits choices as well as  some perks that are not usually offered by other companies.
good,"Very fast paced, great benefits, definitely enjoyed my position with the company"
good,Overall TWC provides job security. A great team of people with a diverse background.
good,Times change and the company was bought out by Comcast.  I enjoyed the friendships and contacts I made with customers and still keep in touch with them and consider them to be my friends.  I met people from all walks of life and countries and built bridges and friendships with them.
good,Time Warner Cable was a great company in which to gain and use new skills
good,"A great place to move up in the company, great benefits and pay. Strict on rules regulation in the workplace"
good,"Time Warner Cable is a good company to work for. If you are motivated by advancement, Time Warner Cable is the place to do it. The benefits are great."
good,"I enjoyed working in different positions at this company very much. My first job consisted of doing audit spread sheets via Microsoft Excel in the Human Resources Department. I enjoyed this job for what it was, and the pay was very good.It helped me to improve my excel skills also. The co/workers were reasonably friendly, and management for this position was very straight forward. I would like to have worked there in the department permanently, but this was an additional project, and temporary. "
good,"A typical day at work involved handling up to, but not limited to, three hundred plus calls assisting customers with their services and offering them bundles to providing them with more products from Time Warner Cable which include: home phone service, cable T.V., and high speed internet. Taking payments and managing account information as well as editing any needed information regarding residence information, appointment schedules, troubleshooting service issues and following up with scheduled service installations."
good,I am currently a Direct Sales Represenatative.  They trained me well and really try to drive and motivate the sales teams.  The local supervisors are great and really seem to care about the well-being of their employees.  The hardest part of the direct sales position is that it is a six day work week.  The best part is closing the sale.
good,"in my 25 years in the cable industry and been in a leadership role for various departments, I gain so much experience and recognizing that  no two individuals are alike, but treat avery one with respect."
good,"I couldn't imagine a call center being more fun than working for Charter.  Although the micro management was heavy, ping pong was great stress relief."
good,"always on the run. great work ethics, micro managed. coworkers are fun "
good,It was a good company but not really good management at the time..would go back if I was rehired
good,"Great people to work with. Fast paced job, but work/life balance has become an issue. "
good,"Going out on assignments to do shoots monday-wed. Then hoping to edit your own project or hand off to someone else. Working on different studio shoots, from sports to School programs. I learned how to communicate my ideas to others on shoots and editing. I learned to work with people who had clear Ideas about video production and how to help people get an Idea about what they want to create. My co-workers were very helpful in projects and became my family. The hardest part of the job was getting new Ideas excepted by supervisors. The most enjoyable part was being ably to do all the cable television shows I created.  "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Take on an average of 25 to 30 calls from Charter customers. "
good,The pay is pretty good the benefits are outstanding and depending on what department you work in you can make good money but as an installer it wasn't for me.  If you get into the business side or management you will prefer to work there more than the physical labor side of it for most.
good,"Company is a great company benefits are amazing, but when it came down to management and disciplinary actions they were only applied to those who were not the favorites."
good,"The Central Outage Team at Charter Communications is a twenty-four hour a day operation consisting of the following responsibilities:"
good,Job is good for people who like to sell and dont mind doing customer service
good,"My typical day at work..having fun talking to customers and finding out their specific needs. Entering orders based on information."
good,customer service rep. Trouble shooting cable issues and selling products for Time Warner Cable.
good,"Installed and troubleshot various cable provider services for example high speed data, digital cable TV, and VOIP telephone services. At all times maintained a clean uniform, professional appearance, and fluent polite communication skills for the customer. I was always the first to volunteer to be trained for new products and innovations for instance, Signature Home service and Intelligent Home alarm systems. Signature Home service technicians are trained more in depth than ordinary technicians. Exposure to the challenges in the job such as building heights, pole climbing with ladder, and pulling cable in crawl spaces of a building. Maintained company owned vehicle, tools, and other property. Maintain an accurate account of company owned modems, routers, and digital set top boxes inventory."
good,"Enjoyed working there. Company has many benefits, the people are great, pay is good."
good,I enjoy working there and have met many wonderful people whom I shall never forget.
good,"Management support of realistic sales goals rather than projected goals would improve sales force morale , removing job lose fears."
good,"The company is a great place to work and is constantly growing. I've held several positions and was encouraged and bid over to be placed in different departments. Unfortunately, as great as the benefits and peers are, advancement has always been based off of who you know and not your individual work ethic. I have been blessed to be on the receiving end of many promotions so I'm not complaining about it, given I've always been qualified. I have seen positions go to candidates that were severely under qualified and people who were qualified but not in the inner circle were passed up. This is an observation and not a complaint given the fact that it never affected me. Overall I would recommend people to apply for TWC and the only reason I know longer work there is because my department as well as others, were relocated and outsourced and I declined on being relocated and took the severance instead. I excelled in every department I worked in and won awards for top sales, perfect attendance, finishing projects early and under budget, and loved the ability to multitask several departmental projects in an attempt to keep work from becoming routine. If TWC were to come back to Cincinnati, I would consider reapplying."
good,This is a call center settings. Typical day is taking incoming phone calls and provide technical support and customer service to customes.
good,"Compensation over $6,500 / Month. Street Sheets - 500 businesses / month must sell at least 22."
good,Receive and handle inbound customer calls and provide resolutions to customer questions and or service issues.
good,"The overall company is a great place to work, I unfortunately worked for a person that was a very poor leader."
good,"The best thing about the local operations here is we look at all our decisions - be they operational, strategic or marketing/sales - through a lens of ""is it good for the customer, the employee team and the shareholders?"" While you cannot always answer 'Yes' to that question, application of this decision-making theory is important to overall success."
good,"Its a busy environment never a dull moment answering all sort of technical question and troubleshooting customers computer related problems as well as setting up connection via proxy server ecetera. I learned how to think on my feet and get to the point in helping people resolve problems. Management well they expected the best possible scenario to take place as they should. Co-workers were supportive because we were all resolving similar issues so you could ask for help if you didn't know the answer which is good in a time allotted environment. Meeting quotas because sometimes volume didn't allow it or a customer wasn't technically inclined but we always resolved their issue. Working four days straight and having three days off, loved it!"
good,I enjoy working at TWC; however my role may soon change and after 6 years it may be time for me to move forward. I learned a great deal about teamwork and enjoyed the management team and co-workers.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Through Charter I gained entry level knowledge of VOIP systems and I was able to move up quickly within the technical support field.
good,"I was a csr , my day was helping customers with their problems (billing ,technical, and new installs). One of the things I didn't like was that I was always able to help people like I wanted to."
good,Time Warner Cable was an overall great place to work. I grew tremendously within my position and was encourage to do so by management
good,"From the start of the interveiw, throughout the training process, and onto the floor everyone was great. Great place to work...just not my cup of tea."
good,Great experience working with potential clients
good,satisfying customers needs on a daily basis with any technical or sales issue
good,well i was pulling cables all day. i questioned that a lot .management was ok but they had there hands tied because of union .coworker were cool. the hardest day was working on roof tops replacing cable that were good in summer .most enjoyable was going home .
good,"Time Warner Inc. Was a great learning experience. Management was very knowledgeable,informative and helpful. My coworkers were like my second family."
good,Essential Job Functions:
good,"My job here was incredible. I was given the opportunity to grow from entry level into management with independence yet necessary guidance. I enjoyed my co-workers and my employer as we worked together as a team. We had hard times and struggles along the way but always managed to pull together to find solutions through it all. We became a family who counted on each other and all the pieces of the puzzle had to fit! The pay was good, bonuses were great, benefits were fair, paid time off and vacation were perfect."
good,Good workplace with good benefits. Value driven company with friendly workplace.
good,This company offers room for advancement with hard work and dedication. Great health benefits.
good,While working at TWC I had the pleasure to assist some of the most loyal devoted customers. I also had to work under mangement that didn't care much about those customers or the devoted employees. While the company's corporate works hard toward making its values outstanding internally the management in charge makes the work environment dreadful and impossible to enjoy or advance. As a company TWC is under an democratic umbrella as a working family TWC falls under the communism umbrella.
good,The possibility of earning extra money when you exceed all your goals is there but the hourly wage is not that great.
good,"Great Place to work.  Great people who I work with. Great atmosphere, grat culture was able to learn a lot from my manager and co-workers. Management is great they have an open door policy."
good,"Built experience in television, phone and internet.  Great being able to work outside and meet different people everyday. Very rewarding being able to supply great service to customers and receiving great appreciation from them"
good,"Inbound call center. Maintain customer account by offering product value and/or promotional rates.Experience with Avaya, CSG, Optimyze, Skype, Panorama and Gateway."
good,"Very good management team"
good,great moral friendly competition fun at times but I decided to chase my dream of becoming a chef and open up my own business witch is put on the back burner at the moment
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"a company with a little job security as long as you do whats asked of you when asked to do it. Previous job experience not required, they teach you most of what you need to know and the rest you learn in the field over time. over all its a good company to work for."
good,"Where I had to bow out was at the point of remembering a lot of codes and/or where you had written them. "
good,"Work life Balance is not the best especially if you have children. Schedules are made for ppl without families. Money was great management tried their best to work with you as ,such as they could. Perks were great"
good,This company is now spectrum and runs very differently. Career advancement  was a bit easier when time warner cable was around. Now the whole company has changed.
good,Everything was okay they had benefits that help me out I love the way they have insurance for people who didn’t have none. Best part is they had overtime.
good,"Overall Experience and expectations are satisfactory. Setting and achieving goals more challengeable. Everyday assigned work is as expected, very challenging, d demanding. Balancing work schedule and home time is less than satisfactory. Actual work is comfortable to perform and assist from others are as expected."
good,The job is very easy to learn and for the pay its great. I loved working there but management needs work. There is a big break room for all departments with a pool table.
good,"good place to work, good pay, nice percs - free cable/wifi/phone services. great training. overall great place to work independently as well as within a team; felt very good when issue was fixed by me over the phone."
good,"Spectrum is a good steady job, the consumers can be wonderful and knowing them and coming to care for them enriches your life. There is plenty of downtime, but a great deal of responsibility."
good,"It’s a great company to work for, but the pay that comes along with the driving, attic climbing, pole climbing, shoveling and many other hard daily tasks isn’t really worth It. There’s people doing inside jobs that would make the same as you do or even more. They start you off at $15/Hr now but tbh they should be starting you off at a little bit more than that."
good,"A day as a field tech consisted of installing and troubleshooting cable, phone, and internet. I would work outside and inside homes ranging from apartments to big houses. Everyday was a learning experience."
good,"It was a good place to work. But they decided to close the call center as of August 22 nd, 2019"
good,Busy with back to back calls. I appreciate the efforts towards a diverse work environment. Work schedule not flexible at all. Benefits were really great. Management was sub par.
good,I have the flexibility to work remotely and keep my own hours.  I see a lot more of my family then ever before.  I am given the freedom to work from home where I can stay focus and get more done in less time.
good,"over all good campany  to work for. Good things about spectrum is that they have flexible work schedule. "
good,I worked there before and during the transition from Time Warner Cable to Spectrum and wasn't there very long after Spectrum took over. It was a nice place to work although pay could have been better. Benefits are great.
good,Spectrum is a great career. Can get stressful at times but most jobs are like that. Very rewarding job. Love to retire here. Looking for all options. Thanks.
good,"As the Statistician for Time Warner Cable Sports Channel's broadcasts, I kept pregame, in-game and postgame numbers for our production truck, using an Excel program that I designed on my laptop. I was in direct contact with the CGI operator, broadcast producer, and on-air talent. We traveled throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington Metroplex telecasting high school, college and professional sporting events."
good,"It is a great place to work, the hours aren't all that great but the benefits and pay are great. It is very high stress from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave and it is not an easy job at all but the pay makes it worth it"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Working at charter was a great opportunity. I enjoyed coming in and having a family setting away from home. The overall setting was peaceful and calming, too say the least."
good,"It's a good place to work. Most of the staff & management I worked with were from the old Time Warner Cable group. There were some new support tools issues that had to be ironed out, but the leadership team at the North Canton Ohio is top-notched."
good,Spectrum is an enjoyable Company to start and perfect a starting customer support career. While being able to have a great environment  to work in company will provide educational and opportunities for anyone striving for improving their career.
good,Working here is definitely a good experience a lot of benefits dealing with healthcare and 401(k) managers try their best to do what they can do the only thing I can say is that the customer rates raise a lot so you will get a lot of customers that will clog be very upset about the changes so you just have to be able to show empathy and your job and try to resolve the problem as much as you can
good,Its a very good job if you are young and single but if you have a family it is very low pay. Benefits are great. Blue cross Blue shield for health you also get dental and vision. 401k is matched 100% up to 6%. you work 10-12 hours a day but you do have 3 days off in a row
good,Micro managed but decent pay and benefits the people there are so nice. Not enough.different positions mostly csr. Many different shifts and a diverse workforce.
good,"I invested 7 years with Charter, I only left due to the system tech manager I had above me, he was super negative about everything and at the time I could not get a transfer. But besides that.  Spectrum was an amazing company to work for. They will teach you a skill set, help you advance and learn in the industry, amazing room for advancement, great pay and benifits, it's rewarding work, knowing you used your skill set to help make a customers day."
good,I loved my sups.    I do not think management was following the corporate rules and made things up as they go.   I never would have left if the office didn’t relocate.   I was a router for technicians and delt mostly with field sups and technicians.
good,"Spectrum overall was a great company to work for.  A typical day at work as a tech was very fast paced,  but that fast pace allowed the day to go by very quickly.  I really enjoyed working hand and hand with other techs and the customers.  Every supervisor that I encountered treated me fairly and with respect.   Over all a good company."
good,"It was many years ago but I do remember a lot of people that I enjoyed working with and it did, for the most part, have a nice family atmosphere.  I was surrounded by co-workers who were supportive and helped me to hone my craft."
good,As with any cable company Brighthouse had some good things to offer.  If you like technology and have any interest in communications than cable is a great place to go.
good,Spectrum is really good for those who are looking to make high dollar and also want to feel connected in the work place. Egos by managers can sometimes be a downer but overall it's a wonderful experience.
good,"Lots of room for advancement, but intense working environment.  Entry level positions are difficult and can be highly challenging.  But if you put in your time you can really made a very good career for yourself long term."
good,"good place work for, education assistance is fantastic. plenty of opportunity to move through the technical ranks.A lot of great people to work for. friendly"
good,Spectrum is a pretty good company overall to work for with their benefits that they provide and the fact that they give you overtime options and time paid off
good,"Supervisors are knowledgeable and understanding"
good,"Answer 60+ calls trouble shoot take payments."
good,"great place to work, but still a big business that ultimately doesn't listen to the opinions of the little guys where pay is concerned. lots of great benefits though"
good,It's an ok place to work. Good place for someone with little to no education to build a career. Many of the different departments have been moved around since the merger so it depends on where you want your career to go.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I enjoyed talking to customers and helping them resolve their issues. My coworkers were fun and uplifting. I learned a lot of skills for dealing with irate customers.
good,The warehouse treated me like one of their own was at spectrum for 2 years and enjoyed them even though i was a temp. It still was amazing getting to work there.
good,"Being in HR my day varied. I take pride in self development and interacting with employees.  Building rapport and trust is huge in this and got to a point where certain employees would only work with me.  Management was not hands on and allow me to discern which helps us in not being robots.  After 10 years with Spectrum I loved my time, but my family is prepared to moved to Texas."
good,This job was over 13 years ago.  It was a temporary job that I filled in for a few months before getting hired at Satandre.  Due to the longevity of when I started and the fact it was a temporary spot I don't remember any thing about this position.
good,"The pay and benefits are good. However, we just had a restructuring in force, so job security isn't what it used to be. It seems that management has their own agenda, even though they pretend to want and sometimes encourage employee input."
good,Spectrum services was a small company no insurace or benifits but was a grat workplace and good learning experience .The company provided a lot of training and treatedall employees the same. I really enjoyed my time there
good,"I enjoyed my work, my position was required to be relocated to  Charlotte, North Carolina. The people I worked with were patient and great to work with."
good,I really enjoyed the environment there. I enjoyed working with the people. They were very friendly and helpful. The dress code could have been more relaxed though.
good,"Spectrum is a decent company to work for. The department I worked for was short staffed, therefore there was an opportunity for overtime. Team members were knowledgeable and helpful."
good,"I would get there internet at 39.99 but i would buy hulu, sling, amazon tv or anything other than them to high priced and they dont care about the tv client."
good,"The job culture has changed in the past year, bringing about concerns. The pay is great and human resources very helpful for issues and concerns employees have."
good,I would simply encourage candidates to contact and speak with reps who are currently OR were previously in the role that they're applying for before making a decision to move forward.
good,typical day at work. learning courses. opportunity to transfer to different departments and career advancement. Management is great and knowledgeable.
good,If your co-workers are good then this would be a good place to work.  One of the more unusual and cool perks was that you got a cable box and television on your desk.
good,"As with any place, Spectrum has plenty of pros and cons.  The field technicians are some of the best around to work with.  It is difficult to rate the overall work experience as Spectrum is in a transition period.  The benefits are competitive with other company’s packages. Overall, Spectrum is a decent place to work, the problems that exist with culture, management, benefits etc. are generally the same complaints that you will hear with most other places."
good,"Very fast pace and competitive but, fun working with the guys and get paid very fairly. hours and job load can be extremely stressful at times but would love to go back one day."
good,"Management was in a bubble and to entitled causing a disconnect with the techs. Work schedule was nice with 4 10hr days, training was in depth, company vehicle"
good,I worked from 8 a.m -5:30pm everyday and only had one day a week off. The environment was nice there was a lot of cultured people there. Management was not the best and there were problems with scheduling and having to pick up extra duties to to the slacking of other employees.
good,TWC was a better place to work for than Spectrum. The pay has changed and the qualifications for different positions have changed. Also charter doesn't believe in listing all open positions so if there is a position that comes available managers and directors will send out an email of the promotion of someone to a role that was never posted for all to apply
good,"When I started with the company it was very small, but Time warner bought out Jones Intercable. The  benefits was awesome , the ability to grow and to increase our income through classes and how explain technical questions.  Opportunity  to learn and to go to college through the company was available, Yearly cost of living , 401k Health Insurance affordable, great hours."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Overall a decent work environment. The happiness in your role will depend on the department management. Lack of communication between departments. They do encourage career progression in most departments
good,I was hired on during a contract extension so I new this would not be permanent work. The company was grerat though and allowed me to move my career in a new direction that has greatly shaped where I am today.
good,My typical day consist of assisting customers with questions concerning their cable and internet services.  I answered incoming calls and made changes to their plan and made adjustments to their bills if needed.
good,Great people to work with.  Most of the employees are new so there is a great opportunity to share new ideas. A little disorganized since this was a merger of three companies.  Nice new building with a great view.
good,Working at Spectrum has gotten less and less satisfying. There are no incentives other than getting your pay check. It used to be very family oriented but that went away about two years ago. The management is great but those that are over them are not. The job needs a lot of improvements. Speaking and handling angry customer can be very stressful and causes a high turnover within the call center. There are some that have been there for many years and are sticking with the job but the new hires are not staying because of how difficult the job can get.
good,"During my time at Spectrum, I was happy. I learned so many things in the telecommunicating industry. I got to move up and receive better pay and have my college courses paid for."
good,My employment was during the time of time warner cable.  I would hope that it is still the same great place to work. It's a beautiful campus in a great location.
good,Good company to work for still trying to make as one company from the buy out of Time Warner but they are trying some good moves some not so good but go with the flow and you will be fine
good,"I was hired as a supervisor in 2014 and moved across the country for a program manager position. That position evaporated due to the executive leader of the center being terminated and I was given the option of leave the company or become a supervisor again. Three years late I took another project manager position only to have it evaporate after they closed the project and once more offered leave or take a supervisor role. "
good,Hours were good. Pay good Benefits are good. Management was very help full and knowledgeable. As in most call centers the only had part were the extremely angry customers beyond that good job overall
good,The pay provided is fair for the work done. The only issues I had with the company is the secrecy for the future of employees after the merger of TWC and Charter. Employees were told countless times that their jobs were safe as long as they worked over time and had better numbers than all other regions; our region was always on top and we were the only one to be shut down.
good,"This is a great place to share thoughts and new ideas. "
good,"good place to work compensation is not enough for me , very supportive staff and management . Good training and benefits from day one .progression is very fast . it all depends on you the individual and how fast you want to move up the ladder."
good,The company pays very well in the sales market. I am a veteran of the industry and they paid above average. Make your numbers and you wil be fine. If you dont make the numbers you will be looking for another job.
good,"it's a great place to be. Sit down environment, being on the phones is fast paced but slow on  certain days so its manageable. plus the discount on cable and internet is amazing"
good,"Spectrum was a nice place to work.  I had good supervisors and the benefits of free cable, internet and phone was definitely a bonus.  I think it is a great place to work if you are starting out."
good,I was a contractor when I was working there easy to get along with the supervisors that you have at Spectrum every house is something new you don't know what you're going to get into every day that is the best part about it it's like a big puzzle and every day you have to solve it
good,"It was an absolutely punishing job. Seven in the morning to four in the afternoon doesn't seem too bad, until it is 109 degrees outside and you have been carrying an eight-five pound ladder for the last six hours."
good,"Different work environment , great business . "
good,"It was  a well paid job, for a position I had. The stressful part was rude customers and overtime that just eats a person, so unfortunately I could not handle. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,After any company merger there is lots of changes.  We are are changing the customer/employee culture. I think I may be personally ready to do something different.
good,Position starts with one month paid training. Training is helpful for learning systems. Job consists of taking 50-70 calls per day. Helping customer whose cable is not working.
good,"It is a good company to work for, they do work with their employees and are willing to help anyway that they can.  They can work on paying better when first starting out with them, but overall not bad."
good,"The calls may be difficult, people rang from understanding to very angry when services aren't working.  Spectrum gives you the tools you need to deal with customers.  The supervisors and managers are very helpful and there when you need support.. They are constantly giving training to help deal with the issues or changes that arise within the company.  The atmosphere is friendly and the employees are the best.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult angry customers.  The best part of the job is the people."
good,"I enjoyed preventing customers from wanting to cancel their services simply by listening to their complaints, emphasising and offer solution by setting expectations of how to prevent these issues in the future...."
good,"The Company provides for its employees with PTO, Vacation, healthcare benefits, 401K, and discount offerings.  If you are in their footprint, you can also obtain services for free/discount as well.  I was lucky to have a wonderful Manager who was supportive and well liked across the company.  Most teams were helpful and truly tried to make things work better.  The hardest part of the job was the travel (1 1/2 hrs each way) and the changes when TWC was bought by Charter.  I would recommend this company to anyone wanting a fast paced environment with potential for growth."
good,Free cable and HSD and phone services. I you have a past due bill you have to pay it before you get your free services. Good healthcare and paid time off
good,"Good company. Wages are on the low end. Nice benefits to start. Very secure, but very difficult to advance. Supervisors were well qualified. Lots of perks and incentives"
good,I enjoyed my time with Spectrum. You get what you put into it and some people were a joy to work with if you build connections. The benefits for employees like yearly flu shots were helpful.
good,"It's a fast paced environment and has good pay with excellent benefits. Hard to beat free internet, phone, and all cable channels. 401k, medical, dental, vision, Retirement on top of 401k, discount programs, vacation time, personal days, sick days. Financially speaking the place is pretty decent."
good,excellent company to work. Good work life balance. excellent people. knowledgeable people. i love working here. will recommend everyone . best benefits.
good,It is a great job to grow and develop they take care of you in spectrum great place to work a really good call center environment very team oriented thumbs up
good,"Extensive training to be the best at what you do. your calling customers to ad service to their account. you had to be knowledgeable of the products and services and pricing and a quick thinker while working 2 different screens. the manager will give you whatever help you needed to close the sale. you really got to have thick skin because for every yes you get, you will get 5 no's."
good,I enjoyed my time at Spectrum but was unable to maintain my job due to the fact I couldn't relocate. I nothing bad to say because it was an great experience and work environment.
good,Great that I mostly work on my own and I get to take my vehicle home. I loved solving problems for our customers it can be challenging sometimes but that is what i like. I enjoy the comrodery between other employees. The parts I don't enjoy are the breakdown in communication between upper management and the employees. Seeming to remove some tools that actually helped us do our job better. Overall I enjoy what I do and I have learned a great deal over the years.
good,"not a bad place to work, get a van to take home, free internet and cable clothes are provided along with tools. need to be patient with the public you will be in their homes."
good,"Fast Past work place, very high call volume, one call resolution, have to meet quotes and marks,following company policy is big and major, discounts on service"
good,"I worked in both the field and in the office at this company. The field was a very eye opening experience in the world of cable TV. I enjoyed that part of my position. However, in the office, I became the go to person with experience in the field to solve problems for customers over the telephone. I unfortunately was too good at my job and was passed over several times to move into a management role."
good,"Overall i love the company it was a great opportunity and helped me grow a lot, However my manager at the time terminated me while i was under doctors Care bad experience but a lesson learned"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Good work place but when going into the job I was told I would be compensated on advancement and later on was told otherwise. For instance, you start as a Dispatcher 1 and they had levels to Dispatcher 4. Each advancement you complete you'd be compensated by $1 or $2 more depending on your test score. Than I was told that advancing to Dispatcher 2 you will not be compensated. Too many changes and not enough information for employees."
good,"It was a good place to work, very fast paced but also overwhelming at times. But I learned a lot during my tenor at Time Warner (Spectrum) I worked with some awesome supervisors!"
good,"Sectrum is competitave and fast paced work environment with supervisors give you the tools to succeed, personal and professional growth is a must if you wish to make money in the Direct Sales Role"
good,"I received numerous calls daily in reference to changes, new installs and transfer of cable and internet services. I assisted and educated customers in reference to the packages which would best suit their needs."
good,it was brutal. going up to someones door uninvited and then have to convince them to let you talk. if you could get them to let you talk selling became easy.
good,"Spectrum offers a very solid Billing and Customer Care Call Center environment. It offers competitive pay, and an ample amount of benefits. It is an excellent company to find an entry level job, and develop it into a sustainable and satisfying career!"
good,I love working here.  I get free services and benefits are great.  They feed us all the time and always finding new ways to train us.  If you get someone to work here and they stay for 90 days you will get 500 dollars.  AGAIN YOU GET FREE SERVICES.
good,A good company with good benefits including insurance and paid time off.  Fast paced environment that changes rather quickly.  Room for growth for those who want to further their career
good,Management was always willing to back up project work as it was being accomplished and paved the way for solutions to be implemented across the company.
good,very challenging but good pay. retention can be hard with any company but you get paid well for it specifically with the benefits that you receive. Hard but worth it
good,"its an ok place to work good benefits, nice perks like random potlucks ,free cable/internet/phone the atmosphere is awesome because everyone is ""nerdy"" like me and the people that i work with are cool and will help with anything they can and on top of that the pay was good...BUT the job itself is a hassle my only complaint would be the lack of consistency. upon hire it was GREAT pay by comparison then tech support was rolled in with billing and shortly after, sales. at that point i felt like the perks or pay didnt matter because im doing something that i didnt apply for. On top of that the way they handled operations changed LITERALLY every thursday its almost impossible to MASTER your job because of this."
good,"Fun shift bid every 6 months great pay "
good,Very fast paced and very stressful if you care. Low advancement opportunities and compensation could be better. Staff is very professional. Management and team lead are very helpful.
good,"This company is going through a major overhaul and making Denver CO, the main Place for Engineer's and management.  There is room for advancement and is career oriented."
good,"A typical day at work was fast-paced and competitive. Calls were typically easy to resolve and the customers usually upgraded their services after their issues were successfully resolved. Customer retention had a high success rate as well. The management encouraged the staff by having contests and providing prizes, free lunch and other incentives. The hardest part of the job was being disrespected by customers who had multiple ongoing problems with their bill or services. However, deescalating the customers was one of my strengths. At this job, I learned what it feels like to be on the receiving end of an unhappy customer. Therefore, even if I am unhappy or upset about an issue, I still treat the customer service representative with respect, while respectively verbalizing that I am unhappy. Finally, the workplace culture was stressful but sometimes fun. The other employees always shared in the success when someone made a sale or won a prize for their hard work."
good,"Great place, good managers. People that trust you and support you. There are many changes happening and it is a great time to join the company and grow! Many opportunities available if you work hard and participate in the changes."
good,"Used Sql daily to adhoc data analysis and answer data driven questions. Worked with MSTR and ETL developers to create new metrics, attributes, and reports to support business needs."
good,"A lot in the cable network field. Good management, beautiful work environment. The hardest part of the Job is that i have to meet my family only every other weekend."
good,A typical day consists of working on any errors on work orders submitted by contractors and sending them daily reports of their work. Also sent a weekly file for approval to the contractors and got their approval for the monthly check run. Our supervisors were very understanding with deadlines when issues with the contractors come up.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Charter is a good place to work, it is a very fast paced and quick decision making job. "
good,"Most days involve putting out at least 25 ""fires"" (executive escalations), in addition to routinely processing approximately 1,000 residential and commercial requests for service."
good,"When i started working for the company it was still Time Warner Cable.  The training was decent. Pay for the training was better than expected. Benefits are good. Free services from the company. Plenty of room for advancement. What i didnt like about the company was the management in my facility, the way bonuses worked, the constant pressure and no matter what you did, it was almost always wrong. Having to work in disgusting houses was no fun but to take the bad with the good, i did meet a lot of awesome customers. They will work with you if you have extra curricular activities to tend to, given you provide enough notice. I played in a band during my employment and they usually did everything they could to make sure i made it to my show on time. They also did PTO for charity, so that was nice when my band played a charity event i was able to get off work and still get paid. They only offer 12 hours but in my opinion thats pretty good considering if you would like to attend a charity event or do some community service they will pay you for at least 12 hours of it. Overall, its really not a bad place to work."
good,"In sales, you always have to be ready to move in a fast paced environment.  Spectrum is no different.  It's all about the numbers you put up and you are only as good as your last month."
good,Great place to grow as a cable field technician. On the job training is highly efficient. Managers were not always easy to get along with but field work was sustainable.
good,"Inbound customer care, can be fast pace and a little stressful. Management always available for support when needed. Incentives were always available with contests and give-aways. Great place to work."
good,"A lot of changes being made since the conversion to spectrum. Moving up in the department will take a lot of hard work if you plan to move up quickly, other wise will wait at least 5 years to become a supervisor."
good,Managing there I had a good time size and the expectations were resonable. The shifting goals and focus was diffcult and one month to the next we didn't now with area was most important to focus on. Leadership was very inconsistent.
good,"Typical day at work is to engage in customer focused conversations regarding what needs the customer has for cable internet and phone service. Learned a lot about the culture of the company as well as the products offered as well as the competitors products. Management within the company is very fast paced, encouraging, stern, but at the same time beneficial. The culture is great competitive,friendly and also relaxed. Hardest part about the job is the rotating shifts seasonally based on performance and also at times the duration of phone calls to close a customer. Most enjoyable part of the job is the culture and the commission pay outs."
good,Worked there for 10 years.  Company was in transition/reorg mode for most of that time.  Company is micromanaged from the VP level.  Not much room for creativity.
good,"Management tries their best to have good communication, keep associates paid well, and happy with their job. Supervisors are usually stressed and help as much as they can when needed."
good,Take inbound calls answer customer concerns regarding theiir bill. educate customer on self help options. Take payments for customers. Spectrum provided a help desk so you wouldn't have to wait with your hand up if you needed assistance.
good,Time Warner/Spectrum is a fast pace job/changes daily/have to be able to adjust with daily changes/ worked in various departments thru out my career/gain a lot of experience
good,"The schedules in the call center are completely random to choose from, you work an 8 hour day but with the most random days off. It's pretty back to back in the call center."
good,Work was not bad. Just didn't like going under homes. Not my thing. The pay could have been a little better but for the most part it was ok. Super visor would give you a hand full of work orders to do for that day. These could be an in home install or a repair job up a utility pole or a under ground job. Had my own company van.
good,"Project analysis"
good,working here is stressful dealing with peoples bills and their problems outside of the billing issue can get overwhelming. over all working for them is ok. you do get burnt out quick. i learned to be an life coach and to listen to ppl more effectively
good,"Still transitioning  from Time Warner Cable to Charter Communications buyout. Nice office, but very disorganized in getting contract and nee employees settled.  Very confusing for all to try and set up an In-Processing of a new employee.  Still dealing with the Time Warner Cable and Bright House Cable transition to Charter Communication which falls under Spectrum."
good,"Working with Spectrum was a good experience overall. Since the group I worked for initially Monitor, report and troubleshoot network, systems tool issues, I learned different aspects of troubleshooting and support in timely manner."
good,Overall good company to work for. Management is very involved with the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see how the feedback you provide is put in use.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I've been working there for over 4 years now. Not a bad place to work. Good people to work with and the benefits are pretty good. Not too stressful there.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you are just getting into supply chain logistics, the problem is the management there, they make bad decisions and they were brought in because there was no one else at the time to fill the positions. Great Benefits, great work environment, not enough room to grow though."
good,"Enjoyed my time in the billing department. Loved the fact that everyday was different and I had the freedom as an employee to make decisions to help our customer satisfaction rating."
good,"I loved this job starting off, the balance of work and my personal life was awesome and not much demand. Yes the job was Door to Door and we had goals to reach! BUT management wasn't on top of us....."
good,"Great Company to work for. There is plenty room for growth, and career. Due to the merge somethings have changed a bit, wouldnt consider it good or bad"
good,"Worked for Time warner Cable for 7 years and then company switch to Spectrum. "
good,"I like my current job but need an supplemental income for personal reasons. The department I work in has wonderful Management, great team work, and we are very productive."
good,"Great place to work. The only reason I left were for serious medical reasons.  When I was going to try and back to work at least part-time, my position was not available."
good,typical day was installation and maintenance of customer prem equipment and turn up. maintenance was scheduled in advance and customers were notified before work was performed
good,It's a good company over all I believe.  It's just what you put into the company really.  But other than that spectrum must be a good company.  I never worked there personally but I hear good things about them.
good,Having had a slight background in this field it was easy for me to get going. Over the 7 years I was there I learned so much that 10 years later I still remember most of it
good,"Lower level management is very nice and understanding, upper management not so much. My supervisor was fantastic. "
good,"You are your biggest obstacle in success with the company.  If you have a desire to learn, succeed, and a good work ethic, you can be greatly rewarded."
good,"good place to work but company lacks communication between teams."
good,"A typical day in Product can be somewhat hectic, the Product team at Spectrum is needed in most parts of the Company. This can be good and bad, on the good side you never do the same thing twice. On the other side many teams will fall apart without direct help. "
good,"The job itself was challenging being a D2D salesman, however the people and environment was always uplifting. Management was very organized and professional and the people were always helpful."
good,"Spectrum is a nice place to work,good benefits,very good incentives. good location.Nice atmosphere good management staff.good location. CEO needs to have more hands on meetings with employees to advise on status of the company business"
good,Good company. This was a very engaging job. just ask questions and get involved. i loved the atmosphere. good people and good management. i loved what i was doing.
good,"Started with Charter as green as could be"
good,"Good company to get started in a sales opportunity. Many changes, must be adaptable. Compensation pays well when you work hard. Many incentatives too."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I was responsible for collections, and accounts receivable.  Dealt with inside as well as outside collectors, invoice preparations as well as getting outside vendors paid.  Was responsible for cutting checks for clients, dealing with client accounts, debiting and crediting accounts.  Creating spreadsheets, sending correspondence related to accounts."
good,When I worked here it was still TWC. The work was great but must love the outdoors especially in the northern states with sub-zero weather working outdoors.
good,"each day was different"
good,It is a great place to work for if you are single. This place changes every ones schedule every six months. this also may be because they just had a merger but they ask way too much for phone etiquette. These phone etiquette come from management that does not answer calls on a daily basis or deal with the people calling in.
good,"With the recent ""merger"" of Charter and Time Warner, the footprint has grown considerably. The workload matches the expansion. Our team manages day to day work on the infrastructure equipment, and planning for expansion and streamlining of operations. The team works well together, and shares information openly."
good,"This was overall a great place to work, the training teaches you everything you need to know before you get to the floor. Once you're on the floor they have plenty of people walking around to assist you at any time you need the help. Unfortunately this location is plagued by drama and gossip to the point where it costs people their jobs. Plus the compensation didnt really seem enough to justify all of the tasks we were performing."
good,"A very physical job, lots of aerial work via a ladder or gaffs. You work independently as long as you get your work done. The work schedule is M-F weekends off, but the pay is not outstanding. If you like working outdoors, and driving, and don't need to make alot of $$ you will enjoy this job."
good,"I never got what I needed from HR. My manager was a great guy, but didn't quite fit the role so to speak. Outside of those issues there isn't too much to complain about. I loved the job, it was just time for me to move on."
good,"The company in a whole is solid showing signs of growth and strong longevity. Benefits vs. cost is one of the best I have seen in a long time. In order to perform well within the company, you must be independent a self starter, be able to overcome objectives and be comfortable taking ownership. Having the ability willingness to self train often is a must. There is continuous changes implemented  for both adapting to the industry and making improvements for the customer. This makes the day by day challenging and interesting. Being very consumer customer service driven, many incentives are put in place for both team and personal challenges, creating a fun creative environment."
good,"Overall a great company to work for, great supervisors always willing to assist to meet required goals. Company has excellent benefits and bonuses."
good,"Great Pay, Mentally exhausting, Mircomanagement."
good,The environment is great with very supportive managment and coworkers. They are restructuring and the ability to advance is very limited unless you are willing to relocate. I would recomment them if you are single and wanting a company to grow in.
good,Great trade to learn and put it under your belt. I would recommend the great benefits that they offer to their employees. Takes a while for you to move up with the company.
good,I enjoyed my time with Time Warner Cable. I was able to make my own schedule. I was able to really make a difference with a customers experience with Timer Warner's service. I enjoyed fixing customer problems with their devices and assisting in understanding what they had purchased and about the other service that they could utilize with our company that they didn't know about.
good,Pretty good place to work just make sure u keep to yourself mostly don't get caught up in drama  make sure you stay up on your attendance that's number one
good,"Seasonal position,obtained state license for health and life insurance at no cost to the applicant.Great place to get experience in call center setting for health insurance."
good,Call volume is not bad. Managers are very supportive. Base salary is more during training. They give away great prizes. They offer the opportunity to apply for new positions after 6 months.
good,"Typical day at work is challenging."
good,"Good money is possible if you work the system. Management wants to help but sometimes gets in the way. Micromanagement is the preferred method of helping, when most times a little encouragement is all that is needed"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"When I first started with Time Warner, it was a great place to work. It still is a great place to work but there is looming concern about job security with the impending merger with Charter. Hopefully I still have a job after everything goes through"
good,"TWC is a great place to work, however the job can be very difficult if you do not have thick skin. The company provides excellent training and preparation for the tasks."
good,"Fast moving sales of Commercial accounts in the Tampa Bay area, Focus on internet, TV and video packages tp businesses. .New higher tech products are being introduced on a regular basis. Purchased by Charter Communications recently."
good,Bright House Networks is a good company to work for. The company merged with TWC and Charter and is going major changes at this time.
good,I learned a lot working here and do not regret the opportunity. The most enjoyable part about working here is that you meet different people.
good,"TWC , Learn a lot about the cable company and how to keep each customer satisfied and continuing there service,  Loved my co-workers who also help me understand different cable codes and so forth , hardest part of the job had to been the constant back to back phone calls . I loved making my own hours and picking a schedule that best fit me."
good,"There is opportunity for growth within Time Warner Cable. Great benefits and pay. A lot of incentives to win weekly based on performance, or even just simply coming into work"
good,The job is overall good. The company was purchased by Charter and is currently being revamped. I wouldn't recommend applying until after the restructure is completed.
good,Time Warner is a very good company to work for. Compensation and benefits are very fair. The work environment is full of diversity and inclusive of all.
good,"Decent company to work for, full time, decent compensation, decent benefits. Not a whole lot of room for advancement, just due to the sheer number of individuals in the entry level positions and the vastly smaller amount of promotable positions."
good,"I take care of random situations where I either use the company's database or go to look in other resources to further help and resolve a customer's issue, or I get them to the right places they need to go to help in resolving it.  Immediate management changes every year or so.  So adapting to new personalities can be challenging, but can also help in maneuvering my own abilities in workplace interactions.  I find that it can be helpful in finding ways to benefit from one another so we can help each other progress and move forward.  My co-workers are great.  I help them and they help me in many situations.  We are able to maintain a pleasant and rather enjoyable atmosphere and balance that with the work that needs to be done.  The most challenging part of this job is at the busier times of day where you must handle many complex issues one after the other, which can also be a benefit to help expand and even review through my own skills and abilities.  The most enjoyable part is being able to find the answer to rather difficult issues."
good,"This is a fast paced work environment where there is always something new to learn.  Customer equipment is returned, tested and  refurbished in this establishment.  All items must be documented and tracked all the way through the process.  Employees are trained through all phases of the testing and refurbishing and distribution of equipment to the technician. The hours for this position are great where the family life is concerned and there is room for advancement."
good,"TWC was a great place to work with a very flexible work life experience.  I would like to continue to work at TWC if not for the merger with Charter which would require a move to Stamford, CT."
good,"Time Warner Cable is a world of opportunity and growth, Having been employed at Time Warner Cable I have been introduced to internal and external customer patterns and behaviors. I was driven to learn and adapt in fast paced work environment. I am proud to be an employee at Time Warner and would like to use my experience to assist other companies."
good,TWC is a great company to work for. The culture is amazing and such a fun place to go to work. I highly recommend applying for a position in one of their locations
good,"Monitored technicians daily routes.  I learned to establish relationships with field staff and management.  Management in progress of restructuring.  Co-workers were great to work with, helpful.  A challenge to get techs to job within time frame.  Celebrating when dept. meet goals."
good,"Worked door to door in local neighborhoods from a list of prospective customers provided by the company which was about 400 leads."
good,"Long days(10 hours) the time went fast, I learned how to have good customer service skills doing this job, the hardest part of the day was working in the dark but the best part of the job was fixing the problems that the customer had."
good,"Great Benefits, Employee comp services, a lot of variety of schedules, holiday bids so you don't work every holiday, Overtime opportunities"
good,Independent work;Win over perspective customers at their homes:  Work with diverse groups in all categories of ethnicity and economic position.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"A typical work day for the company in which I am employed can be a very productive one. Challenges arise at any given time, but with proper time management and problem solving skills any task can be completed. With working with this company, I gained one key skill which is to put the customer first and provide necessary feedback upon the customer's request to make the customer know we as a company are empathetic towards their needs. One thing I enjoy most about my career at Charter is the group of individuals I interact with on a daily basis. We a truly like a family away from home."
good,I met so many good people in Time Warner Cable. From customers to colleagues. So many opportunities was given to me to learn and progress. I took advantage of it all and am very grateful.
good,"There are many great jobs at Time Warner Cable, and many different departments available to choose from. Time Warner has excellent benefits, and a good commission's plan as well, if you are a motivated salesperson.  However, working at the front counter in the location I was in, is a non stop fast pace hectic experience.  It is very unorganized, and the turnover rate is very high, so we were hardly ever able to be fully staffed, which was challenging.  This also led to long wait times for customers coming in, which had to be made up for by the excellent customer service given at the front counter.  If you can handle this job for an extended period of time, you can handle anything!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Time Warner Cable.The work environment was very fast paced. The all around atmosphere was great, but employee moral has been on a steep decline from the almost merger with Com-cast in 2015 to the now merger with Charter. "
good,"I was typically involved with daily support and management of local Domain environment, some project management, keeping many systems up to date and meeting evolving technologies. I learned about the cable industry and the infrastructure required to bring entertainment and information to homes and businesses."
good,"Good Job Opportunity,Lot of work, fun sometimes  Multi-tusk job, heavy incoming calls Customer service daily duties, technical support 24/7 etc"
good,"I was hired by Time Warner Cable to create CLEC network and migrate 6 million existing telephone subscribers from PSTN gateway provider (Sprint) to our own CLEC interconnects. Responsible for vetting on all new SIP suppliers, on-boarding, interconnect setup, trunk group ordering and production monitoring. "
good,I enjoyed my time with this company. This job keeps you on your toes when the ever growing field of cable and technology. Management staff was always available to help.
good,"Great benefits,learn something new everyday ,whether it be internal or just by having a conversation with a customer."
good,as the years progress this DSR department has gotten from bad to worst. Now charter has taken over and i felt like you pay charter to work for the company.
good,"To be a cable technician and learn all about technology is great. Also, to be able to help customers with their cable related issues was also fun and stressful sometimes. Technology is forever changing so to be at the forefront of it is good."
good,"A typical day is from 8a-5p. You spend about 1/4 of your day prospecting leads/accounts to call on (at least 40 calls outbound per day). The rest of the day you are calling on accounts for renewal and upsell opportunities."
good,"TWC overall has been a good place to work but unfortunately it's coming to an end and many of us will likely be looking for work soon, so I'm feeling bittersweet about the whole experience."
good,Driving from house to house in the workers specified territory and trying to persuade potential buyers to switch from their current cable/internet/phone provider at a better rate. Would have successfully made a better profit margin if the company hadn't made such a bad name in the area. This is due in part to the management structure of the company. Major support from direct superiors but a noticeable lack from the higher ups.
good,"I love working here, the people are wonderful and the work is very challenging.  THe benefits are wonderful.  I love doing my job coaching my employees"
good,"Well there's really not a ""typical day"" of installing cable. Everyday is different, you learn something new on each job by troubleshooting and correcting problems. Some being easier than others. You meet new people (customers) everyday and a lot of different personalities. It's really an eye opener to see how different we are, but yet how alike we are. Sound weird but it's true, and I think that's the hardest part of the job. You have to be able to ""adjust"" for example. A guy pulled his gun on me for disconnecting his service, it really shook me up. But I had another job to go to afterwards, where the people were very kind. It wouldn't be professional of comfortable to show them how shaken up I was from the previous job.So put on a smile and got the job done. The best part of the job is leaving knowing the customers were satisfied."
good,"While management was ""understanding"", there were tight policies that prevented working parents from having any flex scheduling to put their family first. Overall, the company is a great company to work for. The growth and advancement opportunities are plenty. There are a number of career opportunities and paths to explore. The  health benefits are by far the best benefit of working there. They are"
good,I enjoyed the relaxed work environment and had plenty of personal time but did not notice any opportunities for advancement.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Receive calls from existing and possible new customers who have questions about products or services and sell more services to increase monthly revenue for company.
good,"I have not worked with anyone (at least in person) that did not want to do well in their position and fix an issue or assist a customer. Training is adequate and I've never had a better supervisor, and feel that I probably never will. Management above that level does what it needs to do."
good,"Huge company with entry level positions, great training programs and opportunities for advancement."
good,get in about thirty minutes early make coffee take all messeges off the phones. i learned that people will lie for free cable. i also learned that there is a quick and efficient way to do almost anything. my co-workers where like family and the hardest part of the job was when you know the person was telling the truth about their cable but since the person whose name was on the lease actually got caught stealing then that apartment could not get service unless all accounts where paid in full. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.
good,"I worked in 3 departments at BHN each different. Overall the company was fantastic, great benefits good work environment good people. For the most part people were intelligent and knew what they were doing. Once I move to the field as a PC tech it was even more so. I was used for all sorts of projects and jobs give my extensive background in Computer IT. Once we got new management my job was forcibly changed  and I was made to do a lot more things away from my job description, they expected so much more we were unable to do our daily jobs effectively."
good,"Drove 50 miles one way to work in rain,cold and enjoyed my position while it lasted. Worked low income and high crime areas without fear."
good,"Every day was something new. Learning products, services, working with customers from all over the country.  Management was always available and willing to provide guidance and suggestions, as well as taking feedback seriously.  It was like family rather than just a job.  Hardest part was leaving, and every day was fun due to the diverse group I worked with."
good,"Typical day - canvass for new logos in assigned buildings and territories."
good,I worked at TWC for a few months but had to quit due to how they do their shift bids.  I must say they do shower their employees with incentives to perform. It is competitive but not cut throat. The benefits are great! Only down side is your schedule is based on your performance and you can easily get stuck with a horrible shift. The hardest part of my job as a retention agent was hearing complaints all day long and the mind games you have to play to retain the customers business.
good,"There is no real typical day as a CSR at TWC as you deal with a large cross section of the public. There are highs and lows and that can be from one call to the next. Some customers can be trying but mostly because they are having genuine issues with service or billing. Co-workers and management are great and generally friendly people. The challenging part is keeping your ""numbers ""in line with company expectations."
good,"Overall was a good job, as an installer my managers were great, however in Direct sales, my manager was horible. The service itself is good in certain areas but you have to deal with a lot of crazy people."
good,"A typical day at work involves opening and prepping restaurant, handling food, cash, and credit transactions "
good,"as a sales representative you are your own boss for the most part. We are only required to come into the office once a week. as long as you are making your sales goals you have nothing to worry about. the sales goals are not high at all, you can achieve your monthly quota in two weeks if you put in the time. I rarely work more than 25 hours a week and will make 50k."
good,Conducts proactive consultative needs analysis with new and current customers including developing of client solutions by obtaining all information necessary for resolution of client interactions.
good,"Charter will be changing the industry, however the level of coat tail employees, and lack of consistent priority will cause major losses. "
good,Overall the company is great! TWC provides great benefits. TWC management is ok but could use some improvement across the board when it comes to fairness.
good,"If you are looking for longevity and building relationships with your co-workers then this is the best place to work. Includes a wonderful benefits package and Free Cable, Internet, Phone and Alarm System if you live in a Time Warner Area. Only downside is the pay sucks. But if you are good at meeting your bonus criteria you can make up for it."
good,"Trouble shoot issues with their internet, landline services. Using tools provided and or web searches to find the quickest and accurate information to better assist them if not able to detect a direct issue within our network.  Also answer billing questions on their account.  There is a good feeling you are able to assist a customer to their satisfaction. Especially when they have lost hope that it can be fixed easily. I answer the next call expecting to get a big thank you for my assistance. I treat all customers the way that I expect to be treated. With respect and professional and courteous. You can tell within a few seconds as to how to handle the call. If you have to treat them with kid gloves or if you can joke with them. Make them laugh while working on their issue."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Supportive management & great place to work. Great benefits & I would have retired from there if I did not relocate to another state.
good,"I would usually go to the office first. Get on company computer system to get information on what potential and existing customers had for entertainment services.  Do paperwork for sales made the previous day.  Then I would either go to work area to contact customers to negotiate a sale or upgrade service.  Because I was a special project rep, I also had contacts for customers outside of Akron area.  I would travel to Canton, Cleveland, Youngstown and various parts of the Ohio area.  On regular occasions the first year I installed tv equipment."
good,"Company offers a great work/life balance. Benefits offered are top notch. Improved career pathing, and more opportunity for growth would be a huge plus."
good,My code of business ethics does not allow me to say much about my previous employers. I can say that it has been a positive learning experience.
good,"I worked with a really great team in Master Control in the Cypress office. My manager was totally on top of everything and had the video encoding processes down like a champion. I miss working with those guys."
good,The scheduling flexibility affords me the ability to do my job well and spend quality time with my family. The Franchise Partners and corporate office staff all work together as a team and are very willing to assist new recruiter
good,"when i worked there it was a great place to work, co workers was easy to get along with. good benefits and rewards for do well at your job. your able to advance with hard work and dedication ."
good,Excellent new lab and great people. Standard IT SILO environment/culture. Training is minimal but evaluation of new products and standards is taken seriously (lab). The new lab is a great environment to learn and grow within the ISP space. Charter has treated me well and is a good place to work.
good,"Restocking the truck to what the job loadout shows on the Ipad. "
good,I worked in sales for over 9 years with the company and was the recipient of several rewards and vacations for my efforts.  TWC always runs incentives so that employees are all on the same page.  We would have a sales meeting once a week and do sales with issued leads that were rated by closing percentages.  Management was effective at motivating representatives.  The co-workers are now friends and stay and touch with me after leaving to work at another company.  The hardest part of the job was losing commissions because of install issues.  The most enjoyable part was the flexibility.
good,"Answered questions, making changes and upselling products for the cable customers needs.  Submitting work orders for repairs and new services."
good,"This company was a great opportunity for me at the time and I hated that I had to leave. however that's Corporate America, you never know your job security."
good,Cable is practically free! People are awesome! Many job opportunities. Not that great for raises. Some departments no chances for bonuses. But overall good place.
good,"This is a very large employer who has a very good benefit package, You will have to really be proactive in your networking to gain opportunity for advancement, the hardest part about my job is that it can become monotonous and overwhelming, I really enjoyed knowing that I played a direct part in a customers entertainment experience"
good,pretty ok company to work for. it takes a while to make good money. you would need to put some years in order to reach the mid point. atleast 10 years.
good,A great learning experience. I was able to learn various other program/ project management strategies that I can implement into my own existing library. Great people to work with .
good,Its a fairly good place to work. The people you work with are great and there are many events that go on during the year. Ive learned that there is much room for growth within the company.
good,The work environment within this company was great as were the people.  The job itself is extremely stressful. The only issue I can say I had was the fact that you were required to deal with a great deal upset customers.
good,Unfortunately my department fell prey to having the workers performance graded to suit the managers preferences. Everything was in us to perform up to an imaginary level. Otherwise this was a fine company to work for.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Very extensive training on-site, very good customer service on and off the phones. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers, they were all a very great group of people."
good,"a typical day at work is meetings and conference calls 12 hours a day, 7 days a week."
good,Good experience.  The jobs offers great benefits and peaceful work environment.  One of the retail jobs I enjoyed working the most.
good,While working at Time Warner I was allowed to work independently but was also part of a team. I was responsible for keeping inventory and supplies in my work truck. I functioned as a lead tech where I handled training of new techs and special projects. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and getting to work outside. There were some places that did not have the most sanitary conditions and that wasn't enjoyable.
good,"Allow me to share my ideas and utilize my skills, to help potentially with the Departments needs."
good,Working at charter has improved my abilities to interact with customers as well as fellow coworkers. i have also gained skills that can be used in daily life outside of work.
good,"rather not talk about it."
good,"management always help you to get any sales but sales not some time not goes thru, witch make you incompetence and make your number goes down along whit your salary"
good,"Overall the schedule is generally full. There are always changes happening so the staff is quite busy. Overall team is very positive, cohesive and productive."
good,Installing and disconnecting cable TV was a great job great learning experience multiple levels of system to learn. co-workers hard working and willing to teach all aspects of job. Management also takes employees under their wing as long your willing to put in the effort.
good,"-Place outbound calls to prospective and current customers to add and upgrade services."
good,A typical day included working closely with customers and other techs to complete installation or maintenance of cable systems inside customers homes. Management was decent. Other techs were pretty good. could always go to someone to find answers to questions.
good,"In this position, worked with all customers who were interested in cancelling their services.  By speaking with them on a more personal  level and asking the necessary questions to determine why they were interested in cancelling."
good,Everyjob is not for everyone. Just try it for yourself you never know. Just go in with an open mind. All jobs have good and not so good people. Good luck
good,"Each day consisted in maintaining a Professional and Courteous Manner and to provide Excellent Service. What i learned was that a Technician is a very Strenous and Physical job. I Enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers, the Camraderie and the Knowledge that was shared. The hardest part of the job was learning to adapt to the heavy ladders and climbing Electrical Poles through Obstacles. The level of Trust and Independence given to me made My Job Enjoyable and Worthwhile!"
good,"Working with customers in there home is both challenging and rewarding. Creating personal connections with the customer helps provide a better experience for both them and me. Trouble shooting television, phone, and internet services provides an enjoyable and challenging day. Helping customers through a frustrating experience can be quite difficult, but taking the time to do the job right generally leaves them satisfied by the time I'm through."
good,Good environment to work. Always new experiences in the field. Great benefits and retirement. You are your own boss. Co-workers are great to work with. Management is constantly changing along with procedures.
good,Time Warner sales department is a highly competitive area with unlimited earning potential. I learned a lot of valuable sales skills from the management team as well as the ability to manage time.
good,"This place was ok to work for, it was pretty exciting on game days because of all the people you get to interact with, My co workers were fun and I liked them a lot. we all got along , the hardest part of the job was the constant standing but other than that it was a good job and fun environment."
good,"Great company to work for. Great room for advancement, and great employee benefits."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,It was a learning experience got to meet a lot of fun people and enjoyed the free cable for many years
good,Pretty much your day consist of sitting at a desk taking calls and troubleshooting internet and phone issues over the phone for 8 hours. I have learned many things in regard to how internet and phone works. I the hardest part of my job is trying to satisfy an irate customer that is cussing and screaming at you. The most enjoyable part of my job is resolving an issue a customer is having with their equipment.
good,"It was a secure place of employment that always guaranteed work, but had very hectic hours and had a lot of mandatory overtime."
good,Would pick all MSRs. Would do a weekly cycle count. Run MRP every Monday. Receive and put away material after matching packing slip with purchase order. Hard part of job dealing with weather. Going extra mile to get techs needed equipment.
good,I worked for TWC for 5 years and in that time I saw many changes.  From new products like VOIP to new work practices like Home Start.  The management staff are supportive and involved.  I had a great experience working there.  Unfortunetly the Home Start program made the job culture die off.  As my co-workers and I didn't need to come into the office daily we seemed to loose track of each other throughout the week.
good,"I worked second shift from 3:30 p.m. to 12:00 a.m."
good,Things are constantly changing and it is not a proactive work environment.
good,over all environment was good.  had good bennies and free coffee all day.  special food trucks came by and some times free food.  mostly accommodating.  Time was the only enemy on calls.
good,"A Federal reseller for many enterprise SW vendors, with GSA Schedule and SEWP contract."
good,Typical Sales job great incentives and commission. Sales goal unrealistic.
good,"I loved working for this company.  I loved the product they provided customers which made my job of selling the product much easier.  The hourly compensation was not that great however, I did receive commission for every sale I made.  Most of the management there knew me since I was a little child since my mother was a lifer at this company.  My only complaint about working for this company was that my job was to try and sell customers more products however, I was working for this company during the time period in which they did not carry the Big Ten Network and basically everyone I called was furious.  This problem has long since been resolved."

He/she will be sent to the front lines to test their newly acquired skills and prove they are, indeed, everything Charter Communications is looking for. Expect to deal with all types of environments from blistering heat to sub-freezing rain, all while making sure that your job is done in a manner that would bring honor to your family. The most enjoyable part of my job was every Wednesday we would get breakfast during our meetings."
good,"A typical day start off reading emails to make sure I know all new changes to plans and or services, once I understand all changes I hold a brief meeting with all cusotmer service reps to ensure they also know the same information. After that I am dealing with warehouse and inventory to ensure we are fully stock and emptied all materials and equipment not needed such as returned goods, middle part of my day has to do with accounting which could consist of opening batches and closing payment batches reviewing accuracy of all paperwork before we file all receipts from prior day. Managememnt is really only in the picture when there is something urgent or drastic changing, which there are often changes in this job whether it is policy, operational, or service changes. Hardest part of the job is being short staffed often, because they tend to over staff the larger stores and under staff the smaller ones. I enjoy the multitasking simply because my day is never the same."
good,Overall the best company i have ever worked for. the job itself was very rewarding if you enjoy working with/and for the people
good,"A typical day at the Charter store would be to greet customer walk ins, take payments, sell products, discuss billing issues, troubleshoot technical issues with tv, internet or phone, during customer down time is the time to follow up on emails, do equipment and correspondence forms and take a break.  I have learned to be very patient and a little more outgoing than normal.  I've also learned how to handle stress and its ok to rely on co workers to help reduce the load."
good,Good company  but did not like the way a lot of things were handled. I can recall almost everyday goals were asked to be met that were unattainable.
good,"Time Warner Cable is a very stable work environment.  I worked there for over 13 years because I enjoyed my work, co-workers and the opportunities available for advancement,"

I learned to deal with all types of customers in their own environment as I did door to door sales. Also learned that the company did have some customers with past negative issues but I was able to turn the majority of them around with persistence and more personal service. Management was great as all they wanted you to do was SELL! I always exceed my goals by almost double so I was not given much supervision. I did not interact with my co-workers except during meeting and training  sessions. Was responsible for training most new hires as I was senior. The hardest part of my job was dealing with negative issue pertaining to past customer service issues. This could have come from billing, installations, equipment, etc. The most enjoyable part was turning around a negative issue into a positive. Teaching customers how to get maximum enjoyment from the services they wanted."

I then take it to my manager so he can just the counts then leave."

good,"Take calls, Assist the customers, Make appointments, Answering customer concerns, Sales, Retention, Tech Support"
good,"A typical day at work would begin with making sure that all of my windows were up that I would need throughout the day. I would learn about any new offers that were now available to our customers. I would also check in with management with a simple ""good morning"" as well as to my co-workers. The hardest part of my job would be the unknown as far as how the customers mood may be because at times a customer may call in and not be too happy.

good,The day would seem to fly by with as much that needed to be done. little downtime allowed for some great opportunities to learn
good,"The typical day was a selling enviornment. Competition is everywhere, but all management and supervisors care about are their 'top performers' of their own teams.

You seriously can not find this kind of commission plan anywhere else. The problem is, is that there is no way to advance. There are no raises and eventually you will notice that your earning potential becomes stagnat. It is also highly competitive and your job is never really safe."
good,A typical day included taking customer calls to set up/ upgrade services. I've learned the ability of negotiation and up-selling from my experience here. The environment is relaxed but business like. You have the potential to make a lot once you apply yourself.
good,"Great environment fun friendly staff, MUST have self disipline"
good,"low stress job, but the systems are complicated and there are no promotions or room for career change."
good,Charter was an upbeat and a consistantly busy arena to work in. Call center environment was high in moral due to paid incentives to upsell products and services to customers. Constant change due to business needs. Solid 40 hr work week with multiple shift options.

good,"I worked in the Outbound sales dept which was closed locally in Albany and moved to Raleigh, NC."
good,"Overall the work experience, liberal attitude and great benefits make TWC a great place to work. Aside from the rigors of an active call center which does require a certain fortitude and social skill, the job I performed while at TWC did not have a great degree of difficulty. The hardest part of the job I would say is the call volume day to day and a multitude of different customer problems and the always changing policies TWC imposed. Despite those issues which tend to be prevalent in an active call center the job experience was a lesson in patience and a good experience"
good,Most enjoyable part of my job was working with my customer base. I had many customers for years and developed a great relationship.
good,"Working here is a great place, demanding very demanding, but sales is not for me. I am not a sales man or pretend to be one!"

good,"What impresses me most about this company and the office I work in the most, is that they really do mean ""the customer means everything."" Charter is trying very hard to change its image, and it is succeeding, but of course, nothing happens overnight."
good,typical day at work is going in sitting at your computer for 8hrs an talking to customers while they argue with you over the phone an put the blame all on you as you answer the phone. What I learned is that its the person on the phones doing of an issue its just the company its self. My managers an co works are all amazing an really great to talk to.
good,"I have been with Charter Communications for almost 5 years. I enjoy working with the group of people I work with. Direct management is easy to talk to about any issues you may be having. The hardest part about this job is actually the location. With gas being as high as it is, I would love to work closer to home. Not always possible, I know."
good,"I loved my job at TWC, my management was very hands off in my department and they trusted me to get my work done. I enjoyed my co-workers and liked my day to day job duties of training new hires and existing employees."
good,"A typical day at Time Warner for me started at 9:30 and ended at 8 p.m i did work 4 10s driving around Niagara county in there company vehicle installing and servicing TWC services. Which included television, internet, wireless internet, and home phone service.I worked in residential and commercial business wiring and repairing Rg6 cable wire as well as setting up customer premise equipment. I worked in small crawl spaces as well as attics in every type of weather WNY has to throw at us. I worked independently every day with brief 1 hr meetings in niagara falls to gather equipment. We used work assure as our primary tool to access our jobs for the day. As technicians we worked from home and used their company vehicle. We also once a month had to do inventory on our equipment we kept in our vans. Unfortunately Time Warner Cable was going through lots of changes in standardizing their company and streamlining it which led to lots of confusion on policy and metrics. The hardest part of my job was trying to figure out what would cause wirelesss problems inside business and residential homes. So many things can cause problems from lead paint to interference of microwaves, dryers,same signal,and distance. However i really enjoyed the independence and challenges i faced day to day. Although the job is the same, every house and cusomert was different which led to many interesting experiences."
good,"Inbound calls from Los Angeles customers, troubleshooting, sales, billing inquiries in a call center setting. I learned to be patient with people at all times. The management favored a-lot of people in my opinion. My co-workers were wonderful. The hardest part was to sell the products over the phone to irritated consumers. I loved the incentives, bonuses, and the prize challenges."
good,"I was with TWC for a year and a half. I advanced to a better department after about 8 months. The money was great. I was part-time. Most of the people was great as well. As an employee, I cant say that I had any bad experiences while with the company. But what I will say, is TWC needs to work on their Customer Service."
good,With any communications company it is a fast growing and ever changing world. Up to date education on new products and software is a must.

good,"A typical day at work for me an vary from day to day. We have a fun, friendly and busy enviroment and things can change from one minute to the next, this is what keeps me on my toes. Some of the things I have learned at charter is teamwork, making quick decisions that I am empowered to make. Every problem has a resolution and my job was to find the root to each problem and come to a resolution that is benefitial for the customer and the company as well. The part of my job that is the hardest is putting myself in some of the customer's shoes and knowing that I I can't please everyone, even as some of them may be going through tuff times and truly can't afford service. The most enjoyable part of my job is being around my coworkers, we are all like one big family."
good,"Time Warner was always looking for ways to streamline the business while improving the customer experience. When hired, I was tasked with restructuring the entire Southwest Division. Within two months we had a 300% increase in productivity and within six months, we had an increase of 450% productivity. The work was challenging and often required work from home and multiple conference calls throughout the day, some late in the evening to account for participants in various time zones."

good,Generally long days with a good amount of physical work combined with a customer facing environment - its not for everyone but can be very rewarding for many!
good,"A typical day at work here involves taking about 60-80 calls a day. The pay is good, the benefits are awesome and job security is not an issue at all. If you do your job you have nothing to worry about. A few of the team managers suck, but for the most part management is there to help you and will help with any question or problem you may have. The co-workers I had were awesome! The hardest part of the job was the monthly goals were mostly unattainable, though I think this was to give the sales force something to shoot for. The most enjoyable part of the job was bonding with customers which happened alot."
good,"take calls from all over southern california about their services with TWC. Learned to overcome obstacles and objections, management taught you to be perfect. Co-workers were excellent people, enjoyed being around my co-workers."

good,• Make outbound phone calls to customers and offer products.
good,As a project coordinator my day was filled with meetings with internal and external partners. TWC is eager to make the right changes to accomplish good business decisions. My co-workers were motivated to improve their services to their customers.

good,"Customer sales can be stressful, Spectrum  does make sure you are well trained and prepared for company changes.Before the merge  bonus was favorable but with the change it seemed to be more customer base and employees were replaceable."
good,They try to find every little thing to write you up for and will eventually lead up to them firing you. They put trackers on your vehicle and if you are anywhere near where you aren't suppose to be they will write you up.
good,Really enjoy my learning experience at Spectrum Reach and the people that surround me. It is a fast paced environment with lots of opportunity to learn new advertising metrics.
good,"There are many great, passionate and hardworking employees that love their job at Spectrum which creates a work environment. Also, the benefits are good."

good,"A typical day includes receiving 30+ calls per day for Internet & Phone support. Management provides good support when needed. Workplace culture is good, as they provide activities and incentives to improve morale. Advancement is based on phone metrics, and it can be difficult to advance or qualify for shift bids for better hours. Handling difficult calls is never easy, but I have learned to use positive phrasing to improve communication. The most enjoyable part is resolving Internet or Voice issues for the customers."
good,"excellent benefits: 401K,medical, dental, vision & life insurance options, free and discounted video,internet and digital phone services, comparable wages."
good,I was an inbound sales agent. The calls would vary and after a while we’re just exhausting to deal with. I did very well and the compensation was good which is the only reason I stayed as long as I did.
good,"Spectrum/ twc is a good company, great benefits and the comission structure is really nice! But if you dont make sales goals you can easily be termed!"
good,"The money was great in sales if you sell and hit and exceed monthly goals. It is the highest paying job I ever had, and if there was still a sales dept in Colorado springs I would still be there, but they switched the center into customer care instead which is no money."
good,"1.- Busy but good days"
good,"Working with spectrum, has great benefits including complimentary services. chances to move up in the company and chances to grow. Charter Communication is a wonderful entry level establishment to customer service."
good,"Walk the floor assisting reps with questions."
good,"At the location I worked at they had desk that can be adjusted to ones's height. Your space was yours you didn't have to worry about coming in the next day and someone was sitting at your desk. You work with multiple screens, so there is multi-tasking involved"
good,Yes.  It is high stress because you deal with guest payment issues and complaints.  The culture is supportive but fluctuates between flexible and conservative based on trends in the company.
good,Company culture and getting a long with others was important here and employee appreciation seems to almost always be apparent. Upper management has an open door policy and had no issues other than personal challenges and the advancement of myself while working here.

Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Pretty good pay for the amount of work you do. You do have to have a hustler mentality though. It’s very competitive but you do get a great 100% discount on services.
good,Many good and bad memories and learning experience. Loved the small scale office I worked in and I stayed until my office in Hagerstown was shut down.
good,"I have only been a contractor at Spectrum, but would jump at the opportunity to be a full-time employee.  The culture is friendly, the work interesting, the atmosphere is professional and I really like working there."
good,Charter was fun and fast paced in the sales departments. I felt you spend to much time tied into charter as a manager and left little time for family and social activities.
good,"Great job, need more communication with employees as technology changes or changes in rules or system changes. Lack of flexable schedules. Need more time to train on the important aspect of the job."
good,Spectrum is a great organization. Medical Benefits. Dental Benefits. PTO. Great work environment. Supportive Management. Freedom to customize your salesman pitch. Base Salary
good,"I learned so much at Charter Communications/Spectrum lab at CTEC.  While other companies may require certifications for career advancement, at Spectrum, I actually used all of the IEEE 802.11 spec on a day to day basis for our extensive wireless testing.  Devices were put through rigorous automated testing, Upstream/Downstream/Bidirectional, Latency, Voice Quality, etc.  If a device did not meet the specified requirements, then it would not go to market."
good,"Cannot really comment on Spectrum, as I worked for Time Warner Cable. However TWC was a great place to work. Fast paced, exciting place to work. The only down-side was the less than stellar wages, benefits were awesome!"
good,I was employed with TWC when it was bought by Charter and Merged to become Spectrum. Overall the change wasnt to bad. Alot of Rules did change including the Ever changing metrics. Of course the customers are sometimes aggravating or rude and call volume can def be high. But overall its manageable. And long as you have great supervisors like I did you'll do fine. The benefits are great esp the health insurance and PTO. I was there from 2015-2018.
good,"Pay was great. Super generous benefit package, including free cable with all the extras and internet and phone. Health insurance was awesome. Frequent potlucks and employee appreciation."
good,"I found it rewarding to help customers troubleshoot their internet and phone lines of business. The job is a great start for people new to the call center and tech support field such as myself. The hardest part of the job had to be call control while retaining the rapport you just built with the customer. Stats are important, as with any job and the management is there to help you succeed with the weekly coachings and weekly team meetings. My leadership worked diligently to provide floor support and keep agents aware of active events.  The workplace culture tended to be inclusive and an all-for-one attitude. The Fun Committee worked hard to keep up entertained and engaged at work, including cookouts to local charity work. I learned a fair deal about how telecommunications work and added to my customer service skills from this great job.  So long as you can take the heat that customer service representatives everywhere face, this job was one of the easiest and satisfying of this type."
good,"A typical day at work is never a dull moment when it comes to HR. It is very fulfilling when you deal with employee relations, new hire training or any questions an employee may have. The culture is instilled during new hire training and it is enhanced during the practical training experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we have helped an employee or management solve issues or complex problems in which we can advice or provide guidance on."
good,Great company to work but depending on your position and location the pay may affect you. The company pays commission but it only paid out at a percent. That's what I don't agree with because I believe one should get paid for the work achieved and done. If you miss the sales goal by one... no commission paycheck next month. I am hourly too but when one relies on commission too it's become challenging.
good,This company is a fast paced place to work with varying levels of job and customer involvement. The days are 8 - 10 hours and the teams work well together.
good,"Good benefits, pay and commission, bad customer service for closing the only store for 50 miles. Coworkers are wonderful and customers are mostly nice."
good,"When they had slowed down the calls to let you breathe the job was fine. Biggest issue was customers being difficult, it's always your fault and they have no idea how WiFi works. "
good,"A little old school but overall a good place to work."
good,"Absolutely enjoyed my time here, great pay, amazing hours, you could honestly make as much as you wanted as long as you were willing to put in the time to earn it."
good,Great company with good benefits! Company 401k match (6% match + 3%bonus) is best I have ever seen! Employees are treated with respect and office has a good vibe.
good,"Been a field technician is not a easy job anymore, nothing like the old days of paper work and CB radio, now is metrics you have to meet and be on compliance all the time. In the old days we all had time to have lunch with the team. Here now is just you and your busy phone and demanding customers.Jobs now one hour time frame, don’t be late, ETA, OTA. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Great place to work with room for advancement if you want it. There are good benefits and schedules are flexible. The people are good to work with and training is excellent.
good,Great work environment. I would suggest this job to anyone. It is also a very diverse place to work. Competitive pay and cutting edge technology makes this company a gem.
good,Company has a great relationship between management and employees. Able to start from home. Compenation could me a little bit more competitive. The company has great benefits.
good,a typical day at work is talking calls and helping customers with there needs. going over bills and making orders. everything else is easy. idk what to say about management
good,Company benefits allowed me to obtain my college degree through employee assistance program.  Allowed growth and hired from within first.  Allowed time for family as well.
good,All co workers were great and willing to help out the new people.  Great atmosphere and fun. Company went above and beyond for employees by providing lunches and praises on jobs well done.
good,Stable steady job. Growth opportunities from the start yet slow down later in career. Great people to be around with job security. Lots a benefits from the company
good,"Regulalry scheduled breaks spread through out shift. "
good,"IT IS  good place to work. They have a lot of meetings but that is a part of being a project manager."
good,The environemnt was very fast-paced. There was job always to be done. The average day went by quickly. Help was alway on the way if you needed it even the supervisor would come out to assist.
good,It's very fast paced in the daytime and stressful. You get yelled at often about things that customers don't like about the company that aren't because of you.
good,"The overall experience as a direct sales rep for Spectrum is positive. The pay structure is attainable, usually. You can make a LOT of money. The culture has changed to be less enjoyable than it was but it's not too bad yet. Your work time is pretty flexible, during the day, so you can do some things you want/need even while you work."
good,"Provided customer services, sales, and product demonstration for electronic gadget retail store in shopping mall heavily frequented by national and international tourist."
good,"Been employed almost 2 years at Spectrum.  Benefits are good and the free cable/home services are a huge plus."
good,"I enjoyed this role greatly.  The company is going through a lot of change, but the senior field leadership is down-to-earth, and collaborative.   The people here are great almost universally."
good,"I worked in the Call Center.  You answer calls after calls.  You get to hear people at their best and worst on the phone.  It also gives one a sense of power, responsibility, and practice with ones listening skills."
good,Management in flux with senior team changes common.  My tem was silo'd making it difficult to function across multiple departments. Freedom was given to run my relationships with little oversight
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere of the Spectrum call center. We always had Power Hours where you could be rewarded for an up sell during the hour. The place I worked also played music and had multiple TV's playing different things. Often times they ordered pizza if you worked a certain event.
good,Good work environment; work atmosphere is mission then people.  Solid pay; varied management silos.  Lots of hard work / hours;  could improve 'team' atmosphere across departmental / geographical lines to bolster bottom line.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Worked there in 2015 for a short amount of time. Management was not great, again in 2015. could be different now. Pay was great I would almost consider going back for a while because of the pay, benefits, and how easy the job was."
good,Our group was like a family. I miss everyone I worked with. We worked as a team. All worked together and built the distribution center we worked out of. Benefits were very generous. Last day was very hard for everyone there.
good,"I liked this job and would go back in a heart beat, it's at least worth trying once and seeing if it's for you. they pay more now than when I worked for them."
good,"I don't know why you ask about Spectrum when I worked at Time Warner, but it was a job I would have retired from if my department had not closed.  I loved being part of Time Warner and would go back if Spectrum would have me."
good,Decent job at first but company made changes that negatively effected their field technicians. Made it extremely difficult to work in certain environments.
good,"I may have just had a great manager but this job was great to me. Great benefits, alright pay and the easiest troubleshooting calls you could imagine.  They were flexible with my schedule to accommodate my crazy schedule with my family. In the end i had to leave due to an injury that made it hard to be stationary for 8 hours a day but they did their best to help right until the end and my company insurance covered alot of my treatment. If i ever went back to a call center id probably go back to work there."
good,"great benefits, was much better as TWC, I miss the old culture and all that was done for employees and the community as a whole. I have worked here 6 years and seen alot of change"
good,"Worked with property managers of MDU to promote my position in having new tenants contact me directly and set up new accounts for them. "
good,"Charter communications was a very good company to work for. they offered a competitive benefits package with plenty of on the job training. While working with the company I was trained ""In House"" by many installation and maintenance technicians. learning about radio frequency levels, troubleshooting techniques and and the installation of cable equipment was a large contributor to my goal to become a lineman."
good,"As an installer technician, no two days were alike.  Each day, a different set of customers would be assigned to your route.  When every location is different from the next, you tend to experience all sorts of situations, ranging from easy to handle to very complicated.  You get to meet a lot of interesting people too from all walks of life."
good,Decent company to work for. Good benefits. Management was better than most and provided the necessary tools to complete any job the right way. Spectrum bought Time Warner and that was a huge deal.
good,"I found this job fun at times and stressful at other times. I found most people there were friendly and professional. great having reduced or free cable, internet and phone service."
good,I had 5 years at Time Warner Cable / Spectrum and was provided opportunities to advance and move up to more interesting and better paying jobs from the beginning.  I would gladly work there again.
good,Awesome place to work.Great environment and helpful supervisors. Flexibility on swapping days or hours with other agents. I would definitely recommend working here.
good,"depends on where you work within the company. I'm on the customer service side with project managing, and so far my experience has been positive for a few reasons."
good,Professional and productive environment. Training programs provided were pertinent and assisted in furthering career path. Management worked well together towards common goal.
good,Do the job you are hired to do and you are fine. Things change quickly and you have to adjust to changes in order to move within this company. Promotion from within is great
good,"Spectrum is a nice place to work, several opportunities to move up or laterally to other positions. Most departments are by the book and operate ethically, others are slightly questionable but overall this company is pretty good with good benefits!"
good,Great opportunities for growth and development. Amazing benefits for all level of employment. Salaries are fair and commission earnings are very generous.
good,Great place to work. It's hard to advance in job but it is a great place to work. Benefits could be better. Field tech team is great.  Managers are helpful.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Leadership was great at Spectrum before I left.  Main reason why I left was because Spectrum kept cutting back on any way they can pay us and tried to make it seem like it was a good thing.  Starting salary was $40k when I started.  New hires were given $24k by the time I left with a much less aggressive commission plan.
good,In this role you work on call 24/7 every 6 weeks with very little compensation.  You are expected to work on call and come in the office and do your job.
good,"Pleasant work environment with Managers and Supervisors willing to help you be successful in your position. Looked forward to going to work. Loved the job training, co-workers, managers and supervisors, and was looking forward to doing the job. 6 week training was intense with a lot of product information. Quit because there were no part-time positions available."
good,"I've spent many years working for Time Warner Cable and a couple more after their transition into Spectrum. One thing remained the same- the focus on balancing the needs/wants of the customers, and educating their representatives on how to provide those services."
good,"I worked as an inbound sales associate. Charter spectrum does offer good benefits and good pay, but their standards and expectations are high as well. Eventhough they give you extensive trainings and tools to achieve goals, it is hard to meet them especially when you are not accustomed in sales. It is also not a place for people who wears their heart on their sleeves because you will encounter customers that would not commit to spectrum."
good,"Over my years at Spectrum I have had the opportunity to learn from great leaders."
good,"I was on the phones with Customers. I was a Mentor, Customer Service, Sales, Billing  and Troubleshooting."
good,"Spectrum Reach, in particular, is slowly figuring things out still as they are trying to merge 3 companies into one (Time Warner, Brighthouse, and Charter). As joining while they merger is coming about, my experience as been overall positive. The management is great and the workload is fair. Although the world of cable/ telecommunications is new to me, the technology used to very familiar. Being able to learn quickly and apply what you learned is key because there are projects left and right that you may get into. Being able to piece together things with little information and reaching out to people you may only talk to a few times is key as well. There is also room to advance your knowledge and career, if you so choose. Many co-workers have been with the company for years and few have been in the same job title for several years. You make your own bed and advance in your own terms."
good,"Operated company truck to commute to customers homes to help with services. "
good,"The inbound sales department is very fast paced and very competitive. This is typical of most sales environments. Management for the most part is supportive, but of course their compensation is tied to your production. Overall is a very good place to work and if you apply yourself the sales goals are achievable."
good,doesnt matter what you do theyre going to try and keep you unless you keep messing up but they will continue to try and teach you how to properly get the job done.
good,The company as a whole is no different from any other large National company. But I liked my job but it has it ups and downs like any other. The company does appreciate it's employees and shows it by providing kudos when warranted and taking the time assist you when needed. Also the company did it's best to provide motivation both professionally and personally by means of honoring their employees with rewards to good work and accomplishments. But also allowing their employees to enjoy working their by provide extra curricular activities like celebrating holidays and events and encouraging employee participation in doing so also. But the work was fast paced and tedious at times as well.
good,"I had a great time interacting with customers and employees. The employee worksite had an exercise room, pool table, large couch and  TV, and free coffee."
good,"It was hard to leave the company knowing how close I got with everyone in the location. There is definitely a sense of community,even if at times it does seem a bit clique-ish. "
good,"I was provided training opportunities to perform a variety of jobs, and was allowed to attempt new challenges when requested. The hardest part of the job was having overtime discontinued. Our team needed the extra hours due to the wide variety and priority of services we performed."
good,for the time i was working with time warner and now spectrum i enjoyed helping business customers with the needs of the business.  Recommending the services such as internet speeds and phone.
good,"If you like call centers Spectrum is really great. Awesome Benefits, Great pay, quick to move up. Caring management and support when needed. Overall great place to work."
good,I worked at Spectrum for about a year then had to relocate. Best job I've had though. They pay pretty well and as long as you can handle the stress its a pretty good job overall
good,"I enjoyed my time with Charter, and felt my boss treated me well.  I enjoyed working in the 11 Western Mass Towns I was responsible for and working between departments at the company."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Typical training day 8-5 while being passed around to people"
good,"It is great place to work if you can meet you goal monthly, very fast pace, I would still be there if my office hadn't been shut down due to the merger that took place. I enjoyed it a lot and loved the people I worked with"
good,"Opportunity for growth good benefits good pay"
good,"Worked in Door to Door Sales."
good,I enjoyed working for this company but unfortunately the company was going in a different  direction and I was called to work for MTA and I chose to take the opportunity.
good,"The director of SMB Service Delivery is amazing. Assisted with learning additional skills while increasing an employees production and motivation. "
good,"Love my job working in customer service it's the management that has a lot to be desired.  Back stabbing amongst employees and supervisors as well. "
good,"This is a great platform to start your career. There are many challenges with scheduling but once you are able to overcome this, everyone is generally very easy to work with."
good,"Great company that cares about its employees. Has the same problems that any large company with thousands of employees have, but keeps us informed and educated and has lots of room to grow."
good,8 Hour shift with great team work; teammates help each other out ; retaining customers was a bit hard when have little lee way to work with discounts and promotions; the hardest part of the job was losing 20 plus tenured customers
good,"Over 10 years of employment, I found it to be a postive and supportive environment with Time Warner Cable. Managers and coworkers were supportive and enjoyable to work with in a rewarding work environment, then position was eliminated under Spectrum"
good,Good place to work.  I would recommend this company to anyone looking to start or continue their career.  There is room for upward movement in this company.
good,"Although you work in an environment where customers are constantly yelling at you, the culture itself is fun and relaxing. Unfortunately, like any company, you will have that one person in management that will sour your experience."
good,The job is alright where i work not difficult by any means. My boss is a great guy very hard working and goes out of his way to get things done. The people are alright everyone kinda does there own thing. id recommend getting hired on if you can.
good,"Spectrum gives you a lot of incentives to be an employee with the company. Paid vacation, advancement opportunities, and great benefits. While working and doing your job is great, management could be better. I felt like management was unstable or unorganized at times. However, getting great pay and benefits while being your own boss is not bad and makes the job worthy of applying."
good,"I have been a field tech their about six months now. the starting pay is good and they push you to take your class so you will make more. Management is always there to help or answer any question you may have. I have called my supervisor hours after they got off and he still answered and was happy to help me figure something out. "
good,"great company ti work for great enviroment all around, awesome.techinians great benefits always provide all tools to work with , have own companytruck"
good,Charter has set its sites on becoming a mobile technology company. This has opened numerous opportunities for growth and expansion. You can start as a technician and work your way up to any level you desire if you learn well and perform well.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Working with spectrum was a challenging yet great experience because I love challenges. You will have to be an avid learner, active listener and problem solver. You must be able to make great and rationale decisions."
good,I was really only with Spectrum for a short period as Charter Communications purchased Time Warner Cable. I did not have enough time in with Spectrum to provide a fair review.
good,It is a lot of work but if you do it well you are rewarded! Love the company and benefits! Stay on your toes with every customer interaction and you will succeed.
good,I found a job that i fell in love with. My manager was aware that this operation was to be terminated so we just casually went about our daily routine under no pressure whatsoever.
good,It was an okay job! Had good time with my co workers! They lunch room was cool! Great on break when i needed food to go back to my desk! everyone treated each other great
good,I worked in a retail store as a Lead. The company is a great one to work for. They have great benefits and pay competitively. My position earned monthly incentive pay based on sales.
good,This position requires you to upsell the products and services. You can take 50-80 calls per day. The morale is great and rhe environment was wonderful.
good,"Great working environment, really good work schedule, good hours, great employees working for me, nice company uniforms to wear to work, a good place to work for first-time employees"
good,"A typical day you can find yourself working on several things at once and if anyone calls in you'll be sure to make up for their lack of productivity. Although work can be fast paced and the load heavy the pay and benefits are generally adequate, w/ 401k at a 6% match and full medical, visions, dental, long and short term disability. Under the umbrella of field operation you are given more discretion to make your own decision and you are mostly speaking with technicians all day rather than customers. There are no high pressure metrics and no sales driven incentives, though this is a refreshing way to work the lack of advancement will ultimately become an issue."
good,"A typical day at work, log in and start grabbing cases, work the oldest to the newest, or the higher priority cases first. you do have a minimum number of cases you are required to work everyday, but that is an easy number to hit."
good,"Most of my career was with Time Warner Cable, where I worked alongside some fantastic teammates. We have employees in different parts of the country, but we collaborated as if we were sitting next to each other. We would meet in NYC often for planning, training, team building and meeting major deadlines. Most of the time, we communicated by phone, instant messenger and our project management system."
good,Spectrum is the same as Spectrum Sports which I work for on an as needed freelance basis through Randstad.  I work with a dedicated group of lifelong video production professionals who enjoy their jobs to the fullest.
good,As broadband cable tech I installed and repaired from connection at the pole to the device in the house. I enjoyed providing and repairing these services.
good,Enjoy everything about it. only negative i have about the place was the management. their was no communication between the employee and the manager. and things weren't getting done in a timely fashion matter when it came to requesting of things.
good,"The best part of the company is that they were family orientated, had christmas parties, picnics, auctions. cared about employees as if they were family."
good,"A typical day of work would involve clocking in and after about 1 minute, there is a call coming in on your line. You would speak to the customer for maybe 7 minutes and then you shoud be wrapping up after solving the reason for calling, thanking and recapping. As i stated I enjoyed working at both companies overall. Nice atmosphere. Fun people."
good,"Really enjoy the team and management I am currently working with.  They are understanding, supportive, and helpful.  Enjoy coming to work.  Work environment feels like family.  Able to get a lot of work done while enjoying interactions with the people on the team."
good,"Working in the Syracuse Spectrum Newsroom is filled with ups and downs each and every day. There are times of extreme stress, with deadlines, breaking news, technical difficulties, etc. But those times are always matched with feelings of pride, success, and a strong camaraderie among co-workers."
good,I worked for a company by the name of Charter communications. I learned a lot and gained a huge amount of troubleshooting and sales experience. I would work for them again in a heartbeat. the reason I left was for a better paying job.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Spectrum is a company that offers a great opportunity for anyone looking to grow in their perspective career field. They offer many options to increase your knowledge about your career field, advance and excel in what you set out to do. I would recommend Spectrum to everyone."
good,The work environment was educational and collaborative. Managers supported you acquiring education for new tech tools. Employees communication as an enterprise was very clear and effective.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Spectrum and really miss my co-workers and I hope I get to see them again.  I had a really good schedule working for Specturm.  I had the opportunity to work from home and that I really enjoyed.  It was a really fun place to work.  There were many events that were planned by the support staff to make life at the office a little less boring.  They really took care of us.  Pizza parties and special events that brought many famous people to our office. Those events were great.
good,As a supervisor you have a very good upper management team to work with. They want you to succeed in your position. A down side you have younger agents without  a very mature work ethic.
good,"Extremely competitive career, where you compete against your coworkers for commission.  Since inbound calls, you can not control what calls come in, hence, could be a customer care call which hurts your commission since your yield based. Roll the dice some might say."
good,"was a pleasant place to work.  friendly, professional, and well kept environment.  adequate break rooms and facilities.  learned a lot from co workers and management.  great benefits and additionals such as incentives, bonuses, leisure activity etc...my direct manager when employed there was superb..."
good,great coworkers helpful management great organization skills only flaw is the transportation its okay but could be much better. Staff really helps you out to reach what ever you need to get done . With this line of work you need all the support you can so that's greatly appreciated
good,"this was a good company to work for. there were some good benefits like a discount on cable internet and phone. the office i was in was in kettering  ohio. A good managemen tstaff.. the issue i had was you did not get 2 days off in a rowand the medicall benefits were a little high for my standards. when i left they downsized an moved my department to another state. there was not much of a incentive to stay at that point. they said we cold go backto cusotme service take a pay cust , move out of state or quit. there was no severance to stay. but your  schedule was fixed for the most part. that was a good thing."
good,"It was a really good job experience, it gave me a real foundation for work in a call center. I was a customer service representative and sales rep so I pretty much learned it all in that position. It was also the first call center where I had to meet expectations for a score card."
good,I enjoyed working for spectrum I just did not have the job security I was hoping for. Management was awesome The schedule was bid on based off time served.
good,It would have been a better career if Managers took care of issues when they were urgent. Compensation was good. Work environment was very stressful. I had sometimes over 30 thousand employees and on top of that was expected to answer the help desk and have immediate answers for our employees. When Charter bought TWC a change came that wasn’t a good one.
good,"•	Play a major role in the development, management, and analysis of competitive data for Charter’s Residential and Small and Medium Business (SMB) segments, with a primary focus on three foundational areas: competitive overlap; market share/flow share; internet speeds. "
good,"During the last 17 years I've worked and helped local and regional businesses grow in the Mid Michigan Area!   Each day I would assist my Account Executives in the field and meet with clients such as auto dealers, health care providers, financial institutions and other general retail.   The goal of these meetings was to help gain a better understanding of how for example a local dealership could grow.   Once this was established we would recommend a creative concept (television commercial/online ad), networks that would reach the desired demographic and in recent years an online application that would help re enforce the branding message on television.    "
good,"very laid back environment, you take inbound calls from cable customers and assist them with their cable needs.outbound calls for past due accounts. Take payments over the phone."
good,"I highly recommend Spectrum.  Great environment   Great training.  "
good,"The training is great, the benefits are great. However, sales that you work hard for; can fall through too easily. You are supposed to know on at least 50 doors a day. You have to sell T.V, internet & phone. You have to face the elements & forever changing turf. Dogs, nice customers, mean customers etc."
good,"Day to day was constantly random"
good,Challenging Work Environment. Risk-Reward. Technical Team Excellent but Lacked Direction from Management. Introduction of New Products and Services were Poor. Stagnating Customer Retention.
good,"Not much room for advancement, but love the people that I worked with lower management is great; however upper management  does not show any respect to the hard work that everyone puts in."
good,"Working for Spectrum, for the most part, was fun all jobs come with some bad, but with Spectrum there where more good than bad. The one thing that sets Spectrum apart from any other job have worked for in the past is the team work. co-workers call each other everyday before heading home and make sure nobody needs any help."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Great workplace, great environment. Supporting leadership. Great place to grow as an individual learning different tools, technologies and develop leadership qualities."
good,"I learned that there is strength in unity. .The most enjoyable part of the job is win the office contest for most sales in the month, and getting help"
good,Great product to sell. Allowed to make your own schedule. Didn't have hands on training. Wasn't a good transition for someone who doesn't have sales experience
good,"has good benefits cheap cable & internet,, pays well if sales are up to par, commissioned sales can be very unreliable, job can take a toll on your car,"
good,"You work on your own in the field, and there are some advancement opportunity's. The benefits are great, and the pay is good. the supervisors are helpful and understanding"
good,If you can handle a fast paced environment and change.  Charter Spectrum has many jobs available for you.  Definately a job where there are more pro's then con's.  Also company is changing and growing which has opportunity for fast advancement.
good,"As a Sales Support Specialist with Spectrum i was able to work with a wide range of people and departments, the management team is very knowledgeable and overall i'd say its a great place to work at and be able to grow."
good,"Sales, cash management proceedings and account management .Good interaction with customers and great coordination with  management ."
good,problems stated when new management took over and the job became a numbers game .Originally it was one of the best place to work in NYC but when it became numbers first and customers second and employees further down we start having issues
good,"Overall, Spectrum treats their employees with more dignity and respect than I would have expected being my first corporate America job. "
good,worked building breadboards and working on fixture that the pc board were made to make the system work as they wanted...Everyone work together which made it a great place.
good,When I worked there it was a pretty good place to work. You were paid well and they were always feeding the employees. I have no complaints about this job.
good,"Working as a dispatcher was a very nice job, you were in charger of a team of installers and repair techs and pretty much kept them busy through the day routing jobs to them as well as assisting them in trouble shooting faulty or non responsive equipment."
good,Was a good place to work.  Very good benefits and discounts.  Enjoyed my co-workers and became good friends with many of them.  Most managers had a very good balance between producing results and accommodating outside work life.  Many opportunities for learning and advancing.
good,"Only left because of poor management in my department, had it not been for that I would still be working at Time Warner currently known as Spectrum. Need better managers"
good,"The company does not embrace the new world of geographically diverse work environment. They subscribe to the outdated notion that everyone should be centrally located in a brick and mortar building. "
good,The people in the customer service department were all nice to work with. The stress comes in due to the massive high phone call volume. Dress code is business casual no jeans.
good,"On average employees can take 40 to 120 calls per day, with most customers being up-set either about cost of services or services not working. The Job procedures are always changing due to technology up grades."
good,Days are never the same and new projects are given out all the time and things change a lot.  Policies and people and the organizational structure.  Need to be ready for changes and be flexible.
good,"When I was at Charter, the work-life balance was very decent. My team was spread across the country, and management was a bit of a mixed bag, but there was alway a sense of teamwork, and compensation was decent."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Working there would lead someone through out town working on different projects. Some of the work was an issue due to weather concerns but they are very interested in safety.
good,"Great place to work, hard work pays off, incentives are not as great as TWC, but you still have a job with benefits.... that's the point right, you must be team player because your team counts on you for monthly stats at"
good,Great people that work there. Does get stressful when a job runs behind and you then late for the next jobs. They need to schedule the routes closer together to be able to meet the jobs on time.
good,It was a great place to work. It was a great team environment with plenty of opportunities to take on new tasks to learn new things. The work days varied with some days were challenging but gave me an opportunity to solved problems.
good,it is a nice place to work the just not in to the family life and there is alot of long hours i had a good supervisor to work for if i took care of him he did the same for me
good,Time Warner Cable was purchased by Charter Communication and our Virginia headquarters was eliminated.  There was not much time for me to evaluate Charter.  Time Warner Cable was a great place to work.
good,"its a nice place to work , very fast pace always changing. its just not that many career advantages a long with salary advantages the raises are penny's."
good,"Great place to work and learn about the broadband cable industry with cable TV, Voip, and High Speed Internet. Hours vary which usually include working weekends and holidays."
good,"can be a potential great place to work. great insurance.. health, dental and vision. can take your van home if you wish, so it saves on gas and miles on personal car. potential career job if you are willing to stay."
good,I was able to start my working career with Charter. Charter taught me so much in how to be sociable and the a little to work under pressure as to sell services and fix any problem that may occurs.
good,Spectrum is  great place to work. The company offers great benefits and a easy place to work. I like the people I work with and take pride in the job I do.
good,I enjoyed working here. I just didn't like the hours and you don't get 2 days off back to back. The management was friendly and very helpful. There was opportunities for OT and bonuses.
good,"really liked the job. hey push you to be a better employee, great management and also great coworkers, loved the breakrooms and the vending machines, nice headsets and computers to complete your tasks"
good,"Going door to door and striking up conversations with total strangers is not as bad as it seems! Spectrum taught me to be a driven and motivated self starter as well as sharpening my interpersonal skills to an exceptional level. My management team was there for me whenever I needed them and they made the work environment fun and exciting. "
good,"Spectrum all in all is a great company to work for. Although the services not being up to par, make it a very stressful and consuming workplace day to day."
good,Awesome place especially in NYC driving in Manhattan. The customers are usually friendly. The Brooklyn branch is with a Union and they are currently on strike.
good,Its a good company to work for. We do have consistant lay offs which makes it hard to depend on having a good future for the company. most people feel this way that currently work for the company
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Typically you would be answering calls and going on a short break. The calls usually arent too hard to handle and if they are you can always get upper management.
good,Job was great I've learned a lot from my coworkers.Things got more demanding. Changes came but not for the best. People started losing they jobs because of the changes made by the other cable company.  My department in the warehouse was being give to the other cable company hub.
good,The sales department here is a fast paced and goal oriented place to work. Great benefits but expectations and goals are constantly changing. VERY high stress.
good,The company is going through growing pains as it ingests a much larger organization through acquisition and now forcing their entire engineering and ops organizations to relocate to Denver. The management and staff are very good though and will do fine longterm. Their primary challenge is they are drastically understaffed in many key engineering and operational roles.
good,"A typical day at spectrum is exciting and energetic, you learn how to deal with costumers in  every situation. Working with management is very difficult because on most jobs they  have no idea what to do a lack of filed experience.The hardest part of the day  is when a manager does not no what to in a tough situation.the best part of the day is  working with your colleagues and getting  the job done."
good,"Pretty awesome place to work, if you're willing to really work. Opportunities are there, and if you're willing to network and do projects you can easily advance. When they hire, they are looking for people who are ready to come in with both feet running and they give you all of the tools to succeed. I've seen people come in and just steadily move up every year and I've seen people stay in their seat. You have to make a plan for yourself, while you have all the tools to succeed no one will do it for you. You have to make it work for you."
good,"Dricet Sales is a hard job, employees have to go out side to knock people's doors and try to get a sale, no mater the weather is, employees still have to go out side knock doors get sales in raining, snowing, hot or cold days."
good,"Job was really fun. Everyone got along great and coworkers all expereince the same type of angry customers so we all relate to each other and can talk and share stories about things we have experienced. Very laid back environment with free coffee, water, hot chocolate. I loved the perks such as free cable services and the management really works with you when it comes to scheduling and absences you get up to 7 call outs before your terminated so they understand these things happen. I had to leave the job because I did not hsve care for my child. Had they had daycare services would be extremely beneficial. The pay is good for upsate. But, now with Spectrum I know alot has changed. I hate the metrics its unrealistic to think customers will give u 100% satisfication when you cant lower their rates which is 90% of the reason why they call.  What i hate the most there is no accountablity for agents who tell customers wrong information just to get them off the phone and so they can get a good survey and when customer calls back your left being the bad guy telling them the truth."
good,"Loud working environment but learned social skills when dealing with customers.The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and learning new techniques. The hardest part of the job was probably to concentrate because of how loud it was but overall, it was a very clean, friendly and organized place."
good,i loved working here everyone was a team player and was always there for one another. the customers were sometimes a little rough on you but that wasn't even a problem after the first couple days.
good,"This position allowed to dictate my salary based on sales.  There was no shortage of overtime and the training was extremely extensive and prepared you for the sales floor.  This job was exciting, fun and very goal oriented."
good,"A very productive environment with amazing co-workers all around you. The environment can either be very stressful, or it can be a blast, depending on personal preference and the job that you are working in. The only thing that was holding me back from staying with the company is my personal illness, they worked with me to try to keep me there as much as they could, the illness was just taking me away from the office too much for me to personally stay there.  Great environment if you were looking to work there. Management is a hit or miss based on the person in that position."
good,TWC now known as spectrum was one of the most enjoyable places to work. I delt with people in all kinds of moods and always enjoyed helping people sort out issues and get things fixed.
good,"In the beginning;when it was Time Warner, then Bright House Networks, it was a great place to work for. excellent pay, great work place environment. until Spectrum took over, Not very happy after that."
good,Typical day is busy and on your feet all day. I learned how to speak to customers of every background. I learned how to communicate effectively and in a timely manor. Workplace is fun and lively full of co-workers again from ever background. The hardest part of the job is unset customers and sometimes communication isn't had or wanted.  Co-workers are a joy as well as management but more incentives would have helped and better commissions.
good,"A good place to start an entry level customer service position. The company offers a good training program for call center representatives."
good,The company that I worked for was contracted out to Time Warner so I can not really speak on working directly for Time Warner BUT!!! I know the job and if you are willing to put forth the effort and learn you can make a good living and meet some really cool people in the process.
good,"I truly enjoyed working for BrightHouse Networks.  Charter/TWC merged changed many things, and my position moved to St. Louis."
good,"benefits package was better under twc, but benefits package is still decent under charter/spectrum. Different departments  have different management rules"
good,Extremely fast paced and stressful environment. Never able to relax and get comfortable. Not a lot of positive feedback unless it was combined with new and more difficult expectations.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Very little home life and those who go above and beyond have more work put on them workout an increase of pay. Just like any other big corporation I guess.
good,"good benefits hour lunch breaks , great co workers but poor management...rushed to get off the phone with customers..no time management...company is more worried about time metrics then helping the customer which i don't approve of.."
good,"Charter's Retention department is fast paced and can be stressful at times, but is made up by good work/life balance and great compensation. I would recommend others to work here."
good,"With the exception of Director Mary, this call center was a great job for someone looking for promotions. I worked here for 7 years when there was only 30 reps in Zanesville to when there were 250 plus. I was a supervisor when I was terminated. I lost this job because I could not deal with stress and issues at home and got little support from my manager. The company, formerly Time Warner, was great and fair to me and others there. I wish that I had handled this differently and reported her favoritism, and other issues early on but I was afraid of her."
good,"The job is demanding, but if you like working with your hands its okay and the more test you take the better your pay, Just be patient coming out of training it will take time to get the hang of it,"
good,Benefits were good and was a really great place to work. But since the company was bought by Charter a lot of negative changes have occurred such as elimination of whole departments in the Appleton location. There is a lot of uncertainty now. And there is virtually no room for advancement.
good,"Working as an Installation Tech. If you work hard and do a good job, advancements will come quickly. It is a very team oriented environment. Management is approachable. The hardest part of the job is the lack of flexibility with your work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job, is that if you work in-house, the company provides you with all you need to do your job at the highest quality"
good,"One of the funnest and most exciting sales jobs, with bonuses and spiffs given monthly! With the merge of spectrum, they changed a lot of things we were accustom to, including and most importantly, the commission structure, which we were not happy with. Left to move to San Fransisco and find better opportunities"
good,Great company but changed compensation and commission requirements making it hard to meet quota. friendly work environment and flexible hours but compensation model inconsistent.
good,Busy but fair. Long hours however developing employees was rewarding. Benifits were acceptable. Work live balance was taxing but withing reach. I loved my job.
good,This company is a great company overall. The only issue is the scheduling. I learned a lot working here regarding the cable business that I can apply to my everyday life.
good,"I enjoyed working here it was a fun and happy place. The hours sucked but non the less u sale u do customer service u keep your job an more money. Good benefits vs any other company ive worked for,"
good,"Spectrum  is a good company. lots of challenges. works with the public in television, internet, and phone services. hardest part is the daily operations but challenging.. the employees are great to work with with lots of teamwork"
good,good job great 401k friendly people and environment. great opportunities for job advancement as well as thorough three month training before being placed in live environment
good,Plenty of job advancement opportunities if you are wiling to put the time into it. Work at your pace during training and mentoring but then they expect you to pick speed and performance up within 6months.
good,I worked for Time Warner Cable before they became Spectrum. I don'y have an opinion on Spectrum. Time warner was not a bad place to work. Lot's of opportunity.
good,"Management is great, very knowledgeable and professional. Great benefits. supply chain knowledge schedule wasn't desirable (3pm-12am). Learned how to run the warehouse, I was in charge of the entire operation of the warehouse at night. We started an entirely new shift at night and I had to train a complete shift by myself while also maintaining production goals."
good,"Great Company to work for. Great benefits, however the the position I held had a lot of ""grey areas"" in which the rules were ever changing which lead to many technicians getting in trouble for something that was different depending on who you talked to or who your upper management was. but the job was exciting in the fact that each house had its own set of problems and it was never truly the same job day after day which i felt kept the job interesting. the hardest part of the job was climbing telephone poles and crawling through attics in the lovely summer heat."
good,"Benefits are ok. Working conditions are good. Colleagues are friendly and make the work fun. "
good,"Over 32 years of sales and customer service have taught me how to communicate effectively to find out what existing and potential customers require.  I know how to listen to customers in order to provide them with the best fit for their individual business needs. I have successfully worked independently for many years, consistently meeting and exceeding company quota's and expectations.  It is a demanding position with such constant growth and change, which also is one of the most satisfying and rewarding parts of my job when I have not only met but exceeded my customers expectations."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Energetic career minded individual with over 16+ experience in the communications/cable TV industry, looking to secure a challenging position that emphasizes increasing responsibly, personal growth and professional achievement."
good,Enjoyed working at TWC during my years there. The atmosphere and people were good and the team morale was always at a high level. Recognition was always provided and people acknowledged.
good,Overall the people here are friendly. Everyone goes out of their way to help one another. Great place to grand new skills and experience to continue your career goal.
good,"not for me, management was not professional.  call center was big,,  good benefits,, everything is timed, coach you every week on perfoorrmance"
good,"TWC provides advancement opportunities, competitive pay and benefits. Everyday is different which is what I enjoyed the most about the job."
good,The atmosphere at Time Warner is friendly.This was a challenging and Enjoyable job. Management was great. Overall a great place to work.
good,It is a good environment. Management is not always on your back and it makes for a productive work day. I enjoyed the employees and were very effective to assist with important issues.
good,"-show up to location have a meeting and set up equipment for production"
good,"The culture of Time Warner Cable (TWC) for most of my time there was very positive with plenty of room for advancement.  Upward movement wasn't as easy as if could be due to the size of the company but the opportunities did exist.  Once TWC was purchased by Charter Communications, the job became uncertain and the communication from executives to frontline employees was minimal.  The typical work day was filled with multiple objectives and projects to complete.  I learned how to work well with my different departments and how to support the executives and provide them with any and all needs and also to anticipate what would be needed before being asked.  The most enjoyable part of my job was learning the executives I supported and providing the best support.  The more responsibilities I was given, I realized it was because they knew I could handle the additional work load.  I take pride in a job done well."
good,"Colleagues are great to work with. Customer service for cable industry, busy everyday supplying support. Keeps employees up to date on services offered, training constantly supplied."
good,"The best company I have worked for. Great promotion opportunities with great medical benefits. 401k, pension, dental and vision, free cable, internet, home phone services available."
good,We have been in the transition of going from Time Warner cable to Charter Spectrum so a lot of positions may or may not be available anymore. The company has good benefits and competitive pay if you are in positions other that the phones.
good,"The people I work with are great. The job is a challenge. The training is hard too, the turnover is high. The financial rewards are great too."
good,Make outbound calls to existing and potential subscribers. Establish report to create or upgrade existing accounts. Coordinate and schedule installation for new products.
good,"Charter is a good place to work.  I am only a part of the transition team from Legacy TWC to Charter, and once my position's termination date comes and goes, I am certain Charter will continue to make its mark on the cable industry."
good,Time Warner Cable is a diverse workplace that promotes inclusion and equal opportunity. It's a fast paced business that requires adaptability to meet changes driven by competition.
good,Charter was where I began to learn the ropes of life and being with this company helped me learn so much in life with the many ones I came across. I learned to master my selling skills and very confident with any sells job that comes across to me that I have the change to learn the product and value of.
good,"A lot of metrics to follow, Average handle time, First call resolution, Adherence, Customer survey, outbound call %, and hold time. Granted once you get to really know the job some of this is easy, however a lot of it is out of your control. In between calls they don't want you doing anything that requires streaming, interacting with your fellow neighbor i.e. card games. Can not have cell phone out, that will get you fired very quickly. On top of all this, the calls can be very difficult. We aren't given  a lot of tools to assist our customers, however the customers don't ever want to take responsibility and will blame the company for everything. Makes it hard to work when the people asking for help don't want help. These are just the cons, they're a lot of pros to this company too. Right off the bat if you get hired in the beginning of the year you get 2 weeks paid vacation and up to 32 hours of personal time. If you do good in the metrics you can get very good work schedules. Supervisors are very kind people and very knowledgeable. They offer a lot of over time if you need it. Medical, dental, and vision.  All in all sometimes it feels like you're still in highschool with the pity rules they apply to us, but the people you work with can make it rewarding."
good,"Great place to work, timewarner does a lot for there employees atleast they did when I worked there,  pleasent atmoshere for the most part employees are very accepting and will usually lend a hand the best part about the job is thier not cheap raises are ok."
good,I was able to obtain good experience in the field of accounting at this organization.  This was a great first job after I completed graduate school.  I do not have anything negative to say about my experience here.  I believe this position has given me skills and experience necessary to pursue a new and better position at another organization.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Time Warner Cable is great company to work for. Excellent benefits and they will make sure their employees are well taking care of. They will always go above and beyond for there employees and their customer's
good,Good place to work. Great benefits. Good training. Good co workers. I would say its a great place to work. Lots of perks.  Go apply today!
good,"Enjoyed the work and coworkers are good to me."
good,TWC was a good place to work before the merger with Charter.  The changes in company policy do not match my personal goals and values.  Unrealistic goals placed upon agents and supervisors.
good,"A typical work day started late in the afternoon. The hours weren't that great but manageable. I learned a lot from this job such as perseverance, critical thinking skills, empathy, as well how to access a computer properly with multi-screens and multi-line phones. The management was a little out numbered by their team employees, but they did a good job keeping control of the floor and the teams. My co-workers were helpful, friendly, and team players. The hardest part of the job was the hours, with me having young children the 4 P.M-1 A.M shift was not a good fit for me but I sacrificed for my family and earned a better shift. The most enjoyable part was having a gym on the facility to allow the employees to wind down from a rough day as well as the security to walk employees to their cars during the evening hours."
good,Typical day at work is answering phones; troubleshooting products; additional training which reinforces what was learned in the classroom. Support is there to learn the job.
good,Time Warner Cable is a great place to work! Everyday in a new challenge and being in a call center there is always something new a fun going on everyday! One of the best jobs I have ever had!
good,"Well I am not directly employed to Bright House, but is affiliated through Sutherland Global Services. Working as a CSR is the best experience, you learn a great deal and customer satisfaction is key and guaranteed. Working in the eCare department, our base pay is paid by our direct employer. However each month we get bonus in the form of commissions from Bright House as a result of sales made. Since the acquisition , Commission is no more, so we only looking at base pay, totally ridiculous. At least a good incentive package was the motivation for providing the ABOVE PAR excellent customer service experience we provide in the eCare department. There is no motivation to move forward now.....since the acquisition my job with Bright House seems less secure.....it seems management is not advocating on the behalf of lower level workers....sad...al in all it is a good ongoing experience..."
good,"tough at first. going in not knowing how cable works can have you chasing your tale for first year. but take your classes and tests and get a two dollar raise for every tech level. it all about metrics. you have to maintain your numbers which they make harder and harder to meet.  the more people meet the metrics, the higher they raise the standard and the harder it is to maintain."
good,This job pays well for what it is but the turn over rate is high because aside from benefits the salary is not high enough for what we deal with on a  day to day basis. The management is decent and the environment is nice. high stress.
good,good company hard to advance. management has hard time running the company. too many ideas that hurt the wages of regular workers
good,"The job description or the position I would play on the Logistics meet wasn't clearly explained.  The contract I work under had internal differences that I was not aware of.  And I was never apart of the conversation.  When my contract came to the end, it ended."
good,Worked with great folks loved solving challenging issues in a team environment. Looking for new challenges.  Thank you.
good,"Working at Kwik Trip is a great experience. You're always helping people in a fast paced environment. There's always things to do, whether it's assisting customers, stocking the store or cleaning the premises. You're never bored working there."
good,"a typical day is getting to your first job once you clocked in from your mobile device they give you, either if you took a vehicle home or start at the shop. you'll have to get to your job on time. its a time frame job. so you'll get a set number of jobs each day you work. and depending on work load for that day you might have to take some extra jobs. so that means overtime. plenty of overtime to go around. management really cares, because its their responsibility to make sure you do your job correctly and safely. the best part of the job is interacting with people and being outside, going around different places. also, problem solving is fun and makes the job fulfilling when done the right way. I would come back for sure."
good,Supervisors let the emotions get in the way of promoting techs. they constantly over book techs and won't reschedule jobs. as if techs don't have families to get to
good,I left charter because the Texas division made quantity (money) a priority over quality.  The new england division an its leadership was fantastic.
good,"Good company overall. I enjoyed the fact that we had off Sunday's and were out by 9pm most days. They were always showing employee appreciation there which was nice since you don't always get that. The benefits were great. Job security was not always there with the required sales quota. Some couldn't make the sale and were terminated for it even though their title was billing rep not sales rep... Other than that it was fairly decent nice co-workers, some supervisors were big headed but what place doesn't have some like that."
good,The job is a solid starting point as a CSR but not where you want to stay for long. Good opportunity to move up in the company if you stay diligent.
good,"My job is as a Retention Specialist. This means that it is my job to try and keep customers from disconnecting or downgrading service. Customers calling in with the intent on taking service off of their account, normally due to service or price, must go through us first. TWC knows that this is difficult and does its best to compensate for having to deal with irate and often irrational customers. The hardest part of the job is explaining to customers that feel entitled to have everything for nothing that there is only so much that a company can do to provide excellent service at low costs. The company provides great compensation and benefits and tries to keep the employees spirits uplifted best they can. I have had my problems with the job but I must say that I love the company."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Time Warner Cable had great retail hours. They closed on holidays like a bank, Sundays, and early evening. There was no attention to training that helped to better me or assisted me in doing better in my position. The minimal training they had felt as if it was winged by management. It was very easy to talk to managers and area manager, since there were not many stores the managers were readily available through messenger or working in stores. The hardest part about my job was that the product was not reliable and every other customer complained of internet lad and old/ bad equipment. Stores were constantly overwhelmed with people because they did not plan the city roll out of system upgrading properly. Management like all managers were not as knowledgeable in the system or were new so we relied on senior coworkers more. I loved my co-workers and the lax atmosphere which was the best part of job."
good,Very good company to work at. They have good benefits as well as a good 401K plan. Management is open to new ideas. If you go above and beyond they take care of you.
good,The team I am on are like one big family.  We enjoy helping each other on various projects and have eachother's backs when needed.
good,My time at TWC has been excellent. In my department the Leadership is exceptional.  I work in the Security department and report up through General Counsel. The reason I love my job so much is that TWC Sr. Leadership supports and sponsors the BC Program. It's truly a top down approach. I have the authority to run the program and am empowered to do so. They block and tackle for me as needed and are always open to Program maturity ideas and ongoing personal training and development.
good,"There is plenty of room for advancement within Charter communications, both laterally and progressively, a very good learning experience overall."
good,"Cable installation on a daily basis, learning the importance of customer satisfaction and home etiquette. Self-management is required in order to excel and get promoted. Hardest part of the job is troubleshooting ongoing issues when different elements required to get the job done won't line up. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to get overtime if you meet all your projected numbers for the month."
good,"Teamwork, good environment great opportunity for growth,"
good,"My team was amazing. We worked well together and always maintained a high level of respect for eachother. I definitely appreciate being able to work with a group of people that became more like my family; we all looked out for eachother. When working at Time Warner cable my ability to acclimate to constant change sometimes on a whim made me more effective and knowledgeable, I appreciate it because it taught me how to be resourceful and how to remain aware. Time Warner taught me patience, and helped me  develop my communication skills. There were some very challenging days; the difficulty was not in performing my work duties but in dealing with some very verbally abusive customers that took advantage of the customer service culture we were trying so desperately to implement. When those challenges presented themselves it was always pleasant and highly rewarding when we could provide an upset customer with a great experience that sent them home with a smile. It felt good to know that we had touched someone and were able to provide them with the customer service experience they felt they had not received prior to coming into the store."
good,A typical work day here is taking between 20-30 inbound sales calls. Greeting customers and listening to their needs then setting them up with new services.
good,"TWC was a great company and learning center for me. i was envolved in the community and learned about marketing and communications for main and minority markets."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company in which treated me like family, as if I care. Great environment that creates equal opportunity to their employees and provides great affordable benefits that allow you to take care of your family and yourself. This is a great thing for a company to do. Promotes passion to work and accelerate as an employee and reciprocate how you are treated from upper management and provide your all to the company."
good,I worked as a billing agent in a call center for the cable company. i assisted the customers with understanding of their bills. I sold the products that the company supplied. I took payment via phone for services. I trained new employees as well as mentored them.
good,"Usually a day at Charter consists of just sitting at a cubicle and taking about 40 calls a day. They do a terrific job training you and making sure you have the knowledge and support you need to do the job well, about the first 4 weeks of work are devoted to training and learning in a classroom. Co-workers are like your fellow soldiers in the trenches together, and are easy to bond with about taking good or bad calls from customers. The hardest part is actually not the calls, because if you stick with the job for a month or two you eventually get used to taking the same types of calls and solving the same types of problems and you start really knowing what you're talking about. The hardest part can be Charter's metrics and expectations for how they would like you to speak and behave on a call, which fluctuate between being strict and reasonable. It also depends on who your supervisor is a little. But on the other hand it's a very well paying job with great benefits, and like I said if you stick with it for a little while you get used to the work and it's very doable."
good,I would start the day by opening the store but first i had to check the surrounding area make sure its clean and no visible trash. I assist customer with payments and also any equipment issues.
good,"Great benefits, above average compensation, some very excellent managers and also some questionable managers. Overall majority of staff have been on board for more than 10 years+."
good,Enjoyable people to work with. Interesting clients. Great place to learn about small to medium sized businesses of all types.
good,"I have cross trained and three different departments with the company over the last 7yrs, a great experience. I have learn leadership, by taking different LMS training."
good,"It doesn't offer much of a balance between home and work, but the pay is decent. It could be better, but as it is it's fine when you consider the health benefits and free cable services."
good,Great group of people to work with. Very flexible with family lifestyle.  On-going support implementing and troubleshooting edge routers. A lot of overnight maintenance.
good,"Typical Day knocking on customers doors and talking to customers selling Cable.  I learned a lot about sales, and being consistent, cold calling.  If you are consistent they will come. The hardest part of the job was trying to change people perspective of TWC, my supervisor was awesome and my peers was great.  IT was a great culture."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Good benefits and work conditions depending on which city you are talking about.  In Houston while they were there it was great compared to Comcast.
good,"Arrive at least 10 mins early, log into phone email and all other links needed for the job."
good,"I enjoyed my albeit brief employment at TWC. I enjoyed the work atmosphere and LOVED the work I was doing. The most frustrating part was the really long hours we worked, however that made the income a bit better. I enjoyed learning about the infrastructure of a cable company and how everything combined together to work properly."
good,"great place to work. managers seem to care about helping you with the sales process. training class is fun and very helpful. great place to potentially make a lot of money. have to compete for days off, really hard sometimes to get a day off."
good,"Almost every day TWC has prizes for the best sellers in the floor, so is a very good way to keep the employees motivated. this was a great job for me, before nursing."
good,"I really enjoy working for Time Warner Cable, they have competitive pay, great training programs and great benefits. The staff there are very knowledgeable and really give the impression that they want you to be successful. Conversely, the performance metrics for success can be quite challenging. Be prepared to fall short of some of the goals, especially in the beginning. The hardest thing for me is the extremely high volume of calls, while sitting in a cubicle for the entire shift. It is a high stress, high demand profession. I learned a great deal about the television, high speed internet and telephone industry. I have become proficient at using several different computer programs simultaneously for documentation and diagnosis.  When I first started working there, I had my doubts about being able to learn it all. However, I am proud to say I did it!

So when we had to ask a question or needed help with anything we couldn't rely on our managers to give us any help or feedback on the situation. It was always ""let me go find the answer to that question/concern and I will reach back out to you."" It was an unwritten rule that everyone had which was ""ask 3 before a sup."" Also the attendance policy was not fair. For instance they would excuse certain employee's absence depending on their ranking or whose team they were on. But other those issues the company was an amazing company."

My co-workers were awesome we all worked together as a team and learned off each other which was an asset.

As a CSR I thoroughly enjoy the team members I work. Opportunities and incentives are excellent, however it is difficult to earn advancement if your sales numbers aren't superior. In regards to management the company has an open door policy however it is not kept anonymous unless it is an HR issue. If you have a general complaint about a co-worker or superior, they will tell the person who made the complaint and the details of the complaint. Policies, procedures, teams, supervisors, etc change ALL THE TIME. You must be able adapt, to deal with change. The hardest part of the job, for me, is dealing with callers that are nasty. You have to take any abuse they threw your way with the exception of threats of violence. If you mind your P's and Q's and are not easily riled up you will LOVE the jobs and incentives this company has to offer. You have to start with 2nd shift with shift differential but after 6 mos you can try for shift bid or other positions as long as you are in good standing. The position requires sales."

good,working for spectrum had its perks but it also had its down side. they were nice to some cust. an mean to others. mangers and sups do not help you advance.
good,Spectrum has it's ups and downs. The job description is sales #1. Helping customers with transactions of all types. Spectrum overall offers decent pay and benefits. Work environment may depend what store/location you are at.
good,"Knowing that not only will I be happy, the customer will also be happy knowing they're getting the best service available. They offer great rewards for just showing up for work"
good,Face paced telecommunications company. Always looking for good talent to represent the products and services. Growth potential. Free or discounted services.
good,"Neutral - there was really nothing bad to say about working here.  you come in do your work, have a few laughs go home.  Don't mess up and you will be fine"
good,Great place to work.  Training is great.  Everyone supportive for you to do your best.  Learn from others.  Hard to get hired if you are a temp.  Overall one of the best places to work.
good,"This job felt like home, the employees are supportive,knowledgeable and reliable.  A great place to work, learn and grow.  In the 20 years at Charter I have made life long friends.  I am confident that there will be a position for me in the future"
good,The work is the same thing.  Asking questions about dmca violations.  Hours are evening.  The benefits and pay are very good.   The supervisors seem to care about us.
good,"There was a constant change, however, you were always trained for every situation.  The training is intense, and the hours were hard to work, but it was very well worth it when I got my paychecks."
good,"Great place to work and grow.  Fast Paced work environment, benefits are great with much room to grow and learn. Management with help with your career path with in Spectrum."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I worked Internet & Phone repair on the third shift.  So, I am only going to speak from that perspective.  A typical day at work begins with finding a desk that has your profile on it.  If not, you will spend more time than what is necessary for getting logged in and on the clock — once logged in, waiting to see how handicapped you will be for the night.  Night management is very involved in what going on with the floor — their subordinates and up to date with changing policy.  Meetings conducted once or twice a week."
good,"My manager was wonderful to work with.  The work was feasible and the people spoke mostly Spanish, so I was able to learn some of the language.  Great opportunity to get out and about."
good,"A typical day at Spectrum was not that much challenging, but the work was somewhat fast paced. I learned new IT, and security techniques to better assist me with my job."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Time Warner Cable/Spectrum.  Enjoyed the perks and the pay was competitive. Great benefits and PTO.  Customers were a challenge at times but overall, a good job and company!"
good,Spectrum is an agent motivated company dedicated to overall customer experience and satisfaction. Call compliance and integrity is their number one goal. They offer great benefits and and growth opportunities
good,I have a very positive work environment. I have developed many friendships at Spectrum. I have worked at this company for the last 5 years and 11 months.
good,"I was there for a short time on assignment, work was okay, people nice,"
good,I loved this job because the experience and promotions I’ve received here. I worked and gave my 100 percent to this job. I always go beyond my expectations.
good,"Great for go-getters who are self motivated, have vision and can build and motivate teams to make things happen and get things done. Don't expect to be led; leading the charge is up to you and your team."
good,it was a great experience working there. you had a lot of support from supervisors and the management team. they did a lot of activities to make your job less stressful.
good,Great company to work for. This has been the longest I've worked anywhere. The only thing I don't like is advancement is a slow process and could take time away from family time to learn on your own. Overall Spectrum isn't that bad of a company to work for. They need to rethink the advance placement process over and allow techs to be promoted via supervision approval andlllrecommendation
good,I originally got hired as a sales and customer service representative for for spectrum. The days before training class started I was asked to be a tech support specialist.
good,"Challenging environment, opportunity to learn and develop your skills. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys working with skilled professionals. The company is growing and adding new technologies."
good,I loved working for this company.  The benefits were excellent and the pay was more than fair.  It is a stressful position and physically demanding as well. You are expected to work 6 days a week in all kinds of weather (no exceptions) and it is sales driven so you must keep you with your quotas
good,At Spectrum there is a Great work culture. This company Promotes from within. The pay could be better but recognition awards are exceptional. There are cons such as constant changes in the system used to resolve customer issues. Onboarding training could be better.
good,Until I got laid off. Left with a bad taste in my mouth about who got cut and why. I really have nothing else I'd like to add. I loved my role and colleagues.
good,Spectrum requires that you come to work ready to produce.  This is a team atmosphere that will need you to be able to work with little supervision.  Must be willing to work at your trade.
good,"working at spectrum is like any other big corp. they only care about their bottom line. I was injured on the job, and they rather throw away my 13 years of experience than transfer me to another position. A position I was very well qualified to do."
good,"very nice place to work, management strive for the best from corporate to sale force. the training atmosphere was above par and very informational.  Our team of employees is very supportive and willing to share ideas with others."
good,"The only thing I will miss is my pay checks and my co-workers. The work place was nice had many things, like meeting rooms, lunch areas and relaxing areas to distress. The calls were another thing, I had good customers most understood it was our job to help them with there accounts. The other customers, the worst ones that made it seem like you were the company's owner and that it was your fault they did not pay their bills on time. Bye to all that..."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Good place to work. Good to better benefits. Good teamwork. Overall good working culture. Communication between management and employees was always an open door. Career advancement was always available.
good,"Spectrum has been a fantastic learning and growing opportunity for me. It helped me not only as an employee but as an individual as well. Going through takeovers in never easy, but the management team is trying to make it as smooth as possible. You have the potential to make a lot of money with the commission."
good,Working in a fast paced environment is what I enjoy. Customer service teaches you patience. I enioy working directly with clients and offering them excellent customer service.
good,"Sold Internet, cable and phone packages. If you sold all 3 you get bonus money into your paycheck. If you sell mobile phones you get bonuses as well. Plus there are incentives for adding protection plans. Overall its a great company to work for and the work environment is super relaxed."
good,"Great pay, amazing bonuses, good benefits and healthcare and free spectrum services for your home. Its a fast paced environment but worth the pay....."
good,"My time at Spectrum was very good. My training was quick and slightly challenging. My team, after I hit the floor, was very helpful and helped out anytime they could. My supervisor was amazing, because he was not only helpful, but also understanding. The job itself could be stressful, but the employees made it easy and enjoyable."
good,While clientele can be challenging at times the training process was really in depth and really prepared me for the job. Unfortunately you cannot prepare for mean customers but it is apart of the job so if you are not one to be able to brush things off easily and not take things personally this is not the job for you
good,"Working in the dispatch department was great, we had our challenges but we had an awesome team. My supervisors and manager were great to work for. Always let family come first. The techs dont have it as easy."
good,Its a good company to work for with many perks and benefits.   Although the outdoor selling is tough being out there in all weather and rude people at the door.
good,"You get start off at $13.5 an hour plus commission if your work after 11am then you make $14.25/hr. You train for 2 months and get paid just hourly for the 1st month learning how to input orders. Then the 2nd month your start taking calls in training, and you can start getting commission. What they do in those next 4 months is give a promise pay of $687.50 something like that. What I mean by this is your a new sales person taking very little calls a day maybe like 10-12 at first (on the floor its 25-40calls). So the commission you make will not be very much. So they give you this promise pay. 3rd month working on the floor you can really start making money. You get paid every two weeks your hourly of $13.5 /hr. And once a month you get your commission (they take 30% in taxes so prepared). Overall you just take calls and don't have to outbound call or go door to door. The benefits are great only paid $50 a month for all great insurance dental, vision, medical, etc. Plus you get all the services for your home for like $20 with all the channels and everything. And there is opportunities for advancement. Just be aware shifts can be from 6am-midnight monday-sunday. Be prepared to work weekends. You get to pick schedules every 6months BASED ON YOUR PERFORMANCE and other STATS. Can be very stressful not every person wants services sometimes calling in for ""reset password"" etc. But after you get the hang of it and all that you can make good money. Just last month i made $4300 taxes. So decent money and Im a college student. 40 hr desk job where you can make crazy money pretty cool."
good,A typical work day would provide a high volume of calls. There are many incentives to preform and hit goals. The center is very competitive and rewards are performance based.
good,Not a bad company. The customers can get you. The job itself is fairly easy. Not the worst environment. Typical call center. Always busy and always hiring.
good,"Have great benefit and career development opportunities. The work can be very demanding you will be working outside everyday in all kinds of weather, will have to climb utility poles, and routing can be a pain way there are no set routes in residential work."
good,"Work days tend to variate between slow ans stressful. The company has many amenities for employees to use, for example a game room and a gym. Free coffee and very comfortable cafeteria."
good,"I loved working at Spectrum, unfortunately life issues caused me to leave. You have total autonomy on the Enterprise side, the hardest part of the job it the monotony, and repetitive conversations."
good,"I've only worked for the company briefly; however, I have truly enjoyed my time here. I've worked with some very nice people and I like the job culture/environment of the company."
good,"It is a great company, great benefits and incentives. The call volume is high at times. Theyvtreat their employees well with dignity and respect. Not for everyone."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Work with multiple verticals to managed and improved the network environment. code upgrades, standardization, augmentation, implementation and network support."
good,"Flawed Sales Model. Teach relationship selling, but drop the ball when installation goes poorly. No attempts from CS or management to solve issues or to retain clients. No accountability with 3rd party install team."
good,"Many opportunities for enhancing skill sets. Strong teams for engineering and support. Quite a bit of travel, usually daily. Good camaraderie.  Good benefits."
good,"When I worked at Spectrum, it was Time Warner Cable. A typical day at work at Spectrum (TWC) involved ten-hour shifts. I worked from 12-10 every day for 4 days a week. It was long days but I got 3 days off and I enjoyed that. I learned how to connect and disconnect routers, their speed testing and why that was important, setting up cable connections at the pole, the role of the Technicians, how to program remotes and the boxes right along with setting up phone connections and the phone numbers as well. It involves so much technical know-how, but with time I got good at it. I also learned billing, rewards systems, and many ticketing and technical applications. It was a favorable environment for me due to the education I obtained, but it was stressful because everyone wanted to be a part of the newest biggest promotions and that could cause problems so education was key. There were some excellent Managers there and I gained some life long friends."
good,"Great training class, have weekly meetings, employees are enthusiastic, fun and helpful. Start the day from home. Always a job to do. Team will help you out."
good,I enjoyed speaking with new or returning clients regarding their accounts. Spectrum was very intent that quotas had to be met. This made it stressful.
good,Job is fine but it can be very stressful with the speed that everything changes. One day we do something this way then the next it's something completely different or more complex. Be ready to adapt
good,Customer Operations is responsible for delivering superior customer service and sales support to our new and existing customers. Our team operates 82 internal call centers across our footprint of 41 states. A dedicated training and communications approach ensures representative specialization and outstanding service for residential and commercial customers.
good,I was able to learn additional skills that I did not previously have. Some skills were inventory management and mentoring other staff members in the organization.
good,this was my call center was not a good feel or fit for me... there was a lot of training and was not really able to take in all that was taught once got on the phones and the hours were horrible for me
good,Only stressful when super busy.  Back to back calls can be annoying.  Benefits are awesome. I started with a night schedule.  Within months i was able to change to mornings.
good,Great teamwork. Schedule sucks but never a dull moment. Mgmt will help if in a bind. You really have to try to get fired. Vehicle/tools/clothing given
good,"Still work for Spectrum over 4 years, they believe in promoting within. I've recommend others to apply.  They have a great referral bonus in place, so what are you waiting for?  Apply."
good,I have had multiple positions within the company and I have liked all them thus far. Each has provided a great working environment. Really you get what you put into it
good,"* Work from home business model"
good,Good place to work and the benefits and compensation are great.  Still has a small company feel and the technology is behind the cable company giants but we are getting there eventually.
good,Spectrum was one of the accounts of convergys cebu. The support and the working balance is good. People from the management team is also good. Compensation is average.
good,"Good company, Good people and work environment. Worked there for 9 years met new people and learned a new career opportunity in a new field placement."
good,"Another Gem, working for Time Warner Cable was a blast!!!! i had an opportunity to talk TV, one thing im good at. Answering the phones on a daily basis game me control. I shined, or at least i thought i did. Conversation flowed like the Jordan River as i named packages. Anywhere from basic to platinum where every channel on the spectrum was included. It was a pleasure to provide my customers with what they needed. Even if they didnt think they did. My skill was governed around providing my customers with the perfect package. In doing so, game me the courage to face even the toughest clients, and often co workers would transfer them to me because i had a knack for turning I-rates into cuddly teddy bears. Once again making my job not so much feel like work but more like a funday at the office."
good,"I work in the Dispatch dept. where we assist techs that are in the field. We trouble shoot for them, route their jobs for the day, and speak to customers."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work , but they were always changing since they are not part of Charter not just TWC. It was very fast paced and you never knew what could change in a matte of hours"
good,very stressfull at times. Have to have a thick skin when it comes to the customer calls due to them being angry about their services. Can't really miss days unless approved. They only thing I don't like if you miss more than one or two you have to call into a different line to makes sure that you still have a job.
good,"I enjoyed working as a cable installer, the only thing I didn't care for was that it was contract only so I got paid by the day and didn't have any benefits."
good,The workload was fair and a fantastic work environment was consistent across the 3 call centers I worked in for Charter. The hardest part of the job was meeting aggressive hiring goals while still updating and utilizing current curriculums. This was vitally important as we merged from legacy Time Warner Cable to today's Charter Spectrum.
good,"If you don't sell something the way they like they do pull you aside and talk to you about a certain call. Once you start at Spectrum(My location in Riverview, FL at least) you do not have the ability to pick your own hours or have your own schedule. You have to have open availability. I worked 8:30-5:30pm for 4 weeks of training being told that if you are top of the class you will pick your own schedule.  That was a complete lie, we were all given 2-11pm no matter our rank. They put new hires where they are needed. Other than that, it is a great company. There is job security and  great benefits."
good,"Fast paced, and challenging at times. You will learn a lot about telephony, IT, Cable and customer relations. Advancement is good however downsizing can become a issue."
good,"I actually work there many years ago when it used to be TWC it was good , relax and fun management used to treat the employees really good but then management change they clean house and it was a different ball game."
good,Great Company thankful for the 5 year run I had with them . If I could say anything that I would change about Spectrum is that is that you have to be a Self-Motivated person to make it .
good,Great typical place to work . Very competitive culture that is innovative and creative in creating and developing cutting edge technology and personnel learning. The hardest part of the job is managing you own time..
good,"Great chance to move up in the company and we learn from each other. Calls are fast paced, and we teach other policies and procedures. I take escalated calls and coach agents on opportunities."
good,"I enjoyed every minute being at Spectrum (Formerly known as Time Warner). A great company to work for, full of benefits. They are pretty flexible and fun to work there."
good,Spectrum is a decent place to work. The earning potential is great. Although the company does have some growing pains with the merger between Charter and Time Warner Cable. The hardest part about working there is that youu can be one of the hardest workers and if you make a simple mistake you will be subject to a write up.
good,"good place to work. Fair salary. Some room for advancement. good benefits, fair vacation and sick time. overtime and on call compensation good as well."
good,"The company is changing daily. It was hard to judge. I loved my manager but they eliminated the traffic department. People are friendly, and give one the opportunity to learn other positions"
good,"My role at Spectrum provides me the opportunity to learn valuable skills I can improve upon throughout my career.  A typical day at work consists of designing and developing training for sales and support internal stakeholders.  Management encourages us to grow, collaborate and propose improvements or innovative ideas.  Employees at Spectrum are focused, driven and still find a balance with their professional and personal lives."
good,I am an Account Executive that does B2B sales. I enjoy meeting business owners and helping build relationships with them and helping them identify business pain points and providing them a solution/s that addresses those pain points.
good,"Working in the filed got to meet new people and I got to learn a lot about how cable, internet, and phone worked together with very little experience coming in."
good,Good opportunity work on large project teams with many work groups - provided insight into other areas of the business and allowed me to improve my knowledge of the corporation
good,Wasn't challenging for me i got through so many customers everyday because the issues people call about are on the internet the only ones that take any effort at all where the changes to their data plans and everything is in your face so to easy for me just watch out for changes on how to do stuff because it constantly changes
good,"Our department is a very close knit department.  We treat each other like family and do things together outside of the workplace.  At work we always help each other with projects and teach each other new things and always have each others' backs.  Our working environment is a friendly one."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Great company, fast pace and exciting. Management is will to help you grow  within the company. Co-worker are friendly and willing to help at anytime."
good,Relaxing and Quiet place to work that provides good technical support for employees and workers that make it easy to perform the duties of the workplace.
good,"Work hard get paid well, knocking door to door in itself is difficult. Work the schedule smile, knock and get paid decently. If you don't. You don't get paid."
good,for the most part management was very good. they were very understanding when i had problems. they worked with me when i needed to adjust my work schedule
good,not a bad job. as long as you can handle people upset over their service not working properly you can handle this job pretty easily. supervision was fine
good,"•	Responsible for in bound calls and customer support "
good,"A typical day consists of arriving at the warehouse an hour before the first appointment time frame to receive the route information, gather equipment/supplies, and review the area assigned. I learned a great deal about time management, quick problem solving, understanding the nature of the equipment issued and how it interacts with the infrastructure. The management was very aware and understanding of the occasional hiccups that may throw off the route's time frame. Most of the day is spent in solitude, going from house to house to install equipment or troubleshooting and fixing any problems a customer may have.  For me, the hardest part of the job is coming across a difficult house with obstacles and barriers to navigate while keeping a sense with the customer that it's an ordinary situation. The most enjoyable part is seeing the look on their face when they enjoy having what they asked for in the end."
good,Awesome Director and Management team. Great health benefits. Professional working environment. Overall great place to work with opportunities for growth.
good,"I loved working at Spectrum.  I only left because  I moved to another city and they had no opening. They are a great company to work for with good local management in Asheville,  NC."
good,Someone's experience at Spectrum is based on the family they are given to. I was fortunate enough to love the kids I watched. I really enjoyed working with this family.
good,"Typical day is calling on existing customers, helping them design new telecom projects, maintaining their current product inventory, and helping them purchase new services. Hardest part is reaching the right enduser contact.  Easiest part of the job is quoting and selling services they are looking for."
good,"The hardest part of the job is being stressed out because of meeting expectations from guys sitting in an office not know what's going on in the field. Also, giving Technicians an hour to complete a task when that task statically takes 2 or 3 hours to do."
good,A typical day at work consisted of getting my work orders and driving to sub's home and repairing service. I learned about how to handle people and give good customer service.Management was very supported in my endeavors. The hardest part of my job was the physical part of job.The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and interacting with them.I learned a lot about computers.
good,Learned a lot from coworkers.  Great experience to learn the ins and outs of the company.  Great training and patients for those that need to know what is expected of you
good,"It's never perfect but Charter Communications/Spectrum comes pretty close in all areas.  Employee development, management, culture, challenging work, rewards, fun place to work.  The goals are often challenging and frequently impossible to meet."
good,They allowed me to grow professionally to levels I never had thought I could have acheived. The work days may have been long at times but it didn't feel as such.
good,Worked in a call center answering billing questions and finding opportunities to offer new or additional services to customers.  Trying to assist customers to avoid possible disconnection of services.
good,Excellent work environment. Good team work culture. I would definitely recommend working here. They are concerned about their people and always looking to provide clear pathways to growth.
good,"Thanks for the ride, memories, and coworkers.  Thanks for taking chance on me in 2005.  I proved to be a great worker and a great team player and teammate!!"
good,Its truly a great place to work with room to grow and advance and i would def recommend all interested to apply with great benifits and a wonderful work environment
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"A typical day at spectrum would consist of morning emailed "" Error Reports"" from our analyst team that would determine what entered job orders from the previous day weather from the Field, Lobby, or call center would need to be revised or re-worked due to errors. These jobs would be deemed as orders that would not be properly processed until certain coding in the billing system would be corrected. Since Spectrum is one of the largest telecommunications companies, there were different Quality Assurance Teams throughout the company. Our team provided support to Voip Department, we would verify their Third Party Verification records. We also would manually correct errors for High Speed internet Billing as well as errors in their video departments. Providing feed back or patterns found in coding or billing errors or in new equipment was part of our everyday tasks."
good,Charter is a great company to work for. You receive free charter services and good benefits. A clean work environment that is friendly and competitive. I recommend Charter.
good,"Maintain I -Series, checking for updates, and new PTF.s, keeping the Mainframe up and running at all times. Working with clients in the Networking Team and Customer Services, they where my eyes and ears."
good,"As long as you don't mind working in tight spaces and up high it is a great company to work for and the pay is competitive. the only negative I can say is the hours are long and that takes away from the family time, 4 10 hr days a week, so on days I work I don't get to see my kids really"
good,A typical work day begins with greeting co-workers and working together to assist customer's with their financial needs to maintain a strong and satisfactory relationship between Spectrum and its customers. Always looking for areas of improvement in various company processes for our customers as well as employees to provide a satisfactory experience with Spectrum services. The work environment is always positive and filled attainable goals to keep the work day flowing smoothly.
good,They raised the starting pay to $15 per hour and you can get raises from doing online training on your own time.  Many job opportunities to move up and increase salary in the comopany within a couple of years.
good,I have learned a lot made many advancements work in several areas of the department. Customer Service at Spectrum is at an all time high with agents eager to learn.
good,There are new and exciting advancements being developed and launched on the Spectrum platforms.  All of the hard work and chaotic fast-paced challenges are part of providing customers with a fantastic innovative experience. It is very rewarding to know that all of the hard work is appreciated by the customers when they get more than they expected.
good,"I would highly recommend people to seek employment here. It will be tough, hot, wet, and cold but you get paid $15 or more base pay plus over time every other week with good benefits. Management cares if you are doing well and will help you take courses to progress. Each tier higher you reach you get a raise so try to rank up fast! There’s a lot of money to be made here."
good,went door to door trying to get customers to sign up for charter. this position was the most difficult I had ever had not because of talking with customers but because Charters prices are so high it is a very difficult product to selll
good,"Opportunities for advancement, clean good working environment, state of the art computers, company discounts for employees, online training with software and company products. Hardest part of the job was the preparation of the next years budget. I really enjoyed working with my staff, and mentoring new employees."
good,"Productive workplace, ability to make alot of money, flexible schedule. Tuition reimbursement program, good benefits and 401K match. Overall good company to work for."
good,I started with spectrum 5 years ago. In that time I was able to obtain 4 promotions and nearly double my hourly pay. Spectrum is a good place to start for those with no prior field tech experience.
good,I loved working for this company. Good pay and benefits with a strong work ethic and mission. Competition made the company set unrealistic expectations and goals
good,Overall a company. Good pay and benefits but not a lot of room for advancement.  When you first get hired you usually get the worst shifts but eventually can bid on better shifts
good,"the training was nothing like the actual work atmosphere- most of the training was for the technicians, not the front counter (customer service) reps. pay is good, but could be better."
good,"The typical day at work was constant face to face customer interaction to solve and troubleshoot potential issues at homes, including installation and deactivation."
good,"I was able to wear many hats. As I moved from one job to other I gained a lot of knowledge, With this knowledge I was able to apply my knowledge  each area I moved to."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Good place to work if you like to make money, especially in sales. If you have a drive to work in a fast paced and high demand position, this is the place for you."
good,The calls did come in back to back but they did try and make it fun for us with incentives. They had teams compete against each other to see who could up sell more.
good,I met a lot of co-workers and everyone was very respectful and helpful.  Knowledge and team oriented atmosphere.  Some employees like me were just starting and others were seasoned and long term employees.  Everyone was treated equal.
good,The job comes with many benefits but for the short amount of time that i worked their the calls were stressful because you didn't have much liberty to do much for them or yourself. Some of the policies the company has i do not agree with them.
good,"It is a good place to work and definitely offers the opportunity to promote from within, the company has great benefits and often caters for its employees."
good,Assigned 4-10 jobs per day in a specific geographical location. Had to have great time management and keep good records of inventory and company vehicle.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with on every level.  I had the pleasure of being able to work with my team of direct reports as well as with varying levels of upper management and contract staff.  I always felt that my opinions and suggestions were accepted, I felt well respected, and in many cases I was trusted to handle several different pilot programs to test and implement changes for improvement."
good,"A typical day was successfully challenged no mattered what the job."
good,"It was a very good place to work at. The people that work there are great. It was fast paced at times and the benefits were great. Plus you get free services, which is always great"
good,"Spectrum has amazing opportunities, and every job has the potential to turn into a career. No one is left behind and they train you very well with supervisors always being a phone call away. The field technician job, however, is very demanding. You need to be quick, points are assigned to each job, and if you make any less than 12 points an hour, they will berate you about it a lot. They'll critique your work process and they're meticulous about doing everything just right according to a quality assurance check list.

What company's to avoid, and who have better services when it comes to internet and cable. A diverse working environment with up beat energy.

good,"Good company but not a great company to work at I really enjoy mostly the discounted services but it is a hard place to grow within the company..also the company needs better training skills and more up training because of the many changes within the company. The company makes so many changes and it is hard to speak to customers about their bills and services with no notice as to the changes.,Lastly the selection process in the upper management and supervisors is what makes the company even harder to work with it is a stressful job no matter how you learn call control on the calls majority of the employees remain is because of the discounted cable services."

good,CenturyLink was a very comfortable and very congenial place to work.  All of the people that I worked with were very educated and very polite.  I would have no problem working with them again.
good,Very busy and fast paced. Customers need understanding as they are not advanced in most cases. Management  assists in any way they can. Not a bad place to work.
good,The job was good until bought out by Charter Communications. The pricing has changed and the commission structure has changed and not in the benefit for the employees.
good,"Call centers aren't usually for me, but this place had a great culture as far as how they treated their employees.  The calls are stressful but the training was great and you felt like you were ready to start taking calls after the 3rd week.  "
good,"Pay is great, discount is great. Full time job. Calls can be back to back, sometimes slow. Just take day by day. Didn't really intend on leaving it just happened."
good,Good entry level options and place for advancement. The culture is always inviting. The work does become fast pace and sometimes a lot to handle but there is down time to get your head straight.
good,"Overall a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time there, with the exception of my first line manager who just so happened to be pretty high ranking."
good,"I was not at this position long enough for a valid review, but from what I could gather,the people there were nice, and very dedicated to their jobs. A lot of the people had been there for years, so that's always a good thing to see within a company."
good,"Good stepping stone for when your just trying to get experience in call center, call can be fast past. I would say the hardest part is trying to get the customer to understand why we no longer offer future dated payments and why we dont offer any promotions."
good,"Charter Communications took a big bite of the apple when they absorbed Time Warner Cable and Bright House.  The leadership has a good plan for merging the companies and it is progressing, whether the employees are willing or not.  "

good,"You have to be a really strong sales person to keep up with the increasing sales goals. Goals are based on previous years before the introduction of Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Firestick and Roku. It seems as though upper management does not take the changing technology into account when determining sales goals."

All of the contractors were cut during the Spectrum merge and sadly I was a contractor. I got called back to help when work piled up too high. Its too bad that corporate made the call to clean house. However I would love to work in-house for Spectrum."
good,"It was fast paced, and slow paced at times. The days felt long, and sometimes you would not have much to do. It could be easy for some, but others might find it challenging depending how well you adapt to change because work procedure and new system are always being introduced."
good,"the morning shift  can be very stressful with the call volume, if you work the night shift you lose your work life balance completely. it can be mentally draining because of the hours, working 8-10 hours straight a day talking to people daily trying to diagnose their issues and seeing what is the best resolution. otherwise it is easy work. great benefits. easy to advance as long as your not on a final written warning. lots of ways to make more pay, but not a lot of ways to prevent being on the phones."
good,"I had a great time working at Spectrum Sports Networks. Great people to work with, lots of teamwork type effort from my co-workers. Working on LIVE Sports is fun and exciting with its fare share of obstacles and challenges on a daily basis. Getting to meet and work with star athletes was also very appealing."

good,"charter is a great company to work for, great benefits and other perks.. you got to be focus so you can see your full potiental but its worth it.. the money iis good there"
good,"I never worked for Time Warner so I don't have anything positive or negative to say about them. We did do work for them, the construction part of the jobs and it was ok dealing with them. They can be a little mean at time or difficult and don't want to pay for whatever job has been done."
good,"Its a great place to work if you like dealing with angry customers all day. I enjoyed the job when I had more duties. I was a Repeat caller specialist , sales, billing n it was more exciting. Billing is black n white n for me it's either you want it or not."
good,"Charter Spectrum is a good place to work, but given how many people are cutting cable cords, it may not be a place to grow. I would happily recommend this to anyone who has thick skin because you will face a great deal of rejection."

good,"A typical workday would consist of dispatching Drivers to certain jobs throughout the day, inputting orders into our system, heavy phones, two way radio communication, scheduling of Technician visits, quality control. Learned about the whole Communications business from installs to repair. Management was incredible from helping us with anything we needed to being extremely flexible.

Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,The engineers on my team is why I come to work every day.  They were like a second family to me.  We spend a lot of time together on projects and late night maintenances.  They understand the goal was to get them done in a reasonable time without causing any customer impacts.  I never had any issues with any of them not wanting to meet the same goal.  They made me and my team look good with our upper management team.
good,"Fun place to work if you love sports. They encourage new ideas and input. I would highly recommend Spectrum to anyone. The variety of work, plus the opportunity to chat at times with Los Angeles sports legends made it a great experience."
good,"Spectrum is a decent place to work. There are great perks and the pay is decent.  The benefits are ok, 401k is ok.  Overall there is very little to complain about."
good,"Since the switch over from TWC to Spectrum the commission structure has changed for the worse. The amount of negativity that the retention environment creates due to customer issues doesn't out way the possibility of a commission check.  There are plenty of other call centers that pay more for less stress amongst management and customers.  At the end of the day it's just cable, but too bad cable is dying.  The main job is to keep customers with the company but the metrics are ruled based on how many lines of service the customer keeps. Advice to anyone considering the job at Spectrum would to gain some good call center experience and leave immediately."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the career advancement. A typical day at work involves meeting new people and installing cable and internet services for them.
good,"The TWC business and Engineering teams are in a transition period, merging into equivalent Charter organizations primarily in Denver, CO.  Work life will depend on management team, while the Data Center Engineering team was well taken care of, I can't speak for others.  Scope of authority to make budgetary decisions seems to be reduced, where even small deployment projects need the highest levels of approvals. "
good,Many different jobs to work in this field. Chances for advancement. Great benefits at one time. Been a long time since I worked there though. Average pay.

good,"Working as a customer care coordinator, you answer phone cals all day to help people out with there cable services. Its a great place to build communication skills. Upper management is good. Middle management is alright, very demanding and semi-professional. Work place culture is positive. Hardest part of the job is the constant focus of stats, as an individual, team, and call center. The work is very metric oriented. Most enjoyable is the excellent benefits and free services"
good,Extreamly fun staff with a family vibe. Great mentors who really care about you growing in the company. Fairly easy job to pick up if you're good with people and comfortable with sales
good,once again I am trying to apply for a job that has nothing to do with Spectrum and you are forcing me to review another company??  I do not understand and feel this should be an optional step.

good,i would do all installs at the customers house this included anything from tv to internet along with phone. the workplace culture was a lot of fun very laid back. the best part of my job was seeing the customers satisfied when it was time for me to leave their house.
good,Spectrum has recently taken over ownership of the previous company that I worked for Time Warner Cable. My experience so far has been pleasant. I would recommend this company to others.
good,"good place to work for over 10 years"
good,Supervisors where helpful and respectful of our opinions. Liked the environment it provided for their employees and how HR was so helpful to all of their employees.

good,For a single person with no kids would be a good place to work. They currently work ten hour days 4 days a week and an on call rotation so trying to be there for a family or even a wife makes it difficult.
good,Buscar trabajadores que sean responsables y con calidad
good,"typical large corporate environment with many benefits. Competitive pay and Vacation, Gratis accounts for those living in applicable areas. However there are too many chiefs telling you what to do rather than letting departments run themselves."
good,Spectrum is a good company I enjoy working there offering services and helping customers with their needs. Spectrum offers great health insurance and is flexible.

Departments that had worked extremely well together began finger-pointing back-stabbing to reach their 'numbers'.  Prior to AOL becoming involved, upper management was very focused on customer service and employee training.  Went downhill quickly!"

good,"We did it all in Tier III. You never knew what the next call was going to be about. It could be billing, a home networking issue, a complicated phone order, or a person having difficulty with their remote control. I learned a lot about phone systems and more about networking. Management is subject to the same metrics as their team members, so the goals are all common. Because of the call volume and office setup, you never really get to interact with your co-workers except in a group chat."
good,"This requires alot of time out on the field, and while it used to be good, now it is slowly becoming a nightmare with the transition. Daily meetings, losing sales to customer service, bad turf management by supervisors, and etc. The one thing that will keep one motivated is the comission and base. That should be the only reason you are there. It is not exactly a friendly environment, just like any other sales job it is competition and stress over the roofs."
good,My position required a lot of communication with customers.  As an employee you must have the ability to not take things personal and handle a fast past environment.

However, the supervisors are friendly most of the time. They make it fun and constantly pump you up.

As a Team Lead a typical day consisted of assisting coworkers with any issues that may arise whether it be a call escalation, order entry or help in closing the sale. One thing I learned working for this company was how to handle calls in the most efficient way to maximize the number of inbound calls received each day but still follow the company guidelines. The management team was excellent in helping each team member to achieve their monthly goals by providing coaching opportunities and providing a stress free environment to keep members motivated and focused on goals. Co-workers were a joy to work with. They understood the meaning of working as a team. Coworkers were always eager to provide help and encouragement which made to workplace more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was, at times, the work hours and having to deal with irate customers. But,  the incentives and compensation made up for it.

good,Work is very busy and long drive times. Router do not have any ideas about drive times and how much work to do in each job and the company keeps coming up with more things to keep up with
good,Pay and benefits are amazing with Spectrum. There is always endless support and a great environment. The money is endless if you put your best into your work and also if you want to start your own business.
good,"Charter Spectrum is an excellent Company to work for . It was challenging but I need to be challenged. Management micromanage to the ma, but it's not that bad. Employees help each other quite often and zi was able to ask any question concerning my job and receive a reasonable answer from Managment."
good,"Being a senior technician you can be routed many different types of job types. Jobs may include business or residential installs, trouble calls, disconnects or equipment pickup."
good,Strict adherence to ever changing compliance standards is what it takes to be a top employee at Spectrum. All of your tools clothes and transportation is provided making it a true bring your A game to the job only.
good,Job has great benefits and great people to work with. They pay their people very well in Direct Sales if you can do the job. Management is not bad to work for they listen to you here.
good,"Great job if you’re not afraid to work. You get 500 addresses to work a month and you just have to be willing to do what you’re supposed to do, KNOCK DOORS, and you will be compensated for it. A lot of training for you and management is super willing to help you. Benefits are awesome and if you plan things and understand your turf you can have an excellent work life balance. Great job I SHOULDVE stayed."
good,This is a fast-paced job that requires a lot of dedication and skill for the industry always trying to strive ahead and do a fast clean job for are demanding SMB and Enterprise customers while maintaining a good work relationship with all of our subcontractors
good,"Very good opportunity to leverage communication skills while practicing getting to yes. I have learned to listen effectively to verbal communication as well as body language to fully understand what the client is communicating. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"The company is really good at supporting their workers.  They make some mistakes, but, they try to fix things asap.  Management is excellent and helpful in my case, of course that may vary.  The culture is good, and communication is great.  The hardest part of the job is the customers.  Some are great, some are beyond terrible.  It can be hard to be yelled at for something that is not your fault.  The best parts of the job are the great benefits, the support that you get, and the facilities. I left the company because an opportunity came up that I couldn't resist."
good,Love the trainer and Human Resources. Learn to follow a script. Love having cable for free. The pay was decent but wanted to really work with customers face to face.
good,Good job good environment great people to work with never has a problem with this job I came a very long way with this being my first call center job thanks
good,"everything at this company is by yourself unless you need help.  no breathing down your neck."
good,Spectrum is a great place to work. I enjoyed working with my peers... We just had a great customer service week... Everyone that works for Spectrum is
good,"I've heard a few bad things in other markets, but I never had issues.  The only time I saw any issues was when someone didn't make any effort to work."
good,"It is very fast pace but days so fast. If it is slow, you are allowed to leave early. Training is extensive and coaching is effective. Pay is now better but was low when I was there."
good,I should have never left.  Time Warner Cable was the best place to grow up in the corporate world.  You could make mistakes and learn rather than simply be fired for everything.  And my last boss taught me invaluable lessons that continue to help me in my career.
good,"Flex time offers a flexible arrival time for work due to different family or individual schedules and morning commutes. On site gym and cafeteria. Maternity/Paternity leave, some positions allow working remotely intermittently.  Positive work environment"
good,"The job environment with Spectrum is fast paced and at times challenging, but if you're willing to put in the effort, it can be a great long-term career, with opportunities for advancement.  The benefits with Spectrum are stellar:  insurance, 401k, discounted and/or free services, generous paid time off, etc."
good,Great place to earn money but keep in mind it can be a stressful environment. Its also important to be there as much as possible. management can be a bit intrusive at times.
good,"Spectrum has been a great place to work. The benefits are great. The people that work there are great. Most of the environment problems come from a lot of people taking potentially stressful calls in a billing call center and the stress can spill into negative conversations. There is always a lot to do as a Supervisor. The hardest part is probably just keeping up with all of the changes and reporting. Overall, I love the people that I work with and we work well together."
good,"Reviewing reexports, taking escalated sup calls, coaching and developing reps. Working with management to keep call center to provide positive experiences. The hardest part of the job is the high turnover. Most enjoyable is developing rep."
good,This is one of the most easiest and relaxing jobs I ever had. Besides the customers you have to call but other than that it’s easy. Just memorize the script...
good,"Working with Time Warner Cable was a really good experience but, after it  sold to Charter and renamed Spectrum, the work experience became more difficult to communicate effectively with upper management."
good,I really enjoyed the two years that I worked as a temp for the Columbus Warehouse. I was offered a full-time position but unfortunately I wasn't able to pass the background/credit check. My information hadn't changed since I started there but I guess they have different standards than the agency that I contacted through. You would think they would be the same but I guess not. There are no hard feelings and I really enjoyed the people that I worked with w
good,The company have very good infrastructure to work.  I enjoyed working on the latest technology.  The working culture is good and co-working and management staff were very cooperative.
good,"Great place to work with great benefits. Very good pay and opportunity for advancement within the company. Friendly environment with good people, overall great atmosphere and work place."
good,Working in a call center isnt for everyone. You have to have a strong mental mind to be able to maintain day to day. I recommend taking time to make sure this would be a good fit.
good,"Spectrum is a good place to work they offer good benefits and paid time off. They have good managers,plus you can not beat free cable inter net and phone."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"10 hour days, 4 on 3 off. Not a bad environment to work in at all. Most of the workday is laid back and management isn't constantly breathing down worker's necks. They expect workers to work, but they aren't constantly badgering them. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to get a bit of downtime where you can advance your skills and study on the clock."
good,There is a strong support system in place for all members of the team making a typical day mostly stress free. The culture is very team oriented and works to help achieve goals.  Being able to satisfy a customer always reminds me of why I do this job.
good,Spectrum was an overall great job. I would defiantly work for them again. Great management and great environment. Is a fast pace job. Although the local call center is closed. I really enjoyed working there.
good,"This job is a fast pace working environment with constant changes having you adapt to new things very quickly. Friendly employees, management is very supportive and understanding."
good,"This is a very good company to work for. "
good,"It has been 10 years since I have worked there, but it was a good place to work at the time. Solid. Overall, a good company, and a good place to work."
good,"Excellent Benefits Package"
good,"When I first started I did not know much in the field of internet and VoIP phone service. The training helped exceptionally! along with training I did my own research that amplified the help as well. I taught my self about pinging ip's and researched the customer website as well. I strongly recommend doing your own research if you are in training with Spectrum. The (research for troubleshoot) aspect of your job will continue as you take more and more calls. I worked for 1 year and 4 months with the company and it had its ups and downs. "
good,Spectrum respects their employees. Pay is good and they have the best 401k of any company. Medical is good. No micro management. Overall very good company.
good,It's a call center and a very busy one for the most part but there are slow days. One thing I did love about this place was  when it was slow and there were minutes between calls they would allow employees who applied for it to leave early either with pay or without. One thing I saw while working there was the high turn around rate. Every four weeks there was a new training class and not because it was expanding but because employees were either being let go or quitting. The company does not believe in Dr.s Notes and if you plan on being out at any point you best have sick time or FMLA. The company offers amazing benefits to its employees but they operate as an employee at will company. If you like a fun but stressful working environment this would be the job for you. They are constantly having coaching and team meetings to improve customer and employee experiences. Dont take this job if you cant handle being yelled and berated at by customers all over the country. They can be extremely nasty at times
good,Daily Goals and Targets fast paced environment. Drive performance and moral. Live monitor calls   and provide feedback to the agents. Provide support for overrides in the system
good,Spectrum has taught me so much with customer service. Empathy and listening is very important. Communication is the biggest key in a call center. The way to treat customers and that customer satisfaction is #1.
good,"Would not like to leave a review at this time. It was a good working place, other tech made it difficult but it was great there. Benefits were also great."
good,Working for Spectrum is a very bittersweet experience. The job itself isn't that difficult for those who are willing to learn and can adapt to a constant changing environment. The pay is fair and the benefits are excellent. They have even paid for my college tuition. The downside is the communication between management and agents. I can only speak for myself when I say the pros outweigh the cons.
good,Spectrum was an okay place to work. My direct manager is FANTASTIC. But the managers over her are terrible. They do not put themselves in the shoes of the representative at all.
good,"Always a different event or wsys to keep your spirits up while working. Fun place, do your work hit goals and you can advance. "
good,"I I enjoyed my time working for spectrum, my supervisor was great, and also the manager. The customers are what made the job difficult, and sometimes corporate was a pain. They pay well, and there is always room for advancement if you are willing to put in the work."
good,"Typical day starts at 8am. Go to install/ trouble calls then work until you're jobs are done and other techs finish. Only issue I have is never having enough equipment on the truck and getting jobs put on you last second. Very team oriented, managers are very supportive. Advancement opportunity is there. You just have to want it."
good,I loved working for Spectrum until I transferred to Florida and the management was extremely unprofessional and unequipped. This is the reason I turned my two week notice into the company.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"The work day can range from preventative maintenance, trouble resolution dealing with outside cable plant and electronics, or system restoration.  The training was ongoing and dealt with new technolgies and equipment.  Being able to work alone and maintain a productive attitude is helpful, but there are also times that projects required working in groups.  The hardest part of the job for me was the long hours while on call and covering a large area.  I enjoyed my coworkers and management made the goals of the positions known and worked to help the employees succeed and advance in the company."
good,Great base pay and discount cable and internet services. wonderful benefits. Many events and appreciation things done for the workers. Weekly food vendors on sit. 30 minute lunches
good,The company is a place I enjoyed and would go back...I felt I was treated fair and felt the company had great benefit and cared about there employee...
good,"Great job to learn, train and finess sales skills!"
good,Good company. Fast pace and unlimited growth options if your willing to do what it takes. 4 10Hr days. Time off paid. Family oriented place. Good training and technology.
good,"working at spectrum was very fast paced. meeting performance goals was number 1 priority. ,Had 10 great yrs at spectrum. hardest part of job was trying to troubleshoot in the dark. the most enjoyable part was the freedom we had where i was not micromanaged."
good,good career job. great benefits. challenging but  rewarding. great training program. paid training friendly team driven atmosphere. secure site hand cap accessible
good,"its a overall good place to work. great benefits. overall good management. every since the merger, seems like they have trouble getting things in line though."
good,The workers were friendly and my manager helped me when i needed to learn something new and do it quicker. Everyone was helpful and kind to each other as well and helped them if they needed it too.
good,"I greatly enjoyed doing all the training and installs for a year, but once I was promoted to trouble calls it got a bit more stressful. Some angry customers and more work to do in less time. In the end I was doing only trouble calls everyday, but not being paid according to my tier. To be promoted you need to do unpaid online classes. It's very interesting and beneficial if you plan on staying in the telecommunications industry, which I'm not. Also very time consuming.  Overall it was a good job and company to work for.  They're very invested in safety and making sure you're prepared for any scenario."
good,Spectrum is a great company as a whole with endless opportunities. With great pay and benefits it makes an excellent career opportunity if you are able to keep up with the fast paced environment. The management teams are contradictory at times and seem as though some areas are not managed as well as others but the beauty comes with the fact that you have so many opportunities to move to other jobs within the company.
good,"I enjoyed working at Spectrum, learned different aspects of Customer and Tech Support. Had Support from management in other departments, Developed excellent communication skills."
good,Great company to work for with a lot of career advancement. Also very friendly and professional. You can trust Human resources with information and that they will keep it confidential.
good,"Overall, Charter lacks leadership and it all starts at the top.  Supervisors and managers did all they could in order to maintain a balance work environment."
good,Spectrum is a great place to work with a calm environment and lots of knowledge and teaching. It's a great place for helping you learn certain skills and assisting you with advancing.
good,"it helped me with more skills in computer . it also helped me more  skills in receiving , inventory. shipping , leadership, materials hendler , papers work , QC and more"
good,"There is a lot of pressure to do better with stringent and sometimes unattainable goals but, overall a good place to work. just do the job that's expected of you and you won't have any problems."
good,"Overall I have enjoyed my experience working at spectrum it’s a great opportunity for many. The commission is great with a decent salary. Obviously the sales is where it’s at with any of these jobs and if you deliver the money is great. The job requires a lot of energy and efficiency, so you always gotta keep your self on track!"
good,"Fun environment, listen to music while working.  Fun managers that would help you at the drop of a dime.  Very secure workplace with a good chance for advancement."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I started at spectrum with little practical large scale networking experience, they gave me on the job training to advance my knowledge. They have great benefits and even better employee perks. The work can be very emotionally exhausting but fulfilling."
good,"Charter Communications is a growing diverse company that challenges associates with the every changing technology related to telecommunications and entertainment industry. My typical day at work involves the recording and analytical task of asset management. (Fixed assets) The most enjoyable part of the job is the learning experience that goes with the daily, weekly, and monthly duties involved."
good,"I really enjoy what I do at Spectrum; however, no one, except upper management have weekends off.  Everyone works from Sunday to Wednesday or Wednesday to Saturday.  That is the only downfall to this job."
good,Management is very flexible at Spectrum.  Although you have the ability to work remote most of the day is spent in the office.  It's a good environment  to develop your skill sets.  Most of the training is hands on and there have been classes offered outside of the office for additional training.  Overall it's a great place to work
good,"The work was okay, you don't really know if you fit in with until you have done the work. Management and co-workers are very friendly and supportive in the work environment."
good,"Overall Spectrum is a friendly, postitive, and rewarding work environment that challenges you and grooms you to be the best you can be at your job. I highly recommend working for Spectrum."
good,I have learned a different way of customer service and learn a lot working with a types of people and attitudes over phones met some great people along the way
good,Long and stressful days but very fast pace and get to meet new people everyday. Great benefits with free cable and fair compensation with plenty of overtime available. Easy to move up
good,They try their best to make a stressful job bearable and really show they care for how hard working the employees are. Whenever you’re struggling they provide someone who helps you with it directly.
good,Spectrum is a wonderful company with amazing benefits. The pay is very competitive and the company is very diverse. There is always advancement opportunities and management to help you along the way.
good,The telecommunications industry is a business that is constantly changing.  You need to know how to change your plans and work a different direction at any moment.  Overall it was a good company to work for.  I was treated well.
good,"Go on scheduled appointments for the day."
good,"productive, great learning experience."
good,Working for Spectrum as a sales person was fun. I got to meet a diversity of people and learned about their life and family. To be able to connect and assist them.
good,"Start the day at nine o'clock in the morning, be at the first job by nine. Get a job every hour until eight o'clock pm. The time frames are what get you."
good,"Good work, lots of independence, management could be better, Plenty of benefits, plenty of room for advancement, as a matter a fact they they try to push for advancement"
good,"Learned how to maintain, repair and install cable services. Would go out with about 10 jobs for the day and could pick up more if i got done early. A very good work enviroment and everyone got along well, the hardest part was a bad winter season."
good,"In the 17 years, I learned a great many databases, skills, cable & communication abilities. I cannot measure and/or put a value to everything I gained there."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Spectrum truly allows its employees to create their own future. You can make as much money as you are willing to. Upper management is difficult and disconnected, but direct supervisors are amazing."
good,"Spectrum is a good place to work. The management cares about their workers. While the customers may have negative reasons for calling in their opinion, they don't encourage becoming confrontational with the callers. The management does work with the representatives to help them improve their skills and advance to other functions within the company."
good,"Very friendly environment. Great company to work for, all management staff had an open door policy.  Benefits and 401k were great along with other great benefits."
good,"A typical day at Spectrum would include taking calls from various customers from all over the country, as well helping with internet issues, cable problems, and utilizing other problem solving skills."
good,"I was very happy, however, the career advancement was not there. Management was very nice, cared about their employees, and easy to talk to. Definitely recommend."
good,"While every company has it's shortcomings, in general I would rate Spectrum as a great place to work.   "
good,"Typical day is providing customer service whether be installing or fixing. Some job may be difficult depends what the issue is, manager are a phone call away if help needed. the best part about this job is leaving a customer home smiling and service working."
good,"Work with little supervision, I learned to work with others and work with other companies, "
good,This is an amazing company to get your start in a tech career. At least it is in the business class side of things. I definitely can say that this place is a blast!
good,"Well managed company. The work environment was friendly and they take the time to train you. Vehicle is provided, gas card and tools. They keep the tech's informed of updates and encourage further training."
good,I work for Time Warner before it became spectrum. Time Warner was a lot easier to move up and make more money. Spectrum it is harder for you to make money and things change too much. It’s only been spectrum for about a year so I’m just getting used to the new company. Overall it’s a good company I just think they could treat employees better.
good,"spectrum is a great company to work for , theres a lot of opportunities for career advancement. I learned a lot of awesome things with spectrum. the culture is diverse its a great environment."
good,Busy but in a good way. Great support from management team and HR. Great opportunity for progression especially if you are willing to relocate. I would recommend Spectrum to friends and family.
good,Great management with great attitude! Unfortunately you're on the phone 24/7. You gotta be okay with getting yelled at. Very tough to keep angry customers. But they pay well and definitely always have your back.
good,sales is want I love to do but people could be very hard some time to work with in a environment of a call center with different personally. I was able to talk with great people over the phone and we also had great training section every week.
good,"Typical day for me at Charter as a cable repair phone rep started at 5 pm and ended at 1 am. I was tasked with answering the phone and helping all customers with any charter related issues or question. this ranged from helping to reset a cable box over the phone to answering billing questions and helping to dispute any charges. Charter will provide paid training that can last up to a month before you are placed with a team with in the call center. All management with in the call center will help you with question or concerns you may have while getting used to the work flow and customer issues. The best part is that if you work for charter and are in an area that charter services, all charter services that you have are free or reduced to a really low cost."
good,"Time Warner Cable was a great place to work, Charter/Spectrum was okay, much stricter (no more telecommuting), and stingier than Time Warner Cable. "
good,Spectrum call center is a good please to work. the director goes above and beyond to break barriers to make you feel comfortable. the team is amazing and willing to assist.
good,"Had a great run during my time there. call center environment. never worked in a call center before, but definitely enjoyed my time here. the salary was great and commission was phenomenal.  Everybody gets along with each other and develop a bond with your team that your on. gained a lot of sales experience and great benefits."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"It's a great job if you can stick to a schedule and find meaning in a normal routine. You can pick up overtime when you'd like, but often there isn't enough people answering the phones so at the end of one call you will take a breath and another is on the line. But the benefits are reasonable and it's a great entry level position"
good,"I worked as a Technical Care Representative doing over the phone trouble shooting and technical support for internet and phone. The job and work was relatively easy, though you would occasionally get an upset customer, same as any other customer position. Pay was good, and getting free services from the company was very helpful when it came to making life affordable. Overall, it was a good job, but the lack of outdoors and overall type of work wound up being not for me. I would recommend it for people that are well adjusted to call center work."
good,Great environment to work in. It is very laid back.The people that I work with are amazing. We all help each other if needed and it feels like a family.
good,"Cannot rate for post acquisition by Spectrum, but my tenure at TWC was overall a great experience that provided me with a lot of career growth and opportunity."
good,Charter/Spectrum is a huge company and experiences may vary. The Columbus based repair center is excellently managed.  Probably one of the best call center jobs in the country when the pay/benefits are considered.  Environment is a little strict (as with most call centers) but still emphasizes community and collaboration. The benefits in particular make this company difficult to leave.
good,"it was a good place to work at just was to slow for me and to repetitive. "
good,Spectrum was a great place to get started in a career. I was able to quickly move to a position that was a better fit than what I started off with. The culture in the company is great
good,"Everyone is there for you, internal career advancement friendly management. Would recommend. Great pay, competitive workflow, break rooms and free popcorn and Coffee!"
good,"14+ years in the fast-paced, technical cable industry.  Multitasking ability is imperative.  There is always something to learn as procedures can and do change. Teamwork is a must, but being an independent self starter is just as important.   Constant communication via computer based programs as well as telephone -internal and external.  Attention to detail is a high priority."
good,"I can only speak for the specific department in which I worked for which was in the inbound sales team. But overall it was a great place to work, and very fast paced. This was my first job coming out of the Military and has given me a great experience overall in the civilian sector. I knew I wanted to do sales and that's what pointed me to this position.  As a sales rep our job was of course to sales. It was a base pay plus commission type of job and if you can sale, then you can make good money. They provided all the leads in the form of inbound calls so all we had to focus on was selling. Sales isn't for everybody though.  If you like sales, then this position at this company is definitely a good company to check out."
good,"Worked for TWC for 35 years,,  Very good to me....I would recommend a position to anyone here.   Their benefits are great as well. Left only because they relocated my position to another state"
good,"Good, fast-paced environment at this company and has a good job culture from my three years of experience there.  I continue to have very good relationships and keep in contact with the people whom I've worked within the past 3+ years with and continue to work with on a daily basis today as well."
good,"Been with company for 5 years and has been a great experience to always remember. Met great friends and learned a lot, something to take with me in my next chapter."
good,"Charter offers great benefits, If you aren't use to working in a fast paced environment this isn't the job for you. I love it here , Im happy I chose Spectrum !"
good,"Help customers that came into the office with either payments, setting up new services and troubleshooting issues they would have.  Inventory of stock and ordering monies when needed."
good,If you like to manage your resources & time and like working within a team but dominantly on your own then this is the job for you. Not at all a desk job.
good,"The job was very physical and fast paced, at times.  I had no trouble staying in shape or keeping my weight down.  There is a learning curve to catching onto what's needed to do the job well, but management and coworkers do well to help out when needed.  If they weren't available, answers were at least a phone call away.  Unlike most other jobs, you get an office!  Unlike other jobs with offices, YOURS has four wheels!  This job is not easy, but I found it to be very rewarding and challenging.  I never struggled with going into work the next day because of being bored with the work.  I liked helping the customers and found it easy to develop rapport--that's the best way to start your service calls.  The job can be stressful when times are busiest, but that gets easier, like all other jobs, as you get more experience.  It took me a solid year before I felt comfortable with the different things I ran into, from day to day.  Just don't let that deter you from trying onsite cable install or troubleshooting.  I will miss this job very much."
good,"When i worked for Bright House Networks, I loved everything about the job. I worked on reports daily. I put gift bags every Thursday for Friday's events. There was nothing hard about my job."
good,"fast paced fun , team based structure . the only issue I had was with scheduling once you pick your schedule you are pretty much stuck with it unless someone trades you . unfortunately management could not help me with this so I had to leave . You can not work here and go to college full time ."
good,Typical day was built around reaching goals and eliminating root causes. In tuned to life-work balance and provided a relaxed culture for all employees.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"represent the company handling corporate escalations on behave of the company and it's leaders, responding to complaints and resolving them. Putting together trending reports to pin point needs of the company and what will help us grow as a company."
good,"Great benefits, great salary, but you have to sacrifice your personal life because sometimes you are required to stay more than you should work in a certain work day. if you have learned great at training it will be easy for you out there, otherwise you will have a hard time in the beginning, coworkers are great but there is no time to chat too much, my manager was great, and it is a great place to work for."
good,It's very well established company. Spectrum is growing day by day and there's alot of opportunities to grow and enhance your skills in the Telecommunication domain.
good,"I loved this job!  Dealing with internal, and external customers was my passion!  The possibilities for advancement was phenomenal!  All in all working there, you became an important  part of a team."
good,Working for Spectrum brings you in contact with cool technologies and also great people. I go from house to house on a daily basis to install or troubleshoot customers tv and internet equipment. And i enjoy interacting with them.
good,great working relationships built over 15 years of service there. We were like a working family. great understanding of cable industry thanks to working in multiple depts.
good,This is a great starter job for those that need work experience.  Each day is different from the next and at times it can be overwhelming. Some days are busy and others are slow.
good,"Awesome place to work. No part-time positions. Set Schedules, Great Pay, Great Benefits & Perks to include all services(cable, phone, internet), awesome instructors/trainers and management"
good,My review is for TWC only since I would have to relocate in order to keep my position which I didn't.  I can't accurately rate now they are Spectrum.  The work was challenging with great benefits.  Also good work balance.  Always felt I could manage my personal life when I needed.  Had we not been bought I would have most likely stayed.
good,"I enjoy Spectrum as a company,but Im looking for a career more involved in learning IT support.Ive learned a lot from them and look forward to learning more."
good,This is a company that requires employees that are committed to excelling when faced with change. Because of the constant shifting in management employees are often subject to self-training in order to keep up with business needs. Overall this is a great company to work for if you are seeking a stable career with the opportunity to retire and still manage to care for your family.
good,I enjoy working at spectrum just wanting to pursue other career options. The work environment is balanced and they offer great benefits I really appreciate all the job has to offer.
good,"Taking calls and manage customer needs its always challenging some how.  The workplace and people were always professional and awesome to me.  I learned about internet technologies and also learned what kind of issues customers can have."
good,"I worked and learned several different positions for this company. The hardest part of the job was any time that although I tried my best, there were still those customers you just could not satisfy, but that goes with the territory.

good,"need more supervisors. 4-day work schedules"
good,"I will admit that since the purchase of TWC by Charter there have been alot of changes that the company has implemented, alot of it is not good and seems to benefit the company more than the employees and customers. However, One thing that has not changed is the people you will meet there. The people that you will meet at the San Diego Call Center are the most professional, most friendly, most people that you will ever meet"

good,"Charter communications is a great place to work if you can last long enough to get off of the residential phones.

good,"I am at a dead end job without possibility of growth.  I really enjoyed my last duties and hoping to find something that I was previously doing. I was a ""go to person"" and really enjoyed this role. I take my job very seriously and with my long time employment you can see that I am a dedicated person.  The job role that I am currently in, once I have completed my work, there is not much more for me to do or learn since the team is split. As far as cross training, they are very big on that. The hardest part of my job is just making sure I balance and hoping for no errors. (which I have next to none). I also do what we call Issue Traks which is when customers make a complaints. I have masters this since the first day of roll out in 2005.    I am the lead over these currently and serve as a go to person for these."
good,"first job is at 8 am, have an 1 hr and 15 min to find and fix the problem. Your next job is at 9 which could be 20-30 min away. There's no one hovering over you all day but you have to make sure you are doing your job correctly."

good,Great people to work with and for. You spent your day interacting with customers and helping them set up different cable plans for their home. We also took cable payments and set up service times
good,"Pay could be better but everything about it is meh. its a good job, not a career. I personally think that the management should allow the employee to focus more on quality first and then production but its the opposite."
good,"They make an effort to keep employees happy with surveys, advancement from within and decent benefits.  Last few years have been VERY tumultuous with takeovers and restructuring, so there has been quite a bit of turnover.  Even though I lost my job in the last round, I have no complaints - there were lots of moves made, but at least they made sense.  Upper management proved to be honest and open and the vast majority of the team is easy to work with.  I would have no problem going back for the right opening."
good,I already input a review for this company. It appears there is something wrong with your site requiring me to do it again.

good,"I have worked for Time Warner Cable/Charter for a combined 25 years of experience and have held many positions within my tenure. I have been given the proper tools to advance my career and have taken advantage of my opportunities while working for this great company. Working as a fiber services technician has been a great learning experience for me and I have developed my skill set with the opportunities granted to me. It is hard work with a lot of driving involved since we cover such a large area, but the rewards have been well worth the effort given. I work with a great group of people who go above and beyond to help each other and provide support to get the job done right the first time."
good,"Great company Benefits and typical day included workings 8-10 hours. Learned a lot with self help classes and provided good oppurnuties for advancement. Had a good supervisor and a very diverse working enviroment. Annual pay way good and with yearly bonuses. The hardest part was the first 2 days of month end close going loghours, but they did provide meals for every moonth end close late nights."
good,"Learned so much in this position. Learned several design programs, all about loose tube & ribbon fiber, as well as how to calculate dB loss & find faults in existing plant."

good,"I was a dispatcher for 15 years and every day was a fun day because the technicians would be very help full and responsive. Co-workers were help full as well. Management, unfortunately I can't say that they are all in the same page but that was the biggest reason why i would not approach them too often. "

good,"In this industry you learn how to stay ahead of a constantly changing environment. Almost no day will ever be the same.  While being with the company day after day, it turns more and more into a family environment."
good,A great company with amazing benefits. There is alot of room for advancement with training provided at no cost to the employee.
good,Awesome place to work at! Recent merger has caused quite a stir and a bit of disorganization. Training is 5.5 weeks and the sales trainers are great! You learn quite a bit of information that you will take you through you sales career with the company. Like a crash-course in telecom.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is taking on new projects and challenges. Charter was going through a lot of changes so we were learning all together as time went by.
good,In past years I have become more efficient in many different computer programs.  With the fast past world and changing our company done I would have to be able to learn something quickly and different as soon as it was handed to me.  My co-workers became friends and family to me.  I enjoy people and love to have a bubbly personality.  I enjoy working with crowd and public and always enjoy changes.
good,"Bright House is a good company to work for depending on which office or location you work. Technicians are treated differently , if you're not a favorite. ..well. Hopefully someone working there will see this review and keep an eye on the MLK office in Tampa."
good,Training is hands on so you learn a lot if you apply yourself. Work closely with your sales coaches and learn the products.
good,"The company as a whole was great. Great benefits and employees, the hours were there and the growth opportunity as well but the commissions sales base part was a little excessive"
good,TWC provided a good environment for someone to learn and grow. Management was supportive and paid for certifications.

good,"Workforce Department in Orlando is by far the BEST TEAM I have EVER worked with!!  The Senior WF Manager and the supervisor are the BEST leaders ever!!  They care about you, are professional and work hard in being fair to all.  They always provided a work/life balance atmosphere yet, knew how to roll up their sleeves to pinch in and help with work overflow..  Anyone who works with them are truly blessed!  I know because I was!!"
good,"Audited res/Bus in TWC territories. Acquired knowledge on latest Cable TV  tecnology. Management restricted working with employees of other departments in the company. Co-workers were always very helpful with each other. Accessing telephone poles in back yards could be very challenging when property owners denied entry. Customer satisfaction was a rewarding part of the job bring Cable TV, Internet, and telephone services to families and Businesses."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits and people. Not much room to advance though. My experience with Management was wonderful. I was lucky to have great bosses to work for."
good,Great place to work. Great people. A lot of ways to advance and make more money. Really miss working there. Hardest part about working here is climbing utility poles in the summer time.

good,"I love working for this company very much, just does not have family friendly schedules due to it being a call center.. everything else is great."
good,It's not like a dinosaur and unicorn walk over to the marshmallow alien’s burrow for a tea party before taking an afternoon ride on flying pirate ship but Time Warner Cable is fun place to work. People are nice and very talented. Everyone helps each other to achieve common goal. Management structure is both functional and divisional  and works most of the time. The most challenging part of the work is delays in getting certain things approved. The best part of the job is the people. Team and teammates within department do bring synergy.
good,This was a fun job. Met a lot of wonderful people. Management was awesome. The perks were amazing for the employees. Learning the in and outs of new products were great. They were always looking for  the next best thing.
good,Time Warner Cable is a great place for someone that is entry level background. You will learn the ins and outs of the cable and high speed internet industry. The hardest part of the job is that you won't be able to fix everyone's problem.
good,It was a nice to work.  Really liked all the coworkers. Learning curve was very steep to learn the computer skills. Must like being on the phone to do this job.
good,"TWC has given me the opportunity to expand my knowledge and to contribute in a meaningful way.  My skill set and experience is appreciated.  The team communicates well and works well together.  This particular group has a great collaborative environment.  I can't speak to any of the other roles at TWC, but I highly recommend the Compensation Department."

good,"excellent benefits, fast paced work environment and sometimes can really be fun to work at...The only negative aspect of the job is sometimes the customer may know of a change in their services or promotional offers before the employee so I would say that there is poor communication between management and the employees."
good,Excellent pay and quarterly bonus! Great management! provides great opportunity for career growth.Enjoyed all the company perks to local professional sporting events.
good,"It was 6 months project and i really enjoyed it, everyone there is very friendly. i would love to work there again. thanks to all the team"
good,"Reviewing accounts, processing payments, and typical customer service was what I usually did. I also had to meet a sales quota and handle customer equipment. I learned a lot about building rapport with customers and it helped because customers used to come and request to speak with me instead of other representatives. Management was not great, but in my time there, they made a switch and the new upper management team reviewed all customer employees. They gave me along with a few other representatives an additional raise that our supervisors overlooked. Some of my co-workers relied on me too much since I finished my work quickly, but for the most part, they all handled their own work well. The hardest part about the job was meeting the quota since I was a floater and would be stuck in slow offices at times. The most enjoyable part was  the pay and benefits."
good,"Answering phone calls, you get coached once a week on your good behaviors and give you advice on how you could do better. You earn paid vacation and sick time. Each month we work as a center and do work incentives to help the community or our work place."

Support et assistance au Managing Director et aux Vice Presidents, coordination administrative, responsable des organisations d’événements tels que séminaires, activités de team building, avant-premières de films Warner Bros., réceptions…"
good,As a technician you are responsible for installing and repairing cable systems in costumers homes. While on the job you're responsible for the company vehicle along with taking care of and respecting the costumers personal belongings. Supervisors are always helpful whether its needed on or off the job.
good,"I  became a polished television play-by-play announcer; developing my abilities as a high school and college football and basketball sportscaster at Time Warner Cable. My partners and I worked together as a team and we had a fantastic time broadcasting not only prep and college sports, but professional boxing as well."
good,"A typical day employed at Time Warner Cable consisted of technical operations. Specifically in troubleshooting, installation, repairs, service calls and customer service. I obtained 100% customer satisfaction and zero re-work; meaning, I never had a co-worker re-visit my work because I failed to complete a task. I learned that in order to succeed at this job, a positive attitude always had to be present because your day could quickly turn ugly. Ugly because weather conditions were unpredictable. "
good,"Overall I liked the company and its environment. My co-workers were all go-getters which made the job fun, each day we all competed to outsell one another, which not only increased our daily numbers but allowed us to grow as individuals."
good,Charter was a great company to work for the only downfall is the inflexibility of the scheduled work shifts. Not the best place for parents with children depending on the outcome of your initial shift bid.

good,"A typical day insisted of driving the company van to customers' houses to install internet, tv, and phone service. I learned a lot about troubleshooting skills and in depth operations of the field technician of a cable company. My supervisor was the most approachable and friendly, he really made me feel like he was there to help me, which is a major plus in a job. The hardest part of the job was being outside exposed to harsh weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of this job was the moment you've finished a huge installation and the look on the customers' face when you have fulfilled their every need and ensuring a 20 year installation."
good,Great to be out of the office atmosphere. Big company that looks out for there employees. With being such a big company hard to get your voice heard and regarless of how hard or of it doesnt make sense you have to go with the flow. Other then that great company.

good,"A great place to work if you willing to put in the hours, which are usually 11a-8p weekdays and 4-5 hrs on Saturday,  Dealing with residential customers you learn how to cope with a variety of personalities and sales scenarios.  Co-workers are another amazing asset, all will work with you as a team."
good,I was very comfortable working this job. The people were all extremely helpful and the work itself was very gratifying knowing that I could help out customers with their problems.
good,"It's been some time since I worked for Charter Communications and from what I've heard through the grapevine much has changed, but when I was working there things were pretty great. It was a great start to my Telecommunications career. The benefits were great, the compensation was FANTASTIC, and the self advancement opportunities were plenty."
