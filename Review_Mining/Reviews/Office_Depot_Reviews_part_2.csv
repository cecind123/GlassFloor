I absolutely love everything about working for this company. Communication among employees is casual yet stern, employees are close friends without overstepping boundaries, each department is filled with people who care and are knowledgeable about their field (at least, in my store). I was moved to Copy and Print after about 2 weeks on register, and I love it so much. On events like tax free weekend our store manger would order the entire store pizza since most of us were there all day, or for morning meetings a manger would bring donuts for us. Overall, if college doesn't work out, I know I have a home at Office Depot."
good,"I only worked with them over a summer before my Bachelor's work started, but it was a great experience with varied responsibilities.  My only complaint would be that they dumped associates into working the print center with only two day's training, and we had no one that could really help if there was a machine we forgot/didn't know how to operate."
good,"It was a pretty laid back job. It has a good management team, and the co-workers have a ""team oriented"" mindset, and working together is second nature."

good,"your typical retail job but less stressful i would think, does get boring at times the pay is okay but the management is great stressful times are usually closing with a furniture return or sale but the gratification from finishing it is awesome"

I had fun with my customers as well as fellow associates while getting my work done in a timely manner Some days we were slammed in the print center so i spent most of my time helping with print orders or giving consults with potential print customers rather than helping at the registers. I was the stores go between, they trained me in all areas so I could assist when and where need be."

Our customer service manager is great with customers and our Print Services supervisor is friendly and easy to work with. Office Max is a great company with excellent management and they genuinely care about their associates.

They showed me how to work the computer system that they do their work on. When they had meetings they included me, even though I was only working for a week, they still treated me like a full time employee. I wasn’t that confident in that area of work, but the supervisor, was patient with me and showed me what to do. The best part about working for turners is the friendly people that work there aswell, thy make you feel welcome and are willing to help you out when you need help.

We all supported each other. I worked at two different locations and loved both. The atmosphere was great which is the reason i stayed for 2+ years. Turnover at my stores were little to none because everyone loved working here.My favorite part of the year was back-to-school because we always had such cute school accessories. Im sad I left this company, but hours became very minimal due to many new hires. I started here when I was a sophomore in high school and now I'm graduated.

good,"Worlds best company to work for! I wouldn't give it up; for the world."
good,A typical day at OfficeMax was rarely dull.  The customers usually knew what they wanted but there was always a question here and there.  By learning from my peers I was able to answer their questions with confidence.  Management changed quite often which wasn't a problem to me.  Adapting to change is fine because I learned new ways to help the customer get the solution that was needed.  As with the management my co-workers changed frequently and I never had a issue getting along with them or helping out the new team member.  The hardest part about the job is when business slowed down and my hours were cut due to low pay roll.  Office Max was a great place to work simply because I got to interact with people from all over the world.  I learned a lot from that company.

good,Party City required me to multitask while providing the best possible service to any customer with all inquiries. I loved how fast paced the work environment is--there was always something to work on/improve. I loved all of my coworkers--all of us got along very well and were friends outside of work as well. The management team was also very great... this group is very understanding/fun/promoting of good work ethic. The hardest part of the job was once when my managers went into the back office and turned their radios off... i was the only associate in a sea of customers--but the situation turned out to be fine.
good,Worked in various departments. Good opportunities. Good pay. Challenges that kept things interesting. Hardest part was leaving.  Learned a lot. Especially computer programs.
good,"Everything is great with this company management is awesome."

good,"From the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out, there's nothing but professionalism, team work and very hard working people making your life fun and stress free."
good,"Great place to work. Everyone is extremely nice and a little goofy. Managers were amazing and really cared about employees. Some days would be slow and some days would be super busy, but always worked hard. Slow days are spent really cleaning and organizing the store; while busier were spent really trying to make sure every customers had what they needed and left happy. Have to be very attentive to who is in the store and where in the store they are. At the end of the day its always great to hear a customer say that they enjoy coming to our store over other locations and our competitors."
good,"A typical day at work would be going over planograms and projects that are coming due, as well as assigning tasks to associates. Other tasks included goal-setting, and training, along with dissemination of new or relevant information to associates. What I learned is that each individual is different, with differing attitudes, aptitudes and motivations. Management at both locations was very uneven in terms of work ethic and management style, but expectations were in place and enforced. Co-workers in both locations tended to be professional and people's areas of responsibility well understood. The hardest part of the job was always keeping the store well-staffed and trained properly. It was always a challenge working with a high turnover rate. What was most rewarding was achieving and/or exceeding goals, be they sales, logistics, or training."
good,"I had remarkable experience working here, got chance to learn a lot and improvements accordingly. My manager was cool and helpful, so my collegues were."
good,it's a great place to work and you get to help out customers with what they needs to find. Take phones calls to help out the customers online .
good,I enjoyed helping customers pick out the right technology for them. it was am awesome work experience and enjoyed the staff
good,"With this job, time management was a priority. Being at work on time meant that a co worker was able to leave as scheduled which was a plus for building a good relationship among the team. My position was in the copy center and once at work, it was very important to go over all work orders in the log book and check emails for online orders. Another vital task was to communicate with customers via all means (telephone, email, and in person). My experience with Office Depot was educational in that I learned how to more extensively work with office equipment and help put together presentations and/or important materials while keeping a professionally warm mannerism. One of the other benefits came from doing a check list upon hiring. In doing this, I was being able to get to know the products on the floor. The management team was always available and encouraged teamwork and integrity. The hardest part of the job was some co workers not taking their job seriously and the most enjoyable was building relationships with customers."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new customers everyday. The hardest part was to satisfy unhappy customers. The management was great and flexible with scheduling.
good,I enjoy working for Office Max for the years that I have been employed. We offer excellent customer service and the staff is very friendly and reliable.
good,"A typical day would be me dealing with Customers i loved doing that and making them feel welcome into the store i had many customers who would come back just to deal with me and it made me feel special."
good,All of the management is helpful. let work and be by your self I.E. they don't hover over you and let you do what you need to do. And the employees are nice to work with.
good,"compañerismo"
good,"Very great place to work, management is great they know how to run their store together as a team and make it a very mellow, relax working environment they make it fun and as the same time we all get our daily task completed."
good,"Es una excelente empresa para trabajar, con un buen clima laboral y buenas prestaciones."
good,If we had not gotten layed off I would still be there. Every work day you were challenged with change and that kept if from getting boring and you were always learning new things.
good,I was with OfficeMax for two years an learned many valuable soft skills as a manager.  They have advancement opportunities that were easy to enroll in.
good,Working with this company was the best decision I ever made.  Management always looked out for their employees.  I started working within the warehouse as an Inventory Control Specialist and worked my way up to a Bids/Contract Administrator.
good,"This was my first job, they taught me how to deal with customers in a nice manner, work the cashier, organize the product in a organized manner."
good,"I didnt really like i here much. Bad management, but it was a great job for the time that I was there to be honest.They could do alot better of controlling their hiring situation and being fair to their employees though."
good,Fun place to work. The schedules are flexible and I am able to work my favorite shift which is second shift. The medical and dental plans are very reasonable under (Blue Cross and Blue Shield).
good,this was one of the best work places of my life. I grew from having not a single thing about printing to knowing about everything i could ever aspire to know about printing
good,Responsible for entire technology department and inventory and pricing.  Managed several people on the floor and worked directory for general manager to improve overall presentation of the store.
good,"part time job, stocking, computer sales,  aroun 20 hours a week"
good,"Since I now work in the print center I have learned how to work on several different things at a time without stretching myself thin. The environment has always been great. I've never had problems with the workflow, scheduling, or my co-workers. I actually do love working there. I would say the hardest part of the job is just remembering to file everything and to deal with customers and still give them great customer service regardless of their attitude. On the other hand the customers are part of what made the job enjoyable for me. Just the feeling you get from seeing that a customer is highly satisfied with your work and what you've done and created for them is a reward in itself. By making sure the customer is happy then creates a relationship with the customer and store ensuring that the customer will continue to do business with the company."
good,"In the early days as the company was growing, you could developed strong relationship at all levels of the company. The company would act on the changes needing to be made to successfully drive a Customer Service Centric Experience / Sales / Profit with the input from the field."
good,All Office Depots associates are fun to work with and caring of each other. Great Team Work. As Management we try to make the workplace fun and energetic for our clients to receive the best in class customer service.
good,Working at Office Depot was such a rewarding experience for me. This was because I met some of the most influential people in my life. My bosses and coworkers would all collaborate as a team to help keep this business running smoothly. It was also very rewarding in that I was able to  learn proper cash handling procedures that were necessary to do the job in an orderly manner.

good,I loved working at Office Depot although it was a short time. They really cared about the employees. My typical day was watching the floor and doing audits.

Hardest part for me was hand lowering several boxes of about 50 pound copy paper boxes off back of dock height truck to cart on ground. Hard on shoulder joints. Most enjoyable for me - I like delivery jobs. Physical and outdoors, on your own."

good,"I learned a a lot from my management and co-workers. Beyond the best job I've ever had. I would say cross-selling and demonstrating certain products like printers were the hardest part of the job. I learned that studying your work environment will make it easier for yourself. I enjoyed the customers, engaging, welcoming, and helping all there needs to be met. My co-workers were the best. Always positive vibes and made the work environment fun. The management team were all so supportive, beyond great at teaching, and very understanding in any situation."

good,I enjoyed the opportunity to control my own destiny. Quickly establishing common ground and nurturing relationships was the most rewarding part of the job and it came very natural to me.

I've been working here for about a year and three months and I haven't received a raise (they told me it was going to be impossible), I've worked fourteen hour shifts and they haven't considered me for full time. I just want to be able to move up and grow in a company and I don't feel like I'll be able to do that here. I'm still thankful that this company was my first job and I'm very happy I was able to learn how to be proficient with things like Photoshop, word, excel, publisher and adobe.

I have personally grown and developed a lot of communication and organizational skills due to this company and I'm forever grateful."

I have learned customers come first and that if given excellent customer service customers will come back, and bring more business. Managing OfficeMax consists of being in control of not only the whole store but also one of the huge departments. I am continuously driving numbers and also training employees. The management team runs as a team and employees go above and beyond to help the company. All employees are constantly working at moving up in the company. The hardest part of my job at first would have been being my age, but once employees understood there's a different line it isn't a problem.

Co-workers became like family since we had all been  together for 10 or more years. The hardest part of the job was hearing that we had dropped the ball somewhere.
