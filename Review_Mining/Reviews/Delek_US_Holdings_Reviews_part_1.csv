rating,review
bad,Terrible culture and treat people disposable no respect for vacations or holidays.  Pretend to be concerned with safety but have few safety managers.  Highly recommend to not work here
bad,As manager you get no support questions are not getting answered .You are the cheapest employee because of salary the have you cover all called in shifts .
bad,"I would never recommend anybody to to work for them.. Delek sucks . Working there with the bosses that don’t know anything  bout mechanical experience. "
bad,The lack of knowledgeable leadership at Delek was evident. They had no direction as far as an organization and very weak leadership especially on the IT side of the house
bad,"I was a contract worker.  I actually liked my job at Delek.  I've been in the pipeline business (for both ROW and Construction) for more than 20 years and love the industry."
bad,I'm still employed and they haven't paid me my last check from last pay period. They have put me in a horrible position financially. I have worked hard for this company and they have hung me and my family out to dry.
bad,They expect you to be a manager and a cashier at the same time while still holding you accountable for the stores appearance and sales numbers. It is impossible to hire people but when you do they steal them to place them at high priority stores. The pay is not worth it they are a “cheap” company who care about numbers not their staff.
bad,"Possibly worse job I've ever had. Worked 90-100 hours/week for over a year as an accepted expectation. No appreciation was given when missing family events, etc. Having any sort of social life outside of Delek was frowned upon heavily through passive aggressive retaliatory behaviors from upper management. Absolute misery. Happily quit when the opportunity arose."
bad,"Delek Logistics' management team feels free to treat their contract employees like second-class citizens while maintaining a false front of employee caring. Honestly, I could described my entire experience there at the Dallas, TX office but I'm not going to waste my time. However, I will say that the company desperately needs to hire qualified managerial staff to run the operation. Otherwise, they are doomed for failure. "
bad,"Extremely poor management, very messed up company , the whole management is run by red necks who have little technology background. New graduates runs the place, older seasoned personnel are squeezed out of the door. Continuous changes are made without thorough engineering, potential bombs are placed on daily basis by new graduates and less competent personnel."
bad,I held several positions for Alon before Delek purchased the company. Delek is strictly in business for profit and does not pay mind to their employee well being.
bad,"Poor manager (never had a supervisor role before), coworkers had no prior experience, everything was behind schedule and over budget, no safety standards or training, un-qualified and non-trained employees testing 480v panels. No communication between management and hourly employees"
bad,First off if you are trying to get experience this place is a great opportunity if you make it out alive.  They preach safety until it gets in the way.  There is no such thing as work/life balance.  In the past year alone I and others I worked with would be lucky to get 2 days off in a row on a schedule were you're suppose to get half the year off minus vacation coverage.  Also compensation is not competitive compared to other companies in the industry. Benefits are average but compared to others in the industries is lacking. The Health insurance is terrible.  The culture is very punitive no such thing as empowering employees.
bad,They changed how they pay loads and implemented a trip rate for the day instead of load pay. I lose an average of $200 a week. On average I gross $1100 a week for hazmat.
bad,"In my opinion, this company is reactive and micro manages to a level that is not productive.   There is also no work/life balance unless you work is all you want to do.  Also the leadership team does not collaborate and this is supported by their leader.  There have been many changes at this refinery including numerous changes at the manager level as it is difficult to work with the manager.   They have no direction except for making changes for the sake of making change.  There is not a lot of good to say about this company especially the overall leadership at El Dorado."
bad,If you want to work all weekend and work all night this is the place for you. Good equipment just no family life. Average pay but no room for advancement
bad,Avoid Delek overall and especially the risk management department if you value any semblance of a family life.  Intolerable work culture.  Senior management relishes being worshipped and creates environments that demand such. Terrible professional experience.
bad,Do not work for this company. Very unorganized place. Management was horrible and encourages other employees to tell on each other. I would not ever recommend this job to anyone. Do not waste your time here.
bad,I used to love the company and i do have a lot of respect fro the upper management but you will never have anything positive said about you from operations. Nothing is ever owned and liability is always passed on to some one else. Even the contractors are blamed for the unorganized behavior and ill front end planning. Operations is the falling point. Ownership will always be someone else’s responsibility.
bad,"The managers are way overworked for a set salary."
bad,"The management at the company in its Logistics department was confused, untruthful, non supportive and incompetent.  The entity had received a large investment fusion that placed then in a situation of growth.  As most know if you are going to grow organically and accusation you better have a solid team and protocols in place.  That was not the case here and it made it very uncomfortable to me."
bad,"Is a very stressful, pressure filled environment. You must do what the CEO says or you will be out of a job. Expect long days and hours. It is a very busy environment as this company loves growing through acquisition. With that said they run very lean and do not like hiring the needed staff necessary to support the growth. "
bad,"Stressful workplace, maintenance slow, pay compared to other delek owned plants paid less than those plants, but this plant makes more product and less down time"
bad,Personally i feel more resoucres for issues should be available for employees. And when contacted quicker responses.  Employees should be more appreciated than left feeling like they are alone and should walk on eggshells. Speak up when its time to speak up and matters should be handles  responsibly by management.
bad,"Too much turn over, too many meetings, no work life balance.  Undergoing a huge transformation in company infrastructure.  May be  a good place to work once they clean house especially within the PMO department. PMO has no experience as a PM with no certifications as a PM.  Very hard to communicate between teams, projects are a mess and have little or no direction.  Projects are all extremely over budget.  I believe once the new Agile approach is implemented the company will change but that is going to take a long time as every department needs an overhaul."
bad,A cutthroat environment were the boss's blame the operators for there mistakes that they denied things that the operator was told to do by them and then try to reprimand them.
bad,"As others have stated safety is very important until it cuts into profits. Managers blame their short comings on underling employees. We patch and run wide open until it breaks again, we don't buy new parts! No responsibility, no accountability, no repercussions for messing up or not following rules or standards, and absolutely no integrity! You can keep the job as long as you want it because we are so very short handed management won't fire you. Plus it takes a month or longer to complete the hiring process then atleast 2 weeks to train."
bad,sent to missouri when my actual pick up was in eldorado....  management tried to blame me although the paperwork i recieved was wrong....  didnt make anything near what was promised.  was left stranded multiple times....
bad,"This company do not provide any benefits, you have absolutely no breaks,You at not guaranteed days off,,no discounts . The customers were good and fun but this company is not worth working for."
bad,most of the workers are lazy. manger needs more teaching on how to treat her staff. not good pay. people quit all the time cant keep staff. manger is rude to everyone
bad,"There is never a typical day at 7/11. Always interesting but very demanding for the low pay you receive.  Take care of customers, keep the store clean, inside and outside. It's a lot of work and expectations from managers and Districts Managers are high."
bad,"I would not recommend, there are a lot of new policies that are not good for the employees. This used to be a great place to work, now not so much. There may be an opportunity for people to come in and move up because the hourly employees are serching for other options."
bad,Been at Delek  since 2010.   The money is good but the management is the worst I have ever experienced they will look you in the face and tell you one thing and go do just the opposite.   A lot of  lying and backstabbing goes on in all of management.  You have to figure your paycheck every payday because they refuse to train anyone to handle the Kronos pay system.  Your check is almost never correct.
bad,"Overall good company you will work"
bad,The amount of Managers to district managers does not allow for the amount of support needed to help each store. Managers are often working 7 days a week with very little relief. The pressure to show up even when sick can lead to very poor morale and health issues.
bad,Delek will work you to death. Supervisors and management have no clue what is going on. There is zero communication between operations and the maintenance department.  You can rarely get a day off. Unless you call in sick
bad,"Great CEO"
bad,"High degree of turn over [much higher than industry norm], constantly changing strategy [shotgun approach], lacking commitment to longer term direction. Share holder pressure forces short term management style."
bad,"This is a great place to work if all you want to do is work. There is little to no balance of home and work life. They expect you to work your days off unless your dead, then you’d had better asked for that day off., more than once I have had to work more than 20 hrs straight then be back in 4 hours for my shift again. Safety is paramount unless it means loss of profit and it shows with the condition of the equipment.  The infustructure is crumbling at the El dorado refinery and from what is said every thing delek has purchased has went downhill. They are dead set on making money nothing else, so very little gets fixed just a patch and run operation. Yes you can make good money here but you won’t be able to enjoy it and I’m my opinion the el dorado refinery is a accident looking for a time to happen."
bad,"I work with great people at delek US, there is no job security though. It would be great if they allow work from home and if the contractors are seen as employees and not outsiders."
bad,The management tried to do their best but the Union made it impossible. They worked with you the best they could. Pay is horrible!!! Training pays 15.90 an hour.
bad,"Management is so overwhelmed with the daily tasks that they constantly have mess ups then blame the employees for stuff they did. I loved the work. Stocking,  cashiering, and the overall customer service is fun. Benefits are great but they work you till you get sick but you can't see the doctor's you pay for because your always working overtime."
good,Job was demanding and stressful. Was on call twenty four hours a day and sometimes work several shifts a day. The pay could have been better for the responsibilities.
good,"nice place to work as a manager if you are single, have no children and no personal life.  Responsible to cover all shifts if associates call out. Little help from other stores or upper management."
good,"We had a great core group of guys in Abilene who took care of business and made the Company money every year.  However, in the grand scheme of may corporations, more management is inserted to fix things that are not broken.  End result, four good men no longer work here.  If only Uzi Yemen knew..."
good,Communication is a Big Deal. They wont know of a problem unless you address it. Keep in contact of any issues or concerns with employer. Be sure everyone is on the same page.
good,"No benefits, no room for advancement, pay was not fair, seldom gave increases, very stressful place to work in management and worked long hours. The Executives were very unfriendly and hard to work with..the facilities were run down and in need of major renovations."
good,"Unless you are the top men in the business, you are small potatoes here. Great people throughout the company but it is a mans world. Females do not get promoted or paid what they are worth. If you are female and have an issue...certain male managers choose to ignore it. Chaotic, way of doing business is questionable. Ethics are questionable. If you want stability- this is your place to work. Small chance of being let go, but you wont get paid what you are worth most likely. I had a degree and was getting paid less than a burger flipper at McDonalds. I also worked 60+ hours a week, 7 days a week and all holidays. No family life."
good,The company was not bad at all. Management could be handled a little better. I enjoyed my job. I was given the opportunity to learn new things. Also working for this company was a valuable experience.
good,Conservatively aggressive Leadership intent on growing the business the right way.  The business has doubled every five years or so.  Travel in specific roles causes stress
good,"After the union , renewal contract took place we as drivers lost about 10k a year."
good,I have really enjoyed my position and learning over the time that I have been here.  I want to continue to grow and develop but have reach a brick wall.
good,"Overall not a bad environment, but they have gone through much change in the leadership and organizational structure.  That can be very good or very bad depending on your position."
good,"Overall company has been  challenging. But, I have learned a lot more about my position to move on to better opportunities to advance my career path...."
good,"although this company was fun to work for -with long hours with low pay, the company was not secure enough . some days there were no loads and we got paid by the loads"
good,"It was a good culture. Very nice people to work with and very helpful."
good,It’s a easy job cleaning stocking you know regular communion start business just wish there was a little bit better communications on what they need other than that easy job they just need more people to work so they don’t overwork the people they have
good,"You will work rotating shifts and sign a union card. Since everyone uses gasoline it is a 24/7 operation. Because it is a union there is the typical head butting between management and the bargaining unit; however, it is not something that cripples productivity when I was there."
good,People are great to work with. Excellent place to build skill set needed to become effective engineer. Tech services group is exposed to various aspects of the business.
good,"The coworkers are great, but I felt overworked very often. My phone rang off the hook, and I was expected to come in at all hours. I do not mind working hard, but this was not part of the deal when I was originally hired."
good,"The position is in a convenience store but depending on the location you may be dealing with issues beyond your control.  The position requires an individual be willing to put in long hours, especially if you have staffing issues.  You do get support from the district managers and corporate, as well as other store managers. and the corporate environment is one of the more supportive that I have seen.  Delek does strongly believe in promoting from within and there are opportunities to advance within the company."
good,This is a refining environment and is very demanding of the employees from a job commitment and time requirement.  It is going through a transition to a larger enterprise model with many changes in flight.
good,Good company to work for. I enjoyed working with the stuff there. they all treated me respectfully at all times. I managed myself. I was not micro managed by my manger or anyone there.
good,"I had a good experience working here. I just didn't like that I was working so much, and hardly spent time with my young family. If long hours don't bother you this is a good job with great benefits."
good,"Delek feels very entrepreneurial. When you have something to bring to the table, bring it, own it, and add the value. This is a fast paced work environment with a very flat org structure, and the top leadership has both great vision and great relations with all employees. Expectations are high, and Delek rewards you very well for meeting/exceeding them. Work life balance can be a struggle, you really have to draw the line with your management on this (or at least, I feel like I would need to). Solid benefits,  good vacation, great pay."
good,short staffed making it hard to have days off. If there were more employees it would make for less pressure on current employees. Pay is decent for the job requirements
good,"Worked at the Refinery. Involved in Safety support in the basic work practices program daily. Enjoyed working there. People were good, administration support was there."
good,The company pays well but expects you to wirk excessive hours.  Offers training for distrct managers and managers.  Stresses the importance of safety with a strong safety culture
good,Delek is a great job to have with great people. Very competitive pay with a wonderful work life balance. Offers ability for advancement within the company
good,I enjoyed working at Delek but pay is not competitive. They don’t have very flexible work schedules and management is not held accountable. The different departments struggle to communicate. Overall though it is a safe and good work environment and the people are the best part of working there. There is opportunity for advancement and they hire from within whenever possible.
good,I worked here for a few months during which point the Store Manager left for medical leave and we then found ourselves down a few employees which led to us all working seven days a week with no days off for over a month and a half.
good,Fast paced great opportunity company.  A very culturally diverse company.  Always looking for great people that want to work hard and success at a very high level.
good,"If you can't stand to be still and always want a long list of tasks to complete, Delek is the place for you. There is always a new project starting just as one finishes up (sometimes overlapping). There's never a dull moment at Delek. If you don't like a fast paced environment or changes to be made almost everyday, Delek is not the place for you. However, if you can keep up, Delek is a wonderful company filled with amazing people."
good,"I have been employed at the Delek plant in Cleburne, Texas for only a few months, but I have enjoyed my time working here. The pay is much better than the jobs I used to work at, there is sick leave and overtime pay, benefits, and healthcare options available. While the 12 hour rotating shifts and the occasional physical work is a challenge, the work I do at Delek is rewarding and the work schedule is manageable."
good,Working for 7-11 gave me a good work experience with customers. Getting to know your everyday clients is a big role in the community. It showed me on how I can help people everyday. By greeting and thanking the clients.
good,"You like working long hours, on a strange schedule."
good,"DelekUS is a growing company, so during the transition to a larger company it seems like there is a lot of upper management but not so much lower worker Bees.  This can be kind of stressful with quick decisions being made.  Overall a good experience though"
good,"Nice work place and friendly co-workers"
good,"Overall good place to work, with sme really good managers, and eployees."
good,People are talented over there. Work pace is fast and learning curve is steep. They have really good data warehouse system. Which is definitely a plus for any data analyst or data scientist.
good,"It was an enjoyable 10 years spent in Tennessee. Career advancement, end interesting work.George working around Nashville Brentwood Franklin Tennessee. 200 miles closer to upstate New York."
good,Delek was a great place to work.
good,Great atmosphere and working environment. Ability to learn a lot about maintenance and electrical troubleshooting. Able to build computer skills on Microsoft Word and Excel.
good,"If you enjoy being part of an ever evolving team, full of challenge with no two days alike, join this company.  The pace is fast, the work ethic unparalleled, but the rewards in recognition through promotion, pay and benefits are great."
good,"If you enjoy being part of an ever evolving team, full of challenge with no two days ever being alike, join this company. The pace is fast, the work ethic unparalleled, but the reward both in recognition through promotion, pay and benefits are great."
good,Excellant management team with the right people in key positions to make the company a growing sucess.
good,"This job is amazing!! It's flexible with life situations. I have met so many amazing people in this business. Thier is opportunity to move up the ladder. They have amazing insurance, health care, and even 401k!!! Absolutley would recommend anyone."
good,It was a nice place to work at. I recommend this jobs to whoever that's looking for a jobs or want to work in a facility like this. If they call me back to work here I would go back.
good,Shouldn’t of ever left missed my customers and employees great vender relationships All top management team help and lead leadership skill are very good in most of company
good,"Great teamwork, benefits and culture. They have a Wellness program to assist employees in making the right decision for their families. Always listening to feedback from employees and looking to innovate"
good,"Best place to work with good people and outstanding management, the environment was great and very professional, all employees we’re so kind and knowledgeable with positive vibes"
good,overall work was great   just looking for a change in my career my needs to follow my grand kids in their school activities is very important to me so i hoping to find a little different pace to life
good,"They gave me an internship and treated me well, they kept me busy and I learned a lot about corporate accounting.  Everyone treated me well."
good,Pay is exceptional I have been hauling crude for 9 years and I have never got close to $200 a day except with this company. If you want a great place to work and the highest pay in the industry go here
good,Learned much more about fixed asset tax accounting. Management had a great open door policy. Delek promoted an excellent team environment. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was being able to gain knowledge from the great minds at Delek; there was no shortage of things to learn. The hardest part of the job was the company/industry learning curve in my first few months.
