rating,review
bad,Don't take a contract position with Eversource. They'll let you go without blinking twice. The Group where only cares for themselves. Manual team will give you a very hard time about sharing info for automation.
bad,Eversource is such a bad place to work. They will stress you out and make you feel like you don't know your job. The supervisors walk around while doing nothing all day and when you need help they pretend like they are busy. It's like a never ending episode of Grey's Anatomy where everyone is having sex with everyone just with less pay. They are an unethical company and really need to be investigated for their treatment towards employees as well as customers. Apply at your own risk
bad,I worked on the Networking Team where I was never included from the beginning. They had one guy that was there for 30 years and would take down the network for hours on end. He would also sabotage you lab setups and work. The setups would be deployed in the real world/production. The guy did it on purpose.
bad,All the good people have left. They hire new workers so they don’t have to pay.. use temp workers for years without hiring them.  They treat the customer service reps poorly.
bad,They only promote friends and family. Everyone else is treated poorly and unfairly. The management team is young and inexperience. Many of them are unprofessional. You have to check your paycheck each time to verify that you are paid properly. If you don't catch the error they won't tell you about it. They are very horrible at communication. They will tell others about your business before they tell you.This is a dead end job. It is just good for learning how to work in a corporate setting.
bad,"The company all together is trash! They don’t care about there customers or employees. The managers are never available for support. No room for grow unless your a kiss up. Very high stress job with no pay to show for it."
bad,"Sales management needs to go, from the top down. Also, the older construction workers and technicians are harbored by the union and they utilize that to wreak havoc on a daily basis and go unscathed."
bad,"constant verbal abuse from customers and management, nowhere to turn for help or relief from being scrutinized and nit picked every single day performing this job, there is not enough money in the world to submit yourself to the emotional & mental distress, management have power trip issues and do not have your best interest in mind by any means, they are the worst people I've ever met in my entire life!!! I will never be the same after being there for 5 years and thank god I got out while I still could"
bad,rather than give a negative review I will be silent.  The workers are good people.  the rest not so much.  Do not trust HR.  Management does not have your back
bad,"No comments due to legal requirements. See the story about them on ""60 Minutes"" to get a real idea of the company ideals by how they treat their American employees."
bad,"decent pay if you don't mind extreme micro management, catty coworkers and taking constant abusive phone calls for 9 hours a day, every day"
bad,I have worked in my job for 10 years with very little to no advancement.  My group was 6+ people and now only myself.  There is always to much work and yet you still have some people and managers who do very little.  If you are one of the few chosen you can rise through the ranks regardless of what little knowledge you may have of the industry or department.  The company is continually outsourcing jobs and there is a strong negative employee morale issue.
bad,"Lots of talking behind your back and back stabbing. It didn't matter that I kept my personal life to myself my supervisor would find things to gossip about which even included things like what I ate. Most people in that place could afford to since nobody does any real work. Just one big ""water cooler"" environment."
bad,"While the pay is great there's a reason: you are a slave to this company they don't care if your child is sick they don't care if someone died in your family work comes before everything including breathing to this company, it was a call center positiin and they made u work like the best doctor in the world, on call 24/7 any storm YOU HAVE TO GO IN OR FIRED!!! Your working 60 hrs at least, again pay is amazing but you have to have no outside life to work here. They tell u your children are no reason to not work. Being a single dad my daughter was very sick with the flu and I had to be with her, they called me in and I said I can't (it was my 1st day off in 10 days) and manager said come in or don't bother coming back ever. They drug test AND ALCOHOL TEST! So even if you worked a 15 hr day (happens often) and have a glass of wine to relax, they test u next day, FIRED!"
bad,"Executives are blind to what is going on in the field. The company is understaffed and leads to the field staff being overworked. Company is rampant with abuse claims and management leads by fear. The Benefits are great, but it is not enough to undergo the daily beating you take working here. The management and executives only care about their bonuses and what it take to get those is to keep the field understaffed and overworked."
bad,"Eversource energy is not the same company as it was before the merger. In my experience, any concerns about the work culture are ignored by management. The employees are miserable, the expectation is unreachable, and any negative input is dismissed. As in most companies, the wrong people are given leadership roles who don't have a good relationship or rappor with their employees. I've seen my previous bosses LinkedIn account and she is full of bologna."
bad,"Do not work here expecting at guidance or training at all. You are publicly encouraged to ask questions, but it damages your reputation if you actually do. It's a completely bi-polar system."
bad,"They say they want employee feedback, but only if it fits their narrative. Ultimately, they only care about management, everyone else is expendable. "
bad,"Once Northeast Utilities merged with NStar (and before the company was renamed ""Eversource""), the NU IT department was a well-oiled machine, comprised of hundreds of dedicated employees. Many had decades of experience at NU, but the new senior management decided that all of that experience was too costly to maintain, and outsourced 80+ percent of the IT business to South Asian companies. Since then, the IT workplace has been described as ""dismal"" at best. This same pattern of outsourcing appears to be headed to other sections of the company, like Payroll and HR. This company is probably not a good career choice for anyone at this point."
bad,"Northeast Utilities used to be a customer-focused company. After Eversource, it is focused on increasing the stock price to the detriment of employees and customers."
bad,"I intended to stay with the company but it became very clear that there were little advancement options. If you were not in the right group, you have no hope of advancing your career there. Too bad really, the company is watching good, experienced talent leave in droves. I worked there for 14 years. Left for a new opportunity in a higher position. Thought I would retire from the company."
bad,"High turn over and management seems lost. Co-workers can be brutal backstabbers at times too. The company motto is "" Our company makes money in spite of itself"". "
bad,Very slow placement. Not offered a job after 2 years. Still in the same position with no raises. They don't check on you to see your progress and no direction
bad,"I don't feel this company cares about the people that work the hardest to make things work.  From the management level up to the CEO, it's all for them.  The middle and lower employees don't get rewarded or recognized for the hard work and dedication they have for the company."
bad,A typical day involves moving work priories around and adjusting schedule. Learned about the many code requirements and safety distances away from electricity. There are many different types of personnel and age groups which make workplace culture interesting.
bad,The people I worked with on a daily basis were very nice. The management was poor little to no communication. I worked there fro almost two years and my manager had no idea what my name was. We had the same first name and she still could not remember it. I felt it was a pretty sexiest environment.
bad,If you like utility companies this company is for you! They have become the typical company with the typical benefits.  Nothing fancy.  I wish I could explain more but I cannot at this time.
bad,"Still a very closed culture where only certain favorite employees (based on personality, not skills, education, or work ethic) get rewards, not the employee whose work excels.   Human Resources will be glad to show you the door if you voice your concerns about management."
bad,Employees are very friendly.  Management does not value its employees for their knowledge or experience unless they are located in the Boston area.  A different company since the merger.
bad,"The management ( if you would even call it that ) in this company was absolutely awful. Favoritism for some employees only."
bad,Company's recent cost cutting measures by outsourcing more than 250 employees shows the lack of care for its employees.
bad,"very poor customer service, almost every job classification has contractors performing daily job assignments of permanent employees.Very few jobs are being replaced when there is  an position. The future there looks bleak."
bad,"As a contractor there is little room for advancement after 2 years and I have been strung along to believe there would be a full time position available. It seems that they hire contractors as a way to pay people less and not give out benefits. "
bad,"Worked in the call center. Overtime is mandatory based on a roster or when there are storms. No flexibility with hours; if you are two minutes late, you kick out on a report. Like anywhere, some managers were better than others, but upper level management was tone deaf to the needs of the majority."
bad,"Typical workday was 8:30-5:00 and I was left to work on my assigned responsibilities.  Very little guidance was provided relative to the operation of the business and I was knocked in my evaluations for taking the time to meet with operating groups and units to fully understand the operations.  Although public utilities was a new industry for me, I was not provided with an opportunity to 'learn' the business before being thrust into a project that had initiated months before and I was expected to be up to speed as soon as I was brought on board"
bad,"too many silos; each department does its own thing; no common mission; there is lots of work and when there are storms you must work. Last winter, lots of people worked 100 hours one week  and 120 hours the next to respond to the outages."
bad,"I did IT work there; but not belongs to IT department. The IT department of eversource experienced heavy laid off; because of merge and consolidation with other companies, and can’t support our department well, so our department hired me to do the DBA and ETL work. But the IT department did not like this and did not cooperate. Very badly support made my work very uncomfortable."
bad,"A typical day at work may contain taking customer phone calls throughout the day, while simultaneously working our job queues. We handle many situations such as bankruptcies, ID Theft claims, settlements, deceased, as well as acting as a client in court. The hardest part of my job is knowing that they will be outsourcing the credit department soon. The most enjoyable part of my job is working collaboratively with my co-workers to reach the same goal. Management is a strong piece of the puzzle. I understand it can be a very rewarding job while at times, very frustrating. I believe a great team comes from a great leader."
bad,"Best part of working for this company is it has decent pay and benefits, Management is not good, a lot of required overtime in bad weather. No schedule flexibility for call center employees."
bad,Working as a customer service rep is stressful. People call in yell at you all day. Management is always confused and in meetings. Not enough man power a lot of times in field so it makes your job harder. Not very organized but has really good benefits and pay. Not easy to advance.
bad,"No life/ work balance, micromanagement is ridiculous- literally every second of your work day has to be accounted for and Lord forbid you have to use the bathroom outside of your break. The pay and benefits were awesome, but it wasn't worth it."
good,"Was a great place to work prior to the N-Star takeover.  The company took about a 10 year setback once N-Star took over.  Moral is low, and anyone with the skills to jump ship has."
good,"Ok place to do a contract assignment. Pay was fine and I did learn a lot while I was there."
good,"Only hire contractors with no chance of working full time. They do this so they do not have to offer benefits such as paid holidays, vacation or medical benefits."
good,Only offer contracted employment. No paid time off or benefits. minimal managment influence or training. Onboarding was rough. Not a lot of supervisions and frequent process changes
good,"Contract sale, no room to advance.  Little commission.  No holiday pay no healthcare plan and no 401k plan for contract sales people.  Also lack of training for new reps."
good,Some departments within this company prefer to hire external candidates rather than foster and progress their internal employees.
good,Management is inconsistent with policies and procedures. Favoritism is rampant and has a huge effect on employee morale.
good,"If you don't mind feeling degraded daily, then this job is for you. No prospects for movement. Outsourcing in all areas."
good,Employees are very resilient and adaptable. Non union workers have to pick up the slack from union workers. The company regularly moves business people into Information Technology roles.
good,Long days but can be rewarding.  Its an all in effort during storm restoration which is a good thing.  Very talented people working at Eversource Energy.
good,"The compensation package was great. But the hours were not flexible. Your schedule is not what you are hired for they change it after 3 months. Your told it your schedule and it's a 2 year commitment with said schedule. There is no room for growth all seniority based and need to wait for people to retire for schedule or position opportunities. "
good,This job started me off with a very good pay rate and my income has increased every year since being here. They also have great benefits. A lot of opportunities if you know people.
good,"There is no work life balance they run their workers into the ground and the New management that came in after their buyout was terrible. They basically made work conditions as bad as they could so much of their senior staff retired or moved on to other opportunities. They cut all overtime pay for salaried and then expected them to work hundreds of hours a year for a bonus dependent upon stock performance. These are folks not bringing down executive level pay but just front line supervisors. It was truly a massive betrayal of long hard working folks that often worked their way up from climbing a pole for a living."
good,Great pay and benefits through the company. Lots of calls. Can be difficult at times trying to manage certain information. Must be sharp to be able to answer certain things.
good,"Overall, I find it very rewarding to provide electricity and gas to our community.  I have worked with some innovated technologies and great people.  I am constantly solving problems that make a difference."
good,"A lot has changed over the years. Management sucks, mandatory overtime when there is an outage & u are expected to risk ur life in dangerous weather to get here. We now have a union and it is still under negotiation after a year. The company is making us suffer for signing in this union as well. Only apply if you are desperate for a job!"
good,"Conservation Load & Management "
good,"Very toxic work environment, too much negativity and training is horrendous. Very competitive pay and benefits package, but very demanding work and unachievable goals. Most enjoyable part is payday and heading home."
good,"Eversource has growing pains , with the amount of upgrades coming up and not enough employees to cover it. They do use outside contractors but again not enough to cover what they need done."
good,"Eversurce was a good place to work while I was there.  My position was eliminated so now looking for other employment.  Fast Paced environment, with good benefit."
good,Eversource is a solid company. The company takes a long time to make decisions and enact change. This is both good and bad. The company is a construction company first and foremost. All other areas of the company are there to support the construction group.
good,"The call center expects numbers/robots to work at a desk, not humans. That's the environment of a call center. Your quality in the call center wasn't as important than the quantity to their standards. Because of this you will be held back from further advancement in the company.  I believe the customers are the reason we have a business. If they aren't heard, they don't feel valued. I believe in quality vs quantity, though a balance is needed. They don't care about their customers here, and they don't have to because if someone wants power or gas, they don't have a choice to use someone else. The company takes advantage of that and treats their customers accordingly.  The work environment is 100% negative. The employees are miserable, the management is miserable, and the customers are too.  They offered programs or events to ""help"" people have a better work life balance, but they were during times we were all on the phones and we weren't allowed off the phones to participate. If you went to the bathroom off your scheduled time, they would send supervisors to come find you (yes male supervisors to the women's room too) and find out what's going on because you were out of compliance. The benefits were great for medical - because you have to use them to keep yourself mentally right to handle the job - therapy and medication is very prominent in the workplace."
good,"Good company,environmentally continuous.  Most employees tend to stick around.   Can be somewhat bureaucratic; but its more the nature of the business."
good,"""Because it has always been done this way"" mentality"
good,Relaxed work environment in pleasant suburban location. Company focused on long-term planning & development of service area. Was very high tech in many areas.
good,"My typical day consisted of managing daily work plans and scheduling personnel to complete construction, maintenance, and operation related projects."
good,"Poor coaching - training was good, but the coach I had was difficult to work with."
good,"Very nice company to work for the managment teammate are very dependable.	"
good,"Hard and challenging environment. Everyone puts their hear and soul into their jobs.  Quite the stressful environment at times, with no true ""perks"" while on the job."
good,"Can't comply "
good,"Management was supportive."
good,"This was a great company and people,  but the lack of process and leadership made projects run over time and budget.  Things were a little chaotic and there was not much communication."
good,Typical work day is extremely busy and long.  Management support is ok and culture is mediocre.  I've learned that there are many facets to the electrical utility industry.
good,Co workers were great to work with.  I believe the company changed when the merger happened.  Enjoyed what I was doing while I was working there.  hours were great
good,"I have been in this company for 12+ years as it has transitioned from Northeast Utilities to Eversource Energy.  There is continuing labor strife and the fatigue on the workforce is apparent in nearly every day experiences.  As I work in management, I work to show empathy for workers but I can see both sides of the coin; management and labor.  I go out of my way to promote a positive culture, reassure people when I can that things will eventually improve.  After 3-4 years, there is yet, no ""light at the end of the tunnel.""  With things in a high state of flux, I am wondering if I might find a more promising challenge in another company."
good,"After a rocky merger with N-Star, there is still instability and change occurring.  For the most part, eversource is a good company to work for and wants to be a innovator to the industry."
good,"Eversource Energy is the power house of New England. As a well established company, there isn't much room for innovation or new ideas. It is mostly the logistical work of how to keep the lights on. Can be rewarding, the people are great, and the benefits are too."
good,"NSTAR has been a very good company to work for, it has undergone significant change in last two years as the company is now part of Northeast Utilities, a large utility holding company that also owns PSNH, CL&P, Western Mass Electric and Yankee Gas."
good,Strong company and the call center is a good starting point.
good,"A typical day for me at work is coming into the call center, turning on my computer, checking emails, responding back to any email Ive received. I then sign on into my call system and sign in with my agent id number, putting on my headset and begin to take credit calls. So far, Ive learned how to be more understanding when working with different groups of people, ive learned how to deal with different personalities. Ive learned new material in the credit world and how to set payment arrangements, and also Yankee Gas move ins and move outs. My co-workers are excellent people, friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is to remember all the rules in realtion to the credit and collections part. The most enjoyable part of the time is I get to talk to different people everyday and interect with different people, really makes a difference in my day."
good,"Northeast Utilities was a magnificent company.  Eversource... not so much.  The change in leadership has many employees extremely frustrated.  Still, as far as large companies go, I guess its par for the course."
good,Okay place to work...little room for advancement. Management is okay but needs to be way more organized than it is at this moment. Lots of overtime opportunities though so if you are looking to make extra money this is a plus!
good,It's a great company to work for for benefits and compensation. It can be very stressful at times. When there are storms you have to work! It will turn into a 24 HR shifts
good,"My opinion:"
good,"Bad news. NStar took over Northeast Utilities, renamed it Eversource Energy, and RUINED anything good about it. From the CEO on down, the leadership team has no INTEGRITY. The rule of the day is, ""It's MY way, or the HIGHWAY!"" The customers are regarded as a nuisance, as are its employees. Management has NO CONCEPT of how to inspire excellence or to encourage workers to go the extra mile. Salaried employees are not compensated at all for any work performed over 40 hours per week. Hourly workers have lost the will to speak positively about this company. The company watches your EVERY move. The CEO has paid for compliance from the Governor of Connecticut to consistently look the other way when the company's actions are questioned. Just got a job with Eversource? Keep your resume current. You'll need it."
good,"Nice atmosphere to work in, but recent changes reflect concentration on dollar bottom line at expense of longer-term goals and needs of both the company and its workforce."
good,"Eversource has a plethora of work.  Within the PMO, there is an abundance of reporting.  At Eversource, the work environment is pleasant.  Good place to work, but stressful."
good,"It's generally a good working environment, with great opportunities to learn many facets of the business.  Learn who the players are and network to avail yourself with all that you can."
good,"It was a fun place to work!  Great and talented people to work with.  Unfortunately, the merger brought in IT outsourcing and that resulted in many talented IT people to leave the company voluntarily or to be forced out."
good,Northeast Utilities is a good place to work. Good benefits and pay. In stormy weather there was a lot of overtime.
good,"Was a great place to work until recent changes added uncertainty to the future's outlook regarding job security.  "
good,"Lots of different tasks , busy day, learn a lot of different aspects of the business and deal with outside contractors as well. lots of great people and groups to belong to and part of the community"
good,Enjoyed talking to new people on the phones in everyday interactions. Management was supportive and always there when questions came up. Co-workers normally stayed to themselves but lunch breaks were very fun and was great to become social.
good,Developed and trained a new location without much management. Operated for a set period of time until this contract was completed. No follow-up by company to show or acknowledge the job that was performed.
good,"For more than 24 years I was a writer, editor and public relations spokesman. One of the finest parts of being with NU was interacting with all levels, from maintenance people to the CEO. Interviews, news releases, program development and other techniques were always a part of my daily existence there."
good,"When I started at NU almost 20 years ago, it was a close knit, dedicated, results-oriented team.  Unfortunately, after two major mergers cost-cutting and outsourcing have become the name of the game.  I was very lucky and am eternally grateful to the managers who saw my potential early on and helped me develop a career in IT.  Sadly, NU is no longer a place where you can expect to build a career; rather you can increasingly expect the new management to be treat you as a temporary, disposable vendor."
good,"My typical day at work is from 10:30 to 7pm, The work environment is comfortable to learn  and ask questions."
good,Very good company to work for. Many stay for decades due to the passion for their work. Each job has its own job description. Opportunities to explore beyond your job into other positions.
good,"It is a good place to work and helped me in  enhancing my skills. Good working culture and had healthy competition among employees "
good,The work here has been very rewarding and has provided a wealth of experience and education to my professional development.  Having the ability to work with cross functional departments has provided the project management skills needed to be successful
good,"Great company to work for and the people who work here most have been here forever.  Difficult to get a permanent job here though and once here it's difficult to get promoted as people tend to stay put so chances are you will stay in the same position for at least 10 years and maybe longer.  But that's not always a bad thing, as I said it's a great company and the people stay because of that."
good,Fine company to be employed by.  As a purchasing agent learned people and negotiating skills.  Enjoyed going to work each day.  Worked for several managers in the purchasing and stores dept.
good,Got connected with a lot of professionals with good technical and management skills. Really learned a lot from managers and colleagues. Got a broader view on how the industry works and how to develop a better product or program. Also expand my network across the industry.
good,"Standard 9-5pm environment.  Great work-life balance."
good,There are good people there.
good,Everyday entails of same routine. I am happy with my job here but I want more room for growth. I have been working the same position for almost 2 years and feel that it is time to seek another opportunity.
good,"I have the opportunity to go to job sites, review the projects with engineers and construction contractors. The co-workers are exceptional and I have a very good working relationship with all of them - no matter their discipline. Everyday provides a learning opportunity. I support my teams and in return I have their respect."
good,"This was a good stepping stone in my career advancement."
good,Great working environment - coworkers are pleasant. Fast paced working environment for day to day activities. Flexible working hours as a contractor (paid hourly). Always possible to advance within the company -- as long as you look for the opportunity.
good,"Good Company to work for along with Union negotiating contracts on our behalf. Need minimum staffing, older /experienced workforce will be retiring in next 5 years, need to get as much experience working with these workers. Company doesn't see the  urgency.  I don't want to see contractors doing my job because there not training us with experienced workers."
good,"The compensation and benefits offered make it difficult to leave the company. However the company has been undergoing structural changes for the past few years, leaving employees feel like there is no job security. Management is not the best at communicating expectations to employees or at expressing the vision of the company."
good,The challenges are handling the requests of the public and staying within the guidelines of the company.  We are a regulated company and in some cases considered a monopoly.  Our typical day is assisting customers with move in/out as well as going over the billing for customers.
good," Streamlined documentation process by creating tools and templates which reduced input time by 90%, also designed a tracking system by using pivot tables in Excel to track performances of the consultants "
good,Excellent company to work for.  Good benefits and salary.  Enjoy being on the management team.  Refreshing management style since the merger in 2012.
good,My day typical begins at 7:00am and can extend as long as 7:00pm. There is never a dull moment as I supervisor over 20 people who range from back office teams to phone teams to dispatchers. The best part of the job is the ever changing dynamics; you never know what the day will bring. I have teams in 2 different states so travel weekly. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you actually help a customer who is struggling to pay their bills and you can hear the relief and gratitude in their voice. This is a sign of a good day !
good,A great place to work but Upper management needs better core values and some foreman need to have better focus (construction)
good,Great place to learn the ropes of utility business. I progressed well and was given lots of opportunity.
good,"Good place to work, and to be given opportunities for growth professionally.   The company itself treats their employees very well pertaining to compensation, vacation, and benefits."
good,Eversource Energy has many avenues to help advance ones career.  An employee should always to reach for these exciting chances an embrace each opportunity as they arise.
good,The people in the field will do anything for the customer. The office will do anything just for the profit. We are a public utility. Sometimes they forget we are here for public safety.
good,Great company with a lot of great experience to learn from. I learned a tremendous amount about various projects and Change Management initiatives that will help me grow in my career.
good,Has become a larger company with a changing culture due to the merger with Boston (NStar). Benefits have changed to match what NStar had in all cases they were decreed.
good,"Fast passed, busy, customer focused company that puts the customer first.  Challenging. Teaching customer on what electricity is and how it works. the hardest part of the job is helping customers. The most enjoyable is helping customers."
good,"I worked here when it was called Northeast Utilities for about three years in the Tax Department. Management really isn't good and there are a lot of odd ducks in this company. But the work/life balance is usually good, despite having to work a few weekends throughout the year. The retirement benefits are outstanding and the bonuses are decent. Overall, I regret leaving the company five years ago."
good,"4 stars - Lost some luster when Massachusetts people started taking over."
good,Great benefits flexible work schedule.  Highly innovative and always seeking to be the leader in the industry as well as focused on +1 customer experience.
good,"Working at Eversource was as enjoyable as it was challenging.  Management encouraged, supported and celebrated personal and professional accomplishments.  Team and individual productivity achieved above and beyond dept expectations were always acknowledged and appreciated by supervision."
good,"The department I worked in was great and had many knowledgeable, dedicated, professional people.  They really focused on providing good customer service."
good,I was a contact employee who stayed for almost eight years. I was added to the organization chartsand was given jobs of increasing complexities and value. I enjoyed working there very much and would go back.
good,"Tough to get a position here. I have a long commute but the management is easy to work with. Some days I can work closer to my home. "
good,Pretty easy job once you know what you are doing. Older crew is old school and sometimes set in their ways but very knowledgeable. The job has changed to automated with more collections. Still a great place to work.
good,"fat paced, fun, fulfilled days."
good,"It was a great job until they outsourced the IT department to InfoSys for cost cutting measures.  "
good,"A typical day would begin with a brief meeting regarding company"
good,Worked hard all day long on grants program providing grants to nonprofit organizations and promoting volunteerism.
good,Great staff and the compensation was excellent. This is an excellent company to work for.
good,The benefits provided by this company are phenomenal.  I enjoy being able to work here and the opportunity it is providing for me.  Some of the job culture is stuck in the 80s but it is trending better
good,In EVERSOURCE you'll find a culture that is really focused in Safety. Being a utility it has a much more relaxed pace than conventional businesses but never the less they are very focused in doing a quality job.
good,"Great company culture, upper management go out of their way to greet people and speak at different seminars and meeting. "
good,Job was very fast paced and diverse.  Training was available.  Lots of promotion from within.  Good benefits.  At the time it was very employee centered.
good,"Overall a great place to work. Compensation and benefits are better than average,On the down side, have to work during major storms for excessive hours."
good,"We work hard at Eversource.  I have found the culture to be friendly and supportive. There is mandatory overtime, but when a storm comes, all hands are on deck, including managers.  We have a team attitude to simply get the job done for the customers, whatever time it takes."
good,"I truly loved my job.  I learned a lot, worked very independently.  Part of the team and my work was highly respected and trusted.  "
good,good palce to work i rally like the control room atmosphere and the benefits.  They are very generous with bonuses and other ways to compensate their employees.
good,Northeast Utilities merged with NSTAR and became Eversource. Eversource is a good place to work and gain the experience that you will need at your next job.
good,"ETL Informatica/SSIS developer with around 7 Years’ experience in IT requirement gathering, Data Modeling, design, development, testing and support with extensive work in Business Intelligence / Data warehousing technologies."
good,"Lots of training in different fields, great benefits, room to advance, "
