rating,review
bad,"Tho product and environment is interesting."
bad,"No communication with employees what so ever! "
bad,"Absolutely terrible corporate management.  Completely lost the ability to manage, but are completely capable of covering their incompetence.  They are masters of promoting those that are even more incompetency than themselves to ensure the protection of their linage."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend to work here as a quality inspector cause exterran does not care for quality. Management is not good, upper management is all lies."
bad,"There are a lot of awesome people that work for this company, But there are just as many bad decision makers.  This company was very top heavy and made poor decisions in regards to technicians."
bad,Funcionarios trabalham insatisfeitos e sob pressao de gestores
bad,"Empresa mal administrada, falta de opurtunidas e crescimento profissional."
bad,Don't work in The oilfield it robs you of your family life and they spit you out when the lay offs begin. I almost died working 100 plus hours a week and they didn't even care about their employees.  Management sucked too.
bad,Plenty of room for advancement but pay scale never matches. Will have new hires working underneath leads while getting paid more. Managers leading crews without any field knowledge.
bad,This place sucks no life You donate your time Run No family time You must provide ALL your own tools Run No training customers will hate you cheapest oil purchased for expensive equipment
bad,"Worked over a year as an engineer.  The company has potential but management are interested in continues push toward productivity without improving working conditions for employees.  Some middle level management treat employees as objects and managed to turned the office to a sweatshop.  Lack of understanding on how to motivate employees made most qualified people leave the company.  There is no future, no opportunities, and below market compensations.  Knowing what I know now, I would never have accepted an offer to work for the company.  I don't recommend it to any friends or to anyone."
bad,"I worked there for over 5 months.  Hired on with no compressor experience.  I had little to no training, while working there. I worked on a crew with guys that were old and only a few years away from retiring themselves.  They didn't want to train anyone new,  they would say they didn't get paid to train.  Pay is ok, dead end job .  No advancement unless you have college degree.  Management don't do anything for the employees.  They act like and say they are going to help but never do.  Most shop equipment is antique and need to be junked.  The shop supervisor is a joke!  Always breaking rules to better himself at the time.  He pulled me off a unit where I was working with another new hand to work alone.  Said that 2 new hands cant work together, must have someone experienced with them.  Ok makes since.  But to pull me off and work alone, using a overhead crane, (which I was never trained on how to use thru Exterran) to do my job.  Yes I can operate the crane but they don't know that.  "
bad,"no future, six years in and has been like being in swirling toilet bowl..no one seems to care loosing experienced employees, answer to that is to just get more temps. safety program holds employees back from completing tasks on time while management wants it done faster and cheaper."
bad,They said they were going to hire me full time and hired me a temp and let me go after 2 days! I have 2 years experience in forklift and let me go off two days? Not good people to work with. They don't give you any chanes at all.
bad,enjoy the work but hard to deal with management. Nothing is good enough for them . every employee is very disengaged at this time. very low pay and long time to get raises in general
bad,"Not a place to work, if you want to move up in the company. Too many changes in management. Higher ups are lazy. Didn't receive a raise in 3 years. Revolving door for those not in management positions."
bad,"There are some relatively inexperienced managers in the organization who don't know what they are doing. They are less concerned about the affairs in the group and the quality of work."
bad,i worked on nights as a pipe welder was all good at first but after a while 2 years there was no opportunity to go to days the mgmt team there is clueless (all from goodyear tires) and the leadmen they put in place are just about the sorriest excuse for leads i have ever seen do yourself a favor stay away from the spoolshop there especially on nights go find a real weld job and take my work you will be happy you did
bad,the company is out for themselves. Does not do anything for employees. Turn over is very high because people do not like working there. Very tense environment.
bad,This company really needs to address on the job issues and stop covering for others they are either related to or best friends with. My experience was horrible cause you are not judged by work ethic. Sad.
bad,"Management was a joke. No leadership- all about politics. Results didn't matter- only company politics did."
bad,"Its very difficult to work here ,due to working envirnment especially on the understanding of my HSE design area."
bad,"The day starts off with meetings, and you find out the days events. The day never goes as planed mangers and lead mechanics always change their minds on what project you are to do. Management acts as though you work for nasa and every thing is top secret. Co-works are ok."
bad,"Exterran is an ok place to work with some good people working there. Mostly, it's a dramatic place to work, and jobs are highly unsecure. Employees are constantly worried about losing their jobs and job cuts. There are lots of night calls and old, junky equipment company wide, so lots of hours away from home. NO JOB/ HOME LIFE BALANCE! Your job is your life! It does pay well, but if you want to have any kind of freedom, whatsoever, it isnt the job for you. We are on call 24/7 every other week, and weeks off call we usually travel. FYI."
bad,"New management made irrational decisions behind closed doors. Increased company overhead with nonew projects in hand. Covering their own backs, they spread negativity among employees that also made the best people leave. Greedy corrupt senior managers who have their own hidden agendas, hired their own incompetent & unemployed buddies to run the show. Severe HR bias based on nationality. No transparency."
bad,"Days can be pretty standard and can go straight to chaos in minutes"
bad,"Management was very poor-"
bad,"Absolutely no job security whatsoever. You can be fired, or ""Riffed"" on a whim or personal grievance. It happened to my brother and me after years of loyal service. The upper management is extremely poor at training or supporting their employees. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF TRUSTING THIS COMPANY! The HR department is not only no help, but very much a part of the problem. Stay clear."
bad,"I will never return to work for them ever!  No positives whatsoever, other than the money, which in hindsight was not worth it.  worst employer I've ever had!"
bad,I was forced to night shift while i was still enrolled in night school that exterran was paying for. Exterran later hired a temp back as a permanent on day shift without even posting the position for internal applications. I was told by a supervisor of this information and they agreed that they were at fault and still did not allow me to go to day shift.
bad,When painting at Extterran at night the painter use flash lights to paint  so they can see and they may paint a part 4 time with just finish coat no primer . When painting compresser painter are confused not hard work just need to work smart. They need to move to another state like maybe Mobile Alabama .
bad,"Horrible company to work for. Sure all the people who like working there are in the offices with degrees. But they treat all the assemblers, paint, welders and maintenance like absolute dirt. Worst company I have ever worked for. NHR just uses temp agencies to hire contractors so exterran dosent have to pay unemployment. Most of the time thy never hire any assemblers onto the company. They will drag you along for a year and then drop you. But the communication and the Management were the worst. And I mean the upper management. They do not know what they are doing because they are college educated with no practical knowledge. If you do go and work for them CYA."
bad,they hire through website and after you go through the interview process they tell you that you have to go through temp service. assembly department is racially driven. Trained for a month and still didn't learn anything. their rules have rules and change constantly. this was a very difficult place to work. management was clueless!!!
bad,"okay company to work for, but not a long term company to be with. they do not care at all about the employees and the manager is crooked"
bad,"- Lots of travel time, long hours"
bad,"If you live around the area and know at least one person there you will probably be fine. If not you better make friends fast and fly below radar or your job will be filled with numerous people trying there best to make it miserable while working insane amount of hours in a very loud, dirty, hot environment.  This place did an great job of keeping me with a paycheck till I could find another place."
bad,"Company new model is working ""lean"". Which makes is impossible to participate with continuous training and improvements."
bad,Well if you like to do nothing then this is your job. Very laid back but the pay reflects that also. You will be the only tech at night and you will work everyday. If your not Hispanic this might not be the job for you. Certain management act like this is the only job in the world. Unlike most employees they have there I can move around.  But easy job now that things are fix but for how long.
bad,Not your typical professional work culture.  The executive management team has changed so there were improvements.  It will take time and process changes for the company to reach a normal operating environment.
bad,Management would not make a decision at all and would hold people responsible to deliver on what ever it was they would not make the decision on.  In developing project scope this is a major problem.
bad,Work was good but each day you had to worry about weather or not you was going to have a job or not .I learned a lot about gas compressions and pipeline .My co-workers were good to work with good friends .Watching your back was the hardest .Quitting time or days off was the most enjoyable.
bad,Exterran was a good place of employment. I enjoyed working for them until the split. When the Company split and we become Archrock it seemed as though the plan was to centralize all of the Engineering and Drafting to the Houston location which in turn left me without a job.
bad,"A lot of cliques, not a cohesive management, everyone was in it for themselves, not the better of the business.  I learned to listen to my gut instincts and should never have taken the position offered to me.  They often would tell you one thing and then deny that they said that to you.  Found myself fighting for my life.  Was a relief when I was laid off due to a downturn in the cost of oil."
bad,"The spin off of Exterran fro Archrock, in the midst of the oil downturn has created a vacuum of leadership and the company is suffering from it, as shown from the 4 plant closings in the past year."
bad,After reading some of the reviews and a lot of the same problems through out the company . But they should know the problems of having area managers that never been around a fabrication . They are just looking for a yes person on muppet strings .  There has been ten very qualified tradesman left after six months of opening a new plant in Youngstown . They lied our wages after we committed going to forty hours of classes on our own time .  Most quit a job to come there . The insurance is expensive . Which they lied about threw interview process. They have no integrity for a big company . They are hiring welders with six months experience  paying same as us with twenty years of code welding . There is only twenty workers in vessel shop and there is three bosses . Two came from Texas and they are not the sharpest of needles . All they do is push you and they wonder why the quality isnt there . It was my worst mistake taking that job. When the human resource lady from Texas had a meeting with us and she said the turn over ratio 42% . If they asked all the employees at exterran Youngstown if they are happy I bet 80% would say no . Truth goes along way to employees and their attitudes . The state of Ohio government grants for training employees at exterran which never happened . Our so called master welder trained us . That's the same guy who has the highest failure rate on X-ray welds . They are sending him to school for welding . It's who you know and who you suck up to will take you far .
bad,"Lies, Lies, and more lies. Was told raises were merit based. Worked your azz off to make more. When raises came out it was 3% across the board  Slackers made just as much as the hardest worker.."
bad,Horrible management and lack of accountability throughout the company. Take everything with a grain of salt and do your best to learn a new trade or set of skill. Everything else is a waste of time.
bad,"A typical day at work in fine. "
bad,New environments developing in both companies. New first time managers lacking experience. Very tense and unstable.
bad,"Good to work at Exterran"
bad,Very slow to make decisions; very political environment.  Good group of employees and coworkers. People lack independence to do their jobs.  The politics was the worst part.
bad,"To the one reviewer, not all of the engineers were happy I'm sorry to say.  The place is a sweat shop.... Benefits have been lost, taken away in recent years...The IP group has been a complete failure since it's inception.... All process plant engineering is done in BA, OKLA.   The Houston IP group is clueless about project execution....  The project management should be in same place as the engineering group and fab shop.... just my opinion."
bad,New Computer System - No one knows how to use it. Terrible training.
bad,"If u can help it stay away from exterran. I've worked there for two years and it seems like the next Enron. They paint a pretty picture to everyone about how good we are doing but really we just laid off 17 people outta nowhere, we don't pay our vendors so major lack of tools getting returned, there's to many cheifs and not enough Indians, whatever ur starting pay is well be ur final pay NO RAISES!!!!!"
bad,They're good about throwing holiday parties . Lot of company get together s didn't get too much sleep while working for them.I got inspired by the old guys teaching me new techniques on how to operate sensitive equipment .
bad,Exterran was a great company to work for until the spinoff of Archrock.  New management was lacking in transparency and the culture went from being happy to severely depressed.   Corporate politics have minimized the ability to progress within the company.
bad,"Company was good in the beginning. Good work environment and pay. Most of my fellow employees were great to work with. However, things changed when it became very upper management heavy. They would have a tendency to micromanage. If a salesman would call and not get the answer or attention they thought they deserved, they would complain to the uppers. Then the worker would get 5 different calls telling them how to do their job, that the salesman/customer is important and to move heavy and earth to get them what they needed. In the end, it was a very political place. The upper management would cower to the salesmen."
bad,I enjoyed my job with this company but after the many years of faithful employment and good work habits advancement with the company is a management position was never going to happen I have never received bad reviews on my work and also took supervisory and management courses this was never taken in consideration when jobs became available. Poor management.
bad,Company stated in would convert from type of scheduling to another which I was hired to do. Also the person before ran into the same problem. Managers would not change at all.
bad,Exterran has a great portfolio of Products and services.  The management seems to struggle in some areas.  The HR department has poor leadership and high turnover.
bad,Typically I worked on the dock and in the office for incoming freight. I learned how to maintain the electronic receiving program as well as how to do inventory and create a more effective process. Management needed more training on communication. Co-workers were generally fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was working in the weather. The most enjoyable was working with my co-workers and customers to create a team atmosphere.
bad,"Exterran is a company where your family will come second . The production schedule will rule your personal life . Work schedule constantly changing , sometime 3 times in one day will make you lose sleep. The management team will role out the schedule not caring if they are setting the shop to fail (with materials that were not even bought for the job to be completed)."
bad,"For someone that lived in Richmond, TX, at the time, it was an exceptionally long drive. Overall, it wasn't a bad company but the drive and the wear and tear mentally such a drive did kind of ruined my overall opinions of the company."
bad,The hardest part of the job is people need to learn how to communicate.
bad,Manager cared about direct reports. Upper management level did not care about employees only bottom line and performance. Very egotistical and was happy when employees could be driven by fear.
bad,Pay is good and the equipment you work on is in good condition. Just never home to see family or rest. End up wasting a ton of time because its impossible to get the right parts. Cant organize days or keep up with required work... you have scheduled pms and the parts are scheduled to be picked two weeks to a month after the fact.. Not very organized
bad,Exterran has lost numerous good people since their creation via merger in 2007. The trend has slowed but is still going on. Recruitment seems excessively focused on MBA types short on industry experience. Pay scales discourage top talent from working at Exterran.
bad,"it's a great company to work for if you are planning of spending 10 to 15 years performing the same task. Before you get a promotion or need to be a full time employee. Not contract, to even be consider for any managing or lead position."
bad,coworkers were great. assignment ended. built pressure valves
bad,"If you like long hours, not spending enough time with your family & being stressed to the point of having health issues, this is the job for you!! Enjoy."
bad,"The experience of the executives and senior managers is lacking. They know little about the product line, and even less about the people. A lot of Auto motive cast offs."
bad,Agradável de trabalhar. Dá oportunidades para aprendizado.
good,"Very stressful, a lot of favoritism, bosses never at work.  Just a hard place to enjoy working at..........................................................."
good,"A empresa não possui treinamento adequado para seus líderes, tornando-os fracos na gestão de equipe."
good,"We worked a 12 hour work day went in at 6 am till 6 pm took readings checked station cleaned station kept all fluids checked ,made certain station was safe for all who entered ,learned a lot about piping and gas compressions ,management wasn't very good ,my co-workers were a good bunch of guys to work with ,there wasn't realy a hard part to this job ,I just like to work ."
good,long days little help for new hires parts can be hard to come by but they do bomb kits for pm on over unit thats kinda cool parts our way at of thre way at the main office
good,There is no room for advancement. Very cliquish environment.
good,Successful local company was taken over by out-of-state corporation. Corporate headquarters dictates hiring and firing over-riding local managements desire.
good,"No job to life balance, it all about the money, if you can not keep up you are gone.  Work 14 to 16 hour daily including week ends,vacations are  frowned up on."
good,Temos oportunidade de aprender. Uma boa convivência com os companheiros de trabalho.
good,"From the many rounds of layoffs to incompetent people being promoted, 2019 at Exterran was about the worst year in my professional career.  I would not recommend working here until new management is brought in from somewhere other than GE."
good,"A empresa é boa e ambiente bom de trabalho. Supervisão e gerenciamento da empresa, deixam à desejar."
good,"Normal problem solving, typical management not always honest, work environment business casual, work instructions lacking, work is repetitive and not very challenging,"
good,"Empresa que impõe alto nível de exigência em seus padrões e políticas, porém seu departamento de recursos humanos não visa o desenvolvimento do quadro técnico. Devido crise no mercado de Petróleo, a organização sofreu uma reestruturação e reduziu seus custos gerais e com pessoal na ordem de aproximadamente 40% após sofrer divisão, deixando de investir em treinamento e focando somente no lucro e ignorando a manutenção de seus profissionais."
good,"very bad costumer service, does not care about its employees, i would not refer any one to work for this company, works its employees to they can still awake and then wants them to work some more"
good,Dailey problem solving in a high paced enviorment. Keeping records for ASME inspections of pressure vessels and piping.
good,This company never respected the people who were on the ground floor taking care of the actual work. Also the females were paid tremendously less than men. There was never a time where we were not worried of company implosion. There was no job security they kept the fear in you of when and where the next lay off would come from. We were not given the proper equipment to complete jobs.
good,"- Um dia típico de trabalho é partindo e parando os moto-compressores, ajustando vazão, realizando leituras dos equipamentos, verificando níveis de óleo, líquido refrigerante, fazendo relatórios de operação."
good,.As mentioned I was brought in as a contractor on a temporary basis and not offered a full time position which makes it difficult to assess them failry
good,Falta oportunidade de crescimento e melhor qualidade de vida para os funcionários.
good,"exterran, now archrock seems to be a bit of a revolving door company. theres a constant influx of people coming and going. management was lacking when I was there, and there was no concern for work life balance."
good,"Morning meeting were alright, we got an idea of how the week will go as far as hours and responsibilities as well as, we got a quick per work stretch. I learned quickly by watching my fellow coworkers then by trying it out on my own. Everyone gets along well as far as your coworkers, management seems to have some type of problem though. Most supervisors tend to give a higher advantage to those who take them out for lunch and suck them up. I put a lot of time and effort for this company and they don't appreciate any of it."
good,Empresa muito boa de trabalha porém não dá oportunidade de crescimento profissional.
good,"Worked 16+ hours average daily, to many bean counters that did not know the business.  No training plans learned as you amde mistakes"
good,Uma empresa de grande porte onde adquirir vários conhecimentos para crescimento profissional. Ponto negativo: Colaboradores individualistas.
good,Night shift people understand their hands....not so much day shift they two face ...they smile in your face then turn right back around and stab you with a smile.
good,This job was short and slow paced due lack of work with poor management. Jobs were limited and safety was last concerned on the job. I was sent to another location with the same company and layed off within a week.
good,"Was a good paycheck. They don't communicate with their workers, in the sense that if you are doing something the wrong way. They will simply let you mess it up. To the point where you get written up and fired."
good,"Lack of communication with management. Work is fast paced and if you strive for perfection and a great bonus, you have to work hard and put in long hours."
good,"Typical day at work was fire fighting most of the day.  Goals were not clearly set by management."
good,"good job, friendly co-workers, but the rate of pay based on the number of parts call-outs did not equal out. Learned a lot about parts and compressors but Supervisor didn't want you to learn too much."
good,"Work schedule was to be expected for oil field job"
good,Need to prioritize projects paying attention to international where LD's can be applied. On time delivery must be considered and planned from the start day and not one-two weeks before shipping. Employee retention is another item that needs attention.
good,They were a good player in middle east gas compression business but with current slump everyone is right scaling business. same is exterran. They are a good company only the middle east market is unpredictable.
good,"No doubt , a learning enviornment there in Exterran Belleli."
good,"Job was stressful, to many changes, nothing stayed the same and never stayed consistent"
good,"low paid, disrespecting, horrible management, long days and worked alot of weekends, favoritism, long travels, the company was too big for its own good"
good,The management does not care about the people but it does about the image it can create. The management seem to do what they want when they want and suffer no consequences. They say one thing and then do another and hold the employees accountable for their actions. The management is a tight clique and they outcast the employees.
good,"at first the company acted like they cared about their employees ,but come to find out we are all just cogs in a wheel and they feel we are all the same"
good,I've had better experiences and other manufacturing and service companies as to leadership and work ethics. Would consider it an average or ok company to work for.
good,"Exterran/ Archrock: Good overall place to work; however, the upper management were idiots. Some department leads and VP were completely clueless and incompetent. High voluntary and involuntary turnover.... many great quality, talented people came and went.  "
good,it was a ok place to work the job had a lot of safety which was good . I learned new paint procedures on epoxy paint and enamel we also ued poly urethane
good,"The day starts with reviewing all the requests for Inspections which leads to carrying out all the due inspections and making subsequent reports."
good,"This position was contract only so most of the ratings do not apply.  The position was for 6 months and I rarely had anything to do.  I only covered for another employee who was out for surgery.  I completed quotes, commercial invoice and billing."
good,good place to start pay is ok lower than other companies management sucks cutting hours no bonuses no employee appreciation or raises
good,"Your job title will not reflect your responsibilities, not a good company if you are looking for long term employment or stability"
good,skilled work force low pay good benefits /poor managment/i work with a good team /our lead was a-1 corperate was the problem
good,Company has good benefits and pay but too much of the GOOD-OLE-BOY culture in place.
good,"A typical day at work - productive"
good,Lack of job advancement and training with no feedback or opinions on job performance.
good,"Un día típico de trabajo puede llevar a cualquier lugar ya que las necesidades son increíblemente variables."
good,The company has been going through changes and is a decent company besides being quite unstable. Major management changes including but not limited to CEO/CFO abrupt departures.
good,Good people to work with but there is no growth. There is a lot of learning opportunity and very productive environment.  The only down hill is that there is no room for growth.
good,"Management is not supportive of its employees."
good,"Poor management,no processes, PMs responsible for every little aspect of job.No credit for successful jobs.Staff level and shop personnel good to work with."
good,"structured environment"
good,"Overall an ""okay"" place to work. Like all companies, good and not so good areas to work. Some good bosses and some bad bosses."
good,Exterran provides many classes for an individual to learn and progress. Opportunities are given to prove ones self and to progress professionally.
good,"Here at Exterran we stay pretty busy, my co worker and management are pretty easy to get along with , the hardest part of my job is keeping paper work inline"
good,Overall Billion Dollar Business that is very successful however has way to many top heavy management personnel that create havic that prevent programs and process to work as they truly should for specific cultures.
good,"It's an okay place to work, gain experience, and then move on."
good,"The summary explains everything one needs to know.  Great people to work with but the company is experiencing serious financial problems. Hence, there is no job security"
good,good work environment with focus on safety. The parking situation was a major headache. Break rooms and restrooms were outdated. Overall I had a good work experience.
good,Empresa de manutencão industrial no polo petroquimico de camacari
good,Company is good but  unfortunately management is ok. Doing fast track projects with poor quality of engineering. Rest everything is fine. Can not expect more.
good,"I am not even sure this company still exist. The management was poor and the people that worked their was poor. Its a good job, but not a good company."
good,"great company just had a bad service manager good benefits and great money and overtime, oil field work so constantly busy but the pay was worth it..."
good,This was a nice company to work for and very supportive for career advancement. It is better to start here when the economy is better. There are a lot of caring people in management.
good,"During the merger if was very productive and a lot of fun.  My supervisor made sure that our long hours were compensated and that we wanted to come to work no matter how long we were there.  After the merger and a promotion, the company that was merged took over and replaced a lot of people from the original company and brought back a lot of people that were let go.  It then became an unfriendly cut throat place to work.  A lot of unhappy employees."
good,"MNC working clture"
good,"Review emails and respond in a timely matter. Send invoices off to appropriate manager for approval. Ordered office supplies if as needed.  Opened, date stamped, and separated the daily basis."
good,"good working environment and ambiance"
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo,aprendí a detectar fallas en moto compresores CAT, a checar valvulas de control marca ficher,controladores murpy y todo lo que se refiere a instrumentación en planta y estación de compresión la gerencia dedicada y enfocada a mejorar el mudo de operación y producción de la planta. mis compañeros muy profesionales en cuanto a desempaño en el trabajo.lo mas difícil es el rublo de alto riesgo y ala intemperie y lo que mas me agrado es las facilidades de aprender en cuanto a información técnica y de campo por parte de la empresa y los companeros"
good,This place is not to bad. Co-workers were great but communication from management was terrible. Benefits were ok as well.
good,"overall I would say working at Exterran was great, I had chances for growth and advancement. I had some great supervisors and Co-workers"
good,"Gas company working with engines everyday maintaining maintenance and working with coworkers. Learned a lot of new skills,"
good,"Exterran was a great place to work for in the beginning.  Due to economic pressures of the dwindling economy, no so much anymore as is any company in the oil and gas industry."
good,"After being there for 3 years I have yet to get a raise. Even after learning new skills and machines. If you are not ""buddies"" or should i say a brown nosier with the managers. You wont get a chance to move up"
good,"Although extremely lacking in advancement opportunities and ability to compensate employees willing to take on additional responsibilities, the company is able to have personnel try on extra work to improve their capabilities within the group."
good,NICE COMPANY AND WOULD OF LIKED TO GROW IN TIS COMPANY. I had learned alot in this company. Good co-workers. Management was nice people.
good,fairly good money clean shop poor shop foreman lots of experience in natural gas compression moved up quickly on ladder
good,Lots of changes in management. Shop floor lacks proper leadership and worker's attitudes reflect that.
good,"Exterran is a large company that is focused on business, but not always focused on its employees."
good,"boa empresa, horário rigidamete controlado o que faz com que o funcionário seja mais disciplinado."
good,Exterran had average compensation and benefits package. The culture and values were good. The advancement was average as well and this could have been because of the economy. I enjoyed my position their and would return
good,"Was a great place when I started, but over the years especially the last few it has become top heavy with management.  People scared on a daily basis as to their job security.  Several lay-offs with more looming."
good,"typical day at work attend at least one morning meeting, complete primary documents for meetings, and meet with Exterran Buyers to forming strategy for expediting deliveries."
good,"Modern welding equipment; Employees were great group of people with a great deal of experience and knowledge of the job.  I was able to perfect my welding skills while at this job."
good,"I have nothing to share.., It like all the other companies trying to gain success. I and some good days and plenty bs to much buddy,. buddy and bs going down."
good,an ok place to work. pretty good compensation pretty interesting work environment. things use to be really good before the downturn. MORAL IS HORRIBLE. GE is slowly taking over.
good,A fast pace atmosphere for a company that is divided in its work processes throughout its divisions and locations creating a difficult environment to be successful. This is a frustrating situation since there has been a lack of movement by upper management to address problems and provide a cohesive approach.
good,Management should listen to lower level personnel. Other than that good Company to progress in and advance in. Potential for new hires and entry level personnel.
good,No real issues.  The benefits were good. Had a boot and uniform allowance.  Plant manager was great.  Plenty room to move up.
good,"I left Exterran for better benefits and an increase in pay."
good,"My day starts at 530 am, normally ends at 400pm however; being the lone HSE representative at my facility, then my day may go 24 hours, depending on the severity if a injury occurs. Manangement is fantastic, my co-workers are good. The corporate management team has some strange and odd ideas on what is right for the company. I feel in many ways they are out of touch, and come up with some of the most nonsensical ideas out there."
good,I loved the group I worked with.  Good team work.  Training could have been better.  We made up for it by working together with teammates. NO room for growth unless you have a 4 year degree.  No matter how many college hours you have or years experience.  They are very focused on that piece of paper.   Lower pay scale then most oil & gas companies.   Very old version of Oracle with patches installed every other weekend to fix issues.
good,"the work and some of the people was great to be around, make this place a nice place to come to, gives me chance to meet new people, working in an office atmosphere around others purchasing personnel"
good,"•	Performed duties too varied and diverse to be classified in any specific office clerical "
good,"Es una buena empresa trasnacional, con opción de desarrollo y crecimiento laboral."
good,I enjoyed working at Exterran for the most part. I believe management was great and it was such a team effort company that everyone felt like family there.
good,"Diversity of products and catering for the Oil and Gas market, makes Exterran a good place to be in for engineers and designers"
good,"la empresa en  muy grande, yo tube la posibilidad de desarrollarme dentro de ella y me dio mucha capacitacion cuando era hanover, viajamos, a brasil, a estados unidos para realizar cursos y conocer la bace central en houston california, cuando la empresa se fuciona con universal comprecion y pasa a llamarse exterran la emprersa cambia el modo de capacitacion y la convierte en capacitacion virtual, obteniendo el conocimiento mediante cursos virtuale realizados despues del horario de trabajo."
good,"La interaccion con diferentes disiplinas de las ramas de la construccion hace que obtengas diversos conocimientos de diferentes ramas ajenas a tu especialidad."
good,"exterran was very good to me, I learned a lot, had good pay but the facility is closing due to lack of work, there last day of business is march 31"
good,"So many meetings.  it is a 24/7 type of job because of the overseas offices.  expect everyone to always be checking emails, etc.  Very heavy calendar driven company.  Need to be anticipatory and read minds!  The people are great to work with."
good,Interesting and Challenging Work.  But they have high turnover and poor knowledge transfer of those who have left.  The teams work together well and knowledge is shared freely.  It's a very cooperative environment.
good,"This company has poor management and only cares about their home plant in Texas. They have centralized buying and the Youngstown plant was the last thing they were worried about buying for. Engineering drawings were constantly wrong, even on jobs that had been built before and corrected at the time of building."
good,Don't do it. If you don't fit in to their clique they will find a reason to fire you.
good,"Ambiente agradável, bons benefícios e possibilidade de desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional."
good,Friendly work culture and very experienced engineers willing to help and guide entry level engineers. Great opportunity to get design and hands on experience.

good,trabajo sin vida social mucho aprendizaje pero el vivir encerrado no es sano para nadie muy buenos compañeros y gran ambiente de trabajo
good,"co-workers are great for the most part. upper management on hte other hand has lost perspective on family and personal needs, and wishes for the general employee."
good,Multi-cultural and multi-disciplined facility with a lot to learn. Working here has added tremendously to my expertise and skills.
good,"Learned , Developed and Utilized Skills."
good,"Learned alot working there, very good co-workers relationships and fun atmosphere. Managment was difficult at times and doesn't pay enough to keep quality employees"
good,"Due to the spread out nature of the customer base and client demands the work/life balance portion was challenging at times, particularly during episodes of inclement weather."
good,Days were eight hours minimum.  Time usually past fast.  Worked closely with shop and field mechanics.  Also dealt with outside vendors.  Frequently work demanded fast pace in order to take care of multiple individuals at the same time.  Required  understanding of oil field parts and terms in order to meet mechanics needs.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with the heat in the warehouse in the summer.  the best part of the job was the comradery  among the coworkers.
good,I enjoyed working with this company as management is really very good . Working with this company has given me the ample opportunity to work with Multi location Projects
good,I worked there because I was in a work study program. The people there were great and very helpful. But there was really nothing to ever do. But overall it was good

good,"Well established and stuffed company in oil and gas business, producing high quality equipment and services for gas processing and treatment, gas compression, production equipment and AMS."
good,"During my short time in the Exterran Dubai Offices I have experienced quite an unbalanced company culture with a very hesitant and confused management."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. Needed more organization and care coming from the management."
good,"I held a three week contract job there. The company was going through a split and I was there to help catch up on support Exchange tickets,"
good,"Company seems stable in the oil & gas industry, while some of our neighbor companies are having massive layoffs. Tough deadlines and busy work. We seem to be treated fairly overall."
good,It would be nice if they didn't lay off half the staff though.  Low activity in the oil industry changed a once robust compression manufacturing company into a shell of its former self.
good,"Exterran is a great place to work. Its always at great day at work, much to learn and deliver, management is flexible,co-workers are friendly and brotherly and there's always a solution to everyone fault reflection."

good,"N/A"
good,6:00 AM to 5:30 PM or later.  Gained further experience with TIG and Fluxcore welding.  Management needs to understand employees have lives outside the workplace.  Hardest part of job is squeezing yourself into tight places to do TIG welding. Once a year Exterran would host a game day with water dunking booth.

good,I enjoyed working here. I learned how to fit vessels here from an older man that knew his stuff. Some days I worked my butt off and others I stood around waiting for a QC to check my work for hours and hours. I did not understand this part about the place.
good,"Possui um ambiente tranquilo de trabalho, as atividades exercidas são de fácil compreensão, porém há cobrança sobre os resultados dos trabalhos apresentados e há colaboração de todos os envolvidos. Minha formação profissional aconteceu nesta organização, aprendi muito sobre as rotinas de uma empresa e como se tornar um bom profissional. As pessoas que trabalham na empresa no geral estão sempre disponíveis para ajudar no que for necessário, existe um clima de amizade e descontração. O mais complicado é o acumulo de atividades e a quantidade de emergências a serem realizadas em um curto período de tempo, exigindo do colaborador habilidade para resolver vários assuntos ao mesmo tempo. A coordenação sempre deixa espaço para conversas e questionamentos dos funcionários, há uma certa tranquilidade para tratar dos assuntos referentes a carreira do profissional."
good,"-Processing service requests and incident report"
good,"*A typical day at work included taking apart oil and gas compressors, spraying the interior with preservative, and putting them back together."
good,"A typical day can be challenging and learning something new is often. I have learned to not only manage a warehouse and its procedures, but also to accomplish many tasks on Oracle. Also to learn the many parts that are used in compression. The co-workers are friendly and professional and the hardest part of the job is dealing with last minute orders. Most enjoyable would have to be friday payday."

good,"This is an Oil & Energy Manufacturing Company, There is no work pressure here, good company to work on, good benefits also here."
good,I mostly enjoy the friendships that develop while accomplishing every day work assignments.
good,"Excellent group of Field Tech and Managers. Company is fair, willing to work with employees and encourage success."
good,Started as help and quickly moved into QC. By working hydro i learned alot about the equipment and safety. I am responsable for many different inspection point through out the day. 
good,"Foi um período curto dentro da empresa, mas um período muito bom."
good,Is a good company to work with good benefits. but the supervisors have no  training at all in how to work with employees. if you are whiling to be kissing the supervisor rear end you got a secure job if not they put you in the cold side.you got to have a good compadre working there if not you are fkd.
good,Working for Extern has been a good experience.  I am looking for something else because of the reduction in force. I don't know if i will last through another layoff.

Exterran has never promised anything they would not deliver. I must say though that i do not understand the decision to close the shop as we have been busy and one week before we were in meetings discussing current projects. Oh,well,not my decision."

With the company demanding that all employees have professional work ethics.    The job provided all employees with mandatory safety talks about our jobs, for example how to  safely tag out, lock out engines to be worked on.                                                      The most enjoyable part of our job was family  vacation time off. The hardest part of the job was  the long hours, and working in foul weather conditions. However, the company is there to serve the customer, with the best part of the job  keeping clients happy with low engine down time. I learned a lot about the wiring on the engines and how to replace faulty parts.       Workplace culture  was challenging due to the  personal cultures that each individual brought to the workplace. Each person unique in his own way, bringing all his knowledge and then  learning to work in the best and safest possible way for the benefit of the company and all employees."
