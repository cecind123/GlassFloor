rating,review
bad,"Employment was terrible.  Poor benefits, no opportunities for advancement, poor work conditions, understaffed departments, poor communication between employees, high job turn over."
bad,"When I started at US Bank I thought I was on a fast track to success in a relaxed working atmosphere with many exciting new experiences waiting to happen. Upon my first few weeks that sales pitch during my interview went down the drain. Office floor is hectic, management does not show appropriate concern for employees. Advancement is virtually non-existent some people have been in the same role for 15+ years."
bad,"Management was unprofessional, unorganized, rude, and inconsistent. My overall experience was unpleasant and the morale in the department was very low."
bad,"The only reason I give my former employer such low score is that having to deal with the management, human resources, recruiters and extremely lax policies that are never enforced.  If there was an ethics committee there, they went AWOL.  Politics also is alive and well in the departments and divisions where I worked.  People for the most part were great to work with but would stab you in the back when had the chance.  I loved my job and the variety of work.  I did not like the commute especially this past year with all the construction on the roads."
bad,Working at U.S. Bank is one of the worst jobs for people who like to stay busy. Be prepared to stand around for 9+ hours in the same spot every day.
bad,Misogyny and racism were the norm.  Inexperienced managers often were in positions of unearned power and this created atmospheres of disgruntled staff.
bad,"The department has faced considerable challenges since inception, led by poor management.  There is too much turnover, which makes it exceedingly difficult to maintain good customer service."
good,"Very conservative, traditional bank. The training sessions were informative, but the technology is beyond outdated. To be one of the top banks in the country, they are behind the times with technology."
good,Opportunity to work remotely. I have learned to analyze data and make recommendations. Help support the sales team to secure deals and help progress strategy opportunities.
good,"Bank teller isn't a bad place to start if you plan to go further into the company. The job itself is very basic once you get the hang of it. Advancement was pretty linear in about 2 or 3 directions, thats about it from what i learned."
good,Retail banking is hard enough without constantly being berated by managers. The competition between bankers/branches fosters poor integrity and leaves the customer at risk to be exploited.
good,"Very slow-paced, was supporting the test rollout of the PRISM small lender management. They decided not to go through with the rollout, contract ended."
good,handle customer transactions while making calls in down time to find potential loan customers.
good,"The bank was a very professional organization with many good people.  I have been gone for many years so I am not familiar with the current structure.  Overall, a very good experience."
good,Okay place to work. Comfortable work environment. Fine management. Not too many opportunities for advancement. Offers adequate compensation. Average opportunity.
good,"Comapny is fast growing in Europe. It is very client focused and  the teams are always aiming to deliver excellent service to clients. Overall, a good company to work for."
good,"I came into the organization as a young (3 years experience) financial analyst.  I was given the opportunity to venture into the accounting side by working on External Reporting (10-Q, 10K, SOX) experience.  Great opportunity to learn and grow."
good,"I worked with amazing people that were driven. I loved my coworkers but the company made us feel like numbers. We worked long hours and often times we did not have time for lunch. We were a top producing branch but the company always demanded more. I learned so much during my time with them, but I had no work/life balance. I worked 50 + hours a week. I got burned out in a couple of years."
good,The job was a good starting point. Not going to make anything happen there but good experience. things could be run better. Things a kind a cluster.
good,US Bank is a large employer  and treats people well. I enjoyed my time there. 
good,Working with large monies and customers data entry and had fun with co-worker also did phone work for the Customer Service Line
good,It was a great stepping stone for me to expand on the knowledge I obtained from previous work experience and university. 
good,Workforce consists mainly of recent graduates. Pay is low. Outdated monitors.
good,U.S. Bank states that it is all about customer service in the new hire training but reality in the branch is that the job is to sell bank products. Management at the branch level is fantastic and the position is a good one to get started in either the finance or customer service field. This is a great job to build a career but it should not be one to stay at for more tha 2 years.
good,The advancement opportunities are very poor within the company. There is a lack of incentive to retain talent. It is just a matter of time before a mass exodus occurs.
good,Due to Ineffective management most of the staff leaves often finding jobs in other departments or companys. Remaining staff has a lack of institutional knowledge. Performing the duties but not know why.
good,Great advancement and learning environment for a career in finances. I was blessed with good management and peer. Always busy and people oriented makes for a good day.
good,"good working environment and management.Involved in testing task estimations LOE, review checklists preparation. Developed automation test scripts using VB Script for UFT automation."
good,"If you enjoy working at a place where other people care about you both as a coworker and human being, this is a great place to work.  I know that might not be true for all areas of the company, but I really enjoyed my time working here."
good,"many opportunities for learning, I have learned a lot from the experience of the people I work with. Annual entertaining meetings with the CEO where dinner is provided and prizes are awarded. Team spirit feeling camaraderie."
good,"I really have enjoyed working with this company. I've appreciated and learned from all of my direct managers and felt very much like part of a team and needed."
good,Really liked my job and would be with the company today if I did not resign to relocate to AZ.
good,USB is a fantastic company to work for with a wonderful executive team in Wealth Management.
good,"Great place to start a career, stable culture and many opportunities to grow"
good,Fair and very driven business.  Very focused on customers and the needs of the customers   Very fast passes and need to play attention to detail and be focused on the need of each customer.
good,The company is going through a series of seemingly un-ending organizational changes.  A decades worth of stable Sr Management has given way to a new faces that are attempting to put their own stamp on the company as everyone struggles to keep up.
good,This place has been rated on of the best places to work for a few years now.  I've had a good run here but always open to more challenging opportunities.  Vacation pay could be better but I believe this company cares and uses surveys to continue to improve.  I would recommend this place to people looking for stability but if you're looking for good pay this isn't the place.
good,I learned a lot about the financial industry. I received working knowledge of financial statements & how these statements pertain to the mutual fund industry. I tried to foster a hardworking team environment while working here. I felt taken advantage of by management and my job was a management dependent job which I disliked at times. I value my independence and adulthood and I felt as if I was just another new college graduate sometimes. Overal it was a great entry level position right out of college!
good,Great place to work for recent grads and as a first corporate job. Plenty of opportunity to grow within the organization and learn from management.
good,"Great place to work.  Learn lots of great thing.  Easily able to move around laterally.  If you can stomach the corporate environment, this is as good as they get."
good,The Bank has a great culture. They have an annual town hall meeting with the CEO cheering the Bank employees. Great worklife balance and some really nice people to work for. Most Mangers have an open door policy. The Bank is ranked in the top ten ethical firms.
good,"US Bank has been a good place to work, I have enjoyed the opportunity, have great co-workers and management, and am looking forward to continued growth."
good,"Investigates internal and external fraud losses, works with law enforcement to prosecute cases and recovery of lost funds, and prepares proper reports to upper management and federal agencies. Management was inadequate. Co-workers were dedicated and extremely helpful and we worked as a team. For me the hardest part of the job was not being bored. I needed more of a challenge. Most enjoyable part of the job is that I was not micro-managed and it was as close to being self-employed as I could get."
good,"I have been able to get exposure to so many valuable opportunities while at USBI.  My only concern is the lack of advancement opportunities, because once people come here they never leave."
good,"In the check encoding department, thousands of check and balances were performed nightly. Getting lost in the speed of the processing helped the time to go by quick. Incentives were also nice as you pick up speed which helps your check that already has a decent base rate. Management was nice to work with and very helpful as skills are developed. There are many programsand benefits that are available through the HR department where you have total and imediate control of direct deposits. Many discounts and incentives offered through other companies to US Bank employees."
good,"Loved working at USB.  The people are great and the leaders of the Company are fantastic.  Working in Audit can be very stressful at times due to workload, hours, etc but can also be slow at times as well.  However, you are well compensated for this stress and they are also great about getting you trained and developed throughout your career, including promoting and paying for certifications."
good,"Face paced work environment, constantly pushed to increase performance but training resources were well established. Managers were hands on during first month and that helped shaped my performance."
good,Working at U.S. Bancorp was easy going.  The keying went smoothly and the filing was the most time consuming.  The hours were flexible and they had a cafeteria.
good,Good work atmosphere with good group of colleagues and co-workers. Demanding job with attainable bonus incentives.
good,"It's refreshing to find a bank that focuses on its ethical principles to the core. Workplace culture at US Bank is family oriented that creates a consistency to how our customers are treated. The development network has offered tremendous opportunities to learn how other departments operate. The most enjoyable part of the job is the extracurricular activities outside your work environment- such as beach cleanups, company events, district bonding. The hardest part of our company is migrating out of sales environment to say working for HR. The transition is a bit tough, because say an individual may not be sales oriented- that individual could excel in our operations field."
good,Great work life balance. Great company culture. Had good relationships with Managers and coworkers. Good Career development. You have to put yourself out there to take on more responsibility and develop yourself.
good,Worked for U.S. Bank for 13 years and thrived. The people and talent  are strong at what they do. Very good growth opportunity. Team atmosphere makes solving problems a joy.
good,You have to attend a training session that lasts about 8 weeks. It is nice and Monday-Friday 8-5. Every session is mandatory. After that you get your regular schedule and are pretty much on your own. If you need help there are various managers to ask.
good,Good working environment to work and progress. They have good ambience and awesome working environment to progress. The opportunities come your way for you to show skills and grow.
good,"Excellent company with great benefits.

Evaluated information data management programs to ensure correct processes, productive results, and compliance with policies and standards."
good,"I am proud to be an ambassador of U.S. Bank.  A CEO to be proud of, company established core values for employees to follow."
good,"U.S. Bank is a great institution and I’ve enjoyed my time working here. Currently, I am at a crossroad in my career and time at the bank. The management and people really care about individuals."
good,Worked on a specific project involving tax accounting and adequacy of current tax payable account.  Large company so all staff had specific responsibilities.  Enjoyed working there.
good,"Senior management puts clients and employees ahead of themselves.  It has a great workplace culture.  Unfortunately, it is headquartered in Minneapolis which leaves little in the way of opportunities for an individual to grow in the New York region.  In addition, many individuals who work in New York have commutes which exceed one hour each way.  A more flexible work arrangement would be beneficial.  Fortunately, the firm is focused on ""hoteling"" as an overall corporate solution.  The downside is that some managers are not as flexible as the proposed solution."
good,"I really enjoyed working as an account coordinator. The team is fun, the location is great, it is fun establishing relationships with your assigned clients. The only downside is the call center atmosphere at times in which teammembers are expected to contribute to shared phone lines and inboxes."
good,"During my time at US Bank, I gained a wealth of knowledge in both financial services as well as information technology.  This was a very good launch into my career with financial companies and has served me well."
good,"I got hired back in 1992 and worked in Corporate Communications, creating corporate news programs, training videos and funny meeting openers."
good,"I loved working at the U.S. Bank Service Center. Training can be a little overwhelming but if you have a decent ability to retain information then it is fairly easy to pick up and even more so once you complete the training and get on the phones. There are a lot of calls that are very redundant, but that is to be expected with most jobs. What I thought was so great about working there, is that most everyone was in a good mood and liked their job (keep in mind we all have a rough day now and then). The Team Leaders that I worked with were all very helpful and would make sure you get good answers to your questions. Shifts vary, but there is the possibility to change shift every so often if needed."
good,"Internship Data analysis for asset acquired management team Analysis of commercial / single family loans, portfolios, overall performance Provide recommendations based on data analysis and model valuation Construct database for new acquired portfolio over $3 billions Served as for new interns, and teach analytical processes"
good,Diverse job options and environment that encourages growth and development for all employees.  Hard work and dedication can lead to improved opportunities.
good,"I worked with several Executives and their customers. I learned a great deal about special needs clients, in addition to the Trust business rules and regulations."
good,"I am very appreciative for my 5.5 years of experience at U.S. Bank. I had an outstanding manager who is extremely intelligent and personable. Each day brought a new and exciting challenge, allowing me to build on various skills. I thrived under pressure with tight deadlines that required a high attention to detail, creativity, and problem-solving."
good,Enjoyed working here. Dynamic team of people. Lots of room for creativity and high service standards. Enjoyed my time here immensely. Had too move unfortunately.
good,"I was responsible for test marketing  Treasury Managment Business Sales Development Officer for the Twin Cities branches. I sold Treasury Managment, Deposits, Loans and Operation and trained Branch Managers on TM products. With my success within my territiory they approved to start a new division. Was later transferred to Omaha, Ne to develop another territory.  "
good,The best job I have ever had. I loved working for U.S. Bank because the work is very fun and interesting. I took close care of my clients and maintained their satisfactory.

Everyone knew their job descriptions and we would do them accurately, and help one another without needing approval.  We were a great team."
good,"I started this job when I started college. This was a great job, because I liked my boss, the customers were great, and the hours were flexible to work around my school schedule. After working there for so many years the people I worked with felt like family."
good,Excellent executive leadership
