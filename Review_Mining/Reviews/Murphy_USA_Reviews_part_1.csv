bad,"I would never recommend working here lol the whole company is a fu**ing joke "
bad,"The job is incredibly boring. It isn't flexible, people are always asking for shifts covered but never cover your shifts in return. The pay is absolutely not worth the job."
bad,Horrible management experience. Doesn’t give as many hours as they promise. Doesn’t give any raises. The communication within every employee is horrible.
bad,"Manager was a wreck "
bad,"Save yourself the time and energy of even applying here. Pay is horrible, hours are not anywhere near fair. If you have anything of a life outside of work go ahead and say goodbye to it as soon as you accept a position here. Stay Away."
bad,Murphy USA has no respect for humanity sick and tired of being mistreated that's why I'm looking for a better opportunity. They don't know how to run a business.
bad,While I was with the company for almost a year was put up for promotion and was told I was not promoteable even with it being wanted by the store GM and district manager. Also only got a quarter raise only to see my hours keep getting cut. So found a better job and moved on.
bad,Worked there for 7 almost 8 months as Assistant Manager and it started off good but slowly ended up with me working every weekend and putting in more tasks than I was getting paid for. There was a lot of call ins and if you were already working and had a call in you might as well be prepared to stay. No breaks or lunches!
bad,"They dont care if you're sick, or pregnant they only care about the money and not of their employees. I was in my first trimester of my pregnancy and they said oh well, we need our cooler stocked. They kept soda in the bathroom which is nasty, it blocked the entrance to even get to the toilet. I had an accident and I was told by management that I still had to be there until closing. It was freezing outside and standing in my own business. Never again will I work at a terrible job"
bad,I only worked a handful of days. There is no communication between management and their employees. I was told by the shift leader that my drawer was short instead of by the manager. My drawer came up short again the following night. I have a full time job and my drawer is never short there. I don’t think there is enough training because I was on the register by myself from day one. I just wish they were able to tell me what I did wrong to make my drawer short.
bad,"I would not recommend this his place for anyone to work.  They leave ladies alone at night to work alone. The manage did not care about any family outings. She had no kids, yet scheduled herself off."
bad,They do not care about their people even though that is one of their goals and the district managers are very racist and they have affairs with the staff
bad,It’s A alright Job Just Don’t Get Paid Enough And The Hours Are Bs sometimes you work 8 hours sometimes you work 4 or maybe 5 you can’t live off a job like that . You can’t take a break or sit down or anything so if you have any time of needa don’t come here to work honest
bad,"The morganton nc location is the worst place ever to work! They expect you to work 8-10 hours without so much as a 5 min break. They nit pick tiny little details, and instead of discussing an issue with an employee the managers will call you out in front of everyone on GroupMe. They’ll tell you that you’ve not done your job when if they could just go back and watch cameras, they would see you have. I wound t reccomend anyone working here!"
bad,Do not apply unless you are desperate for a job. Company is money hungry and does not care about the employees that have to run the locations. The pay is horrible and not worth the stress.
bad,"Don't get sick and miss ant time. You will lose what little hours you do get. "
bad,Low pay for a lot of work. No benefits and no advancement opportunities. It's good if you have nothing else. The job is very taxing and you often have to work by yourself with no breaks
bad,I enjoyed working here before my original manager left and the company failed to be organized to have another manager take over. I was a cashier and became an acting assistant manager. Though I have been working here for almost two years I did not fully understand how to run the whole store on my own. I did my best and asked for assistance. I was soon robbed at gunpoint and then laid off because the store loss money based on the book numbers because I didn't know about most of these things. Although I did have assistance from other managers once out of the week I was still held responsible. I would not work here again. The hardest part of this job would be running the whole place without the knowledge of how to do so correctly. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I learned not to let anyone take advantage of me and my vulnerability.
bad,Worst experience ever!!! The company makes the manager focus in what a employee does wrong. Never a compliment. And then no working with a part time schedule even though hired as such.
bad,"I worked at the Murphy in Vicksburg, Ms this year and the manager there treats us like kids. She's rude and disrespectful, talk to and about the customers to other customers. She has a very high turn over and will find a reason to fire you just so she can work all the hours, not fair. Corporate  really needs to look at her and her turn over rate. Everyone that works for her is working under stress. Customers complain about her attitude"
bad,Work your self to death for nothing no life balance upper management made sure to make your life hard even if your doing the best and store is doing well
bad,"Poor store manager, asst manager has no clue what her job should do messes up reports all the time falsifying reports and lotto gives herself discounts lies to upper management blaming employees  store manager doesnt listen to employees and they do not follow company rules"
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked for!! The management was awful and always on their cell phones. No breaks at all. Pay was horrible. There were no benefits what so ever. I would recommend to stay far, far away from them."
bad,I was treated unfairly and it has a very poor management that works there. they cut your hours all the time and they always treat you with disrespect.
bad,I would not recommend this place for anyone you don’t make any money what so ever and you don’t have a set sced and it is so much drama it is ridiculous so no
bad,I worked for them in Tallahassee FL on appalachee pkwy. I'm from a whole nother county and I got jumped for mistaken identity. And when I became and got PTSD from this because I was cut and bitten they fired me because I didn't want to work for that particular store anymore.
bad,Horrible place to work ! No breaks and low pay . Management doesn’t care about you at all . Management standing on their phone while the lines are out the door and doesn’t budge.
bad,I’ve would say I’ve enjoyed my time a Murphy when I worked there...but the downfall is your underpaid over worked and work-life balance is horrible. The scheduling is unfair the mangers will have every weekend of or get off at 2 while you close every single weekend. And sometimes they will leave you to close by yourself if they can’t find anyone..that is very dangerous considering how much money is bought into the store. Also the duties are unfair they want night crew to do everything when the first and second crew shift does nothing.
bad,I asked for a transfer to port orange from deland. I got approved for it. After two months the transfer was shot down even though i was approved for it. I had to leave. I could not afford to drive from port orange to deland everyday.
bad,Need better communication skills and people more experienced in training. Too many customers complaining and nothing’s being done. They have poor management skills
bad,"Very terrible place to work, especially in Arkansas. They do not pay well and will not give you a raise. There is barely any hours available and the management is very unorganized and unprofessional."
bad,"When I started in Ohio it was a great job, after tranfering to Florida management was poor. High turnover rate, manager told employees to pass out fake money after she took it in when reported to corporate nothing was done, corrupt company not willing to stand up for its employees  never work for these scrums"
bad,"I gave this place my all at 115%. It wasn't worth it. Apparently I was replaceable regardless of what I did for the company that went unrecognized and no advancement what so ever. I went through 5 DMs and 3 SMs even ran the store for 2 and a half months as the only management there with NO TRAINING and no days off. "
bad,It sucks. No breaks and very low pay with hardly any hours. Stay away if you can. There is no place for advancement and the work atmosphere is horrible. The customers are great but management sucks
bad,"Unless you’re desperate for a job, then run from this company as fast as you can."
bad,They are hiring very lazy workers there even the store manager is lazy. They are losing good employees due to the store manager. You need people who wants to work for the company not just for the money. They need to learn to listen to their assistant manager also instead of always having the store managers back.
bad,They hired me on workin 35-39 hrs a wk..then kept cutting my hours the last week I worked before i quit they had me only workin 8 hrs for the entire week..I was the closer majority of the time & it was rough but I did my part on stocking & cleaning..
bad,"Not enough time to finish chores. Did my best and finished majority of them but still got yelled at. "
bad,Stores a mess and so is management. The people who work there only work for free cigarettes and Pepsi..I've never seen them pay for A THING! All the management are incompetent and cant wipe their butts with out asking EVE..
bad,This company doesnt care about employees . Work very long hours with no help. Pay wasn't worth it. No lunch no break. During the winter time its extremely too cold inside little box building
bad,"zero breaks, slavery pay, slavery expectations. leave work exhausted every single night. they constantly watch cameras harrassing everything u do. HORRIBLE COMPANY to work for. not allowed to sit down period. no matter how long your shift is. expected to do EVERYTHING by yourself (closing duties EVERY NIGHT) while running the entire store alone: check out customers, keep store cleaned and fully stocked, change garbage in parking lot, inside store,and the restroom, clean bathrooms and lobby, sweep parking lot, put up truck alone. ALWAYS working alone with zero help, zero considerations, yet management (upper) constantly threathens to fire and nit picks over petty things. $8.75 and hour to SLAVE YOURSELF CONSTANTLY! constantly threatened with the fact cameras are always being watch. I REPEAT NO BREAKS NOT EVEN A 15 MINUTE!! $8.75 to slave yourself i repeat incredibly low pay to slave yourself. leaving work 500% sore every single night. the list goes on an on. unable to live off of or support self but working like a hebrew slave.everyt thing on this review is true!!!! do not work for murphy"
bad,"I was a cashier, then head cashier and promoted to assistant manager all within a year because all of our employees kept quitting or calling out. Everyone was so rude. Customers would drive off with the gas pump still attached to their cars. Cuss you out if you’re out of their cigarettes or if prices went up."
bad,poor management. harassment and unfair treatment. worse place I have ever worked due to the manager. a lot of favoritism and threats if the manager did not get her way
bad,"It's super sucks worked here for 2 years it blows, they do not care about employees what so ever, worst place I've worked in a long time. Wound demanding"
bad,"If you're African American you'll be called a monkey, and if you are slightly overweight at all, you will be called disgusting. You are to answer texts/calls 24 hours a day and are in trouble if you don't. It is the most horrible place to work."
bad,"This job is costing me to lose my custodial privileges as a parent, I'll be 37 years old this year and I shouldn't be closing every night. I told my manager when I started that I can't work weekend night because of my job i do on the weekends & I'm at risk of losing my kids because of all the closing I'm doing. My kids comes before this job and it looks like tonight will be my last night working here"
bad,"After working at the Leitchfield, KY location for several weeks I was let go for no reason. I never missed work and was always on time. Management was rude and provided little training and would not answer calls and messages when I had a question. This job is always open. Now I know why."
bad,"This is not a company that cares about anything else but the money they bring in...not customers, and certainly not employees. They are liars that blow smoke of advancements and raises only to backtrack later."
bad,"This was hands down the most unprofessional store I’ve ever worked at. Manager always seemed lost and in a panic. They make you work by yourself and expect you to clean restrooms,stock cooler,front face everything and sweep parking lot all while checking out customers alone. Also During my training it specifically said not to enter personal phone numbers for Murphy drive rewards on customer purchases but when we didn’t make our goal it was strongly encouraged and when I let them know I wasn’t comfortable using my own number to get points of others purchases they suspended me for 3 weeks not letting me know what’s going on and the manager also wouldn’t respond to my messages for days at a time before letting me know I’ve been terminated."
bad,"Corporate is extremely picky about everything, (what to say when upselling, how to clean windows, etc), and they have begun threatening to fire employees for not meeting quota on signing people up for the new rewards program.  If you are an assistant or store manager, there will be times that you close late at night and have to be back at 4 am. Days off are not guaranteed, and you are expected to be available when you're not scheduled to work."
bad,They don’t care about their employees. They only care about the money you can make them by upselling and having customers put their phone numbers in for drive rewards. They don’t care if you bother them they just want you to get that number.
bad,Had to do everything by yourself. No raises. No hours. Management was horrible. Hours where horrible. Had issues being paid on time or in full. Definitely can't survive off it.
bad,"This job is a complete waste of time.  "
bad,The way that the business is run is very poor. The hours are very inconsistent and you are never guaranteed the hours that you ask for. They also don't offer breaks at all during the work day.
bad,"I worked for Murphy's briefly. Starting as a cashier and promoting to an assistant manager within a few weeks. There was no training and you were responsible for your shifts from day one. Most locations only have 1 employee staffed at a time, resulting in a lot of stuff that did not get done. The customer base was just as volatile as the upper management."
bad,This company is very unorganized and they only care about the store manager and up. Cashiers aren't recognized for their hard work and HR does not return phone calls or do their work. This company is also racist.  Be careful it's a waste of time!!
bad,"The job sucks. People call in and if you been there since 5 am you're stuck until the next shift come. I, on multiple occasions, was just told to suck it up whenever it happened. They offer a ""scholarship"" but they don't really try to give it to you. Was told by the district manager to just give it up whenever I had asked about it. I don't know if it's like this at every Murphy's but a lot of the customers treat you horribly. Only a small hand few actually treat you as a human being. Overall Murphys doesn't care about there employees."
bad,"it's okay to work there if you don't make your boss mad. The GM and the Assti. Manager wear dating at the time, The GM would give coupons to the workers that should of been put in trash cause they belonged to the customers (10 off on gas) The GM also worked less than 40 hours a week. Not such a good company to work for."
bad,"not a good place to work, if they dont like u they well find a way to fire u, angie and sharon are the worse manigers in the world , this is a died  in job, thier is new future here, this is just a pit stop to something better,"
bad,"Manager doesnt know how to deal with those who have disablities, and refused to notify me of work hours less than 12 hours in advance. Didnt ID young customers as per law."
bad,this job was very slow paced with no beneficial benefits. The hours weren't consistent and lots of work for little pay. The hardest part of this job was simply showing up
bad,Working here was ok its just everybody wants to be a manager. Not everybody holds there weight. Cleaning and working alone is not the best. Some days its like being in high school all over.
bad,"Does not promote within hardly no hours to work, No incentives to strive, to strict on on store policies, Management is overlooked for any kind of raise or promotions"
bad,"For my interview, the manager kept rolling her eyes when she was asking me questions but I get the job because she said they were desperate and I was there. I started working immediately and she was just ruthless and rude to me for no reason and expected me to know everything even though that was my first day and first time working at a gas station."
bad,"Fast paced environment, rude managers, terrible shifts and always had to work alone and complete a ridiculous amount of tasks for very little pay, no benefits"
bad,Some of the cashiers are very rude not paying attention to what they are doing and are always on their phones. And it's horrible and very annoying and very challenging
bad,Manager sucked has no respect for his employees and doesn't know how to talk to them... They need to fire and replace him asap! He doesn't value his job!
bad,"Just godly awful . "
bad,"managers are not doing what need to be done as a manager"
bad,Although I was there for years it was just a job they do not treat their employees fairly and they are rude. The upper management staff has poor communication. It is often busy and everything falls on one persons shoulders.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work here. I was hired for ine pay but once i started u was paid something different. The current manager did things ti make u quit so she didnt have to fire u..very stressful work conditions.
bad,"Never had a set schedule and could not call in even if you was sick. Was there about a year and never got a raise. Could not keep people to work for the company. Never had set hours. Was hired for 20 hours a week but if someone stops working, they put you on full time with not even asking."
bad,I wouldnt work for this company just poor everything and disgusting and just rude too and you name it just omg so many things went wrong..............
bad,terrible company very unfair . I was demoted from assistant manager in order for the managers friend to take my position.Said I could only work one job. Had to choose between my full time and their part time.
bad,i would not recommend working for this company. they do not care about their employees and will cut your hours the second you do something wrong instead of teaching you the right way. bad customer service as well
bad,"too much work. the upper managment is not nice but the pay is nice for store managemnt. Takes alot of time, so i wouldnt suggest that position if you have children."
bad,"Murphy was not a great  place to work. The often set unrealistic goals. District managers were not stable, at one time we had 3 district managers in 6 months."
bad,"Manager stole hours and didnt give out hours fairly according to job performance, only hired females that didnt know how to do the job correctly and treated our team unfairly. His eyes also wandered to team very often.."
bad,Work started ok for a few weeks then the hours kept going lower and lower till I had only a few hours then I just quitover the manager giving me poor excuses
bad,Horrible management! Shed steal all the time including other employees and it was over looked. Way to much drama! My managers sister in law worked here and they couldn't decide who wanted to be boss half the time and district manager was a joke!
bad,Great job if you love to be busy all the time. A lot to learn so it is important to be a quick study. This job is not for the slow or lazy person. Must be capable of lifting 25lbs or more on a daily basis.
bad,"Overall I enjoyed my job. I loved most of my customers, my job kept me very busy which is what I wanted but there was no team work and very poor management."
bad,The schedule was always inconsistent. You were promised up to 40 after 1 year cut your hours. 5528 had to use the bathroom in a porta-potty. consistent theft from outside kiosk area employees would get blamed and fired for it.
bad,Murphy's doesn't pay for overtime nor allow you to receive your full 40hrs per week. for cashier and assistance there are no benefits. They work you so much for little pay
bad,I don't have anything to say. I did not enjoy working at Murphy's gas station. I thought the store manager could have been better at her job. It was a total fail as far as jobs go.
bad,"I didn't like the way I was treated at this company. I did receive awards for my work but the manager, at that time was very unprofessional. I was glad I didn't have to stay there."
bad,You cant even ask a question about something that went on during a shift without getting in trouble. They will accuse you of trying to do something even when that would make no sense. We had a drive off and I couldnt even ask how it was caught. This company is terrible.
bad,"stocking coolers, handling money, and cigarettes. learned about gasoline and gas pumps. Everyone who comes in is generally friendly and always comes back. the hardest part of the job was the constant multitasking because you are there by yourself."
bad,"very selfish management, only looks out for themselves, doesnt schedule correctly, cashiers constantly working double shifts with little rest in between"
bad,This company was very disjointed. No communication between the field and the home office. Unreasonable expectations with no support. I would not recommend this company.
bad,"Extremely stressful. You work alone. Expected to do everything from cleaning to stocking as well as help customer at the same time. No breaks, no discount."
bad,"copmpetitive and cut throat  don't work here!! people ther are rude and vindictive"
bad,"Don't like working there they are unfair, the company don't pay enough to the employees. They also have you doing certain stuff and you can't even get down"
bad,"MurphyUSA did not have the ideal part hours I needed nor could I get the message across to them successfully. The work environment was very difficult because I'd be left to fend for myself alone and of course many things went wrong with transactions, rude customers and constant business that was very tiresome and at many times un-bearable."
bad,"The store in Miami was not a location I would suggest working at. I have worked at other locations and they were great. This isn't one I would suggest due to management and lack of communication. Hours are very short, not many offered. Hard to get days off that are needed."
bad,It was the worst employer that ive worked for. I would not recommend this job to anyone to many demands so little pay and no order and the managment was not where i need to be with whom was ever intrusted with the company.
bad,horrid place to work at the managers have no idea what they are doing. they just get a bigger paycheck they are trash. store manager is the only good one out of the lot.
bad,"Stools were not allowed, hours come and they go, things will go as well as your manager is prepared for them to, all managers in this company are biased"
bad,Not a good place doesn't listen to or work with employees and the pay was terrible for the time and effort put into the job. Would not work there again.
bad,Murphys was a great place to work the first time I worked there and then I found a better job opportunity.  When I went back management was unfair and unwilling to work around hours after being told they would. New rules were established and drove customers away with the rude management
bad,They rush you thru training and then you are alone.  The help offered was little to none.  In a hurry to do everything.  I loved my customers.  I did learn how to change a fuel filter for the gas pumps.  I was not use to having to do your own maintenance on your pumps and store for that matter.  They do not tell you when you are hired that you do the maintenance throughout the establishment.  Higher management said if I needed help to call when I did call she did not return the call.
bad,"I would not recommend working for Murphy USA. They are a very unfair employer. The management is corrupt, they love to play favoritism and will try to fire you for any reason they see fit. ."
bad,"Very poor upper management staff. Not recommended to work here. Promised a set amount of hours, never got that amount always less. Manager was not a good leader."
bad,"manager is a very negative person caused a lot of unnecessary drama between co workers. very slack work, does not communicate with others, no team effort."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying customers in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job is management being in control of everything as if they are prejudice.
bad,"I truly feel sorry for any poor girl or boy that works at Murphy USA. I hope you don't have a family or social life or have any plans on having either one of those things because you will hardly ever have time to see them. You will be here every weekend and holiday. I hope you can handle rude, ungrateful people that call themselves customers. I hope you can work for lazy management and know your job is not valued because you will be taken advantage of. I also hope you can work with loud mouth co workers that like to keep drama started. And I hope you like working a whole shift with no lunch, no breaks, no bathroom breaks. I am so glad I no longer work here."
bad,It was bad from day one 2 years ago but it only got worse the pay is good if you yell at them to give you a raise other wise you will never get one and they have you travel sometimes then it takes them 4 two 12 weeks to get paid for it
bad,"Long hours no time for family,  although the pay is okay, you have count inventory everyday also when it's cold outside, district manager was horrible when I worked there. There was also a lot of meeting you had to attend"
bad,"I had previous experience sof the job was easy.  The other employees had been let go and/or quit which had me suspicious.  I got 1partial day of training which consisted of a manager telling me answers to the test questions on the computer. Then thrown right into busy 40 hr weeks. My manager said i was short money and would not train, explain, or let me watch the tapes.  Accusing me of stealing.  I heard thats what she did to the last employees as well.  If you work here WATCH Your back.  The manager steals (Tia) and she WILL make you take the fall for it. She works whenever she feels like it and will leave and come back just to punch out  Customers loved me and I loved them as well.   But the management was worst I've seen."
bad,"it was a small work area, friendly customers but the manager was lazy and put all of the responsibility and work load on the employees"
bad,all the coworkers were very friendly. if you needed their help the would help u as much as possible. i learned how to do the lotto. management was very rude. the most enjoyable part of this job is the coustomers
bad,Boss is horrible awful hours  very poor management and way to many expectations for one shift all by your self be warned do not try to work at the Murphy oil in Cadillac they will lie to you every chance they get about everything and they say oh we work with other jobs then if you actually get another job they act all mad when you have to work the other job beware of this place you will definitely regret working there the manager is horrid and makes up lies to your face and the pay is way to low for all the horrible stuff they put you through
bad,Murphy USA is a great company to work for. I have a great manager. We are respectful toward each other. We all work together to resolve issues and get the tasks done gracefully. In order to receive respect: You must give respect. Training is crucial when hiring new employees.
bad,Working for Murphy express was not the best experience that i have had working for retail/ gas stations. Thats all i have to say bout that.
bad,I learned that people are happier when you speak with them and let them enjoy the company. One customer told me that nobody could get mad at me because I am to nice of a person my spirit is genuine. The line was long a nd I was working my self and he still said the same thing. I keep everyone entertained and handled my self on how I would want to be treated in a store .
bad,"Fun working with my co-workers, there is improvement need in the management area. This company is very disorganized. The hardest part of this job is communication between the employers and management."
bad,"I have learn a lot working at Murphy USA. I work well with others, and enjoyed my time while I was there. I love to stock, and answer the phone, clean and organize my area. Murphy is an incredible company to work at, because you will enjoy doing a lot of different things."
bad,Typically assisted the store manager in all store operations and any assigned job duties. I very much enjoyed the constant work that needed to be done.
bad,Hardest part of job is working outside in the cold. Nothing enjoyable about the job.
bad,"I was brought in as an Assistant Manager for this company. I was quickly trained, and inadequately so. Shortly after my arrival our store manager agreed to disagree with corporate and left his position. Our new manager that was brought in was not at all satisfied with how I had been trained. Within only a short time I was requested to leave the store because of my inadequate training. I wasn't given an option to be given proper training or to step down from the management position and stay on as a cashier to earn a management position at a later time."
bad,i liked working with my co workers but other then that this job stunk. i worked for 7 days stright and they didnt pay my for it
bad,"Lots of employees turnover, rating is a killer, pay sucks (every two weeks) management care only money and lack of freedom and there watching you a lot"
bad,I was happy with my store manager.He went out of his way to help me with work hours. Now the district manager on the other hand was in my opinion very  unprofessional in the way she went about termanating me.
bad,They do not care about their employees. They can not keep anyone hired. They are back and forth with what you’re supposed to do. One day you’re not allowed to do something the next day it’s your job.
bad,at the start I liked working for the company it was friendly and fast paced but the area supervisor wasn't very nice he liked to demote them and cut there hours
bad,I work for the Michigan stores and literally the place is a joke. To be a district manager you can be a complete idiot and not do your job lol and to manage you literally just tell people to call a help desk.  I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to this company.
bad,"If you file a workers comp claim, considered yourself fired! The upper management is sneaky and spiteful. Great customers which makes it semi- workable."
bad,"Probably the worse job I have ever worked at. Fights almost everyday, fires being started randomly at night. And Rude customers. It was so stress I couldn't take it anymore. So I had to leave"
bad,"Long hours and no good direction under  staffed ,no hours  for training, turn over is very high,no  incentive to increase  sales changed commission  program to where you received  nothing."
bad,"This company doesn't care about their employees at all...you don't get breaks and you work alone. Sometimes I would almost urinate on myself because I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom. The upper management sucks! I was once cussed out by my district manager. The district manager had so many complaints for being mean to women , yet he's still working there!"
bad,I worked in the ultra small booth and it was gruesome. It's obvious that this company is having you do the workload of two people. It's too much going on at one time. Not very organized. Night shift should not be outside the booth at night. I was going to stick it out but everyone kept drilling me about how difficult the job is to the point where I just called to quit.
bad,"While working at Murphys, I was the most reliable manager. Every time someone called out, I was called to come in and I did. No matter my schedule the next day. To this day, I'm still highly favored at Murphys. Upper management did not care about the well being of its employees. You can't have a good team without a good leader."
bad,"Lot of work....low pay...long hours alone handling customer concerns and required to cashier, check in orders, fix problems as they occur with the pumps, and maintain a clean appearance for the layout of the store..."
bad,Worked there over 2 years literally completely turned around the gas station and what did I get for it nothing. You get paided for 40 but work 50 hrs.
bad,"They are all bad.i do not sugest to work there.they are bunch of racist people.my area manager was a you know one of those people that ,he is somebody"
bad,"They don’t care about your safety if you’re located in s very bad area "
bad,I was at Murphy's for 10 years it only kept getting worse upper management it not good at all it is not ran by Murphy it's ran by DMs and Division directors the way they want to run it. It's all about making them happy.
bad,Everyone is just looking out for themselves and will lie and stab others in the back to move up. Murphy USA does not typically promote from with in so new management has no idea what their employees do. My manager told me that I get paid enough to compensate me for her not allowing me to take vacation. She also demanded that I work same long hours that she did (she would work until midnight). I would get phone calls when I was in bed at home to do things she forgot. Keep in mind I am not management nor did I get pay check like a manager.
bad,Dont get paid enough to survive in the town I live in especially for all the things expected for one person to do in the little hrs scheduled in a day
bad,It is pretty much a slave ship shaped like a gas station they expect you to do a job three people should be doing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"I worked there 5 years, I found a torso of a woman in our trash an I did not receive one hour off much less a day. I was depressed daily they did nothing to help my pain because we were “short” staffed. It’s the reason for me resigning they lost a good employee to poor upper management. They expected me to act like it was nothing and to go on about my job things were never the same for me. I know it was a freak accident a body was left in there but they could have treated me with dignity about the way it made me feel."
bad,"The job is the WORST. The ENTIRE company is very selfish. They work you crazy out of you for a little piece of money. There’s absolutely NO ORGANIZATION, everything is all the place. It not a guarantee that you will have a life and if you have child(ren) this is not the place you want to work. You get no breaks and everything is expensive with no employee discount This company is a road block in life. DO NOT APPLY ITS NOT WORTH IT."
bad,"I don't really have anything positive to say about this company. My experience was horrible. I was placed in a dangerous neighborhood , my boss constantly talked down to me, she was always out to prove I was stealing"
bad,First of all they want to do everything with low pay. Also when no one wanted to work I was called then later on they cut my hours  because apparently I worked to much . Plus I was in  a contest for selling the most Marlboro's in my district and I was number one to receive a 100 dollar amazon gift card and never received it .
bad,They don't appreciate their employees and they require a lot of their employees and don't want to give them hours to maintain bills
bad,You don’t even want me to start. The manager barely managed. He picked favorites and treated the rest of us poorly. I worked my tail off but it was never enough.
bad,"Low pay!! This company has absolutely no break policy whatsoever. You'll be working 7-9 hour shifts with no break. The cashier's eat their food at the register while ringing up customers. Extremely small work area. You're expected to upsell to every single customer. Management there had been allowing certain customers to purchase cigarettes without showing their ID so when I, the new employee, carded them they would completely lose their minds. Management does whatever they want to do. I worked there for two weeks before I even received any safety training. The general area I worked in was unsafe. We had to run off panhandlers, junkies, and drunks on a daily basis. There are constant robberies in the area the store is located and we were also experiencing thefts on a daily basis, we had drive offs for gas regularly, and they will leave you alone in the store at night. Management is a nightmare. Living in poverty just to work in a toxic, unsafe work environment? No thanks."
bad,"This job isnt what it appears what may seem like a pretty ok job is super stressful. The pay isnt good! Theres so much to do for 1 person and god forbid you do something wrong. Management is ok cause theyre trying but I cant tell you how bad this job is. Theres upselling, cleaning, stocking, customer service and so much more. Theres so much pressure that even on your off days they'll bother you. You have to relocate to other locations to help out cause the whole dang company is under staff. Sometimes its hard to keep up with everything. They'll just keep piling more stuff onto you till you break. They also encourage you to work off the clock with no pay!"
bad,"Management is absolutely terrible new manager hasn't worked a store like ours, she is from a kiosk store where it wasn't as busy, her decisions are terrible and she won't listen. The store is becoming a wreck quickly and our last manager just left a little over a week ago she's rude and expects to much when she doesn't understand how busy it can be at times. Not to mention everything is so strict worse place I've ever worked"
bad,"Just Don't, you work your tail off, just to not be appreciated, then you get your hours cut due to not enough transactions. They don't train you properly to do the job yet write you up for things you didn't even know about."
bad,"I worked for this company for 4 years. Within these four years I did not have a life, I was constantly stressed out, and my health began to fail. Murphy does not provide a work/ life balance at all especially as a store manager. The store managers are stuck doing all of the work no matter what. They also do not care about their employees or their well being. Company advancement is on a who you know basis and not what you know or how well you do your job. Upper Management and Corporate do not support you at all. They do provide health benefits but they are so high you can barely afford them. Vacation time and Sick leave was only okay if you were a store manager or above. All other employees were not provided with sick leave which I felt like was unfair. I would only apply to this company if you are desperate."
bad,"this was one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had and upper management talks to people as though they are stupid, with an eerie sense of racism."
bad,I hated working here. I was 8 months pregnant and they made me work 10 hours in a one-person location. The manager stayed in bed knowing my back was hurting and my feet were also. I couldn't even stand up or walk when it was time to close. This job does not care about it's employees and management abuses there position to do what they want. Plus the customer are so rude. I've never had to service any customers like these before. They are SO disrespectful.
bad,Worst place i have ever worked. You are left alone majority of your shifts. There is only so much stocking one can do as well as cleaning. Very easy yet boring place to work. I would not recommend working at Murphy's nor would I ever work at Murphy's again.
bad,"The local district manager is racist and ignores nepotism.  If she doesn't like you, you will be setup and fired. The corporate HR department and the ""Ethics"" board do nothing to help store-level employees."
bad,I hate It.This location is the busiest in Dallas. Employees late every Day!No lunch no breaks.standing up 6to 9hours A day.and employees make they own schdule.
bad,Bad management from store level all the way up to corporate office. I would not recommend anyone deal with this company if you have any other options.
bad,"I worked for the company almost two years as an assistant manager. I started out as a cashier in Forest city nc and took extra hours an hour away in Greer sc in 1 month fromndriving back and forth they promoted me to assistant manager my pay went from $7.25 to 9.75. I was driving two hours a day. Also, I work over 50 hours a week, done inventory no matter the weather and worked countless hours when employees called out sick. The pay really sucks for the time and life you give to this place."
bad,I had been with the company for 4 and a half years. Lots of ups and downs. You can't have a special needs kid and successfully keep your job. Store managers and home Office expect you to do things off the clock if you are a assistant manager.  The only thing I liked about being a assistant manager was my Co workers and my customers. So if you don't have a life and don't care if you have a wreck while on the road for the job and not have it covered by the company sure go ahead and work here.
bad,"We are given no breaks whatsoever, no chairs to rest your feet even if we were given breaks, low pay, and the job is extremely fast paced and stressful."
bad,It's a good place to if you are just looking for something to do...dont try to make it a career.  I have nothing else to say...i wouldn't want to go back.
bad,"Worst experience in having hope in a position and people. Having that hope ripped out from you and having to move your family is not what I had hoped for. God is in charge, thankful for that!"
bad,"There is no work life balance in this company, not a good fit for people with children. The company will not be flexible and doesn't care too much about their employees."
bad,I was only scheduled on shifts with a coworker so she could sit around all day and i would do both of our jobs.  You run the store by yourself all the time.  rushing in and out of the store to tend to customers and get your daily chores done in an annoying task.  overall i did not enjoy my time at Murphys.
bad,"i worked with bad people so this job was horrible. i was basically forced to quit because my manager was racist, even though she hired me? she cut my hours so i would quit instead of just firing me."
bad,"Work you death, don't pay you enough to be called stupid for 15 minutes straight but expect you to sit there and take it with a smile instead of standing up for yourself no benefit WHATSOEVER"
bad,"Very poor management. The lack of empathy, and the lack of customer service training, never more than one person on shift unless it's day shift. Little if any help with nightly duties. Just not some place I would work ever again."
bad,"The job itself is not bad. The schedules are flexible, and the pay is usually fair, but you will earn it. You will work alone all or most of your shift which is okay, but the company's extremely tight labor budgets do not allow for more than 15-30 minutes for a shift change. If you have been working most or your entire shift, alone, 15-30 minutes is not long enough to reconcile your till, count inventory, and complete the multiple shift duty list. The store managers are also overworked which of course trickles into the daily operations of the store, and if you need support from upper management or Human Resources, you can forget it. This corporation is only concerned about the almighty dollar, not their employees."
bad,"It was okay to work but it wasnt enough hours get paid bi-weelky waitin on 100 or less check nothing to live off on,work by yourself ,no food or breaks"
bad,I worked there for 3 years. I was used and abused than terminated for telling my manager i was threatened by her drug using employee. They refused to fill any Passover work out after my termination said i voluntarily resigned to avoid paying unemployment. Its a terrible business
bad,"What a fun job to be with a great team!   The last year the payroll hours have been cut drastically to the point where nothing is done right.  If you love stress, frustration, cut hours, lines with 10 people constantly , and a consistent decline in morale. this is the place for you.  Our DM was a great help.  The upper management in my opinion is more interested in how many candy bars you sell. We had a pump printer that was broken for 3 months without being fixed which was not the managers fault. It really gets embarrassing when you have to apologize to customers.  This used to be a fun company to work for at store level. Not any more.  At the top all that matters is the bottom line.  I have been in customer service since 1972, and have never seen a company that within just a few weeks destroyed the morale of a once exciting company to work for at the store level."
bad,Murphys was a good job and could be a company u can move up to a higher position. Working for the Company was great but i think the location i was working should be under new management.The manager was not only rude to employees but also customers.
bad,"it is very busy to work there nice people very laid back the hardest part of the job was trying to get everything stocked in between customers, relax."
bad,"Although the customers were great, the management was rude most of the time."
bad,Rude in general boss wise never seen anybody say such harsh things I do everything and still get treated bad just for not going in when needed so I’m a bad person
bad,When I started they were on a different labor model which is when the company was shining. Now there’s a short set of hours given over lapping employees is short or non existent depending on volume of each store but still relevant to all stores. So expectations of caring for customers while expectations of duties in the store or outside pump issues or lot cleaning are done in between customers or making a run for it during shift change. Cashiers and assistants pay are horrendously under wages. I would have gladly taken a cut to get the rate of pay for others to be happy. Don’t hire too many people because who can live off of 20-25 hours these days? Yet if someone calls in it’s hard to cover especially at the end of the week. Taking care of the team and customers definitely is not what this company really wants.
bad,"The district manager I had was clueless as to how to run a store. She openly admitted she knew nothing about the computer based report systems, so don't bother asking her if you run into problems. What was important to her? coloring your weekly schedule to divide up work tasks. I kid you not, she had to be shown pictures weekly by all the managers to elicit approval. The managers themselves were rude, crude, mostly women who looked like they just stepped off the set of Deliverance. They were totally devoid of professionalism or retail knowledge. As a result, there was a revolving door of employees; hiring was a weekly event. This is not a good place for REAL retailers."
bad,Hard place to work for. They did not allow breaks of any kind in an 8 hour period. Some of the Store Managers and the district mangers can be mean and they blame the employee for the lack of training they give them.
bad,I enjoyed working there until the store manager relocated and I was told I would get the store since I was there since it was built. The new store manager came in decreased my hours then thought I should be grateful that he gave me hours that I was working prior to the management change. What had me leave was the fact he would not hire someone who was not white until I reported him to home office after I left. Only reason the new manager got the store was because he was the new district managers assistant manager from an other store until he left 30 days prior to applying for the store management position.
bad,"At the Murphys store here in DeRidder, La I would recommend but under different management. The manager and assistant manager are not as friendly once you get to meet them. They are low key raciest and would do anything to not have African Americans working there"
bad,"Started as a assistant manager. Left my previous job for this position to better myself. Worked 1 year, Was told that if i was not willing to move out of state for a manager position because of corporate down sizing  that my position would be dropped to a cashier but that i would still get to keep my same pay and garenteed 40 hrs a week. But i would lose my benefits and commission. I agreed to this. Two weeks later my hours were dropped to 16 hrs. I tried to talk to the store manager and district manager with no luck. I quit and filed unemployment. And won. Murphy late appealed 3 times and took me to court twice and lost both times. Not impressed. Very poor management. Best part now is several of the regular customers have told me since i left they have been going to a different store because the current store is constantly unclean and rude workers."
bad,My opinion about this job is really not all that good. First I loved the job until the last month or so. The manager really was not a very good manager and didn't know how to run her store correctly . She coulnt keep employees. The only thing I liked was the fact that I got to work with people.
bad,"Is employees not doing tasks as asked and when you do ask they get mad and storm away ."
bad,I have worked for this company over 5 years and they truly use to be in the beginning a great company in the last 3 years they went to the dumps low pay and no raises and they do not appreciate or value there employees. Upper management to HO staff is hopeless if it doesn’t affect them directly they have no hope to support you are your team
bad,"They lie to you it really not the painted canvas they paint for. They over work their managers and when sh** hits the fan they dont help you and then they hold you accountable for things you have no control over. Sh** pay for managers and staff, im sorry but what ASM can survive at 10.00 an hr and be over worked, part timers start at 9 an hr and can work as little as 2 days every other week. Run look for a job that you can have a work life balance. This job will be the life of you."
bad,"I got terminated for someone I feel should never be in a company policy. I will/would not recommend even my worst enemy to work for this company anymore. B/c when I tried to contact the district manager about the issue, they never contacted me back."
bad,"Murphy USA was a good company to work for the time I was there, the only thing that had me in a comfortable place was the management. to me it seemed like the management was very lazy and not considered of anyone else."
bad,totally not worth the stress that is put upon you working here. the management is horrible. i definitely don't suggest working here at all. it just overalle blowed
bad,My typical day consisted of counting inventory and restocking. I learned how to be proactive. The culture seemed secluded. The hardest part of the job was working alone.
bad,at first a really great place to work and when they changed managers working there was a nightmare. everything completely changed overnight and was expected to be able to complete tasks the new way the first time.
bad,"Stocking, planograms, awesome co-workers, i enjoyed talking to my customers and making them feel like more than a customer"
bad,"I would come in at 3:30 am , punch in, then run a gas survey. This meant locking the store driving around town comparing gas prices, then returning to the store to enter the prices into the computer. Next I would start the end of the day process from the day before. While the computer was updating data, I counted cigarettes. After that, I entered the total into computer , if it was correct , fine; if not I had to recount. The store opened at 5am , so I had to make sure everything was filled and clean before we opened. I had no cashier until 10am so I had to run register and finish my paperwork before they came in, this included counting the money for a bank deposit. Monday's were a little hectic, it was delivery day. I had to also put truck away."
bad,Murphy USA is not the place you want to work for. The company could careless about you.
bad,"Lots of double standards at this job. Too many employee's not doing what they're supposed to do (including management AND the ""higher ups""). They don't trust any of their employee's and treat them all like they are lesser people."
bad,"Terrible management, they’re always firing managers over stupid reasons that are the faults of district managers. Management is always rude to their employees, no breaks, no discounts, long hours and you work full time hours for part time wages."
bad,You can pretty much decide on not having a life.  Also they tend to make you train the person that is going to be in charge of you. The District managers and Division Managers don't care about you. Oh and you don't even get a lunch or breaks which is against labor laws when you work over a set amount of hours
bad,"Working there was okay. It is extremely small and tight space to work in. Small enough to hold two people and having to always lock the door behind yourself while working just to get a carton or two of smokes from the backroom that is connected to the restroom. They only have a store manager and an assistant, it would have been better if the company could tear it down and rebuild it so t hey can have one store manager and 2 assistants. The store manager now is cool, but bringing his personal problems to work is really unacceptable. His work ethics are on point, but the attitude he have is just ridiculous."
bad,"Schedules was changed without my consent, and I was forced to work hours that was not coherent to me being a single mother. Store managers was not using the policy for production they were in conceptual contrast to policy for authority to buffoon employers with the most customer appreciation acceptance and much hard working ethics."
bad,I worked for Murphy Express delivering priority mail from 4:00pm to approximately 3:00-4:00am for my entire 90 day probationary period. Unsatisfied with management and their lack of concern for safety of their drivers; specifically myself working overnight hours. Where there is no one to contact in the event of an emergency. I gave “ a 30 day notice” that I would be seeking other employment. That’s when I was told that my route was cancelled and that they were parting ways due to my notice. I also would not receive my 90 day bonus because of taking a one week vacation that they had approved. THEIR SHADY PEOPLE!!!!!!
bad,I thought it would be a great job. But was penalized due to calling off 3 times in 5 months and was forced to quit. Manager never did her job. If they had a better manager i would work their again!
bad,On my days off i was always getting called in because the assistant manager never wanted to work she was lazy and off putting and her attitude was horrible
bad,Love the customers from the area. Get to see new faces everyday. Area is good. Work hours are low. Must use this as second job. Not a job to live on. Must be able to handle attitudes from both sides.
bad,This place is stressful and not for you if you have kids. Your home life and work life are not  compatible working here. Being fair to all employees are a plus and should be enforced.
bad,"As a cashier you will work harder and do more then anyone else. The managers are over worked and stressed and take it out on employees, who are doing their jobs. While always letting the slackers slack off. The first time you call in every one treats you different. And talk about behind your back. Tell your personal business to everyone who will listen."
bad,I worked any time that they needed. Took on the role of the assistant manager and did the job very well. Trained new employees and took calls from employees if they had issues at the store. I got passed over for the job.
bad,"I loved my time at Murphy's but when it comes to policies and people with children they arent forgiving. Management isnt always fair. Favorites are chosen to advamce in the company and the hard workers are taken advantage of. Not nearly enough pay and the hours are ""earned""."
bad,Back on May 19th of 2019 I was hired at the Murphy's down in Pooler Parkway at first it was a great company to work with but then they started acting very rude didn't
bad,"At first I thought this was a pretty good job, but as time went on I soon found out that it just wasn't worth it. It's really not a hard job, but unless you're an emotionless robot, you'll soon want a way out. The management is (sometimes literally) nonexistent. I would rather work somewhere with intense labor and good staff then go back here. If you're looking for an easy job, you might get it here, but surely there must be better options out there."
bad,"They expect you to work evening hours by yourself because they are too cheap to pay someone to help.  It’s a big security concern being out here with no one around.  I don’t know about all locations, but my location the schedule was so tight you could not call out.  And if you have a medical emergency they act like they care but they don’t.  If you ask someone to cover your shift or two you get your hours cut down and they treat you rudely and begin acting like high school teenagers.  Not worth it for what you get paid if you ask me!"
bad,"Worked there for 9 years and was worked as much and hard as they could daily for no gratitude from the company. You worked alone most of your shift so bathroom breaks or any break from the constant stream of customers was almost impossible. In order to go to the bathroom you had to literally run cause it was outside and customers also used it so it may not even be empty when you tried to get to it. Some customers were awesome and made the job bearable, while others could be real nasty. District Managers and people in HO would rather believe hateful customers over employees creating an environment were customer know if they treat you badly then call in to complain on you they would get free stuff from the company to make them happy and undermine the store level employees humanity forcing them to have to re-endure the treatment from the same customers and their friends and families with a smile. Furthermore, the company boasts about home/ work balance and rising up it's people, but in fact has no loyalty to it's own people and the balance is a joke that only cashiers get; since they work less the an average of 25 hours a week."
bad,I would prefer not to say all the bad things I want to say about this company. I just don’t recommend working here. Big lack of pay for the work that they want you to do.
bad,This is a good company to work for as long as you are just now starting out with employment or even a second job for extra income.
bad,The management has been poor the whole time I've worked there.  It is evident that my managers were teated unfairly by upper management and even upper management seemed to be at high stress while
bad,"It is difficult to say but I truly think they could improve alot of their business practices. We were not given breaks, contests we worked for benefited mainly management but not hourly employees.I repeatedly asked to get put on day shifts because I was fearing for my safety after several threats, etc. The hardest part of the job was the way some people react when you i.d. them but also watching conitnuing acts of bias or favortism.Will detail upon request."
bad,"Weren't allowed to break or sit or at any time.Ran store alone,hard to get bathroom break..No help in stocking, in everything parking lot .no help.Schedule always Changed,always tweaked by corporate after manager makes it out."
bad,"Do not put yourself at a disadvantage. I dedicated my efforts 2-3 years when the store manger I worked under knew how to keep the store clean and organized with a hard working team. However, that all changed under new management and everything was terrible. I never had to feel pressured to always be the one person to come in and pick up the mess from the previous shifts and almost do doubles. Everything you do will be in vain working here and needs to be addressed to keep hard workers."
bad,"Constantly Busy. So much that had to be done on a day to day basis.  Most of the time you're working alone.  Customers constantly making mention that there should be more than one person working.  You're expected to complete all your ""shift duties"" before leaving but are reprimanded for staying on the clock to long when completing those tasks.  Getting extra hrs isn't a problem if you're willing to drive to other locations out of town to get said hrs. Dealing with rude customers, passive/aggressive management, and trying to keep up with an ever changing scheduel... It's just more stress than its worth."
bad,No accountability for people in higher positions and you are constantly told you are easily replaceable. You have to fight to get anything from the company and many people on higher positions will treat you like trash
bad,"Literally the most boring job I have ever had. Lack of business is bad enough but policy wanting you to ""constantly be moving"" makes it harder because you run out of things to do really fast."
bad,"Started there two months ago, never saw my thirty day .25 raise. Management does bare minimum, and does not train employees well. It has a high turn over rate, and a lot of policies are broken by management. The management will also cut your hours if you don’t take someone else’s shift on your day off."
bad,"Started off good, hours were eventually cut due to ""season change"", and eventually the manager started playing favorites, and giving me all the hard, and time consuming jobs, and horrible hours, she lost one of the best and hardest working employees she's ever had because she chose friendship status over hard work!"
bad,"typical day...long and boring."
bad,The manager shows favoritism an shouldn't have her position. If you don't kiss her but she really doesn't care about you or whatever you have going on in your life. She won't honor her word.
bad,"Customers are great, but I learned you are not important to anyone in the company while your a cashier or assistant manager. I also learned that speaking of your employees badly to other employees is not taken serious what so ever by a district manager, or HR. Would be a wonderful place if people actually cared."
bad,"Been with Murphy 10 Years.  Was a GREAT Company when I started. But they have grown and Split from Mother Company, All the builders of the Company have left.  Its all about making a penny now.  The urgency to take care of the Customer, and care about Employees have flown out the window.  It all about HOW can we work our Salary Managers 120 Hours a week and get by with it? How can we Puppetize these guys?  Its take away from the Stores manpower so we can build another.  Sooner or later they will Sell because they cant keep treating Managers and employees like they do.  The main players have already left. And they are sqeezing out the people that did the grunt work on the Store level  Soon they will have Slum Stores with Teenagers running them.  They keep raising prices which was one of the foundations this Company was Built on Lowest Prices in Town,  But not anymore.  You can go across the Street and get it for the same price."
bad,"During my years working for Murphy USA Oil i found the job to be very stressful at first but my first manager was very patient and kind. If i had a question or problem he would walk me through the steps to fixing the issue/question/problem. If you get promoted to assistant your first year of working for the company you lose your Annual raise. After being promoted to Assistant Manager at a different location, the store manager who promoted me left to work at a different store. They hired the next manager from outside the company and he didn't know what he was doing and myself, being a brand new assistant, had no idea what i was doing because they did not provide any training. After the ""Outside hire"" was terminated the training manager of the Gulf Coast was transferred to my location and i thought, ""Yes, now i'll get the training that i need to succeed."" That was not the case. He is never at the store. He prefers to talk AT you instead of TO you. He does not explain things to where i understood them. I felt as if he did not have time to talk to or teach me anything. He was just too busy and i was in the way. He does not provide solutions to problems/mistakes, instead he tells you what you did wrong and that it needs to be fixed without any input on how to fix it."
bad,Just watch your back and do not make friends with anyone. Just make sure when you go to work to cover yourself and do your job. Where I worked it was always something to fuss about and you got thrown under the bus alot.
bad,"I work full time and night shift 9pm to 5 am and when i started going back to school it was agreed that i would be taken off of it. I have been in school for 2 semesters now and im still on nights. Management is always late and then I get in trouble for having over time ( I can not leave until they show up in the morning to relive me) I was trained for a management position and they gave it up to someone else who was not trained at all.Manger only hires people that she knows, I only got a job there because i transfer from another store. Not a safe place to work constantly getting threats, no panic button, no alarm and cameras barely work half the time"
bad,"Taking care of customers is the best part, co workers were negative and not driven"
bad,"Working at Murphy has taught me a lot and it was great for a first time job, but as all the excitement died down i started to see how unorganized the company really was. The managers come in once a doy for an hour or so then you dont see them anymore. My coworkers used to come and go as they pleased because of the lack of discipline and accountability. There was also a ot of favoritism."
bad,"I was constantly promised an ""upcoming promotion"" that never showed up."
bad,"Not worth such a busy job if never enough hours to half live on. Lack of corporate communications. I worked my butt off and got shunned when onus was on them to help me out"
bad,Management and other employees are not paid enough by far for what they ask of you.  They are a cheap company that doesn't care about their employees well being.
bad,While at my time there I went from Cashier to Assistant Manager worst mistake. Constantly called into work on my days off no one was reliable and always worked doubles. No room for family time be expecting to work 12+ hours
bad,"Murphys is not a fair place to work the bad ones got promotions and the good ones treated like dirt, management was poor and did not care about personal issues, left because the pay was bad and tired of how they treated me."
bad,"I was always very busy, there was no work/life balance at all.  I worked extremely hard at work and my phone was always ringing once i left work.  i learned a lot through my district manager and he was always helpful and understanding.  The most enjoyable is teaching my team and watching them grow."
bad,I was excited to work there in the beginning and then the longer I was there the more I realized it just wasn't the right place for me so I was stuck there until we moved to high point and I was able to find another job.
bad,"While promising anything to entice an employee, upper management develops Alzheimer's when it comes to the individual worker.  Thier whole mentality is CYA. Hourly employees get little benefit or hours while receiving increasing responsibilities. I actually enjoyed working there, however; if you are good at your job, upper management begins seeing you as a threat and will use the slimmest of excuses to terminate you. Brown-noses welcome, independent thinkers need not apply."
bad,"The customers love coming to Murphy Express to see a happy friendly face. The employees provide great customer service. Hours are not steady. Employees have to be watched on camera every day by Managers to ensure they're doing their job. Managers there show favoritism towards certain employees, and that can get stressful, so I would not recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"This is a great place to work depending on your store manager. The tasks are simple and most of the customers are nice. I would work for this company again but, under different management."
bad,"The set up for computers in work area are not easy to access when the satlelight goes out and shuts the complete system Down!"
bad,"Working for murphy gave me one of the most eye opening experiences I’ve ever had in my life.  Nothing that is taught at training will be the norm while working, which can be considered good or bad; because you are never bored. Working in that environment, you make many different relationships; it could be with customers, coworkers and or bosses. Depending on who is your direct supervisor the work load can change to being more or less, because nothing is standard.  The company is growing so room for advancement is there, but your direct supervisor is the one responsible for you taking the next step; if they aren’t in your corner you will either be stagnant or unemployed."
bad,"Love my customers and the people I work with, but my manager had said several things to me and other employees that in the corporate world he would be fired for.  Many promises made to get me and others to accept the job but later those promises were broken.  My current boss is rude, inseintive, and will look you in the face and lie to you.  If corporate was aware of his comments and actions he would be fired.  And let me not forget to tell you he will belittle you in front of customers.  I work for one of the McKinney Texas stores and in May 2015 he will have 5 employees quitting. That leaves him with himself and his asst manager left on the staff unless he hires others quickly.  Starting pay is $8.45 and they can only work cashier's 20 to 25 hours per week as per Murphy rules"
bad,"A typical day at work includes a great many cleaning and maintenance duties as well as customer service and cashiering duties. I learned about daily accounting, managerial duties, and several cleaning responsibilities that I didn't think would be part of my job. The managers were very professional with me to the point of cool. My co-workers were fun and hard working. We always managed to get our jobs done. The hardest part of the job was having more responsibilities than time in a shift to accomplish them. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers who were always friendly and pleasant."
bad,"There was plenty of room for advancement up to assistant manager and then you were stuck. A small staff meant a lot of overtime and not a lot of help from your team. If your manager was not a good one, you really had no one to help remedy the situation."
bad,The Manager promise me a chance to get promoted and started training me then hire a assistant manager instead
bad,"Murphy USA has great staff but has the worst and the lowest customers. While I worked here for around 3/4 months I was threatened by several customers and there were several days where I feared for my life. Don’t do it, most fast food will pay more than this terrifying job."
bad,The store manager abused her authority in every way possible and once I started addressing her on it with me being the shift leader she found a reason to terminate me.
bad,"This company schedules you 8 0r 9 hours, in this time you Don't get a lunch break nor a 15 minute break. You are scheduled usually alone. You are required to stand the entire time on concrete and often times do not have a fatique mat . They say they don'tt have to give you a lunch break because it is not required by law in the state of Texas.. Well, it may not be a law but it should be of a human. Moral care that you allow an employee at least a. Meal break.  I was appaled at this company."
bad,They are a fast paced company.  I would work 12hr shifts and not get a break or lunch.  They dont really care what is going on in your life they just want a body in that position.
bad,"Easy job, no one wants to go above and beyond. If you try and do more than given then people will dislike you. I recommend if you're complicit with doing nothing."
bad,"As a cashier I wasn't receiving any benefits which is expected. However, they did take away the one program that would help me pay for college. A typical day at work was checking out customers among other duties like cleaning, and stocking. The management in the beginning was ok, not the best. Overtime it grew better with a new manager on board. The other staff was friendly and we got along well."
bad,The store manager and district manager are preferential to certain races. Unless you are a certain color you probably won't be hired. The store I'm referring to is the Northside of town. NOT the other store in town.
bad,"The job was very demanding and the shifts usually leave you by yourself to struggle, everyone just looked out for themselves. The hardest part of the job was taking checks since you had to input everything manually and your line would build up."
bad,"Need better management as well as security for the safty of the workers there are too many dangers out in the world for the employees to face as they are working people coming behind the counter taking thing and for the manger so say things like ""dont call the police call me im your manager you do what i say"" is a disgrace to the companys name i would love to work for the company again but feel as the management wouldnt care for my safty only the merchandise and a price tag."
bad,It was a lot of hard work but I pushed my way up to the top from a cashier to a assistant manager until I was running the whole store seven days a week by myself with a 2 to 3 crew.
bad,"Murphy Usa doesn't appreciate it's employees, they can't keep ppl because of poor management and lack of respect. The person you relieved never completed there task, so you were left to do them plus your own."
bad,It was a great job at first until theu started taking advantage. They ask A LOT of you. I worked with two hours of sleep sometimes because id close then open. I was let go over a on the job injury now my manager is lying about it. Many people quit regularly so it was just my manager and I. You are basically cohersed into doing a lot of things for the store that you shouldn't do.
bad,I would never recommend anyone work for this company. There is no opportunity for advancement or hours. The management is the worst. It is a very stressful yet easy job.
bad,I worked for Murphy for 2 years. Got promoted to manager but didn't receive my 2 year raise. Good for a part time job. Not a good career choice. If you didn't do things right by the book. They will find anyway to fire you.  No breaks or any type of discount.
bad,It was very fun learning the atmosphere of this type of work place. The one thing that bothered me about the whole experience was the late night shifts.
bad,"Working here was an experience, I mean there was some crazy rush hours and moments where you were looking for customers to come in lol. There were crazy customer and there was really sweet customers. That's with every job though."
bad,The company it self is not too bad. I think there a little cheap on raises but they gotta make money just like me. It was more management. Unless your one of the pets your 100% still not good enough. There was two shift leads but only one of us really did are job while the other got prime shift and got away with not doing all choirs. Just the ones that person choose to do. A lot of favoritism.
bad,I was able to work alone and at my own pace. I learned how to be a good leader. I trained most of the employees. Learning new faces each day is what made me enjoy working.
bad,Lack of leadership. While I worked there we did not have a steady manager in the 6 months I worked there our manager was changed 4 times. Hours were not steady.
bad,At the orange location there would be a lot of traffic during my shift and I would close. I would have to restock the coolers and the wall throughout the shift. The inside of the store could only fit the workers and it is really dirty it needs to be remodeled. The management would give good hours but other then that I was so confused. I wouldn’t go back here because we didn’t get a break even working 10 hours a day. The coworkers was not the ideal coworker if you know what I mean. If you want to make some quick money then yes I would try it.
bad,I enjoyed working with the other employees and management. The main downfalls were the hours which you had to be there and the fact there was no set schedules.
bad,This job was terrible. No help. No benefits. People were constantly lying to keep themselves out of trouble just to get another person in trouble. All in all I would not suggest this job.
bad,it's an ok place to work if you want to work overnight all the time and have no life..you pretty much work 7 days a week. the best thing about the job is the customers
bad,"Look for a different job! Look for a different job! There's better out there. Look for a better job!!! Life is way too short to work here, trust me you can do better."
bad,"The location I worked at is a shady area. Too many drug addicts come in go, creepy people, too much equipment failure, scheduling is awful, this location is beyond help"
bad,"This is a temporary job until I can find something closer to home. "
bad,"I have been with the company for 8 months and the reason is, in hindsight, it is a easy place to work. However, this company is one of the cheapest companyies to work for. Management say they care for our future and well being but when wanting to advance was turned down for have ""no experience"" dispite hiring/ future hiring a non-experienced assistant. The company also have no sympathy for their employees. Not only do they work managment to  unhealthy levels they also do not allow our human basic needs (such as sitting, breaks, eating or a decent wage to live off). This company is souly for customer needs which is not a bad thing however, the reason why it has such a high turn over/ no one wants to work with the company is because of the way they treat their employees. We are all just numbers and promotional seekers."
bad,"Murphy's was a crazy busy job. One person working at a time, but there was so much going on that you never had a chance to breath. The coolers needed stocked, but in order to do that you actually had to leave your work station and become nearly unseen. But the customers rarely ever stopped coming, so there was no 'safe time' to do this."
bad,the culture changed and the management is all from dollar general.  it is no longer a fun  place to work with teamwork and people matter. its all about managing to stay off the reports ..
bad,"I run register, take trash out and clean the one bathroom.. and you've gotta be able to all of it in between customers. Multitasking is the main key.."
bad,The job in itself was not to bad . It was very steady paced once again the employee did not want to work there shifts they also didnt want to do there duties. So it made it very hard for the ones of us who did.
bad,It was a good  and easy jobs only benefit was that my management was amazing. The pay is low and working alone at a gas station with no security is kind of a high-risk job
bad,Murphy USA was probably the worst job I've ever had. I was constantly picking up other peoples shifts because nobody ever wanted to show up to this place.
bad,"Not allowed to sit or take a break during an 8-10 hour shift. "
bad,They believe customers over their employee without looking into it farther.
bad,"Turnover is high because the pay is so low, even though the hours are really flexible. Not everyone is held to the same expectations and that makes staying difficult as well"
bad,I worked alone most of my shifts busy or not. Days I requested off didn't get them. The promotions employees get need to be handled differently to get a raise. I have 10 years in convenience store experience I had to quit 4 25-cent raise and I never went back
bad,"Over the six years I was there, the company went from a great place to work with a wonderful atmosphere to place you have to watch your back.  You maybe told that they need to bring people in with talent, but that's what they told everyone else.  "
bad,"Positions are fast-paced, low paying, and stressful.  The customers tend to be very rude, which mentally wear on you, but the company demands every customer be treated as if they are ""royalty""."
bad,"They hired an assistant manager who didn't know how to speak to employees under her as SOON as she was given that role. I worked graveyard & the manager said Murphy's does not allow employees to call law enforcement when you have ANY type of situation with the public. Being a female & working 10 pm-6 am with all types of people out at night & saying this is ridiculous. There was a man standing in the woods rocking back & forth screaming to himself & starts running towards you while you're spraying the parking lot, but please don't call law enforcement & continue your outside duties. Also, you're responsible for being written up due to no pay drive off customers for post pay gas pumps. Oh, lets not forget the men who pull out private parts while you're in the kiosk. Don't call anyone on them either. No benefits/vacation for part time so why wouldn't your employees half tail their work when the companies only offer part time for cashiers to avoid providing benefits. So why would we care about your company if your company doesn't care about us. It was several times I thought my check would be a certain amount, but it always seemed to be way less than the hours I worked."
bad,"The Manager and Assistant manager constantly talked behind each others back, trying to get the other Fired, when they both deserve to be fired for there actions, stealing, writing store items off when they should pay for them, I don't understand how a Large Company like Murphy hangs onto people like that, so many Cashiers had Quit due to the problems and lack of Management duties."
bad,"Work life and home life balance it's completely out of whack, managers are pretty much on call 24/7. You're required to work 50 hours a minimum a week, there have been numerous occasions where I have worked 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. without a break. DM's do not care about management"
bad,"McDonald's is one of the largest restaurant food chian,but it pays it's salaried employee on the lower end buget and it has no benefits for crew , plus it has no vacation time for crew members."
bad,"I really enjoyed working for my specific store manager, but the company as a whole needs some help. Hopefully things have changed since I worked there, but I was almost always (and I mean 99% of the time) the only one working at the time. This included during deliveries and late-night hours. There were multiple times when I had to call the police because of people in the parking lot at closing time when I was there alone. My store manager asked repeatedly for extra hours for the store so that she could have two people at night, but was constantly denied. There were multiple times where I had to work double shifts or on days that I'd requested/been approved off months in advance because of other workers not showing up. On those days, I would be the only one in the store for 12-14 hours. There isn't a lot of room for advancement, and the pay wasn't even enough to cover my basic monthly bills."
bad,Upper management changed over my career and made it hard to be successful because more duties were required but not enough labor allocated. On a typical day it was my responsibility to get the store opened and manage that all duties were complete.
bad,Long shifts...Stressful place to work...Being an Assistant you are put in middle of he said she said drama....No matter how hard you work...no call outs...dedicated employees get the worst shifts
bad,It was a job to have a job. Cashiers were kept at 25 hours max and pay was not great. Had to do everything outside even if weather was awful. No real benefits and had to struggle to get the 401k to rollover.
bad,It was a good place to work... they worked with my schedule very well and all the employees and managers were sweet I worked 3rd alone thats the only bad part bc it was a little scary with all the creepy men and women that came in i think they should have 2 ppl on 3rd
bad,You will not get that many hours for the work you have to do there. The management let us get away on phones. They sometime favor employee. Manager being lazy some
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone they are selfish with the hours they never switch up the shifts you Work to Hard for little pay you don’t get any breaks
bad,"I wanted 20 hours a week.  Was scheduled for either 30+ or less then 15 a week.  Because we were the training store, people were all trained differently depending on what store they were training for based on the intended managers specifications.  Not knowing this it caused a lot of confusion."
bad,"Working there, I loved my job. What I didn't love was being harassed by customers and my boss did not care. We were ALWAYS so busy and not given enough time to complete our sidework. We were always there by ourselves except for the one hour that we overlapped for the previous person to finish their outside work. Sometimes there was situations that didn't involve customers but they NEEDED your attention such as a pump acting up etc and you had to attend to the customers first. I felt as if there should be someone to take care of the outside duties so the cashier could focus on the customers more. My manager was very unprofessional. The workers are unprofessional. Other than that the company is a great company. Can't say that for the employees...sad sad."
bad,"lazy employees"
bad,"Customers are rude, hours are being cut, home office wants 1 person there most of the time meaning no help, no stocking or cleaning. The store is too busy for one person. Job is stressful. And no breaks. Management is the best part of the job."
bad,"Too much work for the worst pay and not so great treatment. The Site I worked at was mainly women and we had to do it all from cleaning garage, running off the homeless, and even fixing the freaking pumps ourselves. The team was not balance and for a supervisor making only $9 a hour it was very diminishing for my effort and skills."
bad,"The company was in such a crunch for hours when I worked there that there would be days that I would work 12 hours and then days that I would only work 4. the schedule was very inconsistent and there was no available over time in the entire time that I worked there even though it was very desperately needed. I loved my manager that I worked for she was very helpful and very good t teaching me what I needed to learn,"
bad,"Customers are incredibly rude and if you're not a smoker you don't get a break. also, taking a mandatory call every week gets old quickly, especially when you're not trained properly and have zero knowledge of what was being discussed."
bad,"I was always picking up the slack my coworkers left."
bad,"This company doesn't worry about its people. It's all about the money. The district manager of the site I was at, let the power go to his head. He didn't have a compassionate bone to him."
bad,"It is a very fact pace working environment.  You have to deal with different customers, some irate, treating with them kindness regardless of how they treat you.  Your full attention is demanded and expected at all times.  Standing position, no sitting.  No breaks or meal breaks at all.  You are required to stock coolers, product, etc, everyday, every shift.  Work alone.  DM micromanages all aspects of the store.  Every decision that you made has to be discussed and explained.  If DM does not like explanation, you receive a counsel.  Unless you are the SM, do not expect a raise.  Very rare.  DM expects ""perfection"", her exact word."
bad,"The company doesn't care about the employees, only the circle of stars (which is monthly promotions). If you call human resource on management they will ""investigate"" but will always side with management. You have no time at home with your family. They've started paying a little better but that's because if you're not management you only get 15 to 25 hours a week. You work by yourself but you are responsible for all of the cleaning and taking care of the customers."
bad,"I had put my two weeks in at my other job to go to this one due to what the manager had told me my schedule would be like and she was willing to work with me on knowing what I needed and when I got over there, she told me that things change and that she couldnt keep to anything she said, so i had to leave ."
bad,"The company values its customers way more than its employees unless you are a store manager.  The work environment could be very hostile at times.  The store manager was very intimidating, would use foul language in order to communicate, and purposely do things as a way of retaliation if she was mad at you simply because she could.  On the other hand, the job itself was not hard at all and it's decent pay if you are a member of management.  Each store manager is different so other locations may be more pleasant to work at."
bad,Murphy USA does not value it's employees or Managers at all. You never know if you are going to have a job or not and it doesn't matter if you have a family at home or not.
bad,"Due to lack of organization an excellent management skills an knowing how to treat the employees that do work inside the stores it was a fair place, i dont have good reviews because of the hire an fire at will thing in Georgia an they hired a whole new team bc of their store manager which had nothing to do with anyone else except the manager themself an the victimized employee."
bad,Seems that the company is doing well financially but lacking in culture and leadership.  Tremendous amount of change as the company grows and contributes to the large turnover numbers.
bad,"I loved my job, but the management was horrible. I was always working alone graveyard all while trying to stock from the back of the store and watch the front. I never really had help from the other shifts. I immediately had to start stocking as soon as I clocked in."
bad,Good place but need better mangament. Poeple keep messing with my register. My hours were not constant . Always work on weekends. The job was good in the beginning.
bad,"Management was great. great part time job, great location very busy store. a lot of side work moping, emptying trash, filing water buckets, cleaning bath rooms, changing gas paper registers and run cash register."
bad,"Fast paced job, very busy, worked very early hours and late hours."
bad,I worked there for 3 years. Had only one pay raise. The only way I could make more money was to move up. In order to move up you had to have valid driver's licenses. I totally disagree with that if another employee calls in you gotta find someone from another store to come cover they shift.
bad,I truly enjoyed the customers i would help daily! The store was easy to upkeep and maintain throughout my shift and the job itself was pretty laid back and self explanitory. The most difficult part of the job was probably dealing with the other employees not doing their job and having to always pick up their slack cause they never seemed to be held accountable.
bad,a typical day at work is fun. i always got along with my co workers. we talked about everything with each other. i learned how to maintain my composer and not get overwhelmed with pressure with a busy day. the hardest part of the job was to be outside in the cold for four hours at a time. the most enjoyable part of the job is not just something i doing there but the fact that i loved my job and my customers and most of my workers.
bad,"Didn’t get paid enough to do all they wanted you to do. The building AC didn’t work good and they didn’t try to replace it. Therefore, it will be hot in the summer. For regular cashiers, they don’t believe in giving you your hours. Don’t believe in raises. Management is lazy"
bad,I hated I got into a disagreement with my manager but it was either me or her she was rude she cursed me out and she threaten me. Management was poor because there was favoritism and the general manager didn’t mind he behavior
bad,"No Hours along with no raises! Was there for 6 years and worked my butt off more than any other employee and went from 9- 10.50 IN 6 YEARS!!! You will have to scrub cement once a week, mop pump pads,  change gas filters (while dealing with register),  pick up after other employee ( no store discipline), they make you use a blower on parking lot ,  and they make you do all outside labor by yourself yet they expect AMAZING customer service (mind you to get one thing done takes 30- 1h to do in between customers)."
bad,It's an ok place to work with low gas prices and good snack deals. Some of the stores should have bigger parking lots . The kiosk stores should have more pumps.
bad,Can only clock in five minutes before the start of your shift and when that happens you have to clock out 5 minutes early. The manager is a great guy but his boss does not do the company justice.
bad,"The manager picked and chose who she liked, I asked for days off due to me moving into a new place and to get my son, the overall thing I liked about working there was seeing new people,"
bad,Dont get me wrong I enjoyed working with my employees and interacting with the customers; but the store manager didn't know how to schedule. She had me closing at 12 at night and opening at 6 am. When I need her advise she never was there.
bad,"awesome management, and a lot of customers that you had to attend to on a daily bases. Not enough to make a leaving since I was living on my own"
bad,"Have better staff member and have a better manager ,teach employee instead of telling them just do it on your own and teach them about the Powerball method"
bad,I enjoyed the coworkers and the customers but that's about it.
bad,They provide part-time hours and are somewhat flexible depending on the manager.  The upper management doesn't much care for lower employees as much as they say they do and managers just act petty towards other managers.
bad,Over all great place to work if you love to stay busy! But they let me go because “I wasn’t capable of working the register and lottery at the same time” it was my first day by myself and they only gave me 8 hours of training! I actually did good! Only issue I had was closing and that was because a worker misplaced the keys to lock it up.
bad,"It's an ok job but it does pay accordingly. The amount of work and how stressful it is, is what makes the job not desirable. There is no overlap in shifts so you are required to do a lot of outside work while still running a register inside as well."
bad,I was offered a shift lead position right before I was robbed at gun point. They told me to take a few days off.  3 days later I said I was ready for the next schedule. When I called to get it; I wasn't even on it. I really liked it. So sad.
bad,"Overall it's a mediocre place to work for. My biggest complaint is they (corporate) wants you to jump through hoops for minimum wage. The worst part is there are no scheduled breaks so you're on the clock for your entire shift and you have to be working that entire shift. To add to that, it's always one person running an entire shift alone."
bad,"Fast paced environment, have to be a fast learner. Handle money, provide customer service, sales, cleaning. Friendly staff. Hardest part of job is being there so much, not a lot of family time."
good,All they pay is minimum and when I was promoted to assistant manager I was at 10 and they lied to me I was at $11. Very unprofessional and do not help you if you have children. The store manager there was also very unprofessional with the cashiers and would not act like a manager. Also overwork you with no type of rewards to keep your drive into going to work.
good,"Murphy USA is a great place to work if you are not in the North Alabama Area. DM of this area takes all the life out of you. She is fake and takes her job to the extreme. She doesn't accept anything but perfect, and we all know nothing is perfect all the time. There is no forgiveness for mistakes you just lose your job. There is no recognition for a job well done, just repercussions for things that aren't perfect. I have talked to several Managers outside of this North AL district and they are perfectly satisfied with their job and are not treated like explained above."
good,The job is very fast paced and could get stressful at times. Being the only one running the store leaves little to no room for mistake. Being quick and multitasking is a plus.
good,"The district manager was a dunce who only like employees that praises her laziness .If you where her favorite she’ll make sure you get your vacation time and days you requested off. She was biases and lazy, she waited to the last minute to do her quarterly inspections. Even though I was the number one store in her district she never gave me the respect that I earned within the 3 years of working at the store."
good,Once printed to store manager any other higher management would tell you what needs to be done but then when you would ask for assistance they would tell you to figure it out
good,"A kiosk versus an actual store setting - very different. Independent work versus having a co-worker"
good,My manager Tasks was a pain in the neck she over worked you ... and acted like she was in high school pinning each cashier against each other ... the best part about the job was the friendly faces ... she also over worked you with little to no break times ... the job it self was pretty easy
good,"I like working there but you cant speak to the cashiers with out an argument being started. Other than that its a great place the store manager is amazing always willing to help "
good,"Murphy USA was my first real job, I was there almost a year. I expressed several times as to how I wanted to move up in the company. However the DM had no plans of me being able to move up or advance. Several times I worked more than anyone else at the store as we were a store of 2-3 employees. There is no room for growth here."
good,The manager is not understanding at all & they are very understaffed. You can be sick & call in hours advanced nope they don't care. Even if you in the hospital they don't care. They have you doing duties the manager suppose to but don't want to give you the pay.
good,"This is a very busy fast pace work place, which I did like because your shift passes quickly and you meet a lot of people. However I believe they could be better to their employees."
good,This type of job requires a lot of balance between family. Working hard to keep a job is very important. Assistant Managers are suppose to help in anyway and not when they want too.
good,"An overall day was busy, rushed and not enough man power. Sometimes we had good customers. We really made money. I learned to be multitasked and self sufficient."
good,"Ok job as long as everyone pulls their weight. Can be very stressful when busy, and working alone. Not enough hours given to get things done. A lot of work compared to amount of pay"
good,Love working with people but management is under qualified. The job is not hard and the customers love having someone to joke with. The staffing is not set for peak customer business.
good,"There is no real opportunity for advancement within the job. It feels as though you need to be a puppet on a string for them to use. If not you're basically thrown to the wind. The Managers seem good on the surface, but they don't care about the betterment of their employees. They'd rather you be put into a self sustaining system of failure then do anything that could better the job overall. The saving grace of the job is that the Fellow employees are kind and understanding."
good,Work alone most of the time running inside and outside.  Kiosk is a box that no one can enter.  stocking is done between customers and a busy store.  coolers and stocking are all outside.
good,"In my time with the company, i was pretty much made to feel as though i was last resort for position. Feel as though, i don't ever do enough and am not a good fit for the job. i am told it is my business but am not allowed to treat it as such."
good,Murphy's is ran poorly. The pay isn't worth the stress of work life. No breaks. Pay is very low. A typical day at Murphys would include but not limited to doing all the managers work and have little to no days off.
good,"Great place to work as a regular employee, BUT DO NOT EVER WORK AS A MANAGER. Way to much work for the pay. Impossible requirements issued to managers. More and more added without addition labor hours added to complete them."
good,"Murphy USA a whole is a decent company, when it comes to working with management, it takes a turn, very poor management along with very poor training."
good,"The upper management is not really helpful from my 7 years of experience with this company. There is no work life balance as a manager is on call 24/7 so therefore a life outside of this position is nearly impossible as your immediate manager calls you whether it is your day off, vacation, etc.. and demands things from you. The most enjoyable part of my jobs is my employees and my customers. I have worked at other corporations and I have yet to be employeed by a company like this"
good,"I love the customers and the fast paced environment, that is the best part of the job. I frequently run into upset customers due to the lack of organization and orders being placed. We are constantly running out of frequently sold items such as: Cups for fountain drinks, receipt paper for the pumps and safe for nightly shift reports, cigarettes, chewing tobacco, cleaning supplies such as, dish soap,  sanitizer, and toilet bowl pods. The manager is very poor at working with you to meet the needs of your schedule, the manager puts their needs and. Personal life before the company and most employees. Very poor place to work."
good,"Easy place to work, loved it when I first started. New management came & took all my hours, they try to find every little thing to write you up for, I’d suggest trying quicktrip or racetrack before you apply here"
good,"As a cashier at Murphy's there is a lot going on or nothing going on. It seems that whenever there is a lot going on you are always by yourself. At the time I left the company had changed policies, meaning that each location was allotted an amount of hours for its workers depending on the traffic they received. It was entirely awful considering that there are many needy customers (lottery players) that require a lot of time and patience (teaching the elderly how to pump gas) and there is a lot of upkeep that should be done, but isnt because there is not enough time where there is more than one person around to get it done"
good,Great customers but poor management and a bit of a risk working there alone at night without security..................................................
good,I liked the job  till the company fired the manager and I got rob but they still would not get two people on the late shift. After all the happened. the management went down hill from there
good,"Worked hard, with no recognition, expected more from you than should have been expected, lack of upper management support, could have been a good with the right support system"
good,"Favoritism, no room for advancement no matter how hard you try to prove yourself worthy and surpass sales challenges. Someone calls out, you're running the store by yourself with irate customers."
good,It was overall a nice place to work at but as far as benefits wise to make a long time career out of working here wasn't enough to stay knowing i wouldn't get any benefits or 401k working there.
good,"The amount of work is very high for an individual. There are to many managers and not enough employees. The lead manager makes you feel threatened. He uses words like ""you have a target on your back"" instead of taking the time to try and fix things or let you know specifically what he would like differently."
good,Need a lot of teamwork and trustworthy management I feel like they only see your hard work later down the line then afterwards you might get awarded but they quick to get rid of you
good,head manager needs to better manage them self always late sitting down never helping cleaning stocking putting up truck to the employees and asstmrg get no credit for the hard work. also 15 mins to open and do your counts etc
good,It was an ok job. Management was very unprofessional. I meet some great people while employed there. The job itself was not bad. Just couldn't understand how their managers handle certain situations.
good,Being employed with Murphy was not the greatest. Management was always an issue & there was no teamwork among the coworkers. The company itself isn’t horrible but you don’t really get a break and I worked in a kiosk so I thought we should be allowed to at least have a stool or something. We didn’t get any discounts on anything being we weren’t able to have a break maybe a bag of chips or something
good,When it comes to this place you will work your behind off and do everything right but when you need some flexibility it is not given and they basically make it to where you want to quit!
good,"Much is expected with not enough opportunity to complete it, simple tasks like restocking coolers or throwing out trash or even small little cleaning up seems impossible at times when it is just one employee and or closing shifts"
good,"i learned a lot it's great it's a great environment to work in because i love the people who i work with. Management is awesome but we need to have monthly store meetings, that's ll i would say about that"
good,It’s s good place to work I loved my manager and hated to leave. I’d still be there if I didn’t have to move it broke my heart having to leave the way I did I miss my manager and probably made it where I’m not rehirable witch sucks I’d go back in a heartbeat
good,"Murphy was a Oka job jus came with a lot of stress no breaks, if no one showed up it was always left up to employees to figure it out, management was suppose to cover if no one showed up but they never wanted to"
good,Management only did something when it was known that big bosses were coming to the store. Other than that they did bank runs and sat in their car. Or on their cell phone.
good,My initial manager was the best but transferred and my second manager was extremely difficult to work for and not flexible at all when I took another full time job and was willing to stay part time.
good,"currently under new management, old store manager was a tool. district manager cares nothing for the adrian location. really sad. great customers and great employees have been hurt too much from store 6649"
good,"A good place to work , must have a very reliable team to have that life balance. There are daily performance evaluations and they have a clear roadmap on how to get the job done. Your flexibility  plays a very big part on the job."
good,"The Store manager didn't hold all employees to the same expectation levels. My role in the store was overnight cashier, clean the store, stock the coolers, inside and outside. The SM did a horrible job at enforcing to other employees that they are suppose to stock and clean as well. Not sit behind the cash register and do nothing. The SM was immature and wasn't a good fit for manager. Each employee has a daily list to get done, he didn't enforce that list at all. Pay wasn't good neither were there any benefits."
good,"it  starts as a good place to work, then your manager starts complain about everything, and nothing you do makes her happy, no matter how hard you work or how hard you try i was happy working there, until she turned into a witch"
good,It's a fun work enviorment to work we all get along there and we work as a team and get things finished and solved it's really not horible u have to be a saleman
good,"They expect work to be done with no help, no breaks, all by yourself, and you arent allowed to sit at all. The job is ideal for a part time for extra cash but not worth it to try to live off of. The stressful fast paced environment makes for alot of headaches an an overall mental health hard to manage. The managers have such a high turn over rate you will almost never see consistency. There is no stable schedule and every employee is expected to be on call. There is no discount given to employees and there isnt even a place to make your food. No fridge (unless you count the coolers) no microwave, anything. The place is so small and so cramped, if your claustrophobic then stay away. They change policies and procedures so often you never know what to expect. Overall I do not recommend anyone to work here unless it's part time and isnt your steady income."
good,There's things that need changed. They only trained me for 3 days and expected me to do everything on my own perfectly so they fired me saying that I didn't understand anything but I did. So they need to train longer then 3 days and give a chance to make it work instead of firing someone just out of the blue.
good,Store Manager called off repeatedley and always found a way to get as long as a week off work...only had 3 employees at one time and one of the employees was only part time because he had another job. So another employee as well as myself were working 7 days a week and working alot of double shifts!
good,"Working for murphy""s was a good experience at first but when the management and assists manager took thing to a whole other level with me and i was fired because of a simple mistake i felt it was wrong and i would love my job back but under a different manager. Also the district manager wasn""t as helpful either to me when i went to her for help. She felt like it was my mistake as well and said i was too old for coming to her the way that i did."
good,"The work and personal life balance is a joke. You don't have a life if your full-time employment, causes problems in your personal life. You might as well be single to be full time with this company, part time employees are only garaunteed 15 hours a week the most is 25 hours"
good,"Isn’t bad company to work for, if the management is fair. No set schedules, miss most holidays because they never close. Only has 3% raise. Money not worth list of tasks needed to be done. Kiosk formats don’t have flexibility with schedule."
good,The store manager was lacking due to some health issues.  It was also a bit dramatic at times with some employees.  They always focused on customers.  Many times would call store manager with no answer when a situation occurred after the scheduled hours of manager.
good,"I love meeting new people! I am a people person! I loved all of my regulars also. You can not have a life outside of working here. You are called in daily and sometimes work 16 hours straight with out any breaks. They do not promote with-in. They tell you when you are hired you will get travel pay for bank runs and surveys, but when you don’t get it they use the excuse of “you have to be here for at least 6 months to  qualify”. They tell you your getting a raise and then say HR has to approve it! Then again “you have to be here for at least 6 months to qualify”.They are always have a excuse for everything.You have to travel daily to the bank and run your surveys daily tho. You don’t get any benefit. You don’t get any discount either. Their is a lot of side work you have to do alone and checking out customers at the same time. They make you travel to other stores when people call-in, if you don’t you will get bad hours. Manager refuse to work nights."
good,"Working for Mountaire you'll learn something everyday, it'll be either scale, cutting, weighing, or even computer skills. Very nice management teams and everyone works together."
good,"As a store manager, I regularly have to work 70-90 hour weeks with months in between days off, when I did have a day off employees and the district manager would call or text at least once per hour starting at 6am-11pm. There is no time off period."
good,I work the overnight shift I stay busy with all of my tasks some of which other shifts could probably do but do not they put all the workload on the overnight but then offer no compensation for your hard work. the customers are great I love the regulars I see them everyday but the assistant manager is the worst she puts herself on a pedestal management is aware of her situation but does nothing about it and I have repeatedly let them know my concern.
good,"With the pay this company offers, it’s just another job for me and others. Far too many tasks to complete and the pay does not compensate your effort."
good,In the beginning I had a blast I absolutely loved my job! After the robbery I was always scared to be at work and even more terrified to run the store by myself. But overall its a great place to work. Wrong environment for the employees.
good,"I currently work here, and there is no breaks, hard to request time off, had to change my availability and had gotten denied for it, managers leave early all the time but then complain because you didnt get your work all done."
good,"Pay was low for the area, especially for a supervisory position with all the responsibility and none of the credit of a store manager. The acting store manager was difficult to work and commumicate with to say the least but she was inexperienced and had the same position I did and was just the acting manager temporarily and I dont judge the company on her performance or management or I'd give it 0 stars."
good,"You work any hours, People call in and late with no consequences, no breaks of any kind. no training period, not allowed to protect yourself in a dangerous situation."
good,"The service station is a very busy place. It is affiliated with WalMart therefore it catches a lot of the customers from the store. It entails more than just standing at a cash register. Stocking, knowledge of gas pumps and there weekly maintenance is a must."
good,It is a chaotic place at times. The company controls hours and the hours allotted are not hardly enough to get all the task they want done completed. The increases that have been made in sales have not added additional hours.
good,"I loved the job, Needed better manager. They need to do a better job of putting in place managers that will keep the company going, not bringing it down."
good,"Great place if still in school or busy schedule not enough hours if you have bills to tend to, would most definitely need other income besides MurphyUSA."
good,When I got to work I had to count my drawer and threw out the night I would have to stock the coolers and candy and at the very end of the night I had to count the ciggerates. the hardest part of this job was stocking the coolers cuz you would have to multitask because you would be the only one there and the stuff to restock is in a shed behind the building so to do all that you have to watch for cars and then if no one is there stock the coolers. I enjoyed working there because I was able to interact with people.
good,"A very face paced environment that keeps you on your feet. I clock in and begin assisting my customers. During my down time, I stock and clean the store. I'm responsible for multitasking which includes: cleaning the pumps, eximoing the parking lot, spraying the parking lot, cleaning the pump pads, cleaning the outside and inside of coolers, cleaning the oil bins, refilling the window washing tubs, sweeping the parking lot, dusting the products, cleaning the vents, and stocking cigarettes and other items. The hardest part is being alone in the store late at night, and having to go outside late to clean the restroom. The enjoyable part is that I've always enjoyed working with any type of computer."
good,"To be honest Murphy probably would fit a person that's fresh out of high school, someone that's looking for a part time job or just want to stay occupied. It's possible to move up in the company but you have to relocate. I don't like the fact that worker can't get overtime. You have to stand as long as your working. There's no lunch break which is crazy. I mean how do they expect their workers to function especially if their constantly moving around."
good,"This would probably be a better fit for a high school kid, or someone fresh out of school. I however did not like this type of work at all. The 'rules' seemed to change daily, as did the required duties. Too much flip flopping for me."
good,"I needed a second job, so I decided to try Murphy USA. I was hired on the spot! Management was nice during the training, once training was complete everything turned sour. The manager barked orders. I did everything I was supposed to do, above and beyond, and it still wasn't enough. Don't let anybody drive off. Be attentive. Keep your supplies stocked. If you're good at multitasking and working a shift by yourself, this could be the job for you."
good,"The job was underwhelming, too many expectations in one shift with little pay compensation, only one person on shift at night in our town (I had a guy show back up after hours and sexually harass me in the parking lot)"
good,While I don't claim to be perfect by any stretch this company was very cut throat. You lived and died by who liked you and whether you made any waves.
good,"Constant incoming and out going traffic. Diverse customer experiences. Store maintenance. Loss prevention methods always utilized. Store audits and report checks. Lot safety checks. Shipping, receiving and ordering of inventory. Employee management and customer service. Product displays and monthly store marketing set ups. Cash handling."
good,In all honesty I should have left when the new manager showed up. I believe my hours are being shaved...You work the hours nobody else wants. You take up everybody else slack.
good,Loved it until i was left in training to manage a store by myself. The other employees never wanted to come in on time and nothing was done about it until i was gone. Luckily the managers around the area in other stores are helpful.
good,It's very possible that the area I worked in was not a fit for me because instead of advancement I was moved to a store that I was guaranteed to fail.
good,"I love working with the store manager! She is absolutely the best! Makes work fun and is super compassionate! Work is always something new, easy to do."
good,When I worked their it wasn't what i thought it would due to the fact i had a gm that flirted with his workers and called it a family relationship. So  I felt iI was walking on egg shells trying to keep my job. I love the customers the most it was a wonderful experience for me.
good,"You start as cashier. Unfortunately, as a cashier you are only part-time, with no opportunity for full-time unless you advance to assistant manager and higher. The pay is decent, but because of the lack of hours for cashiers and the amount of time between raises, it's nothing."
good,"I loved the customers, they made the job much better. Very quick paced so you won’t be bored. You don’t get breaks though, even if you work a nine hour shift. The management was terrible. In the 2-3 weeks I was there (I quit) 5 other people had also left the company. I’ll miss the customers the most but I had to leave."
good,"Worked as a drive reward agent in the NCC, job was easy. Horrible management...supervisor engaged in unethical behaviors, if you are not loud and obnoxious , and do not gossip, or talk dirty, you will not fit in this culture, if you carry yourself in a professional manner and others feel threatened they will sabotage you to ensure that you do not advance."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job for three years. Most of the long term higher ups left due to the company changing. The more new people they brought in, the worse it got. They cut our resources and consistently wanted more. It became dreadful."
good,"The problem is always not enough hours and employees for the store hours. Nobody should ever work alone at a gas station with 20 pumps , especially when some come on automatically."
good,If you don't have a life that involves plans u get along great they change my schedule  really all the time.  But other then that they have been great with me.  I just have kids and a life and I can't keep on doing this.
good,I liked the job. I got to meet a lot of interesting people. The pay is not bad. The people I worked with were very nice. The manager was very nice to work with.
good,a typical day comes with many tasks to complete within scheduled time having to upkeep your main area while having to go to complete duties that are at a distance. you have to follow policies based on training but at times get told to do things not per policy
good,"Nothing but a bunch of kids that ran the place. The GM is a great guy just gas no backbone and let's most of the employees be including his assistant manager just run over him and doesn't discipline/reward for actions or behaviour situations as accordingly. I left because all of the other employees pretty much bullied me or would make fun of or accusations about me to other employees, customers, and even other competing companies. No action taken so i got fed up and quit because all i did was come in every day bust my behind cleaning taking care of customers never called in late only once and not causing a hostile work environment but instead tried to embrace and engage in a more ""cool/chilled"" scenarios. Impossible at the store i worked at. Sad because didn't want to leave but got drove to the point of fed up."
good,My time at Murphy USA was enjoyable.  You had the opportunity to work at different stores when need.  Management was helpful. and they had a very good training program.  Working with the customers was a alot of fun.
good,"Typical workday starts at 3am. Daily inventory count of tobacco and lottery counts, calculating daily revenue, entering and submitting to home office, with numerous problem solving abilities throughout the day, along with mentoring, training, motivating, encouraging and monitoring of staff."
good,"a typical day at work included assisting customers with purchases and fuel, cleaning, and stocking merchandise. the most enjoyable part of the job was working alone because it is a kiosk."
good,"I worked nights, so it was always pretty dead, the managers come in at 530. You have to count cigarettes, make sure everything is ready for the next shift"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Murphy USA as a Manager, the downfall was staffing issues. With only 140 labor hours a week 50 of which I was required you have such a small crew and the turnover was always high."
good,Murphy USA was a good company to work for. I liked helping the customers as much as I could even if it was me fueling gas for a customer. I met allot of people working here.
good,"It's an okay place to work but they don't care what kind of education that you have and they don't care if you have a personal life. It's a great place to work if you are young, single, and don't have an advanced education. If you have a college degree they are paying less than the competition and they will work you all nights, closing, even if you have a family that you need to spend time with. I wouldn't recommend it if you want a life beyond work."
good,Working with customers was an experience of the supply and demands of peoples needs and wants teaches business ethics and responsibility on having integrity and character
good,"It is a very busy store,once we got our license to sell beer, we became more busy. I worked at the Springdale Store for 6 years and I got transferred to Bentonville where I worked for 3 years. Their was not an opportunity to advance, so I left."
good,"I liked my co-workers, but it is a bit stressful. It gets really busy, and it's hard to keep up with the amount of customers you get. Not to mention, there's not a whole room for advancement and the pay is low. You get a 25 cent raise every three months, but it's not enough for all the stress you have to deal with."
good,"it’s a cool job , but you don’t get enough hours to support yourself or anyone else in that matter. good part time job, it’s very easy to learn and catch on"
good,"I loved working for the company.  I loved all the customers as i am very customer oriented. Im definitely a people person.  Murphy usa drives sales and is customer based. Murphy usa does offer great benefits and comission as long as you're an assistant or higher.  You have the opportunity to move up the ladder easily. "
good,"Low pay, no discounts for employees, management made sure that you knew that they don't trust you. Fast paced environment, you only got  a 30 minute break and werent allowed to sit at all unless you were off the clock or in the bathroom."
good,"Working as cashier is a thankless position. You are working your shift alone and are expected to help customers, keep eye on fuel transactions, watch for drive offs without paying for gas. Also some products such as chips, candy, and soda are displayed outside so you have to try to watch them. The merchandise you have to stock is stored in other rooms outside the main customer area so you leave area unattented to deal with that. Have to constantly lock and unlock doors throughout shift. Also have to go outside to change trash and clean pumps and sweep lot. Everytime you do this your leaving the store unattended. No benefits not even employee discounts. Also uniforms are mandatory and you have to pay for them. All for $9/hr. After year of employment you qualify for 25 hours vacation time. Thats right 25. Only recommend if only job u can get or like me a second job. Also no kind of holiday bonus or anything. Fortune 500 company"
good,District manager does not care about employers safety. The pay is not worth risking your life. You will get over worked. There is no help sometimes. Poorly ran
good,"Murphy's is a hard, fast paced, demanding, and low compensation type of job. They require a lot of knowledge due to having to deal with fuel which is highly combustable. The pay for what you do does not even compensate for everything that is required of you. The customers are very rude and demanding in this type of business. They will also try to get over on you, you have to be able to stand your ground in this type of retail work."
good,"they only hire management as full time, theres no lunch break, you have to eat between customers, management was not flexible or encouraging, hours were not flexible"
good,"It was a very fast paced job. To much favoritism also"
good,The Company is too worried about contests and competition within themselves. They are not focusing on what need fixed or needed to be done to help the stores up and running like it should. There are lack of appreciation and principle on taking care of their employees.
good,It was okay for a job but you have to deal with rude customers and while I was working there it got robbed twice (once by an employee)  and while I was pregnant I told them I did not want to close by myself and they kept scheduling me to close so I eventually quit
good,"I was hired on around the same time the manager who hired me was getting promoted. Things happened so quickly that his replacement was not fully trained. Due to her inexperience and general attitude towards her employees, the turnover rate was exceedingly high. We ended up with a total of 3 employees and often needed help from other stores. Upon meeting the manager many employees from other stores refused to come back to help. The customers were my main motivation for staying. Diverse and kind"
good,I was scheduled part time when I applied. I was told I'd be working 20-25 hours a week. I was working 25-35 on a average week. I felt like I received little training and was left to figure out most of it on my own by trail and error. I enjoyed my co-workers and the customers but the store manager was very passive aggressive when correcting my mistakes. I quit in frustration due to being over scheduled and the poor attitude of management.
good,you are working 50-60 hours a week in a tiny box that the ac and heater don't work well in.  in the winter you are freezing to death.  you are also a pump mechanic?!?  kinda scary!!!
good,"Every shift must clean, stock and check bathroom. When I first started working there it was fun. I learned how to handle rude customers, but it is not a good place to work in with the current management."
good,"- Very busy"
good,"this job is very stressful and management is unfair give hours and shifts based upon friends,.Also there is only one person at all times no breaks. Pay is okay until a year then you have to wait another year to get a 25 cent raise."
good,Stressful and its no balance between work and home life. They expect your life to revolve around the store. If someone calls out you are pretty much obligated to stay over. You may work a 10 hour shift with no breaks.
good,Loved working with the public. But not the company. Plus I did not like how they trained their workers. They would only train their workers one day that's it
good,"I worked this job for almost two years, I enjoyed the customers, but the work environment is terrible. Who wants to work for a boss who is never happy?"
good,I spent 90% of my time at work. Schedule was mostly ok but there were several complications in making it and keeping it the same. Constantly felt used and overworked
good,"A typical day includes cleaning the store inside and outside, cleaning the restroom. replenished coffee machines and merchandise. maintained stock of tobacco products through daily inventory."
good,"Murphy USA is a great company to work for just no room for advancement. Seems to friends or family who receive promotions, Unable to get passed HR to advance."
good,The key to making this job successful is to have great assistants and good employees. You have to make sure that you manage you manage your time wisely. Failure to plan is planning the fail.
good,"On Friday, while at work I experienced two customers getting into an altercation and I proceeded to call the authorities and they didn't show until the situation was over and the customer had left the scene."
good,The hardest part of the day was dealing with the managers. They seemed so hateful. The best part was that during my shift which was 4pm to 12am they were leaving and I had the store to myself. I enjoyed my customers most of them were friendly and polite. My co-workers were crazy but in a good way. One thing I learned there well I didn't really learn anything. I knew what I was doing when I walked into the store and I know the same amount.
good,"Days at Murphys vary. Sometimes there are good days sometimes none! Rude customers can make you have a bad day,UNLESS you know how to deal with unruly people. I learned more about customers and customer satisfaction. Our manager is a good guy. He gets results! That's why people judge him as being mean or stuck up. But I think he is awesome. my co-workers are sometimes lazy. We are a running a business,we are supposed to be a team that works together. As far as a hard part of that job,there isn't one to me. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact with the different people that comes in and out. I love working with people."
good,"I was originally hired as the main Assistant Manager, but the General Manager changed her mind after hiring me. The Manager did a horrible job on showing me how to do the job, and when I had conflict with the other Assistant Manager she refused to help resolve the situation."
good,"Murphy's was a pretty good work experience, management could of been a tad bit better but other then that the co-workers and customer made the job worth having"
good,"good place to work. flexible hours, great coworkers, okay work environment, would recommend to anyone that needs a first time job. management works with you if you have any issues"
good,"I would've liked my job more had my manager been more professional. The assistant manager was pleasant and made work easier. Just as most jobs, regulars are a definite. The schedule is inconsistent but other than that, it's manageable."
good,But the back store room was a mess causing me to fall and got a huge bruise on my thigh that lasted months after. I told the manager at the time and she took her sweet time getting around to organizing the room. (Which I was told was her job)
good,It was a good company to work for initially.  I did grow with the company.  Just don't get sick.  They replace you if you go out on Leave.  That is all I want to say.
good,"As I first started out I loved it. Management was great & the customers were super nice, until they got comfortable. I was promoted without the higher pay because I still haven’t got my raise after 2 months. The other cashier hasn’t got his regular raise either. & when told to a manager, we still haven’t got it."
good,The company changed for the worse from the time I joined the team. The corporate office added more and more tasks to the managers and expected them the run the stores plus everything the district managers should have been doing.
good,"I met so many people from different backgrounds, generally worked shifts on my own once I was trained and enjoyed the high paced moments as well as the slow clean everything in sight momets"
good,Eh could use a different manager. And no favoritism we all grown but at the ens of the dat i just go to work and home  no time for drama which had already camd with the job in 4mos I been there.
good,"Its a fast pace work experiance with inconsistant hours but friendly staff. there are ample amount of breaks but there are no benifts for regular staff, just managment"
good,"responsible for inventories, scheduling, deposits, ,customer service. Responsible for maintaining  gas pumps, counting cigarettes each morning. Running register"
good,Everyday you start by counting your drawer. Then wait on costumers. If you work nights you had to cont the cigarettes by yourself. That was extremely stressful.
good,"It was a decent place to work. They want more from you than you get paid, but that is most customer service jobs. They do charge rent on uniforms and company jackets then you are required to return them at end of employment. "
good,I enjoying working her. I did not mind the work even though the work was tedious. Poor management while I was working there she was not flexible with my schedule
good,"Constantly have to work outside, if something breaks you have to trouble shoot the issue yourself until the company sends someone out to fix it in a couple of days."
good,"As a manager I expected back up and promises kept. Neither happened and when some of our vendors were not paid that should not have fallen on me. The people he had hired would barely show up for shifts and never on time, so I picked up all the slack and some were his friends so I had trouble terminating problem associates to get in people that really wanted to work."
good,"A typical day at work would include checking out customers, cleaning the restrooms, making sure the store stays clean,cooking food to place on the warmers, and stocking product. However, the worst part is that they stick you on a shift by yourself at night."
good,This job isn't bad for a kid out of high school etc. There isn't much advancement and most district managers don't care if your there or not. You are only a number to them and as long as you show up to work they usually leave you alone
good,"Loved my manager and Coworkers, bless their souls because they are some of the best people I have ever worked with but everything else about the job was terrible, the company, the customers, it was all just terrible."
good,Nights in the area I worked in were hectic. 600+ transactions as the only cashier and one cook in the deli. Has since then made it a policy for 4 people to be on all shifts.
good,I started off at this job as a cashier part time and it worked for me because they were more then willing to promote you. It's just when getting hiring into the company more bull comes out of course! My co workers for the most part were great. The company just doesn't really care about the little man (like any other company) If they paid attention to the cashier and Assistant managers other then giving everything to the GMs then it might be ok. But it really just depends on your particular store. Overall it wasn't all that bad!
good,required work is fairly easy. Customer service is a must to succeed. I was not impressed with management. Many of new hires seemed to think they didn't need to do work assigned. Hardest part was following incompetent people. Most enjoyable part was the customers that were regulars.
good,I had a long ride with this company and I probably will never go back due to management. The district manager acted like she was better than everyone else and belittled her cashiers.
good,"Overall not a bad company but the district I worked in was riddled with neglect and improper training. Theft, laziness, and one-sided stories will be the downfall of this business. I learned a lot while on the job and it had its benefits, but lack of authority shifted the ethics of my coworkers every three months when we would get a new manager."
good,"A typical day at work involved me clocking in and helping my co-worker quickly thinning out a lengthy line of customers that wrapped around the store. After the customers were taken care of, I would have my co-worker remain on their register while I would go into the back room for supplies that were nearly depleted throughout the day. I would then stock everything in the store if we had the product in store. The line would begin to grow again and I would pause what I was doing to help with the line again. This kind of work takes high levels of teamwork and communication skills as well as speed. "
good,Great place to get retail and cashier experience you really learn how to work with the public here lot of skills learned. And great place to take your knowledge and apply it to other places
good,With murphy you had to be on your toes . Costumers coming every second. You cannot mess up anything! You also had to deal with different attitudes. Checking in trucks and dealing with costumers at the same time. The managers was okay!
good,Murphy usa is an ok job. The pay is not great even when you become a store manager (around 35k a year) raises stop at 12.75 for assistants. One person or shift if you work in a kiosk so that means no lunch break or 15 min breaks either.
good,working with people was always a good thing everyone is happy and respectful but work here can be dangerous because the lack of security. And there was one person per shift
good,"I can have some really nice customer and than not so nice ones. there can be so drive offs and that it hard for the cashier. We work need to time between customer to eat, go to the bathroom, clean the store and stock it."
good,"Working there was an experience. I came and worked my shift and then I left. Everyday, like clockwork. People came and people left. Merchandise was exchanged."
good,"The customers were nice, always a lot to do. Had some slow moments depending on when you worked, some fast days as well. A lot of things to stock and clean."
good,I used to love working with Murphy until I relocated stores because no one else would. I changed places and worked as an assistant to the manager because no one liked her attitude and she had such big turn over. Her issue was her trying to befriend everyone and also trying to be their manager. She would sometimes get the two mixed and it caused many problems.
good,"taking care of customers and paperwork"
good,They pay you really good but they want you to be open availability. I had to leave because of the hours sometimes your working up to 18 days straight and some days 10 - 18 hours a day. No lunch breaks.
good,"If you want hours you need to work nights it seems. Tenure and work ethic means little. It seems if you are a woman with bad life choices, you are more apt to be promoted or given more hours even when being late or calling off. Not bitter just honest. Managers work very hard but need more training on hiring practices and maintaining loyal employees."
good,"I worked for the company for over 10 years. It was great company when I first started ,but I continued to see changes over the years that gave me concern. The company has great benefits  by offering tuition reimbursement,401k,and managers having holidays off and the pay is good for the most part, but not consistent across the board . They started changing the commission program which reduced the payout amount. The work life balance changed over the years which made things a little more stressful due to not having time for your personal life or the ability to take your vacation. What disturbed me most with the company is that I observed is that they started eliminated people from their positions to bring in new people and tried to hind it by saying everyone had moved on for better opportunities, but in fact they were asked to leave. The incorporated a culture change ,but forgot to implement this change to corporate office."
good,Atypical day at work for me was seeing all my regular customers with smiles on their faces ad great laughs. I learned a lot while working there. i more so learned more about people and what it's like to have to adapt to that kind of environment. Management was okay but there was lack of communication in some areas. I like the workplace culture but i didn't like being there alone by myself at night. There wasn't really anything hard about the job to me. The most enjoyable part of my job was the friends i made with customers.
good,The job can be busy and crazy at times but it can also be slow at times. Especially during bad weather and you are unable to go outside and do everything that needs to be done.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Murphy. Our team was awesome. My coworkers are friendly and dependable. I really loved being there, I just couldn’t keep working weekends and holidays"
good,"Me personally, I did enjoy this job until I ran into a snag. Be mindful of what you say and who you say it to. It's normal work drama but since its a much smaller staff than usual jobs, things get around quickly. Hours can be hit or miss. If you're obligated to work another job I would not recommend working here. They usually want people to work the closing night shift. It's really hard to work the day shift there."
good,"Good business with decent benefits.  You deal with a lot and have to take it all in fast, but all coworkers are willing to help whenever it is needed."
good,"It was nice working by myself but in customer service because I am better when alone. It's simple work and you can advance pretty easily. Hours were flexible, but getting the days off you want wasn't always possible."
good,A typical day at work is non-stop.  There is constantly a high volume of customers.  It is important to have strong communication and multi-tasking skills.
good,A typical day at work is non-stop.  There is constantly a high volume of customers.  It is important to have strong communication and multi-tasking skills.
good,"This is definitely that type of job if you have no life or have no other opportunities, by all means take it. Pay sucked as well as the hours. Not including the duties."
good,The typical work day begins before you get to work. Everyday you would have to run a fuel survey by physical driving to these gas station and checking the prices on the dispensers. Then count all the cigarettes on hand sometimes 5k to 10k packs of them. You do your morning paperwork while helping customer. Start you deposit for the bank while helping customers and enter your envoices from the day before and check the to make sure they were downloaded into the system. Then after the morning paperwork your are 100 percent engaged for great service. The hardest part of the day is the most enjoyable part of the day when all the customers come at once and you tried to make sure everybody gets a customer experience.
good,The biggest plus for Murphy USA is that I worked with some of the greatest people I have come across.  My entire team worked very closely and efficiently and respectfully with each other.  Due to a change in upper management the environment is changing but the people are still the same.  Still not a bad place just a different culture is developing.  I would do it again.
good,"While I loved the people I got to work with, I was often alone. When working there it is just me alone. The person before me clocks out and I clock in. 8 hours. No breaks, no time to go to the restroom. No time to eat. You just have to get things done. While I didn't enjoy it all too much, it was a great learning experience and I'm glad I have it done."
good,"Basically ran register, greeted your customers, cleaned and restocked your merchandise plus cooler. For the most part, it was enjoyable, nothing to hard about the job; just being able to be flexible and on call last minute."
good,it was ok. there wasnt really much room for advancement.  the management was ok.
good,"Its hard working for a company who doesnt look out for you or take care of you.. In any time that I needed help there was none.. I had to figure things out on my own because I wasn't trained properly.,"
good,"The location i worked at was very good location to get high sales, great people they always came into the store. Worked with great people, Wished they never fired the old DM, the new DM was not doing her job so it made it look like our location wasn't doing the job correctly."
good,Murphy USA was a good starting job for me. I was full time and in college. They always worked with my schedule. They have good benefits and always paid for overtime. The job is overall easy but you do have a lot of responsibilities
good,"Great learning job I learned how to deal wit customers , employees more better how to be a cashier and how to treat people with respect on a daily bases"
good,I would count Tobacco products when I first arrive. Stock any thing that's needs to be replaced. And checked on gas pumps when needed. I also had to make sure the bathroom was clean at all times.
good,Loke meeting and talking with new people on daily basis. Everyone helps out and do they part as far as the cleaning and making sure everything is properly stock.
good,My store manager was lazy and didnt research possible employees. Both reasons we couldn't keep help. The district manager was sexist and she was hateful and unwilling to help with multiple issues with manager even upon multiple employees complaints.
good,"Very busy. Run out of gas very frequently.  Customers are often rude "
good,Long hours with low pay. Working outside in all weather conditions. Staffing is a huge issue... Management isn't always fair/ Work life balance is horrible. Plan on working over 10 hours daily
good,"The management and staff were ok, the customers were the absolute worst part of this job. Ive worked multiple customer service jobs and was never treated as badly as I was while working for this gas station (not the companies fault). You are expected to do more than you are compensated for and are put into dangerous situations."
good,I enjoyed working with the public. I did not enjoy stocking the coolers especially in the Winter.But overall I enjoyed working here. The management at the time I was employed was lazy.
good,Murphy was a good place to work. There pay rate was better then most gas stations. As long as your willing to work they will let you work the hours you want.
good,"The manager seems nice."
good,"It was an ok place to work. You have to be able to complete multiple duties while there by yourself.  Cleaning pumps, fuel surveys, stocking coolers, etc Variety of customers."
good,nice job! Need to work more on honesty and taking care of the employees. The bonuses were cool and the secret shops. The scheduling was okay.  Respect was not really in the workplace like it should have been.
good,Daily duties being many times the only one working were difficult to perform well as you had to watch the gas pumps.  Had to stop multiple times to complete transactions then lock up and continue with the work.
good,You get to meet a lot of people. Always had a good time. People become regulars and prefer to only be handled by you. Always smiling and always laughing.
good,a typical day was very busy. learned  about management. work place is a small kiosk when got hot outside the air would not work very good at all. my regular customers joy of the day
good,"Learned to be a better communicator because, at the work place employees meet new people everyday. That helps the communication skills of a person. specially to those lack of those essential set of abilities."
good,Ok job for someone without children and who are ok with working alone at nights. The store manager I had was very biased towards certain employees. Showed favoritism towards younger female associates.
good,Was an ok environment. Organized. claer schedule and policy. But not an ideal place to work. Would recommend for temporary time. Good managment and employees.
good,It has its moments. Meet tons of new people opportunities for advancement and new skill base. You are alone and do everything by yourself. Overall it's a decent first time job
good,I got promoted within 6 months and would of became a store manager if I had stayed... no one trained me properly and I left safe unlocked while there was a guy there trying to fix some the pumps...automatic termination. thanks.
good,"Opportunities for advancement were limited at time I was there for people of my background due regional and district manager.They did not want one of us as manager,but I but be asst.mgr."
good,A typical day at work was fast. People coming in back to back. I liked it made my day go by fast. The hardest part was trying to keep your line moving trying not to make people wait to long.
good,"It was better than my last job, because I did get to have days off, the pay was ok depending on how many hours you've worked. You never knew how your day was going to go. Some of the customers were very nice and some you didn't like to see coming. That didn't stop me from doing my job. The biggest problem I had was depending on the workers to come in on time , so you could leave when it was your time to get off. The manager was very understanding and tried to work with all the employees when it came being off or if something came up."
good,stressful work environment. too much to do not enough time to do it. busy station. the most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction between myself and the customers
good,"The hours needed for this position are overwhelming at times, however very rewarding at the bottom line.  Working with the public and customer service being a top priority is a must."
good,"it is what you make of it , a typical day at work is kind of fast paced, alot of stocking in between customers , you learn how to stock cigarettes , the management was okay , she was a good listener very outspoken"
good,"I worked at this location for five years. It is a decent gig if you are looking for a part-time job that only takes 3-4 days out of the week, or a second job to add on to another part-time job. This company is very flexible and will work with you provided you stay transparent with them and let them know your availability."
good,"Company has changed a lot in the last 4 years.  Company does have a good balance of work and home life. Depending on the dm that you have. Some understand, some don't really care"
good,good place to work if you are working for the right manager. I have had the pleasure to both work for a great manager and become a great manager with this company.
good,Can be fast paced but overall good experience.  Pay is decent and management is reasonable. I have learned a lot about customer service and dealing with the public.
good,I do not have any comments about this company. this was just a cashier This was a part time job. after the holidays I was laid off and it was a fair work experience.
good,"Working for Murphy's wasn't so bad; possibly even the most -enjoyable- job I've had up to this point. My schedule was consistent, as my store kept me as the primary overnight cashier basically every week, though I'm sure that's largely due to the super-cool manager that I'd had at the time who understood that it's incredibly inconvenient to work overnight one night only to come in the following morning, giving a normal person no time to actually rest as managers often do in the field of retail. Working overnight was great at my particular store, though, because my area isn't very busy at night, which gave me plenty of time to get my actual 'work' done, like stocking the shelves and the coolers, as well as generally just cleaning the entire lot; wiping down the gas pumps, sweeping the lot, cleaning the bathrooms. The only actual downsides of working there would have to have been the pay overall, as there weren't very many actual benefits that the starting salary for most employees is rather close to my state's minimum wage, but in a way, it's to be expected in that sort of position as it's basically a generic fuel-retail job."
good,Was told i was not asking for enough ID's for cigarettes and i only didn't ask for regulars or obvious older age customers. Mystery shop customers were obviously over the age limit but me not asking got me fired. They don't want you to have long lines so you try to go as fast as you can but end up doing something wrong in the end a a result in the end.
good,come in  clean up  stock and order  count inventory  change out part on the pumps sales  you do paper work  and count  the stuff in the stock room and fill up drinks
good,"This is not a boring job, and you are never 'not busy'. Not only do you have to deal with a very diverse public, there is a tremendous amount of maintenance involved in working in a gas station.  There is constant stocking and cleaning to attempt to keep up with, which is virtually impossible if you work in a high traffic location. Working at MurphyUSA you also work by yourself most of the time, which presents further obstacles in trying to keep up with everything, but is not taken into account.  There are no breaks, no lunch.  It's not the worst job for the pay, but the amount of hours distributed can be quite shaky due to the fact that scheduling is based on sales/traffic (as most retailers do), which can be contradictory if you have high traffic in a low income area, and nearly half of the customers are making purchases less than $5-$10."
good,unhappy by the time i left company went downhill fast. didn't treat their employees as equals to management or respect the needs of their employees i loved working there in the begining
good,A day at Murphy's is fast and hectic. There I learned the importance and value of teamwork.The management only seemed to know what they were doing half of the time but my co-workers were amazing. The hardest part is always being pressed for time and the best part is absolutely the customers.
good,"Typical day: ran cash register, keep the facilities clean, stock merchandise, and quickly an promptly handling customers needs upon request."
good,I did have the opportunity to sharpen my managerial skills. The job was demanding and a bit on the production numbers were priority over customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part was being able to help the customers and furnishing them with a clean and safe shopping environment
good,favorite part is the customers and working with a team that seems almost like a second family you will meet people that you do not like but there is advantages and disadvantages to every job.
good,Nice place to work great company the best way to describe about a typical day at work and what I have learned since being employed there is  simply try it. The most enjoyable thing about the job is the same as any other job is simple doing what you love helping customers and seeking new ways to make a more impact on your coworkers
good,It was a nice job to gain customer service on. The management was very fair and helpful.
good,"Great place to work, The only draw back is the only person with 40 hours is the store manager, Unless the store manager is out on vacation or sent to another store to fill in."
good,"It was great working there. The environment and the customers were friendly, had some complainers but oved came that and took care the of it. Good experience and something  different I did"
good,"i was alright , nice co-workers the job was very fun. i didn’t really have a problem there with anyone , it was well kept and maintained . everyone was nice and everyone got along very well."
good,"During my time at murphy's, i was able to meet new and exciting people. The work shifts were left to be desired but i toughed it out. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my usual customers on a daily basis."
good,The nice thing is you basically work alone your hole shift. You have a list of things each shift that needs to get done. so you are in control of your one destiny of doing thing.
good,"If you have a strong store manager, the position is tolerable. Customers are regularly difficult and time can go from very busy to very slow. It is extremely difficult to get weekends off and hours per week can fluctuate regularly. If you are a student, management will work with you to set flexible hours to match up class schedule. On days without class, one can expect to come in anywhere from early morning or late evening. Pay is not ideal, but again for a part time job it could be worse."
good,The position is demanding but everyone is willing to step up and help out to keep the customers happy. The most rewarding part of the job is the customers.
good,Very little hours if not in management. System they use for opening isn't that great. It's a decent slow paced place to work. They pay well starting off and do well with giving raises. You work alone a lot of the time if working the evenings.
good,"You work alone A LOT, especially closing. Dangerous. Lots of cranky customers but that's expected. Mgmt knows itt's potentially dangerous and they promote a culture of their greed vs your personal safety.  Shame on them."
good,"management could be better, pay could definitely be better, staff never sticks, always hiring new people, benefits could be better, overall not too bad of a job. if you work like you are supposed to, management will work with you for your days off."
good,I enjoyed the work environment at the Support Center for Murphy USA. A lot of great co workers and a few really good managers. Plus they did a lot of things to help relieve the stress of working in a call center.
good,Manager Needs More Training. Its a good job to build your customer services skills.
good,When I was working at murphys I loved it. everybody was always friendly and smiling. somedays you did have rude customers but the employees made you look over it and laugh at it instead of getting mad about it.
good,"Busy and slow times but there is always work to be done.  Fast paced, often work alone and have to manage to keep everything operating smoothly."
good,I loved working for Murphy USA. Co workers were easy to get along with. Mangers were good to us. I hated sweeping the parking lot though and cleaning up the bathroom some people are nasty.
good,Murphy’s is a great place to work for. If you want to move forward in the co. Murphy’s deals with safety that is a must here at Murphy’s. Murphy’s is a co that don’t work on how long someone has been with the co. They go by your work
good,"Upon starting you are greeted by beautiful faces and smiling faces. You will learn how to multitask while handling a vast range of customers, managers are fair and reasonable in trying to distribute hours. In this work place environment you are often left at the register by yourself  so often days are not as easy as others. The most enjoyable part of this job is coming in contact with customers"
good,"Quick-paced, busy, my location only had one register so We had to do everything by ourselves during our shift. customers are rude. the hardest part of the job was handling the whole store alone (cash register, cleaning, and stocking)"
good,"Was a great job until relocated because of hurricane irma.   When I returned to Florida, I was denied employment because of no notice given even though a cat 4 hurricane was expected to hit in 2 days.   I hope they do not treat all their employees this way."
good,"Worked midnight to 7 a.m."
good,"17 years working here, 4 as a district manager. Seen many changes in upper management/home office and company culture. The difficult part about working here has been the inconsistent communication in upper leadership and peers work against each other for their own personal gain. Best thing working is seeing my team members be successful and win."
good,"Retail and customer service. This work gives you an opportunity to meet a lot  of people from your community. "
good,"great management. decent hours. easy work"
good,"It's a lot like walmart. Promises of competitive pay and job advancement, however once you're in there's broken promises and upper management is always breathing down your neck with impossible expectations."
good,"On a daily basis working hard for Murphy Oil, Their are counts, surveys, and deposit's that have to be done on a timely manner. The environment in the work place was fun at times when nothing crazy would go on. Such as if a pump dispenser went down, video system wasn't working properly. Employee's were great to work with, when everyone knew there job duties. The most hardest part of doing my job I think would be catching the people that stole from the store."
good,Can be a very demanding job. You must do all job duties required for that shift. Plus the extras that are listed on a calander to keep the store in perfect order and clean. Not to mention waiting on customers and vendors. The pay isnt very good at all. Also u spend most of your day outside so winter can be tough. There is opportunities to advance though.
good,Its an okay place to work very busy and fast paced which i liked just not many advancement options and little pay with not many perks other than health insurance and 401k. Managers get all the perks it seems. But nice people and they are flexible.
good,works with my schedule. great team. need more hours. fun job. meet a lot of new people. get to know local people. easy money
good,"upon opening the store, business was always great, a new adventure every day. I trained new managers, helped out other stores, conducted monthly store meetings, maintained business, strived for new customers, had a ""family""unit with my employees. We all worked hard and helped each other on a daily basis. Only reason I left was because I got robbed at gunpoint and it took the company 2 weeks to even call and check on the situation. I thought this was unprofessional plus I lost my father and had gotten sick myself. I enjoyed my job, my coworkers and most of all my customers."
good,"Murphy Usa usually had great days at work, stuff would flow evenly and help desk was always ready to help if there was a problem. I learned how to be a good manager and assistant manager when i worked in Hazlehurst. When i transferred to Baxley i work there maybe 4-5 months and couldn't work with the coworkers and manager there anymore they were not good examples of how to treat co workers and i just couldn't take the stress on top of the hour cuts i had when i went there. The part i loved about the job was the customers."
good,Had a great time just standing around ringing people up and getting the job done and feeling relaxed while working. Creating a routine that helps you and helps the company you work for
good,"I enjoyed my work at Murphey USA when I started there. The manager I had was great, He helped me with whatever I needed help with. After he left Murphey,USA I was not working more than 5 hours a week. That was why I left after being there for a year and 1/2. Only working 5 hours a week was the hardest part of the job.I learned to not let rude customers get to me."
good,I loved this job but had to quit due to my pregnancy. It's a great job if you need a part time job or second job. I think the pay should be a little higher because they ask you to do extra things and sometimes you have to clean up and do what your other coworkers refuse to do.
good,"Typical day at work consist of helping customers and keeping them happy. In order to do that everyone has to pull together as a team to help keep products stocked, clean and organized."
good,Busy with pumps and customers. Management was very strict and always watching us. Co workers were just that's.. co workers. Hardest part of this job was when we had drive offs.
good,"Manager was very nice at first then bacame careless, very rude, did not help when she wasn't there wouldnt answer her phone. During winter times having to be outside in the cold to change trash clean pumps an lot"
good,"the hardest part of the job is being on shift from 3pm to 12:45am by yourself, so if you want to take a break, you have to do it when no one is there, which is very rare."
good,Love my job love my customer but I can not stay no place you continue to pass me over for advancement in the company i dont like that they don't support hiring from previous employees than bringing in new ppl and giving them jobs than promoting from within first
good,I only decided to work here cause I needed a job and have children that depended on me but employees are underpaid and even management. It’s sad a company that makes great money but can’t pay out more or offer more to help your employees survive.
good,"The management is very poor, only one takes the job seriously. Your guaranteed some many hours and only get partial of them. They expect alot from one but pay isn't worth it and have very little time to get things done."
good,Can work you still you cant work no more Take a day off for yourself No one cares about you but make sure someone is covering that shift Thanksigiving who care You dont need family You need Murphys Snow storms you better come up with a better reason not to show
good,You must be friendly inefficient kind to the customers make sure you do your clean up at the end of your shift count down your register shut down the store if you close
good,customers were difficult called the cops on many heroin addicts that would leave needles in the bathroom was always by myself not a comforting job area.
good,"Overall good company. Would still be employed had th DM been a responsible trustworthy individual who didn't steal from the stores and then write up the employees.  Also had the DM or the GM listened when I stated I needed help while working 90 plus hours a week, my time there would have been amazing."
good,"Easy job, not much advancement, work alone usually, very busy at each store. typical shift duties are using the register for fuel and tobacco sales, pushing promotions of what is on sale"
good,It all depends who you are working with on how the shift is going to go. But for the most part it was a great fun spirited work place. Had a lot of great customers.
good,"management is nice, co workers are also nice, the environment is pretty easy going and the customers are nice, they have alot of odd policies but they work,"
good,"No help from managers & DEFINITELY none from the general manager. She only came in to tell you every tiny thing you did incorrectly or differently than she would have..Never willing to listen to the cashiers, ones who deal directly w/ the public & would have the best suggestions for moving customers thru faster..."
good,"Was good as ast  manager at Parmer Ln , Austin  but too far to drive. After 8 months changed location an stepped down to cadhier at another store. It was closed an remodeled so i travled to other stores for hours an travel pay. Had trouble getting travel pay because managers wouldn't submit in a timely matter. They still owe me travel pay an it's been 2 months since i left. The company's main office in Arkansas won't return my calls. So i left company with some regret."
good,While working for Murphy USA I was always working. which isnt a bad thing but i had family issues to deal with at home so that started to hinder my work. some of the people that i had to work with were okay. some were not. over all if i can i probably would go back to work.
good,"The environment in which you interact with customers is awesome! When you start out you make a few mistakes but its a very easy going customer group. Once you get your time management together it becomes very easy. However if you're looking for a primary job I would not recommend it because you often find yourself competeing for hours that you never really get and lack of ""team work"" creates a stressful environment on the business side of the job."
good,I think this is a job for a college students who don’t have family or someone who is single. If they could treat the good employees good and the ones who does nothing actually get in trouble.
good,"Helping customers is great. It is very fast paced and knowing what they want makes it easier and keeps them coming back. In retail you never know what to expect and things change quite often. I've gained computer and management skills. An assistant manager also makes commission at the end of the month."
good,Overall enjoyable place to work. The company provides many opportunities for job advancement and growth. Management shows a great deal of support to its employees.
good,The company was great but they need to work on there management. I enjoyed working for them in the beginning when it was under another manager but when the new manager came in I was promised things that never happened.
good,Retail fast paced. Not enough pay. More overtime should be given. Lower benefits. Long hours sometimes. Flexible schedule if your part time. Team work
good,"Initially, I loved being employed at MurphyUSA. I saw myself growing with the company and I had excellent compensation. I enjoyed being a part of a great group of managers. MurphyUSA then decided to reduce bonus incentives for managers while adding to District Managers and Assistant Managers"
good,You definitely don't get paid enough for what they ask you to do and keep up with. The manager is amazing!!! Good job for trying to get experience under your belt for something that pays better.
good,Working here was so much fun the different people you meet on a daily was amazing for he helped with my nervous problems I loved the co worker I had just my general manager played sides and did to her job as she should have but she is no longer with the company would definitely work with them again pop
good,"I began working with a great team of people but then the staff began to change and new faces made it a different place to work, I miss the original crew"
good,i loved working for Murphy USA the only reason why I left was because i worked 6 days a week or 12 days straight always came in when needed to but i was getting paid change to me i felt like i showed my skills and my loyalty to the company and i was not able too get a raise.
good,"The Murphy's I was at was full of unnecessary drama. The job its self was very easy and manageable. Nothing too hard. I loved my job, it was just the people that worked there that was the issue. The best part about the jobs is the customers. You grow a bond with them. Hardest thing is Stock Days. Specifically, on the busiest day, the managers will order more than normal and only 2 people working and expect the employees to but it all up before the next shift."
good,"I left because my temporary DM was asking me to do things, special projects, and when I approached him about all the hard work I had been putting in and asking only a quarter more per hour, he would not go to bat for me. So I left!"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is putting a smile on the customer face. I love the fast paced environment and the people I work with. The hardest part of my job is the customers at times.
good,"do deposit, count cigarettes, wait on customers, clean, stock"
good,its a good company but they do not have advancement never keep employees always short hand
good,None at this time as I don’t work for them anymore. But in all this place has changed  sense I left and has changed for the best. You feel welcomed when you go in there.
good,"bad managment, good experience, I love my customers always say hi. If I will need to come back there I will no thinking two times, bad salary, and be multitask."
good,"The work experience is all about teamwork. Everyone rotates tasks to do around the store to maintain it. Murphy’s Corporate is quite nit-picky about how they expect their stores to look and how they expect you to cashier while abiding your up-selling tactics and your time. Everything is according to MURPHY LAW. The amount of work that you end up doing for what they want to pay, you might as well apply for a second job or use this as a stepping stone. If you enjoy people, then consider apply here with open-availability. That’s all they they’re looking to hire."
good,"Immediate manager is great and easy to work with, however district manager could use a course in how to communicate with people. It is definitely a very fast pace job and you have to be customer service oriented."
good,"The work it's self was easy, did have some management issues but they were easily solved. the hardest part of my job was balancing customers and still getting all required work done. your on a shift all by yourself its hard to balance but doable"
good,"I enjoyed going to work and seeing the smiling faces on my regular customers. It was strenuous at times with customers that couldn't get what they wanted but overall it was good. As far as management, it was good in the beginning but as I noticed things were not fair within the job. The manger had his favorites. In my opinion, no job should have favorites, especially working a job where its a team effort. Secondly, I think it should be fair that if one shift has to be clean up crew, so does all shifts."
good,The job is really easy you literally stand at a register majority of your shift thats how busy the customer traffic is. you get to meet tons of diverse  people and build friendships with them. unfortunately my store manager liked to hire her family and the resulted in favoritism with hours. but overall the company and job is easy. if you show you wanna learn management they'll teach you!
good,Stocked shelves and worked at a fast pace. Helped customers and provided good customer service. Enjoyed providing helpful service to customers and management was well to work with.
good,very busy location. not intended for a slower person. need patience to deal with a lot of cranky people. know your smokes and beer. Customers will ask a lot of questions. Smile it does help.
good,"I loved working at murphys due to great pay paid vacation and yearly raise. All of my co workers were great and easy to get along with. My mangers however was a different story. One out of three mangers made sense to me, my head manger was a good manger but he did show a lot of favoritism, and a lot of he say she say, happened to often."
good,"besides the long hours, murphy was a very nice place to work. Murphy also  had issues keeping employees, because the management attitude was very bad."
good,Overall a great company to work for. The only problem I had was working over night alone. I did  not feel safe and no one should work alone.
good,Very fast paced alot of stocking cleaning great customers at the location I worked at always come in about 10 minutes early to finish shift change so people can leave on time or finish up odds and ends.
good,Very fast and hard job.you have to deal with a lot of people. Who can get mad very fast and you have to ID everyone which makes some people mad as well.
good,I would not recommend this place it is a very stressful place to work. The mangement team doesnt know how to work together. No breaks. Some customers can be rude at times. Very demanding place.
good,I enjoy meeting new people and having a understanding boss. I would've rather work the hours I asked for but it was ok while it lasted. Had fun with my coworkers and enjoyed meeting new customers every day.
good,The customers were the worst part of the job honestly. They were entitled and got angry very quickly. They would stand in line for more than 2 minutes and be angry by the time they got to the register. They would cuss out the cashiers for stuff that’s beyond their control.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with at the time. The manager was great but not enough pay or benefits. Also, I quit because of attempted robbery. I probably would have worked there longer if it hadn't been for the attempted robbery."
good,"The place was new and was great the time I got to work there. "
good,Murphy is an great place to work. They just need to check in on their Stores More. and Bring back the tuition payment for the employees that work so hard for them and cant seem to go to school being that their schedule is rotating
good,"The job is boring while having to work alone and in a small box . A lot of work for one person working alone . Overall it's not a bad job , but it can be stressful"
good,great place to work if you like working with the public Hardest part of the job is each store is like a remote location so any issues with any electronics you had to call a help desk and that is frustrating with customers standing there.  Only saw district managers about once a month
good,"Customer relations was the best part of the job for myself. My manager and I did everything he could to keep it a comfortable work place with team work. There was a safety situation opening one morning where a few homeless guys showed up with intent to do something wrong. I believe if a customer ""truck driver"" did not pull up it could have went bad for me. Murphy does not have two employees opening and closing together."
good,MUSA is a great place to work.  Lots of work there and requires a lot of time on the job. It is rewarding though.  Good benefits and bonuses every year.
good,"I enjoyed my job,and took on my responsibilities well.most of the employees were very pleasant to work with.I am always up for a challenge and love working with the public.The hardest part of my job was covering doubles when employees didnt show up,and the most enjoyable was accomplishing my goals each day and being appreciated."
good,"Company is well organized, management, at least on the local level does need improvement,"
good,I like this company. the efforts they put forth to please their customers has taught me a lot in customer service. this company has very good foundation and respectful people. 
good,I liked working at Murphy's USA.  I had a lot of fun. It was a good company. They paid well . I got paid very well.  It was close to home.  As assistant manager
good,I had like working here. even though the pay was not all that great but they had great managers and they loved to give out over time. I would go back if they was different
good,I loved working at Murphy USA but I know it was completely because of my team and the love and appreciation I have for all of my coworkers and managers. Raises are hard to come by and there are no breaks.
good,Murphy USA is a pretty typical place to work. Management is expected to keep the stores running and the customers happy by keeping things clean and in stock.
good,A typical day was working at the register in the booth and attending to cleaning the area around pumps and restocking consumables. Dealing with customers was straightforward and simple.
good,I worked with an employee that consistently stole from my till. I complained about it to Management but by me being the last one hired manager took the other employees word. Eventually that individual would get caught by stealing from another person and was terminated. I liked my job was extremely upset when I lost my job.
good,"got to meet different people everyday, learned the ins and outs of a gasoline and diesel pump. learned how to fix said pumps. management was always great with employees."
good,"Job was intensely physical,  good customer service,  manager was excellent,  taught me a lot I lost from earlier.  Higher ups were a bit inept(numbers oriented,  claimed family oriented- bottom line only), otherwise good. Schedule changes were made when needed for doctor appointments (big plus!), but if no more of transportation,  hours are very limited(overtime available if a car owner)"
good,Taught to do inventory and place orders. Manage money and make sure cash drawer was accurate at the end of shift along with daily paperwork of prior day sales. Push sale items on the floor.
good,It was a pretty good job. They just never gave me alot of hours. They would give me on average maybe 15 hours a week. Some weeks they only had me work one or 2 days.
good,"You're stuck working by yourself most of the day, however the atmosphere is rather relaxed. If you have an emergency and need to leave, unfortunately you may be waiting a while for someone to come and cover the shift."
good,I loved the job the fast paced always something to do and the customers were always so understanding and they were just awesome all the time but management from the store manager to the district manager needed work. They needed to learn who their employees even were it's sad when you call the district manager and she is complaining about an employee who forgot to bring in their work schedule for their second job and you are that person she didnt even know my name
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with everything by yourself at times, it’s generally pretty easy once you know what the customers want behind the counter."
good,"nothing to bad to say.. don't be to good or you get relied on hard core. talk about constant calls to cover someones shift. launches are 30 minutes, you build amazing relationships with the customers and employees"
good,Easy work just a lot to do in a limited amount of time by yourself. A busy store so when you are left to do the work alone you have to rush when there are no customers to try and get things finished.
good,My manager is amazing. Always available for questions or concerns. Breaks are you get one if you have time. Always something to do based on location. My store is super busy. Day goes by really fast. Overall good place to work.
good,Only reason why I left was because of terrible management. Other than that it was a super easy job. Some evenings were relaxed; while some were chaotic. You work by yourself so that's why I liked it.
good,Enjoyed working with customers have to be alert fast paced work environment work indepentantly be ready willing and able to learn all about the duties
good,"Mornings and evenings are usually busy with customers buying what they need for the day. constantly had to re-adjust the merchandise. Daily duties had to be done by the end of the shift. For example cleaning the restrooms, parking lot etc."
good,I loved who I worked with not necessarily the company I worked for. There were near constant changes in the policies at Murphy's. Customers as in any retail job could easily become irate and it wasn't always misunderstood. Some policies were ridiculous. The drive-off occurrences that don't have to be a thing are irritating. They cost stores money and employees hours for things out of their control.
good,I liked it because you saw new and sometimes the same people everyday. It can be very stressful at times especially when you are in a rush of customers.
good,Nice to see regulars come in and have a conversation with you. Usually only 1 person working at a time though. Very relaxed in the culture. Hardest part of job was working by yourself on sundays.
good,The challenge we face is the lack of pay for cashiers and as a result we do not get a high caliber of staff.   This can be very stressful.   I have no issue with the tasks I need to do.  I struggle with a weak support system in the immediate future.
good,If you have the right team a day at work is loads of fun. The customers are all great and treat the cashiers well. If you have problems it can be hard to get the assistance you need from the rest of your team because everyone is busy with their own stores.
good,It's not a bad job I'm just not making the pay I want to be making and there isn't anything bad other than that it's fun great customers 90% of the time. It's fast paced but it's not stressfully at all after you get the hang of it.
good,I never saw my family. They expect alot of their managers without providing a proficient budget. They would rather promote someone right out of college instead  of someone that has been there for years
good,"Murphy USA is a productive, fair, and collaborative work experience. Management is understanding and treats employees with integrity and respect. The company is team oriented and rely on cooperative team members to easily find solutions to problems."
good,"Job was easy, there was a lot they expect people to do at night working alone. But the job was only seasonal so I wasnt to learn much before busy season was over."
good,good company for part time work can be a great future for store management if you have the skill and drive great place for advancement and they do give chances to promote yourself
good,Love working with the public. Management needed more training dealing with workers situations. The job was not hard as long as you did the job and duties assigned each day.
good,"I loved my job & interacting with the customers. However, my manager treated me very poorly for no apparent reason. I would love to go back but not the same location."
good,"I enjoyed working with Murphy. It's a friendly place except for the district manager, she was always rude when she came to check up on the stores. Other than her all the stores I worked at while being employed I enjoyed."
good,My manager was more concerned about gossip than the SOP. Both of my assistant managers quit within a week apart and my co-worker was dismissed and my hours were cut.
good,I enjoyed working for murphy USA. though the staff wasn't the best the environment was great! they gave me plenty of opportunities to pick up hours and seemed to work along side of my schedule.
good,"I learned that there is much more to a gas station and fuel services than just picking up the nozzle and dispensing fuel in my car. Murphy taught me that there is a technical side which is mechanical equipment, computer programming, vendors, outside technicians, and carriers that you have to interact with on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day at work for me was coming in some time between 3-5pm, and working until closing. The best part of it was being independent, but that was also the con, because it was very hard if you are a social person."
good,I worked with a great group of people many years ago. Corporate kind of ruined it trying to micromanage places they never walked into. Glad to leave when I did.
good,"There are things to keep you busy and time will go by fast."
good,I really liked this company although I wish there were more opportunity for a change of pace and movement. I enjoyed my time at Murphy and the recognition that they gave us.
good,"You have to do a little cleaning and deal with different people, but very fun. Making transaction is the bulk of the work because at a busy store you don't have time to do anything."
good,This job was a good job to start off with but not a permanent job for those trying to move to bigger things. I did duties as a manger and still was being paid minimum wage it was friends as mangers so it was hard to move up to anything more but a customer service rep.
good,Very productive when you want it to be very slow at times customers are amazingly lovely vendors are even better its a quick fast and efficient work place.
good,"Wonderful company to work for.They really care for the staff and offer incentive bonuses as well. Friendly customers. Overall, just a really great company to work for."
good,Murphy USA is great company to work for. It is expanding at a fast rate and there are plenty of opportunities for advancement.
good,it is ok to work. part time and crazy hours. I only work 5 hours a day and I work 6 days a week sometimes and the customers can be a little nutty at times.
good,"Work isnt hard, the customers are great.  Management doesn't really work with scheduling conflicts and do tend to play favorites with employees, but the company is really awesome to work for."
good,"fun place to work great service great employees great managers"
good,This place is not tourist based like a lot of places I have worked at in the past. This has a stable work environment but again  this place is hard to get full time in.
good,"Great job if you are just needing part time work or a second job. Co-workers are great. Store is a bit big so it takes alot to keep it clean,"
good,Great staff and easy going work environment made for an ideal job at Murphy Express.
good,Work with fun people
good,Recommend anyone here!! Great manager!! And great people!! Great environment!! Love working here!! Easy tasks!! And laid back!! And very chill!! Good place!!
good,Working for Murphy's taught me alot about myself and others .I learned alot of self control and patience. I met alot of great people and coworkers....
good,Over all I liked working for Murphy's hi had a few rude customers but other than that it was worth my time i like a job that everyone helps each other it makes the job so much easier and smoother.
good,"Register,clean coffee and drink area and stock them,the same for the bathrooms,stock cigs and shelves and block them,sweep and mop put out signs ""WET FLOOR"". Clean bathrooms and signs out. STOCK the cooler.Count down END shift.Always be nice to the customers."
good,"I wish the pay was better for shift managers."
good,"I worked at Murphy on a couple of occasions.  I was a full time employee for almost 8 years.  I was an Administrative Assistant to the VP of Murphy USA.  The Manufacturing Department was eliminated and so was my position.  I was placed in Accounting and I was appreciative to have a job.  However, I had one and one half days of training in an area I knew nothing about.  I resigned from Murphy to seek a more qualified position with my experience."
good,"I would work the evening shift from about 3 to 1145 in the evenings.  Stocking shells, filling coolers "
good,I stood up for hours on end had to deal with some customers and their bad rude ugly attitudes but I loved my job I was good at it people loved me I am a hard worker
good,It was just a job i had for the first year of college. It was okay. I recommend as a starting job. There are advancement opportunities but that requires moving or waiting for the manager to move. It’s a lot of work and dangerous at night.
good,"As a Store Manager, if you find yourself without an assistant or shortstaffed, for any reason including losing employees to higher paying jobs,  you will be working 70-90+hours/week & without a day off for several months."
good,Never have time for my family. The pay is not good. But the manager is ok. Like working with the public. I like the experience I am getting as a assisted manager. The pay could be better but I am doing ok. The company is a very good company to work for.
good,"The manager there is great. The  place is very busy most of the time."
good,"Murphy's is a reliable job, the works there, you get your pay check every two weeks, is a job. However if your living in today's world you have to make $30 an hour just to get by, I have no qualms with the company, just need more money per hour."
good,I loved the customers as well as my job. I loved having the internal district and division contests. It made my day to make my customers smile when I saved them money.
good,They had a wonderful customer service way. They tried to fix problems before they just told you that they couldnt. Always helpful with eachother. You had to multi task.
good,"While employed at Murphy USA I was tasked with handling all cash, debit, and credit transactions, maintaining merchandise quantities in retail area, operating with a high level of customer service, and keeping a safe and secure environment while ensuring the efficiency and accuracy of all transactions. Time management and self-motivation were crucial elements to succeeding in completion of all daily duties due to frequently operating as the facilities sole staff member on duty."
good,"It’s a good place to work if your only wanting part time. Because the hours change every single week, but you have to be very fast paced, and be able to multi task."
good,I liked working here but there were too many girls and I was not getting enough hours. I learned how to operate the lotto machine. The hardest part was working late at nigh
good,Great place to work with great benefits if you are a full time employee (manager or assistant). hours are mostly flexible depending on the manager. No merit raises. Hard to advance.
good,"I worked at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center full-time (Less than a year)"
good,"It is a good place to work.  Was going to make assistant manager, but someone went to work there before me so she was more entitled to it.  Would recommend a good place to work really enjoyed working with the manager."
good,very fast paced good relationship with customers and management not really enough hours per week had to find something with more hours and betterbenefits
good,"Steady work environment with a friendly atsmosphere. The work was easy and I liked the interaction with customers, also the hours were excellent."
good,"Work place didn't have a scale on which to establish terms of firing, hiring process didn't filter out employees that couldn't perform the job. Also there wasn't a lot of room for advancement."
good,The company it self is a great place to work for. I enjoy what I do and the people I work with. Love dealing with people and learning new things every day.
good,"Sometimes it was a little unnerving to close alone at night. But other than that, was a great place to work for.  The managers were friendly and fair."
good,"As an assistant manager I would make schedules and maintain the fuel logs, pumps and the merchandising of the store. I would have to say I stayed busy with dealing with vendors and employees quite a bit. The customers where generally in a hurry. You learn patience with people in a hurry. I enjoyed working here with some great people and the fast pace of the busy part of the day. It was the first job I took after caring for my mother."
good,The job can be very relaxed as long as you pay attention to dangers around the gas pump and and cash transactions if your management is good it will be a good job
good,"Being a cashier is a hard job, but I loved the job. I got to see many different faces everyday, learning new things about the company. Management could have been better"
good,I was over the store on my shift watching gas pumps and running the cash register. Clean gas pumps on every shift on down periods. 
good,"If you like meeting people, it's a great place to work. Benefits could be better, but company does have profit sharing plan. Managers work with you to schedule around other commitments. Good company to work for."
good,"A fast paced environment with multiple issues daily. Helpdesk helps to resolve issues but most maintenance is done by staff to reduce costs. Managers will change pump parts, fix broken sinks, toilets etc to the best of their abilities. Only then will they dispatch assistance. Commissions are based on fuel sales and non fuel sales, which is dependent upon sales. Lot's of paperwork. Keeping staff seems to be an issue, in which case, the manager must cover the hours in order to avoid overtime for hourly employees. Sometimes other stores will send employees to help, but it is not mandatory. In January, the company sends it's managers to Florida for a national conference which is all paid for. It will include trips to Disney and other fun exciting adventures. They get reimbursed for their travel expenses. There are many contests to win prizes each month for selling merchandise, however, the bigger markets like Texas seem to win most often. It is easier to promote from a cashier to a shift lead and then to a supervisor and eventually into a store manager. However, it is very difficult to promote beyond a store manager as they seem to keep eliminating positions unless you want to relocate to El Dorado, Arkansas. There is a wage cap after 5 years on all positions, save the hourly positions that would have to be compensated if minimum wages change."
good,"Stock, clean, monitor fuel tanks, change fuel filters as needed (usually every 6-8 weeks depending on gas or diesel). Scheduling, utilizing budget forecasting, handling money, debit/credit cards, gift cards. completing shift documents daily."
good,"The worklife is nice. The 9 hours of work Monday through Thursday, and half of a day on Friday was great. People there are nice, but HR could use some help. Not a bad overall experience."
good,Over all the job was good the team I had was okay wish they gave more hours out or overtime out more to the employees other than that they was a okay company to work for
good,"Good place to work but needs more employees. The only bad thing I would criticize would be when you work at night you are there by yourself, would recommend two people to work at night just in case something was to happen."
good,"Great place to work if you don’t need a good salary or if it’s a second job, but as for myself I couldn’t make it on what I was being paid considering I did everything the manager did too."
good,It's a nice and fun job to have but the lack of hours available and the bad pay it really isn't worth it unless you have a 2nd job.  Can't live off of just Murphy's alone
good,Loved my job but changed in policy with upper management made it difficult to work the nights/weekends needed for the future of the job. The assistant usually covers weekend morning shift as well as varied shifts throughout the week. Pay dates are biweekly. Managemnt gets 30+ hours per week while others are less than 25.
good,"enjoyed fellow employees, enjoyed seeing new faces every day. "
good,it was a great place to work loved the customer experience. though it is not a job that you can just skate by doing nothing it was still a pretty relaxed job
good,I loved my job at Murphys and wish I could have stayed and moved up through the company. Unfortunately you cannot make a living working here. Which is really the only negative thing I can say about it. I loved the fast paced and constant customer interaction. Murphys taught me a lot about how to handle customers and a lot of responsibility. Murphy USA really does care about there customers but not so much there employees. Perfect job for anyone turning just turning 18 would recommend.
good,"I do enjoy working with Murphy USA.  It is a flexible schedule for me and the work is relatively easy. Maybe some rude customers now and then but if you are nice Everyone else seems to be. Although, I have been told by other employees that they video and audio record you while working. Audio recording is illegal and if this is true I will not stay with the company."
good,The environment is good. The people are good. Not a bad place to work. Although some of the hours are a little strenuous. Little staff allows for not a lot of leeway when it comes to needing certain times off
good,Didnt like dealing with rude people and having to be nice to them. I love to see customers leave with a smile on their faces. I love serving other on a daily.
good,"hard work rewarded by management"
good,"Mostly easy work, understanding managers, work with the hours that you have to offer. I really like the co workers that i have. Gives you the days that you ask off for"
good,Fun place to work with good working environment. I have learned many things working their about tobacco sales and gasoline sales. Had the opportunity to learn things I did not now
good,"10+ hours a day 6-7 days a week with no help.Used to be a great place to work but now not so much. A typical day of work consist of greeting customers and helping with the essential needs of fuel and merchandise. Learned how to deal with different people and how to respond to difficult situations that were unexpected but required immediate action. Being in management taught me very valuable tools to take on in any workplace in the future. For example, how to diffuse tensions between employees or employees and customers. Marketing along with other business skills was a huge benefit of working for the company. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain a healthy work-life balance. The job requires a huge amount of hours away from family. The most enjoyable part of the job was attending the annual Disney trip. This sparked a new and exciting refresher for everyone who was there and honored everyone's accomplishments."
good,A lot to do during your shift. Low labor hours but you stay busy and the time passes quickly. Upper management is normally supportive. They focus heavily on sales.
good,"The store I worked at had an amazing store manager and assistant manager. The only real advancements are either assistant store manager or store manager. The job was nice when we had a full staff, but seemed to have trouble keeping people around. Being understaffed means more hours, but longer shifts by yourself with no breaks. You get some really great regular customers who will talk to you, but there are some people who will get angry for either no reason at all, or just a ridiculous reason that makes no sense. As long as you can deal with the crazy people, this is a great job. Like I said before, even though I didn't like the district manager, it was made better by an attentive and compassionate store manager."
good,"Murphy USA is a very fun, eventful, and success for your career. They strive on great customer service and have principles they live by each and every day. There core competencies are what make Murphy USA the company they are today."
good,"Murphy's was a good company to work for, when we had everyone doing their part.  Didn't like the customers yelling at you, cause you're doing your job.  Customers would complain to my boss, and my boss would thank me for doing my job when it came for IDs for tobacco products.  Manager was really awesome.  She was a really hard worker and made sure safety rules were enforced 110%.  I only worked part time, but there were times coworkers never showed up as schedule and would call me in to work unexpectedly the last minute.  It was hard asking for time off, since we were often short staffed.  We were not allowed lunch breaks, since we worked by ourselves.  We could sit down and eat between customers and cleaning duties."
good,"I loved working at Murphy's Express. The only complain I ever had is having to be responsible for things on my day off like the gas survey. Unfortunately, I was wrongfully terminated for a simple mistake and our district manager had no sympathy for being human. Other than that it was a great experience."
good,"The management wasn't great at all, but the customers were wonderful. It is good pay and easy money. Do the job correctly and you won't have any problems."
good,Over all I like my Job here at Murphy USA. As assistant manager i step up and get the job done. I felt my direct manager was not a good Manager. Her methods involved to much hostility and negativity.
good,"I had been working here for at least a year and a half. When I started to talk about moving from assistant manager to store manager, they found a reason to fire me. I had done plenty of customer satisfactions and so had my co workers but they said I was wrong and fired me, which I found fishy."
good,I Loved working at Murphy. It's a very small close-knit type of job setting so you will get to know your peers & management very well. If it was up to me I would have never left. Once you get through training your pretty much on your own so pay close attention and you will be okay.
good,"Busy always,  stocking, cleaning and fast cashiering.  This company pays better than most,  you must be fast and accurate.  "
good,Great team and management to work with. Better than minimum wage pay rate. Works with your hours if you have another job.
good,"Clock in then count money try to shift change during very bust store, then begin ringing up customer. In-between customer try to stock all sodas and drinks and windshield wiper bucket , then try to clean all the parking lot and refilling printer paper, Make several safe drops. restock all cigarettes  and count them . Log all tally's on computer make sure bathrooms is clean, lock all doors recheck all locked doors, then clock out/lock up . "
good,"I enjoy greeting the customers every day that I work. I know what a lot of my customers are going to ask for before they ask. They tell me I am the reason that they shop there because I am so sunny and friendly. Learn new things every day in operation of the store. I have a pretty good manager. Most of the co-workers that I work with are pretty good workers. Typical day starts by making sure coffee pots full, cleaning counters then start waiting on customers by ringing up purchases and running lottery tickets."
good,"I typically opened, ensured inventory audit specific to area per schedule. Completed paperwork from day before and entered information in data base, ensured deposit accuracy, ordered product as necessary, pump  maintenance as necessary, customer service and cashier."
good,if ur people friendly. like to keep busy. and don't mind getting dirty from time to time.. it's the place for u. advancing is good as long as u have the determination to move up u can go far in this company.
good,"I worked at a station alone on my shifts. This was fine and I could do it all, however people with back problems or issues standing 6-10 hours might not be able to do it. Management was really nice and I liked my managers, corporate policies were a bit heavy handed at times."
good,Its a great place to work for depending on your location. I have an excellent manager and most of the customers are like close friends. I have a lot of fun times at my job
good,"good place to work, it for very hard workers, great benefits, chance for advancement and monthly sales contest, monthly bonuses for management and assistance"
good,"I moved up fairly quickly in the company. To get the the next point has become more of a challenge. They say they want internal promotes but anyone above me has all been external hires."
good,"Good company, great co workers,fast paced.management friendly, small stores but busy days.very safety conscience.easy to understand, loyal and friendly customers."
good,I really loved the fast pace at Murphy's as well as the friendly customers that would come in regularly. The manager seemed to be more lienient on her choice of employees as if the rules only applied to select people.
good,"Murphy USA is a good job, the hours are flexible, the pay is good. The service was always fast paced and steady. The work was light, cleaning the bathrooms and stocking the products"
good,"Friendly manager, hours are flexible, relaxed environment, I got to mostly choose my days off, the pay was decent, and the job was pretty easy, I overall liked my job"
good,"Murphy USA is a nice place to work,  the Customers are great!  lots to do to keep you busy,  doing the trash inside and out, to cleaning coffee pots and the bathroom. Keeping the store stocked and neat for customers."
good,"It's a good place to work,  but you must be willing to work consistently in a fast paced environment. The management makes effort to keep a satisfied schedule of employees as well as customers."
good,I genuinely enjoyed myself working there and interacting with the customers I encountered. Everyone worked as a team and the whole staff from top to bottom were good team players.
good,The company culture focuses on team values and has a positive growth potential according to their future plans. It seems like the CEO is a genuine bright man and will take the organization far. I just happened to draw a manager who had been promoted from the ranks and assigned the responsibility of a new department without having the experience or skills to effectively manage people.
good,"A typical work shift would go by pretty fast. The job itself had so many different tasks that it kept me busy throughout the whole shift. The teamwork and positive mission statement the company projected made it enjoyable to work there. The hardest part of the job would probably be the shift i worked because I worked it alone but the management would  always strive to make sure I was correcting any mistakes that came with learning a new job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom the company allowed its employees to have while finding the best way the job worked for them, but also maintaining the company's goals and expectations."
good,your normal day was standing on your feet for 7-8 hours but you wouldn't have to work everyday. You will have some rude and drunk customers. I learned how to deal with people that will be very rude and disrespectful. The hardest part was not having any breaks.
good,The company was well balanced but did pay their managers very well. Managers didn't stay with the company for long. Didn't like the buildings kiosk style construction. Only allowed for one employee at a time to be inside the building.
good,"jobs easy ,some filling the coolers,cigs ,snacks and cleaning duties can be a bit of a task having to watch for customers haveing shifts overlap so these task can be done helps"
good,Murphy's has a great culture and it takes care of the employees. The management will work with you if you need a day off and the company makes you feel like you are family.
good,"Most of the shifts will be two people, tops, unless you work at an extremely busy location. You stock the whole time, and help customers when they come up. Managers also do inventory daily and take deliveries. They try to get a second person there during deliveries but the truckers don't always arrive when they expect to. It can be overwhelming, but it's also got a lot of freedom, since you really are alone most of the time."
good,Had previous cashier experience that helped a lot. Closing a store on my own by myself was very new to me. Actually was a key holder. The competitiveness on the sales gave co-workers that little push and the product would change every month.
good,Great work place great employees managers nice just not enough hours customers are nice and friendly work environment very peaceful and respectful no attitude are drama
good,"The manager at this location is very patient and considerate. Although the location is very fast-pace and very challenging. i believe if you are going to work for this company, this location will determine if you are qualified. The customers are brutal and they will try to trick you to get what they want at a lower price but it builds a strong back bone for yourself. I've learned how to defuse complications, how to manage my time wisely making sure i get all my shift duties done in a timely manor, how to properly execute tasks, and to hold other employees to the higher standard to which i was taught. I couldn't have gotten a better manager than the one at this location. Not only does he make time to teach you new things but helps you think about how to solve a difficult problem. If you make a mistake he lets you know what mistake you made and what you can do to fix it. This particular manager's work ethic makes me, personally, want to do better at my job. I would go out of my way if this manager needed help with anything just because i know he has my back and he believes in me as a person, not just an employee. This location is the second busiest locations in the district and that makes the culture very diverse. I've learned with every store there is a different demographic and you have to adapt to that demographic if you want to succeed. The hardest part of the job is always being aware of what's going on around you. There are so many aspects that need attention and sometimes it's hard to pay proper attention to all of them. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing your"
good,"Murphy is a great place to work, if you work hard, take pride in a job well done and are a team player.  I worked various shifts, but preferred the early morning hours, as it allowed me the time to get to know my customers better.  I started about 4 am and worked until aprox 3pm.  I did morning paperwork, audits, inspected the pumps and outside merchandise racks, bathroom and storage sheds daily. I performed maintenance on dispensers.  I interacted with customers."
good,I enjoyed working with people and the hardest part was having to deal with irate and impatient customers. The company was typically good about working with you on your schedule especially if something arose unexpected or sudden.
good,"Murphy is a great company to work with if you're young, single and don't mind working a lot. Store Managers are required to work 50+ hours/ wk, no weekends off and work pretty much every holiday. Murphy was a very sales driven store when I worked there. We had monthly contest for points and the stores with the most points in each division would receive an all expense paid vacation. Store managers received commission once every month. Depending on the sales a given Murphy could run off 4 employees effectively with the manager picking up the slack. Managers are required to order their own merchandise, do maintenance on the pumps (sometimes the fuel tanks), hire/fire their own personnel, build sales, count their own inventory at least 2x a week and maintain a competitive gas price through constant fuel surveys."
good,Great company. I love working here. But as a Store manager you don't get a lot of time at home and when you do you're too tired to do anything.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company as every day was a different experience, loving meeting so many different peple from all over the place, it was fast and never with any downtime ."
good,As with any C-Store your quality of life depends on the staff you have.  Engaging with the customers is one of the best aspects of the jobs.
good,The job is very enjoyable if you have patients for customer service.  management is easy to get along with and will help you in any situation.
good,"Decent stepping-stone job."
good,"If the staff is there Murphy USA is a great place to work, if not you'll be in for a rough time. Aside from a couple people and myself no one lasts long at Murphy USA. You'll find your self being called on your days off to go in either for your store or someone else's store."
good,"Its a Good place to work at,  just sometimes management doesnt know what they are doing"
good,They gave me a lot of hours I loved that. I was a shift learder with in two months.I open and close the store.
good,a fun place to work and interact with the customers.
good,fun work place good experience except being robbed management was good hardest part of the job doing others work when they did not want to do to.
good,"Murphy USA is a good company. They're great when going around another jobs schedule.  They're a great part time second job. The Customers are all great, even the angry ones that are angry at life."
good,"They do not have personal security only the police is called when an incident,theft,or robbery takes place so it can be a dangerous place from time to time but for the most part the pay is good even though it is bi weekly.You will most defintinely get hours to work and the job is not hard once you are trained its just that some co workers or managers will try to make it hard."
good,Fue muy divertido por la manera creativas de hacer nuestras ventas del dia con diferentes challenge. Un ambiente de trabajo agradable y horario flexible. Solo que bajaron las horas a 22 horas.
good,It's a fun place to joke around with customers but you do work hard stocking and cleaning. Small store staff sizes allow for more hours tipp work each week. Not much overt time is given.
good,"This store was a kiosk, so it was basically standing in a tiny box for hours at a time taking care of a seemingly never-ending line of customers while performing other tasks in the 15-45 second moments between customer interactions."
good,Murphy USA to Murphy Express big difference but same overall functions. Greenwood to Anderson was very different. Loved my experience as an Assistant Manager.
good,I enjoy my manager. She's fair and expects good work ethic and dependability. The hours are flexible and they work with you if you have an emergency or appointments.
good,Would like to have stayed for my store that was being rebuilt but it didnt work out. Its very high paced half to keep up with stock and keep everything cleaned up and tighty
good,I love working here. I just think there needs to be more than one person working the night shift as there is so much to do for one person. I enjoy the regulars that come in. There very friendly. I feel safe working here.
good,"Good, love people , fast pace, you work in a kiosk, see a lot diff customers, u have regular customers u get to know wel...........! Management good..........."
good,"From beginning of shift to end of shift, you would see a variety of people. Most would come in with a smile and leave laughing. Assisting customers who came in not understanding the process of safety was a minor setback, but was appreciated afterwards"
good,I enjoyed working there I was a quiet and shy person that came out of my shell I met new people everyday you never knew who was going to walk through the door.
good,"Fast pace, must get customers in and out in timely fashion, and still remain courteous no matter what. I learned to deal with customers on all leverls"
good,Great company and company advances from within. Company provides incentives for management advancement throughout the organization and has a strong point in sales
good,Helping customers cleaning the store and making sure all equipment was in working order.what i learned was how to better help the customer. management was good the best part of the job was working with every one and seeing all the regular customers
good,my most enjoyable part working for this company are the customers and my Boss.  the hardest part of the job is some of the work and some of the customers.  this is a convenient store / Gas station.
good,It is always a work in progress. This company is always moving forward and very innovative. They try some things out and when they realize they don't work for the greater good they will change it up until it is reasonable for all.
good,I really liked  working at Murphys but they pay is not great at all they should pay people w experience more money  especially when it’s slot of tasks you have to do and especially when u close by yourself
good,"I worked here over 11 years, the more you do the more they wanted. It started out a great company. Then it went down hill, my bosses just wanted me to help them do their jobs, even upper management asked me too. I loved what I did but after a few more years it just became a point I had to change jobs. I love to plus sell, talk to people and make people happy."
good,Fast paced environment with good opportunity to advance in a customer service setting. Multitasking is a must and up selling is heavily taught. Good customer service skills will help you advance quickly
good,"If I open I count my draw with my money the I would put my number in the safe to run a report then to open it. Then I would count all cigs. I add them up cor paperwork. Then count deposit. Then do paper work and get change order ready. Then do a older for the store."
good,"Murphy USA is a fast paced environment. Be ready to constantly on the move, give excellent customer service. be ready to upsell every customer every time."
good,"Typical day is very busy"
good,Murphy's gives you and equal balance between working and you home life. They allow you to spend enough time at home and continue to make your money. Murphy's also gives you the hours you deserve for the work you do.
good,Murphys is a great place to work . You get noticed quickly when you work hard which provides fast advancement. Great place for some that likes to work alone. Biggest con was you are there by yourself so if there is an emergency with kids or anything you have to wait and hope you can get someone in to cover you. Doesn't work well when you have small children and no help.
good,by far THE best company i've worked for. The job is VERY laid back & it's easy to do. You don't have to do much there & the management is AWESOME only at store #7508 though
good,"Manager was great, but the hours conflicted with my children's school schedule. Very fast paced environment, but loved to meet new people."
good,I enjoyed serving customers and handling the money drawer. I was able to learn new things like counting money more and keeping computer records. I hated to leave but was unable to continue and live of that pay. The management was amazing and I would work for her again.
good,"As part-time employee you do no receive any benefits unfortunately, but the job itself is as easy and fun as it can get. As long as you keep up with most of your duties you should be fine. Management is very pleasant."
good,I arrive at work count till. Wait on customers. On down time I restock and clean. At the end of night do money and paper work and lock up.
good,"local fuel station the selling gasoline, cigarettes, and lottery.  Competitive prices on fuel and tobacco merchandise as well as monthly beverage specials"
good,"the manager was a good person and she listen to your problems and she made them better, the company could do a little better with the employees and make the pay a little more"
good,"For the type of job it is, I enjoyed my time working for the company.  I think they did their best to make me feel valued and important to the company.  My concerns were always listened to and addressed, and employee safety was a top priority."
good,"Fast paced environment where you get to meet a lot of people, some regulars and some just passing through.  Good quality and clean gas station that builds a team environment."
good,"I love working for this company! It was very smooth! Steadily following time always, the shifts went very fast. I like how the Manger and Assistants did everything."
good,Enjoyed the thrill of drilling down into the code and updated C++ to C++14. Took and received certification on Coursera; please review my resume to get specifics.
good,"As Cashier/Head Cashier I enjoyed handling Customer transactions and interaction with fellow workers/Customers."
good,It's an okay place to work if you don't have a lot of bills. The schedule is flexible the hours are okay. No real hard work needed. Very easy and simple job
good,I didnt mind working there. The manager was nice and very understanding. The scheduling was flexible. It was a fast paced job that kept me busy. It was easy to learn it.
good,I liked working there it was awsome staff amazing manager. It's a gas station job it's not easy but it was peaceful and tiring at the same time but your co workers are there if you need them and they are always willing to work with you on your work schedule for important things.
good,"Compared to same positions in the area, it was not the best; however, management saw potential in people and promoted within the company. You were able to get extra hours being borrowed to another store. Downside worked alone in a bad neighborhood."
good,"I was given a better pay rate here than at other, similar jobs.  I also received omission when I was an Asst. Mgr.  Corporate and managers are good at motivating employees and making them feel valued.  I was also given stock options."
good,Great company to work for. Always worked with my schedule and fair with hours. Pays well. Friendly working environment. Loved getting to see and meet new people everyday.
good,Good place to work overall but they cut my hours so I had to find a new job and they require more work than one person can get done if a busy store so I had to leave
good,When i worked there it was a friendly  place. I jus disnt like when a girl did a no cal no ahow and i had a day to learn all the night shifts and they said i had to park my car right by the door and it was weird and a little scary
good,"I loved working for Murphy USA ,The company was always changing to better fit the needs of it customers and to continue to grow as a company. I only left to relocate back to be close ti my family."
good,I enjoyed working for this company but left to find another challenge. I promoted up quickly in the location I was at as the assistant manager and store manager both left within a year of my original hire date. Small staff unless they hired off the street you move up as the position comes up.
good,"The store I work at- We always try to make the best of the day. Yes we have a lot of work to do but we also try to have fun and stay positive. I've learned how to manage a gas station, how to do maintenance on pumps, how to measure the underground gas tanks. The hardest part of this job is the early morning shifts."
good,Murphy usa was a relaxed place. I learned to work the cash register and stocking. My manager was really helpful and cool. The hardest part about murphy was thieves.
good,"I worked at Murphy's as a cashier for almost 3 years. Typically on the register, greeting customers, cleaning, and stocking. Great management, wouldn't have asked for anyone else. Store was always clean, pumps worked 90% of the time. Since I was the favorite, I mainly got more hours then the other cashiers. Turnover rate was a bit high. Not just my store but all around. I then got promoted to Assistant Manager and had to relocate. That was the worse decision of my life. I only stayed a day and quit. Overall, stay at the store that you are comfortable with. But the pay was pretty good; started out at $9 then once I got promoted it went up to $11.50. Hopefully I can go back when I'm eligible for rehire."
good,A lot of inventory counting but you build relationships with customers and they make it a fun workplace. You get customer service skills and knowledge that you can use in the future.
good,this is my first job after being a stay at home mom for over 6 years. its good experience and I work with some good employees. Keeps me busy but can take a lot out of me
good,I needed something fast that would work with my schedule. I was 3rd shift which is alone in a store. At times it was a challenge to deal with busy moments.
good,Fast paced which I enjoyed. Meet new people daily and get to know them. Very challenging at times especially first of every month. Friendly and outgoing co-workers which made day even better.
good,"Lots of contact with customers, I liked setting up new sales plan, inventory was required for all tobacco products every shift."
good,I learned how to deal with customer. The manger was great. The job really was easy after all the training. It really wasn't no hard part about it unless you not paying attention. The enjoyable part is who  gets the most upsell. It was a great job.
good,Performed all duties assigned to my position whether I was opening or closing the stores.  I watched videos.  I made the schedule.  I kept the place clean.
good,"I enjoyed my time as a manager for this company.  While leadership may have varied from district to district, I had an excellent district manager.  He was focused on developing his team."
good,conflicting emplyee but over all i enjoyed working there third shift is tiring but the work was pretty easy i got it done before my shift was over yea
good,"Awesome place to work at!!!"
good,"I loved working here because you worked by yourself, but sometimes it got overwhelming. However, you got treated equally and the pay was a big plus. Highly recommend!"
good,"i loved working there it was steady paced, people were nice, and i never felt unwelcome. it felt like they were a second family. the hardest part of this job for me was reaching for things up high, it was either grab it or have it fall on you."
good,Overall Great business.It was fast to catch on and easy to learn. Hours was very flexible. Managers work with you and help you. Wasn't hard work very simple
good,Very high paced job. Very fast moving. I loved the people I liked learning to keep the pace. It also included stocking and cleaning on down times. Most shifts were worked independently.
good,"I had no idea how much such a little store did. I was very impressed. I learned quite a bit working there, and my co workers helped me when I needed it."
good,good company with good people. working at a smaller store in a small town was great. I had a lot of fun working there. It wasn't always easy but nothing is. Overall really good place.
good,Fun place to work get to meet new people see new things learn better communication skills there is not hard part in the job management great
good,"I recommend more than one person working at night but it's the ideal job, managers are pretty cool, flexible with my schedule but better pay would be a little nice as well"
good,"It is hard to say how other stores perform. Ideally, since Murphy USA is a franchise it should be similar everywhere. The best thing were my co-workers. My fellow cashiers and management. Typically a day at work would be taking care of customers, being aware of when you have time to clean the lot, stock goods, and maintain the lot. One has to manage your own time and the stores time. The most important thing is to show up on time when your shift starts."
good,Working at Murphy was pretty fun and it stayed busy for the most part. I learned how to be a cashier and to deal with customers. Management was fair and my co-workers and I got along well. The hardest part of the job was trying to restock and clean while customers where still coming in. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alone.
good,"Murphy USA was a great experience. They challenged everyone to good performance and allowed employees to work together to achieve goals. A typical day was organized and driven, and leadership from the top down was aimed at seeing employees improve."
good,"This company is actually a great company to work for. The people pay very well and they offer you multiple opportunities for greatness. My store manager is wonderful and so is my district manager. They work with you to the best of their abilities. They do all that they can for you as long as you are doing the same and dedicated to the job. The most difficult thing about the job to me is the customers. Of course, depending on what area you are in, you get those customers that are very disrespectful and rude. But for the most part, you do get most customers that are so happy and full of life. The most enjoyable part about the job is meeting new people. My boss and co workers are amazing and it's nothing but fun the whole time we are there. Of course, we get our business taken care of but we do enjoy our work. All and all, this is again a great company to work for, but as a manager, it's too demanding for me only because I have kids and I would like to spend more time than my job allows me to with them. A manager position is very demanding and you are on call 24/7. The money and benefits are great but I just can't continue to put my kids aside for my job. If you do not have kids or have people that are very reliable and can help you at any given point and you are looking for a great job with wonderful pay and benefits,  Murphy's is the place to be!!!!"
good,The work environment was very unprofessional. There should be a training to make sure management act as the title they are given.
good,Really a good place to work. Employees and some Manager's are great to work with and sometimes have to help fill in for other store's that are short handed. But being that it's a gas station there are no breaks or lunches and at times it's hard to have a bathroom break.
good,It was okay. The manager at the time was stealing money from the store and blaming it on everyone else.But other than the manager it was a really good job.
good,i loved my job and my team. i miss them terribly. i would love to go back to my job at murphys! i was well taken care of. i only left due to moving from texas to south carolina
good,"get along with co workers, stable position, willingness to learn"
good,"Murphy Express will not move you up to assistant manager if you have had a suspended license in the last 3 years. That was the only downfall to this job."
good,This job was fun at times because i got to meet a lot of people. Seeing different faces most everyday & getting to know customers was exciting to me. The management there was okay.
good,"This job was an environment filled with love and laughter from the Corp. Level down to the employees. Every day I would interact with variety of customers, while also building relationships. My co-workers where nice and easy to get alone with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, but the joyful part was dealing with those customers who would come in and make my day better."
good,"i enjoyed it, the co workers were great. the job was fairly easy,"
good,"The hours are flexible, pay could be better since you're usually the only one at the store, benefits are horrible. $280/paycheck for my husband and me and that's only health insurance. No vision or dental. But it's really nice working here. Like I said, you're usually by yourself so you don't have a lot of drama between other coworkers."
good,"Just a fun chill environment that if u willing to bust your butt u can succeed and really enjoy it. Fast pace on your feet all day type of work,  you are usually solo so the focus is all on you."
good,"I have only been with the company for a couple of months so far but from coming from other companies, I must say this company makes the most sense. Can't wait to see what the future holds."
good,worked for murphy usa for 8 years the pay is great but the location was tough... no personal security provided from company late store hours. high crime high theft area
good,Murphy was a great company to work for bonus was great. Customers could be a bit challenging but once your get to know your customers it become very easy.
good,"you meet great people and at the same time a few weirdo come by. if you know anything about cigarettes you will do fine on your first day there, but if you don't have any idea about cigarettes there are coworkers there to help and teach you everything you need to know. the work is pretty relaxes some days but most of the time it's a busy place to be throughout the day/night."
good,"As long as you show up as scheduled and do your job, they are a great company to work for.  Management is very good at working with the employees if needed."
good,I look forward to coming to work most days. The culture here is a laid back family driving but not the best trustworthy environment. Growth Opportunity.
good,Quick learning move quick think fast mid day is super fast move patience love the people regular customers .fixed income customers so that mean dealing with a lot of coins and a long line on a hot day but its made me happy to help
good,There are many opportunities for advanments with company. They offer Heath insurance. Paid time off. The best thing about my experience was the people I worked for an the ones that worked for me a good crew at work makes any job 100times better. The company has locations everywhere so they are close to everything. My mother became ill so had to come back to Alabama for her or I would still be there
good,Very enjoyable.  Loved working with the people and most if the time the company took care of you. Murphy USA is a self maintenance site so took some getting use to but all and all I would recommend.
good,I loved working for Murphy as well as dealing with new people. The customers were always so nice and understanding about the work. As far as the management goes the company should really watch who they hire to run their stores or business. I have never seen such poor management and ones that don't care about the customer themselves.
good,I loved working their ...I hate I was let go why in the hospital with my child under going brain   surgery.other then that the job it self was very outstanding
good,"The job at Murphy's Express was a good learning job it was fast paced and had to deal with a different customer clientele, I also had my regulars that I really enjoyed seeing, on a day to day basis."
good,My co-workers are the best anyone could ask for.  We all work together to get the job done and make the store look great.  We also have excellent customers!
good,I love my customers. they are what makes my day. I do not like the fact that sometimes you can not use the restroom because you can not walk away for a quick moment. the management is wonderful. I could not ask for a better store manager.
good,"The Company has been good to me for the year and a half I've been there as of writing this review."
good,Productive and friendly staff. There was options for advancement after a certain period of employment. This work place was clean and organized.
good,strict environment. no free produts. clean work place. too much responsibility for a person who is only labled as a cashier
good,"Best boss I’ve had in a long time. Great regular customers as well. The pay is not the best and neither the advancement, but over all I love my job there."
good,"Easy job all the employees  where very nice and helpful  great place to work  management  was very nice "
good,No bad comments if one was in my area I would most definitely work there again. I was nervous about being in the booth alone but the busy environment eased that tension
good,Murphy USa is a great place to work if you want to advance they give you the opportunity if I had the chance to go back I most definitely would you can learn a lot
good,"I enjoy working for Murphy USA. "
good,"Murphy's is a good place to work. I am looking for another job because I have found myself working over 20 hours in one day because my employees keep calling in and there is no one to replace them. I love working for Murphy's, but I am planning to attend school in the near future and need a job with less hours and am willing to accept lower pay."
good,The company as a whole was great to work for but the Regional Managers was a little difficult to deal with.  The overall company was great. The hardest part of my job was waking up at 3:30am to open up by 5am.
good,"Fun place to work, and the management is fantastic. I love the sales competitions between my co-workers and myself. Everyone is friendly and well-mannered."
good,"The Murphy's that I work at is one of the busiest locations. The pumps fill up fast. There are a lot of regulars that come in, you end up becoming friends with the, if you work there long enough which makes the job more enjoyable."
good,"The culture of Murphy USA is what made the company incredible, they provided an amazing company to work for, and empowered you to run your store. The company made the day to day life of a store manager something worthwhile, they supported their staff and allowed you to support yours."
good,"Fantastic and fun work environment. Wonderful array of customer experiences, very relaxed yet fulfilling work. I had a great time getting to know my employees and challenging them to meet their goals."
good,"I learned alot of different area.From production, inspection, quality control, inventory, driving a forklift, shipping, receiving and management."
good,"Good environment, has a the same routine. Management was very patient and kind, especially when training. But everyone was easy to get along with and always felt good at work. Got a raise within the first month. Only con's would be no break and as a cashier you are only allowed to work 25 hours."
good,"I had a manager who had a few issues but overall the company was good to work for. "
good,"This company really cares about you as an employee. They offer programs to help pay for college courses along with many other great benefits. The health insurance is good, but the cost is extremely high compared to wages. The store manager at the Perry, Florida location is the best boss I have ever had! She is very kind and is willing to work with you on schedules medical emergencies and other like issues."
good,Fun and friendly work place. The customers are great to talk with. It is great that they give me the opportunity to learn new skills. My coworkers are friendly and very helpful when I need help with something.
good,Was a lovely time working with every one an had lots of work yo do an time to be there as well as room to grow an move up .as well as a wide variety of stores to work at an be a team mimber with
good,"Everyone that I worked closely with were all very sweet, understanding, and knew a lot about the job and had a lot of skills to help others learn the job as well."
good,They were amazing and they helped me move up in the company. I wished they’d hire me back as a assistant manager. Loved everyone I worked with even when they were messy.
good,Murphy USA is a great company to work for get to meet new people learn new  things.In to help you build your self up and learn how to deal with different type of people.
good,I have been working for this company for 4 years. It has been a pleasure to do so. They really appreciate the managers in this company! The only reason I might leave is for a better opportunity.
good,"I was working 21-hour shifts. They made me clock out at 40 hours even though I worked 6 days a week, open to close, alone. No break, No one came to check on me. I had to do Stock, Inventory, plus run the store all alone every single day. While the manager was in a luxury cabin in Gatlinburg getting paid salary. (She was related to the Regional Manager.) I worked there with dedication until I simply couldn’t take the physical toll it took on my body."
good,I had a supervisor who decided to drive up and down my road while he was on vacation. (he also lived 30+ minutes away)
good,It was OK until new mangment step in now since our old store manger left our sales been down .and the customer been complain about the new manger but other then that its OK
good,"Wonderful place to work until I was expecting a child. They made no accommodations, even though they were safety violations. Incredibly high turnover rate, partly due to management."
good,"Working for Murphy Express was Okay. I enjoyed my customers they were friendly, and I enjoyed learning about all the different types of products people bought. I also enjoyed learning how to read people. Management was unprofessional."
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, because I love what I do on a daily basis but when it comes to management now that is where the company needs to make changes.."
good,My time at Murphy USA was enjoyable. They worked with my scheduling and if i needed a day off for something important they let me off. The employees were not just employees we made each other family and i loved working here.
good,"Murphy USA is the gas stations that are mainly in front of the Wal-Mart stores.  I loved my boss, but not so much the individuals that are above him.  They used to care about the customers and unfortunately that is going by the way-side, just like a lot of other companies."
good,Fun work place. Not all about the numbers but how personally grow and develop. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and greeting them etc...
good,"I Will not speak about my job here. I loved my co-workers, and my customers.  I do not speak about any previous jobs I have ever held.  I don't believe its a good policy to have."
good,"I got fired for throwing away money, literally, but later found out that the store manager, the reason for the bad management review, got fired from the store for stealing money. I'm going to assume that she found the money, kept it, and got me fired."
good,"Murphy USA was fast paced job. you always have to make sure that your area is stocked with everything that you need. At the location, I worked at, there were no breaks so you didn't have many opportunities to leave the register. Make sure that everyone does their job."
good,Great place to work if you like to interact with customers in high volume situations. Pay is good and raises are given often through out your employment.
good,"For me things went really well because I worked hard, however I was overlooked a few times for promotions that I did work hard for and was blamed for things out of my control several times."
good,Walk in stock beer cooler than stock soda cooler check trash inside and out then stock the selves such as candy chips and sandwiches after that take over the cash register
good,Great job for people's first job or just an experience. They worked well with you when you needed them too. thanks for the experience it was well worth it.
good,I liked my job. We got a new store manager and I don't think she was trained well. I was not trained well when I became the assistant manager. I had to do her job plus my own and it got to be stressful at times.
good,Always busy from morning to night. I learned my basics at McDonalds like opening up to the customers. Workplace in McDonalds will always be crazy. The hardest part of the job would be when someone didn't show up for their shift and you get so busy customers get angry.
good,"A typical day would include debit/credit card transactions, cash handling, property management..Lottery and Tabaco sales."
good,Everything is good. it's such a great workplace. The customers are awesome as well. Great prices! Working at Murphys is such a great place to work at .
good,It Was A Great Work Place The Management was Okay The Customers Was Awesome & The Pay Was Poor But Over All The People And The Work Place Wad Good I Just Need A New Pat Rate
good,"I love my job at Murphys and think my manager is excellent at his job-being fair to his workers and the company.  This job is not for the person who needs to pay a lot of bills because as a cashier you get 3 days one week and 2 days the next.  It works great as a second job.  You will have a line in front of you for most of the time and there are no breaks or lunches and you do have chores.  But I have to say it is one of the least stressful jobs I have ever had, you dont take it home and they do not stay on your back.  I messed up they told me what I did and how to do it right and that was it.  It can be a fun job with the right attitude but not for someone who really doesnt want to work hard.  For a cashier, its great for a part time job when you dont have to pay the bills of a household."
good,I very much enjoyed working along side my manager and fellow team members. Couldn't have worked for a better manager and assistant manager! Always felt any idea or job well done never went unnoticed.
good,Murphy's USA is a great place to work. The manager is understanding and willing to help out as much as possible. The customers make your day go by faster when they are regular.
good,I have been employed with Murphy USA for a few years now. I think its a great company to work for. Would be nice to get a raise but I enjoy my job and enjoy my regular customers who I see on a regular basis.
good,I learned a lot at Murphy. They gave me a chance to grow in a field that might otherwise not be available. Movement between the company is a good example of why working at Murphy is great.
good,"Liked the flexible hours and it not being an overnight type of job. What I didn't like is the timeframe they give at closing and things they expect to be done within that timeframe. Other than that, it's a friendly environment to work at."
good,A great gas station to work at. The monroe county people are polite and very understanding.  Always busy though and you have to maintain a fast pace but politely.
good,"Good company, lots of hours, can climb the ladder, good coworkers, depends on location, same with bosses, 24 hours open, 7 days a week, good benefits."
good,Enjoyed working for Murphy's might be interested in looking for additional work with the firm in the future.  Definitely interested in working for the company again.
good,I have been with this company for 2 years an I love it my manager is a wonderful person an very understanding We have what ever a customer need at all times
good,"Advancement opportunities within the company are ever present, challenging because its fast paced, but repetitive so it's easy. Customers are regular, so you establish long lasting relationships with the people you service."
good,Management could be a little more considerate of their employees. More leniency for people who express themself. Also should be able to have set schedules as an option
good,"i really enjoyed my employment their it was the many that came thankful that made the job worth having."
good,"Since I have been employed at Murphy's Express, I've enjoyed my time as employee of a great company. I never imagined myself working at a gas station, but it was been a great challenge! You deal directly with the public. You gain tons of skills from management to people skills through their programs and on the job training. I never thought I'd be so satisfied with a company at the age 23. The only thing I see as a flaw is the feeling safe at the job and people working as a team. If there was a program to ensure both of these, it would make the job that much more enjoyable for me!"
good,"While working at Murphy USA, I was very in tune with myself. There will be time when the store is steady and the only needed to do is stock and/or clean. Being in the kiosk by myself, I had the opportunity to figure out how I worked best."
good,I liked it just didn't like the management hate I had to leave store very unorganized need new manager  on gilmer rd immediately she to young and don't know what she really doing
good,"murphys is a good company to work for the, the hours are home life friendly and the company provides their workers with great opportunities, I would like to advance in the company"
good,"good to work for learn something new every day,never a dull moment and always busy.this company cares about there employee"
good,"A typical day of work consist of providing customer service. cleaning and stocking. The Managers are good to work with, they are very understanding."
good,"A typical day at work consists of constantly working with and establishing reports with customers."
good,very positive enforcement. love working with the other employees. a place that a lot would love to be given an chance to be there and work with the public. don't get yelled at.
good,"In my opinion, this was one of the best jobs I've had. Reasoning being is because they taught me everything at such a fast pace. No one was rude, everyone was patient with me."
good,"You work with costumers all day. Its very comfortable job. As an assistant manager I had to do paperwork, bank deposits, and store inventory counts."
good,a typical day at work is greeting and helping customers that to come our store. Up sale and keep store clean at all times. I have also learned while working with the public that even when customers are not satisfied and get an attitude to keep calm and smile while helping as much as you can with the situation. While working at Murphy's I have 3 different managers and all three of them done things differently so I had to learn quickly what was a go and what I had to change. At our store we have also been through dozens of co-workers due to certain circumstances but have enjoyed working with all of them. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with such great co-workers and having a customer leave with such a great experience.
good,"Always busy, great people to work for and with. learned more about doing inventory. love working with customers."
good,"Assistant Manager for the past 9 months."
good,Great company to work for whether it's a first time job or for someone who is just wanting something to do. Would definitely recommend
good,I loved seeing and working with my customers and getting to know and meet new and different people! Overall I Learned A lot From Working At Murphy’s Gas Station
good,"Love the company itself and the customer base I have here. Upper management has lots of room for improvement. Being honest is part of the integrity principle they have in place. Unfortunately, this needs to be addressed with upper management. I feel as though the store manager is blocking employees from advancement by telling them one thing and doing something totally different."
good,The job in itself is very enjoyable. Management is great but assistant manager are horrible. They work cashiers like slaves while they do nothing. The manager works bit assistant managers feel privelleged. They hire you part time but work you full time hours.
good,"They're very reasonable place to work for. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this place to work for. Not only is the pay decent, but the work environment overall is excellent."
good,"Management is great and willing to work with you. as for working here the hardest part was getting hours. there wasn't a lot to go around. As well as working alone sometimes, but there isn't a lot for you to do so its not that big of a deal. One big down side to working here is you don't get brakes or lunches, but there is down time and you do get paid for your lunch. If your looking for a good place to work but you already have a job I recommend working here."
good,If you are wanting a fun place to work with wonderful people this is the place for you. It is a fast-paced workplace but you make good memories there and pretty good pay.
good,"customers made this job, had good co-works, but the customers was who made the job worth going back to, pay wasn't bad, building was a bit to small, felt like I was a caged animal in a crate"
good,Manager is good with communicating with employees and working around their schedule when needed. I personally like this job because you work alone for the most part
good,If you like to chill and have fun while being responsible at work this is the job for you I so hope ... the day gos by sdoo fast. You went even know you actually worked.
good,I had some amazing customers. I love working with the public. The only down side to this job was the manager. It is difficult to work with or for someone you do not respect.
good,"Working at Murphy's, I caught on really quick. I was trained in half a day and then left on my own. The management has been complicated since we've been through so many manager over the past months but things are pretty steady now."
good,They have flexible hrs and has been a Godsend!!! the management has been very forgiving when the doctor put me out of work for a back injury
good,"I learned how to fix the pumps, cashier, inventory, order supplies. I enjoyed working with the people everyone was sad when I left because they said i was a very good worker."
good,"Wait on customers, stock, clean, keep a very clean store and Bathrooms."
good,"Great place to work if tou need a flexible schedule. The old manager and assistant were  PERFECT, not sure about the new one though. Overall positive place to work."
good,"I was a manager at Murphys and the pay was awesome especially with the commission. However I felt like I never got to go home. I was alotted 150 hours and 50 of those I had to work, 40 of those went to my assistant and the rest was divided between my cashiers. Needless to say... we had a very high turnover rate."
good,"It was fun, never a full moment, fun awesome customers, regulars that came everyday. Easy work, not too many bad days. learning lotto sucked lol it was almost impossible"
good,Good place to work the manager was very sweet an understanding she always works around yo schedule if u have a problem she always understand.. she jus don’t like for u to call out at the last minute
good,Great place to work! Great people to work for! They work around your schedule! They become more than just co workers they become family and they look out for one another!
good,Nice place to work for. Have one manager and a first and second assistant. Assistant manager get commission every month if sales are higher then prior month.
good,Murphy's is a great place to work if you don't have kids or have someone at home to help watch them. They are very friendly and will try to work with you as much as they can.
good,"With the right team working at Murphy's can be great. A typical day for me was clocking in, checking the coolers, snacks, cigs and trash. Preparing my to do list for the night. Once I've done that the prior coworker should be done with their line. Now we can change the register over and deposit the money into the safe. By the end of the night I finish my to do list and prepare to close and drop the safe. I was there for two managers and they were both amazing ladies. The hardest part about my job were the disrespectful customers that would steal gas."
good,"Managers were very good, very busy and fast paced job.  Lots of customer service and upselling.  Management was very good and hours were flexible.  I enjoyed this positon."
good,"Wonderful place to work, great co-workers, very fast paced, always busy, always something to be done. Great upper management, they are always available to talk to if something is not going well."
good,"In a typical work day you had to cashier, answer phones, due gas surveys, stock, and fix the paper in the gas pumps and clean.  The hardest part is trying to clean and stock in between customers."
good,I got fired for something somebody else started and then she quit a week or 2 later. I'd only go back if there were a new manager.  Also I wouldn't recommend this working place to ANYBODY!!!
good,been here for 2 years and still love it. the manager is awesome. my team is awesome. we are very competitive. just awesomeness everywhere. the store is always verrrrrrry clean.
good,"I love the people I worked for the company just didn't care to much to help out employees. Made a commission check there, helped customers, job is fit for a person with flexible hours."
good,"Typical day at work includes but not limited to: "
good,Good environment to work for. Some employees don't work hard as others and if we are being monitored it need attention.  The most difficult is some of the customers that comes daily that or homeless and drunk and also rude.  The hardest part dealing with a coworker whose been there the longest and she is rude!!
good,Greeting and waiting on customers.  Making sure customers needs are met to their satisfaction so they will continue to shop at our store.  Answer any questions that customers may have about merchandise that may be on sale or when it may be going to be on sale.
good,greeting and severing customers.
good,I have been working for Murphy almost 5 years this is a really good company and they love taking care of their employees  I really love this company They are very understanding
good,"I enjoyed working for Murphy USA until new management took over, then I quit. The joy the customers bring to you and the joy you can give them is what made Murphy a fun environment. The new manager was trying to make the tasks/job harder than what it needed to be and I left because 8.25 was not worth me taking the bs off of management."
good,Too many bosses. Everyone complains about someone not doing anything instead of talking the problems out. The district managers only care about themselves to not get in trouble by higher ups. The managers just try to not get fired. Everyone is for themselves.
good,Awesome place to work if you are a people’s person then go for it. Be friendly some customers are really rude they don’t respond when you ask how their day is going they place the money on the counter rather than in your hands. A lot of customers don’t care about you having to clean up they go to the bathroom and leave it disgusting
good,Overall this job was one of the easiest jobs that I have ever had. Its pretty relaxed when its slow and time went by quickly when it was busy. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,Murphy strives for budgeting and bettering their company but they tend to forget the life aspect. Great pay for management with benefits and you work alone a great deal of your time there.
good,Open super early losts of different people out at this time i have to say this job helped me with customer experience so much happens in a day i learned to change pump filters an see how the gas is checked to make sure it at the right gallon for the price an helped me with lose provention as well lots of gas gets stolen. I mostly enjoyed meeting people.
good,"Nice employees, some good management, paid holidays, they work around most schedules and schooling. They close at 10-1030 that is nice no overnights. Friendly environment"
good,"It is fast paced until later on in the evening. It is a relaxed place of work when the evening comes because the pace slows down. You have side jobs during the day to keep you busy so the time passes by pretty fast. I would recommend it for someone who wants extra money with little stress, someone who is a student or someone who is flexible with their hours."
good,"Good place to work,  stressful at times but nothing to bad. My manager was amazing and worked with some troubles I had.  Corporate not so much the best but what corporation is."
good,A typical day at work was fast paced with very short breaks in between . I learned to pay attention to my surroundings at all times and to always be on my toes . My manager was nice and easy to talk but strictly about business . The hardest part of the job was restocking and checking out customers in a timely manner . I enjoyed every part of it .
good,Your experience at Murphy's depends on which location that you work at. For the most part my experiences at murphy's was very educational. I enjoy working with all types of different people and they definitely offer that.
good,Loved working for this company got fired over a simple mistake. wish i could go back. For fired for entering the wrong amount of money manual into the safe. Was a simple mistake.
good,I enjoyed working at Murphy's USA. I only left because we moved back to Florida. It was a very busy store which made your time go by. I love being busy.
good,"Great place to work if you love the public, great opportunities,major fall back is does not allow for work and life/ family balance. No leeway for illness because you are by yourself most of the day."
good,"I enjoy working with people and in a fast and fun place. It makes my day more exiting. I Also learned many things such as replacing different parts of the pumps when needed to be fixed, placing orders, cash audits and store orders many more. My favorite part I was able to make my own schedule. It made my job little more stressful cause others co-workers were not willing to do their duties."
good,I enjoy working at Murphys.  Each day was something new to look forward to.  A typical day at work consisted of joking and laughing with the customers and making the smile.  My co-workers are just as amazing as the customers.  There really isn't anything hard about the job.  If you stay focused and want to learn you can easily be promoted.
good,"I have learned more about customer service and try my best to help. As if it were me as customer. The work environment is usually pretty good even when some customers come in bad,I try to hope customer walk out smiling Eve after a bad day."
good,Easy nothing hard at all laid back managers really nice co workers are nice. Haven’t had any problems. Lots of the same people come. Only problem I have is people driving off not paying for gas.
good,i loved working at muphys i just didnt get enough hours but the customers was great . the only thing i did not like was when i work the late night shift i was there by myself
good,"Room for advancement, great people to work around, some managers tried to accommodate a flexible schedule. All in all I loved working for this company."
good,Murphy usa is one of the best places to work at. The managers always work with you. There is a lot of chances to move up in the company. I really love working there.
good,"Very nice people to work for. I personally think they could use a bigger store, for more work space. They are a very fast paced store and could use more work space and storage space as well."
good,from the staff to the customers everything was splendid. I felt safe and extremely comfortable with my co-workers and supervisors. The training experience was a lot of fun and answered all my questions
good,"Absolutely loved my time at Murphy USA. I would go back in a heartbeat if they'd have me. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you form with the customers, since you're one at a time it really gives you the chance to get to know everyone. The one and only bad thing is lack of security, I was afraid of being robbed every night."
good,"Fun place to work!  Great co-workers, great hours, great manager!  I enjoy going to work.  They offer competitive pay,  hours,  and time and a half holiday pay.  They are open from 5am-"
good,you get to meet a lot of new people. it is fast paced. you stay busy. run a cash register. its like customers service and cashier all together. over all it was a good job to work.
good,"A typical day of work consist of greeting customers and helping with the essential needs of fuel and merchandise. Learned how to deal with different people and how to respond to difficult situations that were unexpected but required immediate action. Being in management taught me very valuable tools to take on in any workplace in the future. For example, how to diffuse tensions between  employees or employees and customers. Marketing along  with other business skills was a huge benefit of working for the company. The workplace was very relaxed and assuring. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain a healthy work life balance. The job require a huge amount of hours away from family. The most enjoyable part of the job was attending the annual Disney trip. This sparked a new and exciting refresher for everyone who was there and honored everyone's accomplishments."
good,I learned to  deal with the different moods that came our regular customers weather it was good or bad my store manager was very helpful and encouraging which helped me to push and do better she taught me a lot in a small time I hate I left.
good,Murphy USA is a very organized and professional work environment. They're always about the customers and keeping store clean and food and drink prep done. They're flexible and understanding with home life.
good,I enjoy working at Murphy's the atmosphere is fun but very serious. It does not off full time to regular employees only members of management as well as health care.
good,I had a experience from working here. The management was very laid back and allowed the employees to work at their own pace. It was an easy environment to work in.
good,Love the job and would refer a friend. The job is really flexible. Great work/life balance. Manager is amazing and easy to get along with. Staff friendly.
good,"It was a good place to work. The routine was easy to adjust to, and the work was moderately easy. I really enjoyed my 7 months at the store in my home town."
good,"Each day was very rewarding for my staff and I. "
good,"Fast paced, busy work environment which required extensive customer service and problem solving skills."
good,This is a good company with a positive culture. They care about their customers and their employees. Management was fair to all employees. Schedule was flexible.
good,Murphy was my favorite place I have ever worked. The atmosphere is great. You get happy and sad customers. You just have to stay positive and understand that you are there for a job
good,Murphy’s is a great place to work and you have a chance to move up in the company. The store I worked at was one of the busiest in our district. The company pays their employees really well but the job can be stressful. As a manager I had a lot of responsibility but I loved my job it was just becoming to much physically for my body. The standing long hours on concrete was getting to me.
good,I loved woeking there. It was a wonderful environment. The customers were great and overall is a very great company to work for. I recommend them to anyone looking for a job
good,"I worked here in college and it was decent pay, flexible work hours, and management understood and worked with you. I worked here for three years and turned down an assistant manager position 3 times, but ONLY because I didn’t want to work at a gas station for the rest of my life after going to college. Would I go back to the company as a manager or dirstrict manager, YES."
good,As soon as you go in you would switch shifts but the funnest part to me is when we got a truck to unload for inventory. We would have one person work the register and us others would count all of the inventory and then stock it. They made it really fun.
good,It’s a good job just very active An long hours by yourself and a lot of responsibility. The pay is worth it An great to work with the customers. If you like this type of work or already Work in retail before then this is the job for you .its a good place if you want to learn leadership roles as well An it’s a job I’ve always wanted to do
good,It was a great place to work and had room for advancement but it was very hard to balance work and home life. The managers were great but someone always called out
good,"The place i worked at was rather enjoyable. you got to meet many interesting people. it would be either calm or busy throughout the day but overall it was not a stressful place to work.  the managers were friendly and accommodating. "
good,"My experience has been a good one, I enjoy working here for a part time job. I love my coworkers, and they treat you well. Its a good starter job for someone who is looking to get on their feet."
good,I enjoyed the learning opportunity this was for me and how it helped me grow in a  career. This position taught me how to improve my leadership skills and how to find balance between all job responsibilities while working effectively.
good,it was fast paced and a good place to work I loved the people the money was good the hours were good I worked here almost 5 years I hated to leave wish I would have never left actually
good,Nice company to work for! Excellent training programs with chance to grow in the company .great uniform purchase program and very flexible work schedules
good,"Open or Close store,  stocking, start up money for cash register, bank deposit, inventory of stock.  unloading trucks and putting away merchandise.  Keep cooler and racks stocked .Ran Cashier register, cleaning bathrooms and pumps around building.  Did repairs to gas pumps as needed, changing hoses and filters."
good,The store that I worked at only had one cashier rat a time working the afternoon/evening shift. You were not allowed to take a bathroom break and the lighting was bad in the back of the building where they kept their stock. The store that I worked for was not a safe and secure place to work.
good,"If you like fast paced busy gas stations, this would be your job. It is easy to do, and you deal with a lot of customers. Good customer service is a must."
good,it was a good company to work for. my manager and district manager was great. I loved my customers. The pay was great. The job was fairly easy..........
good,I recommend anyone working for them. Just watch out when they get new managers. Some of them change their whole crew. That's  what happened to me. It was a very good job.
good,"Constantly busy which makes day go by quickly"
good,"Murphy Usa is wonderful company to work for, its a fast pace environment. Treated you with respect and dignity. I enjoyed my time with this company. Would recommend to anyone."
good,"Great place to work, the managers are awesome, and co-workers are great. Only negative is cranky/rude/mean customers. But the customers that were regulars and nice, those made working there very easy and relaxed."
good,"working over 6 years at Murphy USA, great company with awesome benefits. As a District training Manager enjoying what I like best, meeting new people and be a brand ambassador  for Murphy USA."
good,I liked working for Murphy USA you will meet a lot of friendly people. The Manger was fair and worked with you if you needed time off or who really wanted to work they gave more hours...
good,I loved working for Murphy USA.. The fast paced work environment is tiring.. I loved my store manager and supervisor.. I was being concerted to become an assistant manager but corporate did not recognize my work ethic.. they were only concerned about my background so they fired me...
good,"Besides of the fact of short breaks, this had to be one of my favorite jobs to work at. You get to meet all sorts of people, get to learn about inventory, cleaning, and a lot about gas stations. The people are great, everyone gets along, there wasn't much drama or anyone really irate. It's all fun and games, but when it's time to be serious, we would be. I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Really like working for the company , i have learned alot in the last 7 years.  I started out as a part time clerk and with hard work have moved up ."
good,I resigned due to personal issues pertaining to pay-scale and benefits. We could not come to an agreement and so I decided to pursue other opportunities.
good,This was overall a good work experience. Decent pay and good management! It was a good way to learn good customer relation skills and customer service skills.
good,"Good place to work, nice friendly people, stock coolers, cigarettes,  and run cash register, keep lot and pumps clean, and stocked"
good,the job was a learning opportunity. I ran the register stocked and clean the pumps and run the lottery machines. the job was very fast and it kept me on my toes and I loved that.
good,great job love working with people and excelling there expectations. great management the only thing that i dislike about the company is that the hours vary and its not full time
good,"I loved working for Murphy's it was a great first job experience with awesome management who really helped me grow if the pay and hours had been better I would've stayed, and I worked with a great group of people. All of the customers were also great."
good,"Management was excellent. Always stayed on top of things. Things were always clean. Stocking & money were always fully tooken care of. Co-workers were always smiling, cheerful. Hardest part of the job would have to be stocking at night when you are by yourself and have to take care of customers and stocking. Running back and forth could put a toll on your feet (always wear nice comfortable tennis shoes). Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers. Communicating and making them happy."
good,I loved the people i worked with and it paid well for a gas station.
good,typical day includes stocking and customer service. i learned how to maintain gas pumps. Management and coworkers are willing to help. the hardest part is making sure all products are stocked and the most enjoyable part is helpin people best as you can
good,"typical day is make sure the customers get in and out of the store in a timely manner, try to make them laugh, and try to make the store and outside look clean and inviting, I've learned you can't make everyone happy but 95% of the time you can, management has really improved in the last 3 months, hardest part is making time for everything, the most enjoyable part of my job is making someone feel special and making them laugh."
good,Great place to work flexible hours great people to work with always room for advancement family friendly place to work.!!!!!!!!! Wouldnt want to work any where else
good,"I stocked the coolers, I ran the registers, I cleaned the store, I would restock shelves. I enjoyed working the third shift cause there was not a lot of people."
good,It was an amazing job with amazing people I really enjoyed my time with Murphy's. I loved my customer they were all wonderful people. I miss my customers the most. It was a quick pace environment but I loved that about it cause it kept me busy. Just an overall great place too work.
good,Working for Murphy's has been a great opportunity to grow. But once you are a store manager there is little room for growth/promotion.  This is why I want to change companies.
good,"have never felt as secure with a job as i did when i worked here. i never felt like a faceless employee, even when the ""higher ups"" came in. everyone has a job and a roll. \"
good,"The pay could only be so much, but there are raises if you prove your worth, and the people made this job great. I stayed longer than i would've because of them. You see so much being a cashier at a gas station. So many people to meet, and no day is ever really the same.  A great way to get your feet wet in a new field and I felt my area had opportunities for anyone who applied themselves to advance."
good,"Lots of room for advancement"

My managers are possibly the friendliest people I have ever met and I now consider them family as they treat me like their own. There has never been a dull moment working with my Murphy's family and I do not intend to leave them, although I am looking for more work my loyalty to Murphy's comes first. You can tell the business is successful because of the people's constant return to the store, many would think it's because of the low gas prices and that may indeed be a factor, however I am also inclined to believe that it is the constant friendly and loving attitudes of my fellow employees. Not many people are able to say they look forward to going to work, but with the employees at Murphy's Express it is impossible to say otherwise."

good,"My typical day at KFC was busy and always a different situation to resolve with customers seeming everyday. I enjoyed my job, responsibilities but there comes a time when you are ready to take a different choice of career. I thought I had made a right decision to go back and work in retail and convenience stores but the conflicts I had with my assistant manager and supervisor made it impossible for us to get along. I truly believe until this day I was hired to help get the store up and running because their mind was already made up on who they wanted to have the store. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers. I always made sure they were satisfied, and smiling. I knew what they smoked, drunk, and how many times a week they would come to the store. I learned through losing my job to not argue and try to have the last word with your BOSS! I loved working with this company because the environment, the customers, my knowledge of convenience stores, the benefits and wages they were all great."
