rating,review
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,"management completely incompetent, the worst place i've ever worked. terrible hr department, vindictive and petty. the managers at that company are without a doubt the most narcicistic people i've ever met."
bad,"People lazy, will do anything to get out of work.Supervisor too sensitive not enough sense ability. Trainer looked lost too.sealey talked bad about jamlal,couldn’t understand other guy."
bad,"best work counts for nothing. After 22 years, trained my replacement in India, then was laid off with non-compete rules. Rehired as ""consultant"" at 1/3 the cost"
bad,Been with 3M for 12 years. Used to be a good place to work. Now all they care about is shareholders and cycle times. Safety and employees come last. I would look for a smaller company if searching. This company will leave you depressed  daily and missing your family. Poor management and supervision.
bad,"Working at the Brockville 502 3M plant felt like a prison sentence. "
bad,Working at 3M for the first 2 months was Challenging and stimulating to my brain Management  changed training new hires being a temp not making production Quota perfoming duties in the cell and not being properly compensated
bad,Management is untrustworthy.   Job security is low.  Stress is high.   Reviews process is subjective.   Morale is very low.   Vision is not communicated and changes often.
bad,"Almost feels like there is a group of evil people running the show from HR to management. Either it’s their way or you are out."
bad,"Expected to work 7 days a week and bring phones home daily.  Office hours are from 11:30-5 pm expected to answer phones from 9am-9pm, and only make commission on calls taken if an appointments set.  Other employees purposely set new employees up to fail by tampering with company phones and get away with it.  The hours and pay do not equal out."
bad,"They are not focused on what they have to do and how to do , which make difficult for the person who is working there . They hired people without planning."
bad,"Company does not explain the job profile properly. Gives you an actual job different from the one explained during interviews. The job given to me was completely different from the one explained at the time of joining. To crown it all, had a terrible micro managing boss who did not understand the business needs."
bad,"Ambiance de travail médiocre,manque de considération en vers les salarier, système de management très médiocre;Poste travail pas confortable"
bad,"If you want to look for a full -time direct hiring job, don't think you can get it through Volts - 3M agency. They promise to you many good things to get you in only. "
bad,Very bad management third party xpo logistics running very badly to 3m 3m know nothing what they doing never work there supervisor are very bad and manager is racist
bad,"I worked at 3M as a contractor for a year. They treat most of the contractors like absolute garbage. These are some of the things that went on:"
bad,Worked at 3M Loughborogh I didn’t enjoy working there at all. Most people have been working there for a long time and they will not accept new comers as they are a threat. Old employees bully you if you cannot take it you move on if you like sucking then you stay. Old school do not want to learn anything new as they are stuck in their way. Worst place to work. I would stay away from 3M Loughborogh. Majority of the staff are agency employed and the will not employ you direct which I find very weird.No No progression at3M
bad,"I would NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE , if you want to be mentally abused , play the snake and rat games and getting talked about behind your back and everything that is negative then go for it , the management is TERRIBLE , it’s VERY hard to get in contact with HR or anyone for that matter , the team leads are just the absolute worst , the coworkers are toxic and FAKE . Never again ."
bad,"To much favoritism. As a temporary worker I was made to go as fast as I could, be paid way less than their full-time people and told I never made my numbers. Yet they do nothing but talk and made their numbers.  Find it unlikely."
bad,"This company looks in the mirror and sees itself as a global leader in innovation and technology. They have some ideas that look great on paper but fall incredibly short in implementation. If you're a hard worker, expect 3M to take full advantage."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,"This company treats its employees like swine and just keeps rotating the old class out and the new class in. The care zero about your well being. Forced to drive in dangerous winters snow storms while management stays home, or you lose you job. Forced OT. The nasty examples can go on and on, but the point dont do this to yourself, this company cares noting about you only how hard they can work you until you break and then they fried you and new person in right there to jump in. Its a give give to them relationship"
bad,"Stay away, the pay is good but what you give up in your personal life is not worth it. Management is bullies, safety is just a word, no sense of reality from management."
bad,"Você demora séculos para subir mesmo com méritos e resultados e a política impera em todos os níveis. Não basta ser bom, tem de sobreviver. Eu não sobrevivi. Fui perseguido pelo diretor da área e pelo diretor de compliance conivente. Fiz uma denúncia ao departamento de ética da empresa nos EUA e os dois foram demitidos mas eu não fui readmitido."
bad,"I left because it’s a toxic environment. "
bad,"I was told the job would involve both Server + Desktop work.  It was sitting around supporting laptops, requiring approval from HQ for every thing.  The person I replaced told me that he would be a resource for me, and he never replied to my emails or phone calls for on-boarding me."
bad,This is the worst job I ever had. It didn't last 3 months. They didn't know what they want or what they're doing. I would refuse working for them ever again.
bad,"Poor work culture."
bad,"The worst management you will ever get from an employer. They try to terminate people once work slows down for that time of year. The hardest part of the job is the training, because you are punished for mistakes as if you carried a licence on the PIV already."
bad,shut the doors on employees. poorly ran dirty place to work for. management only wanted to get you in trouble nothing else. worse place I ever worked.
bad,"I have been waiting three months and after 2 day in  I they sacked me without any good reason. "
bad,"As far as management, to many chief and not enough Indians. to many politics, if it weren't for the money I would have never even considered working there."
bad,Managers yell at teams and use threats and coercion. My team finished their first assignment early.Our metrics made the client look bad when compared to full time engineers. Our code was of higher quality too. 3M seemed lost and embarrassed. They treat contractors like dogs
bad,"Worst place to have ever worked at. No communication. No training, just jump right in with both feet and sink or swim.  On call 24/7, 365 days a year."
bad,"Fast paced inviroment supposed to switch jobs every 2 hrs but that never happened for me i was the packer.then they would hire small framed women,they wouldent even switch with me cause they couldnt do the job i was doing all day."
bad,"Rotating shifts 3rd, 2nd, 1st, then back to 3rd again with an 8 hour turn around. There are straight shifts available if you have some time in, but to get a straight day shift you have to be a 3M dinosaur. 3/4 of all employees are from the same small town so friends and family get the good positions. If you're not from the area you will be kept from ever being from the area. High school atmosphere - gossip is horrendous. Back stabbing, butt kissing environment. Mundane work. You will make decent money there but will never have time to spend any of it because you're always stuck at 3M. Due to the mandatory overtime you will never see your family. Management are liars and will throw you under the bus to save their skin. They drug test at time of employment but once your hired it's a free for all. It seems like corporate is trying to make improvements, but 3M New Ulm has some pretty bad stuff going on."
bad,the company was doing very well until 3m took over. things changed and the kept out sourcing job to another plant in new York. probably one of the best jobs I ever had wish that it would've lasted
bad,"Very cut throat.  I think this had more to do with the contracting agency rather than 3M itself, but still a really negative experience all the way around"
bad,Racist people poor management seniority rules this place. They treat their temps like trash. Hope my reviews help people decide if they want to work here
bad,Management does not care about the people they employ. Poorly organized and a lot of bad moral in the whole workplace. Plant supervisors are clueless as to how the operation runs. This is why they cannot keep any good employees. Very high turnover and zero chance of advancement.
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,"do not be a temp at this company. It is awful and I got fired for calling out an another employee for bullying. disgusting, they will never hire any of their temps unless you suck up"
bad,If your thinking about working here think again cause you will be stressed out and in pain all day. Never have time for your family. They work you to death here overtime all the time forced so you have to work it and working weekend all the time forced. When I worked there I never had time to do anything. The management is heartless people too they don't care about anything or anyone.
bad,"Wasnt the job for me so i didnt end ip staying here very long, boaring noone talks and very long hour too early on starting or too late finishing for my lofe style"
bad,Carga y descarga de camiones inventarios manejo de scaner por medio de Sista SAP devolución de materiales
bad,"Poor management, poor handling of issues. Those in leadership roles are inexperienced, no clue how to run a manufacturing department or facility. From HR to production supervisors, no one seems to have knowledge about or want to be involved in their actual position."
bad,This is a chemical plant that doesn't follow SOP. The procedures are not safe and the employees are not motivated because of lack of support from management. There is bare to minimum advancement opportunity. Low quality work environment NOT SAFE
bad,"I worked there a yr as a temp. Killed myself. Never got hired cld never speak to any 1 in hr. The employees r nothing but drama, adult themed & drugs.. Corp. Or management doesn't seem to care.. The Lines are always down. Supervisor come in messed up. Line operators are allowing bad product to go through just to make their numbers."
bad,"when i worked here it was 0 hour contracts so the managers would get rid of staff with a click of the fingers. no windows so wouldn't see daylight for 10 hours. shift pattern, so 1 week would be 6am-2pm and the next week 2pm-10pm. minimum wage. asked everyday to do overtime that day or at weekend and regardless if you have child custody or made arrangements they would tell you off for not agreeing to do overtime and as a result the manager would sack you! absolute rubbish company to work for, but usually they get round this because they work through an agency that do all their dirty work for them. and you earn a days holiday for every 2 weeks you work yet will get a warning for using the holiday if they didn't agree with the reason for holiday."
bad,"Worst place I ever worked; run by politician wanna bees. The managers run the joint with little knowledge of employee issues. Run from the top down. No accountability for managrrs and higher ups.  Micro managing for everyone else. Not a place to grow. "
bad,"A typical day at work starts from every month beginning to 15th."
bad,"Empresa excelente, que figura entra as 150 melhores empresas para se trabalhar."
bad,Motorista de caminhão na carga e descarga no ramo da construção cívil; aprendi ainda mais a lhe dar com clientes; gerência confusa; bons colegas de trabalho; a parte mais dificil era executar entregas longas e com cargas fora do peso bruto padrão; a prte mais agradável era almoçar com os colegas.
bad,"4 crew rotations mandatory weekends ,,living the job no free time no advancement ,,kid of hard to advance when you switch your schedule every week days afternoons,mmidnights,weekends hard to move foreward working these shifts ,,always tired no sleep schedule,dont eat right,no time to excersize,no time for vacation or weekend fun"
bad,"My employment was short lived with 3M. The company I worked for was bought out by 3M and due to lack of experience in the field our company was in, 3M could not successfully manage the team."
bad,"there were too many whiners, a lot of favoritism, they rehire alcoholics, i go into stores now and see all the ear plugs with short fills, didnt happen when i was there"
bad,"Melhor empresa que já conheci na minha vida, alto grau profissional da chefia, pessoas inteligentes e extremamente esforçadas. Aprendizado constante através de cursos e ajuda dos colegas de trabalho. Alto grau de ética."
bad,"Working as an “899 employee” for 3M in Valley, NE is an experience I will never forget.  3M intentionally takes advantage of and abuses federal law by using the law to hire only “temps” (who they don’t have to pay benefits to & can only work 899 hours before having to give benefits or terminate).  At that point, they terminate you and IMMEDIATELY hire another temp.  This is against the law.  They have made a cottage industry of this and are abusing the intent of the federal law.  They openly don’t care & actually have perm employees dedicated to nothing but cycling temps in and out on a constant basis.  Again, this type of behavior is not the intent of federal law."
bad,"très mauvaise entreprise"
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,我回國第一個工作、上司人満親切、可是薪資太低、同事之間很融洽。3M會要求固定公司要進多少貨、其時當經銷商沒這麼容易、因為市面上都充満了3M的東西、根本没有競争力、除非價格很低以外、根本没有利潤。
bad,What I mean by buddy system is there’s no real way to advance you gotta get in there with the boss he has to like you before you advance I started 4 years ago and I been wondering and asking how to get to a level 3 maintenance tech and I’m saying I’m 20 years experienced and I hired in as a level 2 and I still am and my boss was retiring he secretly called his buddy’s in his office one at a time and leveled them up even guys that come to work there years after me and it’s not because of there performance because one or two of those guys are still lost and can’t weld
bad,The management treated me like I was 7 years old. Ignored my suggestions on things I did every day. Then came to me and said I had been making mistakes for 2 months but never showed them to me. Never gave me the days off I requested. None of the mid-level management seemed competent
bad,"Stressful & full of back stabbers. Can’t trust anyone. it doesn’t matter how hard you work for this company or how many nights and weekends you work, for them you are just a number which is very unfortunate to see in a company like this."
bad,They don’t care about their works well being it’s a health hazard and they do not follow protocol. If you get injured or sick on the job they just shrug you off.
bad,"3M is a good company with very bad management in the Gulf. The management and HR had absolutely no interest in the people or customers. "
bad,"People all over others peoples business. Bad supervisors with no people skills. HR always on superiors side. No life balance, upper management just cares about their own benefit."
bad,"3M used to be a great place to work. They are now outsourcing alot of the Accounting/Finance jobs to Costa Rica. To get in there as an employee you need a Bachelor or better. Work experience with them or past jobs do not count. Even if your already an employee needing to switch jobs.  As a contractor you work 6 months. Possibly get extended 6 more months and then your done. You would think after training you would keep them till the end of the assignment.  When your assignment is done you must wait 6 months to get back in. There is no training and alot of unhappy customers. Both internal and external.  Whats left of the employee's have checked out, don't care just going through the motions to collect their buy out pay."
bad,"Would not recommend to work here. Long hours, rotating shifts, poor management. Some people are good to work with, but most are looking out for themselves, not the company."
bad,"If I had it to do over again, after having been here for almost a year, I would never have accepted this job. They treat contract workers like they are trash. They have parties and free food and make sure you know that you are not invited or welcome to eat the food or participate in any way. They even have meetings that will include treats that you will not be included. It's appalling! And THEN all of their employees keep giving you some story as to why they feel it's ok to treat you so poorly. What a joke!"
bad,"Upon my arrival, I have given multiple different tasks. However, I never felt I was able to fully utilize my skills and education to the fullest. Executive Management was rarely in the office, and the office was disorganized with no policies, procedures or appropriate leadership to take the office to the next level. There were ""favorites"" within the office in which did not allow others to advance or show their true abilities. If you join this company, get ready to wear many hats and/or be placed in a position in which your skills and education is not utilized to the fullest. I can say that my co-workers were a pleasure to work with."
bad,"Transportation Division -- Do not follow normal software maintenance practices. Complicated work environment, micro-management, dated products, & misguided leadership"
bad,All in all very unpleasant experience with 3m. Mandatory overtime 10 hr shifts 6 or 7 days a week. Very poorly managed hard work overlooked constant favoritism. Supervisors will punish u and laugh in your face. Approve your vacation and then punish you when u get back from it And to top it all off fire you for bringing in a legit doctors note.
bad,"This company has very poor leadership. Decisions about who takes key leadership positions are not based on performance and competency, they are based on who a person knows and what click they belong to."
bad,"As with all other Fortune 500 companies, 3M places extraordinary demands and stress on employees with the expectations to do more with less while simultaneously reducing benefits."
bad,"I could give many examples to demonstrate how management at 3M no longer cares about it workers, but this one will prove the point:"
bad,Very poor management and shift leader was like bk at school.no one wanted to work only the agency staff worked and was treated poor. Bad place for your health.wouldnt work there again even if I was payed 100 per hour
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,"When you go on break, everyone talks behind your back, and when you come back from break, the next person goes on break and then they try to talk behind their back. Summer Temps aren't compensated fairly; it was like pulling teeth to have the Hutchinson location up their Summer Temp wage to 12.50 an hour instead of the 10 dollars an hour that it was for several several years. My team leader was a sexist 'yes man'."
bad,"I've worked in many local factories and this one takes the cake for the most miserable job I've ever worked.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere....there's a very slim chance that you will have a good experience here."
bad,Very unhappy employees company wide. First tier management has no decision making power to help make the changes they see with the work force. Employees generally feel like a number and an expendable resource.
bad,"3M used to be a premier company to work for. Unfortunately, it has changed completely, for the worst, over the past few years. Very poor management, very short-sighted planning, and lacking long-term vision. Employees are no longer treated like the founder intended as “3M’s most important resource.” So many lawsuits against 3M currently due to illegal practices."
bad,"- Not a good environment."
bad,Their view of management was that managers could manage regardless of knowledge of market or products.  My last manager was a functional alcoholic that was a corporate yes man.  He also committed fraud and when exposed he was promoted. I never had a good manager in the last 10 years of my employment.  They were only interested in their next job
bad,"Death treat, hostile co-workers dangerous work environment...on the job injuries major problems. I worked hard always to work on time little slower then other workers, hand injury, but 3M ignored my doctor's note. Fired. Other workers faster, but showing up to work sometimes an hour late multiple bathroom breaks water fountain breaks did each others work assignments back talked management and team leads, but not fired. My quality of work was good. Other workers even though faster had so many mistakes and product re-work even more so when I left for vacation got back, a whole week of re-work had to be done. 3M wants speed but quality of product, they could care less. Sad very sad. Many foreign workers working hurt don't know their rights or afraid to complain. They told me- several employees- if you complain, you get fired. Well, I complained right before leaving for vacation. Got back, got fired. Go figure. Flemington, NJ 3M Location."
bad,"I grew up with the idea that 3M was an innovative workplace that rewarded innovators and hard work. Instead, I found a culture where affirmative action and seniority determine advancement over performance, hard work, and results. There is a two-class system in place. First, employees with over 20 years experience waiting for retirement. Second, a global politically correct class filling quotas and making brochures look appealing. Finally, the bureaucracy is a substantial hurdle to innovation. Ultimately even with substantial investment in R&D as a percentage, inorganic growth via large investment in acquisitions is the only way they can compete in emerging technology."
bad,"Company is a Union based company, just has a lot of challenges that come along with it being a union based company. Needs to be more fair, firm and consistent in decision making. Company needs to stand firm and not give into Union."
bad,"Menomonie HR Dept all need to be fired. Worst I've ever had to work with, no communications, no one is around they never follow up or thru with people"
bad,"unless you like being treated like you are a prisoner being told when you can eat, use the restroom and talk to others. I highly suggest you dont work here. They treat their employees horribly and seem to have a double standard for work there."
bad,Not a good place to work. I was not a worker i was just a number and you can work really hard as a temp and then they will reject you to b a full time
bad,Started at a great pace then eventually hit a wall that started a. Downward spiral till i couldn't make progress with out management stopping production with incorrect suggestions.
bad,"the company i felt did not care about myself or other employees. we were not people, we were numbers and were treated as such on a daily basis. i enjoyed my job and my co workers"
bad,"if you are good at being a ""yes"" person, even if you disagree, then you have a good start.  If you don't have a college education, then you have no chance for advancement."
bad,"all is fine....everything is nice...its a good company who give me chance to learn"
bad,"As a Volt employee at 3M you are treated like a mindless replaceable worker ant.  The higher ups couldn't do the labor jobs if their lives depended on it.  Jobs include making shipping boxes, palletizing, packaging, and anywhere else they can fit you on the assembly line.  With the little amount of money they pay you I do not recommend them to anyone"
bad,"3M -Hires many contract workers but they rarely hire them permanently. They hire lots of contract workers so their books (""buckets"") look better.   As a contract worker, you will almost never be invited to company meetings, employee picnics, etc. This only creates an unfair work environments and the bad overall moral in the company.  It's like someone in a meeting said one day ""Hey, I got a great way to save money and maximize stockholders earnings, let's hire a bunch of high quality people at low wages through a temporary service company, make them think they are low rank employee material and then keep them here for years dangling a carrot above them making them think they will actually become a 3M employee some day"".  I am just saying....."
bad,"The job pays well, but you work with the worst people imaginable who think they are superior. They treat all outsiders unfairly, especially immigrants. If you are perceived to be an outsider, wether you are from Florida or Ghana, you will never get any promotion. If you went to Brookings High School, and you are perfectly average, you are likely destined for management."
bad,Shift work sucks ! Couldn't get used to it. Great job and well paid if you are single and have no kids! You are just a # when it comes to dangerous jobs or chemicals because production is #1 not you or safety!!
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,Basic work days with not a lot to offer in regards to moving up in the company. Expect constant work with basic benefits and low wages. They will also lay you off and lock you months out until they decide to bring you back forcing you to quit without getting a separation package. At least Ceradyne got bought by Avon Plastics
bad,"No room for progressing in this career unless you hangout and drink beer with all the other supervisors. It's not what you know its who you know. HORRIBLE work life balance. I have missed my kids birthdays and other important events in my personal life. Management dont care about anything else but progressing themselves through this career, not one once of care for employees. I once got sent home for being sick, THEY sent me home, and I had to use my own vacation to cover for a day they forced me to go home. The ONLY good thing about this job is paycheck and benefits but money isnt everything. If you want a job where management could care less about you and you're looked down on this is the job for you."
bad,"I was basically forced to retire. They were getting the old dogs out to bring in cheaper employees. Woman supervisor we had did not know the job, did not deal with customer or people well. Blame us for all the things she did wrong. She had no business in being a supervisor position."
bad,"If you don't have a career with a high status here, be prepared to have people look down their noses at you. A lot of dirty looks,  ignored salutations, and plain rudeness. Harrassment is overlooked, problems with troublesome coworkers ignored, all in all, ended up hating my job. The environment quickly becomes intolerable."
bad,Nous ne sommes pas à même d être opérationnelle en 4 semaines .
bad,"I worked at the Eden Prairie facility for two years and let me tell you what a big waste of time. The management comes and goes - no stability. Career advancement is doled out to relatives of supervisors or their cronies - so if your not, ""the popular kid"",  forget about going anywhere. Salaries are low so you have to work 12 hour days 6 days a week to make a decent salary. Very boring repetitive work. Coworkers were not very well educated and most of them were not able to carry on routine conversations. Do not work at this place."
bad,Poor management. Stressful work environment.  High turn around. A typical day at work. I also learned to drive a forklift.  I did not enjoy working at 3M.
bad,Don't waste your time. Used to be the best job in town now the the worst. They throw away 10-20 year employees like they are nothing. Ruin families by doing so. Now the place employees multiple felons.
bad,"Not a big fan of working for corporations or doing shift work, just not for me. Will never work for a company like this ever again. Not a good experience."
bad,"I put in 2 Years into the Company. Worked hard everyday, made it to work everyday. Good work and Great pay.... But the Management is so terrible that your job will always be at risk... They will find ways to get everyone out the door that doesnt agree with what happens around the warehouse.... I gave everything to work for a company that fired me and has changed the reason on why i got fired now 3x...  AND I WATCHED MANY OTHERS GET WALKED OUT OVER ACTIONS THAT WERE NOT THEIR FAULT"
bad,There was little to no direction provided. Expectations never communicated. Project budget cut without warning resulting in multiple layoffs. The people were nice though.
bad,"The company is over managed, and there tends to be a disconcert between management and the production workers."
bad,They want you to do more work than full time employees and expect excellence even though they pay unlivable wages to contracts with no benefits. There are no opportunities for full time work no matter how good you are at your job.  Full time employees treat contracts like garbage.  Most ignore you and won't even say good morning to you.  Your expected to work like a robot and keep your mouth shut.  The only good thing about this place is that you don't have to sign a confidentiality statement so you can freely give your knowledge to your next employer.
bad,"I worked for 3M for about 2-3 months before my assume that ended, I seen this job being very promising. But after a only a few months of work , they chose not to keep any of the Temp to Hire Workers."
bad,"Work employees entirely too hard. I havent had a day off or a weekend off with out taking vacation in more than 3 months. They dont usually aprove shift deviations for anything. working overtime every week day. forced 10 hour days, plus saturdays, and some sundays. all i do is pick boxes that are up to 50 lbs per carton."
bad,"Local plant management is very ""out of touch"" with the current work environments on the floor.  They institute policies that make working on the floor very difficult and inefficient.  It stems from a large disconnect from the management teams, and the actual production operations on the floor. "
bad,A typical day at work would start with stretching.After that to desk to get orders for the day then pick orders using pickers and pallet jacks then palletize have order checked then weigh and wrap pallet put on shipping dock.Then proceed to run paperwork on computer such as bill of lading etc.The end of day was cleaning up and calling shipments in.
bad,You have to kiss up to leads and managers in order to become a full time employee and such. The environment is very unfair and is all based on favoritisms
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,"It was two to three weeks before I met the manager I actually worked for, the interviewer was my managers supervisor. I found myself struggling to keep busy. The staff would leave to visit customer sites, without letting me know. So I found out after the fact that there were no assignments for me. Distribution of work was sketchy at best, and as an  outside contractor, there was a minimal effort to make me feel that I was part of the team. I felt that I was expendable."
bad,"No choice in what area or job you start in, they place you wherever they want you. Give everyone an equal opportunity to advance, seemed to be a lot of favoritism for minorities at the Springfield, Mo plant!"
bad,"Entry level workers are used as tools. The only time I see my boss is when there is something he doesn't want to do so he dumps it off on me. Little support is offered in my position. Even as an engineer there is little encouragement for innovation or independent thought. The culture of the company is terrible and amounts to simply keeping your head down and avoiding interaction. There is no culture of working hard, nor of making friends."
bad,Promised alot of benefits and job related bonus' but never happen fill you with lies so that you get job done they tell you there is always opportunities to progress which never happens staff having relationships with management so the other staff feel mistreated overall stay away and apply for a different job
bad,This was an absolutely ridiculous experience. The supervisor was incompetent. Many of the personnel were unqualified for their job. Management did not care about inappropriate behavior by some employees such as touching and arriving for work intoxicated. What a joke..
bad,"3M is a great company to work for. Good benefits, The major problem is management. If you get a closed door manager your career is limited. Mid- and Department level managers are not supportive.  They will stand behind there rules and HR stuff. I took my retirement and walked away fast."
bad,Absolutely most horrific experience working for the managers of 3M.  They acquired the previous company I worked for and went through 6 Organization changes in 7 years and then ended up selling the business because they couldn't figure out how to make it work.
bad,Relaxed atmosphere constant training . I did not care for the rotating shift work. They did not have the strongest union but were very well informed and easy to talk to.
bad,Half the managers knew how to keep things flowing and the other half didn’t even run their departments well enough to keep continuous product being made.
bad,There is no training process at all for a new supply chain analyst. You are basically told to take over products from various other analysts with no real knowledge of the products themselves. and their inventory and production systems are still from the 90's and constantly have bad information so you are pretty much forced to guess and get yelled at when something goes wrong. I would not recommend working in this toxic environment. The existing analysts will basically ignore your entire existence
bad,"If you are looking for a job that the management sees you only as a number, you have zero work life balance and your pay is flat rate based, not on your work ability and ethics,then please apply here."
bad,you will most likely not get hired no matter how well you do if you try to do temp to hire. the people you work with are great but the upper management doesn't seem to think about the employees.
bad,"Had always heard great things about this company. Boy, was I disappointed! The money is not even worth what you have to go through. Mandatory overtime, poor management."
bad,Too much OT and 3M refuses to hire and fill open spot. Would rather overwork employees. Good pay but shift stink. No advancement unless you like kissing butt
bad,Used to be a great environment. Not so much now employees look like they are beat down. Pay is ok and good benifits. But is it worth family falling apart.... 3m is now just corporate greed. Management sucks they are more worried about themselves than where and who they work with. No accountability anymore.
bad,there's too much to type and it would sound like one giant complaint in the end. ive worked a few places in my life but ive never seen a place operate anything like this.
bad,management is very poor!!! needs to treat the temp employees much better Richard Bias needs to be FIREDDDD!!!!! I Learned They don't take temp jobs serious as the take the employees who is hired directly
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,"3M has become a diverse monster of a company.  It is a great place to solve problems if you are adequately motivated to do so.  There are many valuable resources available to you at 3M.  Because of these resources, I have been able to amass a wealth of knowledge in my area of study in a short time.  "
bad,I worked there for nine years they let me go for missing a meeting. They don't care about your personal life or problems. If you encounter personal problems they will fire you as soon as they can !!!!
bad,"If you're looking for a position that offers a daily slog with little to no hope for advancement, this is the place for you. I had high hopes when 3M took over, but the only discernible change was mandatory meetings around Lean Six Sigma, nothing positive around direction or management. My manager was a nice enough guy, but cared only about lunch and the game room. There was no amount of hard work, completed projects, or going above and beyond that resulted in a raise, promotion, or even a modicum of recognition. The place is not for the truly talented, creative, or ambitious."
bad," Benifits and pay being taken away or lowered.The thing I did not like is the way Manpower temp. personell are treated like a lower class. The coating dept. manager was a decent engineer but is not a people person,this is the case in many managers,they have no place managing people as they do not understand how to relate to them. This is the reason for high turnover of employees and low quality products by inexperianced operators. Poor quality products are begining to get to the customers,bad for a medical plant. A whole new set of H.R. managers is needed due to their bad reputation of employee trust."
bad,"I worked for 3m HIS for 10 months. It was a horrible experience. My manager was way too over worked and never available to me for help. I recieved no training and I was way to over worked. I felt like a work mule. They expected me to handle the work of 5 people and still provide perfect products. At one time I had 12 projects at the same time with very specific and different requirements and deadlines for each. I tried going to my manager for help, but she just shrugged her shoulders and told me to carry on. Then when I had that many projects at a time, and didn't have time to perfect my deliverables, I was reprimanded for less than perfect work by leadership. Everyone in my department was way over worked and stressed too. Leadership had downsized employment, with a small amount of workers to do the work of several people. Do not work for this company, you will be disapointed like I was."
bad,"Company cares more about their own personal advantancement, especially management. Will step on you and your family to accomplish just that while looking you right in the eyes and telling you how much they love you. Good place to make money, just don't make long term plans. Layoff every year. Promotions by the ""good ol' boy system""."
bad,"The work isn't hard at all but if you're looking to get hired you can forget about it unless you know someone or are willing to do some ""under the table"" work for the people who decide who gets hired."
bad,"Apparently in a learning phase, 3M is not being run by experienced people. They've lost much of their culture by trying to act like they are ""Google"" and their growth engine of innovation seems only to be fueled through acquisitions.  It's hard to say what they will look like in 10 years but it will not likely be the innovators or a place that felt like ""home"" that it once was.  Losing a lot of what made it special and becoming like any indifferent company that thinks what it pushes on social media is how it will be perceived. Just doesn't work that way."
bad,"Management organisé en mafiat, aucune conscience réelle du travail effectué, et évaluation annuelle défini par ceux qui auront le plus dégueulès sur vous !!! Politique salariale inexistante, avec des objectifs intenables."

bad,"La carga de trabajo es altisima."
bad,I've worked on and off contract jobs with 3m and I love the work I like all my co-workers and I like my boss as well. Arguably it's very easy to learn my job and do well. This is due to a very good structure training and learning of the work. However corporate seems to be too interested investors and less interested in employees and consumers. Don't ever count on being hired
bad,"no work/life balance. family takes a backseat. never know when youll be required in advanced, its always at end of shift, might be placed on jobs you have never done before."
bad,"3M has changed in so many ways, and when it comes to employees that are in the baby boom generation, not for the better. D & I does not include age, especially not for older women who still have a good 20 years left in the workforce. I worked in a department where 3 women each did a job that one person could have done. I did more work in the job I came from in 1 day than these three did in a week. No collaboration or teamwork. Corporate Communications is run by directors who manage up instead of set good examples for their workforce. They only care about what the higher levels executives and see and think of their work. Don't know why 3M is hiring so many Target ship-jumpers or castoffs???"
bad,"Buena empresa, con buen ambiente laboral, buena jefatura"
bad,If you have a family or want to have a life do not work for this company. The only thing they care about is production and they will make you work 6 days a week for 1-8 months straight.
bad,Great compensation but it is one of those high responsibility jobs where one hates to go to work. I used to enjoy factory work before 3M.
bad,"They make it sound like you're doing important work, but don't trust you to do anything of quality. My hands and wrists hurt after work everyday from mixing so much."
bad,"Most people are nice,but working Every day gets old and makes you grumpy. Took all Bonus and Incentive pay away and lowered starting pay by over 3 dollars an hour. Great place to Stay Away from especialy if you have a family becouse your treated like a number and work all the time. School play or ball game,tough,you are not going. When people talk about having to work there it is a last resort. Used to be the best Factory work in town but lost it's luster,mostly due to an unsuportive H.R. Dept."

bad,"Upper management has no idea how to run a productive manufacturing floor, so they hire supervisors from DIFFERENT departments to supervise a department they have absolutely no knowledge of. Every employee knows how bad it is, but the pay and benefits unfortunately keep everyone content enough to stay. (seniority keeps a lot of people there as well)"
bad,"It's worse then elementary school for stupid drama! "
bad,"Not a good place to work. I dreaded going to work every single day. The management is a joke and nothing ever gets done. People spend all day in meetings, but nothing gets accomplished."

bad,"3M treat their temp like Garbage, poor management, low pay.no benefits ,job culture bad, bad training ,bad verbal communication skills"
bad,"This place was a joke from start to finish. If you want to work 4 hours a day and get paid for 8 3m is the place to work. Management is rarely seen, always in ""meetings"" wink wink. The team leads where unbelievably lazy, and HR danced around more questions then they would actually answer. Problems were swept under the rug, lazy temps were hired while the ones that worked would time out. This was a very sad excuse for a manufacturing plant. ultimately the doors were closed. Big shocker..."
bad,"Although the pay and benefits are 90% higher then most logistics companies in the area, the job security is questionable."
bad,"Ich habe dort 8 Monate gearbeitet im Bereich diapes und alle drei Bereiche bzw. vier vom Flyer bis hin zum verpacken erlernt und hab dort in allen Bereichen erweiterte Kenntnisse und kann selbständig arbeiten, dennoch wird man dort von dem Gruppenleiter/Abteilungsleiter (Schicht: C) sehr stark beeinträchtigt und rausgeekelt durch die Mitarbeiter die einen schlecht reden, da man von der Leihfirma kommt und behandelt wird als wären wir Menschen unterer Schicht. Angeblich nicht zufrieden mit meiner Arbeitsleistung, aber den Kollegen sagen das ich eigentlich sehr gut arbeite und nur mein menschliches denen nicht passt! Das ist heutzutage ein Grund das ein Mensch kein Brot mehr nach Hause bringen darf!!!"
bad,"A typical day at work was usually very busy and hard to move around on equipment because overtime shifts overlapped. The job is generally very repetitive but if you prove competent you can perform more functions after about six months to break up the monotony."
bad,"my shift manager was always telling me I didn't put out enough work compared to other shifts but were many a night I out did  the other shifts."
bad,The hours worked are long. Its very hard to find childcare for the kinds of hours that need to be worked. The management is okay. The only down fall is there isn't any paid time off.
bad,"If you get into the right dept you may do alright here. But if you're looking for more than an easy paycheck, and want a fulfilling career, go do what you're meant to do. Mgmt is by far the worst ive ever dealt with. All they care about is themselves and how they can climb up the ladder. Hard workers do not get recognized and it's just expected of you while lazy p0s play the game and move up. With how many hours they force you to work you might as well go get a blue collar job and make twice as much for half a years work. I turned a very good career down when i first started here to give it a shot and have regretted it ever since. High school drama all over again multiplied by a factor of 10. So many depts waste so much material, mgmt asks you for your input then talks down to you because you have some common sense. Stay away, if not then good luck."
bad,Tarde à tenir compte de la pénibilitée au travail :résultats 4 opération du dos(suite a un accident du travail) et licenciement en remerciements.
bad,"3M is a chemical plant with very strong fumes. Second day on the production floor I was being talked down to by employees that had worked there for several years. Management looks at you as a number, not as a person that with proper training could be one of the most productive employees they've ever hired. 3M is notorious for making people come in 4 hours early, as well as stay over for 4 hours. With all the required overtime, I felt like I could never get a break to spend time with my family. This company is very safety conscious, so do not cut corners. If you smoke or chew tobacco, you won't be able to do so at this plant and that does include breaks. Requesting a change of shift, even if there is an open position to work on that shift will not be granted by management. This job pays very well across the board, but it takes a special kind of person to work here. If you're good at crossing all your t's and dotting all your i's, then I suggest working here. If that becomes bothersome to you on the daily, then I would highly encourage you to seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"3M has no business being in software.  They're trying to expand beyond manufacturing but upper management wouldn't know a good software business model if it slapped them in the face.  They purchased several disparate software companies, tried to merge them into 3M and have basically destroyed them."
bad,"The compensation met my requirements, but advancement was based how good of friends you were with upper management.  There is no such things as employee rights.  The Human Resources Department does not have the best interest of the employee.  Not an overall good experience!!"
bad,It's a decent workplace but the supervisors watch you closely and drive around the warehouse at least 10 times a day in a group of 3 and confront you together.  You do also have to keep up your productivity. It's a good place to work but gets stressful sometimes because you're always being watched by supervisors waiting for you to make a mistake.

Most manufacturing locations are in small dinky towns in the middle of nowhere with no chance for growth or promotion; people who have the nice positions stay for life, it's extremely stagnant. "
bad,It was a good job at 3M Scientific Anglers in Midland MI but the co-workers and supervisors treated you like dirt. If you were a temporary help you were a 3rd world worker. They covered up harassment and swept it under the table.
bad,Did not feel part of a team.  Work was not difficult but teamwork lacking.  Management runs hot an cold with support and direction.  If you need support from your team you ware pretty much on your own
bad,I was trained on new software called CodSoft to create labels. It was definitely interesting to learn new things. The work environment was very relaxed. If I do my job they don't' care if I am somewhere else so I would usually fo the YMCA for my lunch to spent 25 more minutes to exercise. It was a win-win situation.

bad,I read all of my work instructions along with SOP's and then got let go because I wasn't qualified. Funny considering the told the temp company that we were working long hours and that they needed me to finish out the day. You don't want someone to finish out the day on an important job when they are not qualified.
bad,If management does not like you as a person  forget it.  Does not matter how hard you work or how good  you are at the job.  In my review I got marked as excellent worker and knowledgeable but in comments was written needs to become more knowledgeable of the job and become more proficient.  Totally opposite of each other.  HR agree but still allowed it.  Was not put in hiring pool.
bad,I was a contract worker while working there management was out of touch with dept. there was no sense of role definition. Was hired for a year but only lasted 3 months due to the team being relocated to MN.  To many unhappy employees always vocal about being unhappy. Not a pleasant surrounding.
bad,"There are no opportunities for advancement, no team spirit, no recognition, everyone works at takes their time on projects and that puts stress on other co-workers that are on the projects with them so one team may do more work than the other."

I had multiple offers from different companies but chose this one based on the strong coprorate ethics and core values.  That said, my love for my job and clients never changed but the culture is no longer the way it was when I selected the position over other great opportunities.  I am not sure if it is the changes to leadership or the decrease in revenue at 3M overall but it has changed dramatically.  That is unfortunate considering how it was when I was hired."
bad,"I worked in a team of freelancers, within an in-house marketing agency. Our 'team leader' was weak, immature and unsupportive. His boss was very difficult, OCD and other issues.

At 3M it appears it is who you know and how many degrees you have. 20 to 30 yrs ago when a person hired in to 3M people were valued as a person and your career advanced by your ability to learn, take risks and mentoring - a degree was.nice but not required.  Open requisitions did not require a degree, most stated “degree in XXX or equivalent” . Today everyone hiring in to 3M has to have a degree and all requisitions require a degree.  What this means is if you are in your early 50’s and don’t hold a degree and don’t want to go back to school to get a degree, you go no where and have a target on your back. 3M is also slowly weeding out their older employees as they cost the company the most $$ in salary and benefits.

Sure enough, not long afer her return myself and another who she clearly never liked were also 'made redundant'."
bad,I was a temp worker for 3M and found it very difficult to move into a 3M roll.  I did not receive any benefits being that I was a temp.  I ended up leaving 3M for another position because I needed benefits.
bad,"Empresa desenha um cenário como se fosse um ótimo lugar para se trabalhar, entretanto os benefícios se aplica à poucas áreas de negócios. Funcionários PCD não conseguem desenvolver plano de carreira"
bad,too fast paced and too demanding. didnt like how others were treating me. too much mandatory overtime. didnt train me in too well to where i didnt get what i was suppose to do.
bad,The 3m Department at Major Plastics was ran poorly and showed Favoritism towards the workers with seniority in this particular department.  For it was tension also between shifts
bad,"They have good people, but one apple can ruin your whole experience.  Unfortunate, that is what happened to me.  10% of the workforce does 90% of the work."
bad,"If you are a drone, you will be fine here. If you have a brain or an opinion of any source, this may not be your bag. The work is fine, the pay is great, the coworkers are mostly great and helpful, but management at all levels in the Ames plant is pretty much an unfunny joke."
bad,"The plant I worked at is closing and therefore not a good place for emplyment.  If it were not for this i would have stayed.  Also, i would have stopped typing if there was not a minimum requirement."
bad,"If your looking to kill a year while looking for something else this is for you. Your on the outside looking in a lot of the time. Your not included in any of the full time employee activities, and you get reminded on a regular basis. Don't expect anything from your contact there either. Not much in way of incentives. We were invited to a dinner once, and I got a cup another time. The pay is a little low and Walmart  pays better."
bad,WON is no longer focused on its core competency of technical analysis. Its trying to compete with the big investment advisors that use fundamental analysis. Management is losing its direction because of this.
bad,I was hired by a Temporary Employment  service.  Little compensation for working long hours.  Virtually no chance to get hired on as a full time employee.
bad,"3M is a great place to work if you like to work different shifts and overtime. It is very difficult on family life. Poor management in certain areas. The pay and benefits are really good, but that's how they get you to stay. Be prepared to work rotating shifts and overtime. Very difficult for raising a family."
bad,"en sus momentos por se una empresa en el area de HOWARD relativamente nueva, carecia de procesos definidos y demas"
bad,"Terrible work environment. Turnover rate was considerably high. In 1 yr, 67  employees were let go unjustly  and without reason. Was really hard working with unprofessional people."
bad,"I found that the management fostered an environment of gossip and backstabbing. Slanderous statements could be made with no validation, and when proven completely false there were no repercussions for the person trying to cause another harm."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,Was a very fun and productive place of employment. Due to the economy down turn our plant is being closed and relocated to other facilities.
bad,"Not a good place to work, no training program in place, software products typically have major bugs after every update, very poor QA system"
bad,"its a great place to work as a beginner, but far as moving up and excelling this is not the place. I really liked working for this company now I'm looking to seek better employment with more money."
bad,"un empresa con una gran oportunidad en el trato del recurso mas importante el cual es el humano."
bad,"pessimo ricordo"
bad,Company needs to think more ways of keeping the employees motivated in order to be more effective at work. Career advancement must also be taken into consideration.
bad,"I conduct the flow and process of 250+ digital orthodontic models, troubleshoot system issues, notify customer base of deficient unworkable products, train new employees in multiple positions."
bad,"11.29 hr-12.96 hr.Lost good starting pay. Not worth the rotating shifts so I moved to a higher paying skilled labor job,Looks like the HR manager wrote the last review trying to cover his butt.Lol"
bad,Compensation was great until they started outsourcing then moved operation to China.
bad,"I didn't enjoy working there, I never felt that I was part of the team and the manager was nowhere near technical.  He missed the poor service by some agents and didn't know what he was doing.  I loved working with the customers but the management and once a month pay checks just aren't worth it."
bad,"Mucho marketing hacia el mercado  y ningún foco al cliente. Burocracia impera! Muy lenta, no asume riesgos!"
bad,It used to be a great place to work but now they want to be the next Amazon and are moving everything overseas and getting rid of all the jobs in the USA. Management picks and chooses their favorite people to move up rather than by qualifications. Not the same as it used to be.
bad,It’s an okay place to work.  Pay and benefits are great.   There’s a lack of team work there.   Facilities are micromanaged and creativity is stifled.   There is a high resistance to change in the leadership group.
bad,They hire people fresh out of College that have no experience in Technical fields and  Management areas. They will not hire experienced people who have a Degree. They want fresh out of College in skilled positions. Manufacturing they could care less you are just a number and you will be forced to work overtime or your let go. No if ands or buts. It’s all about Zmanagement looking good. This place sucks as far as 3M cares. Stay away if you want a life outside of work . You will work any and all hours of nite and day. Ask any 3m er. Hutchinson plant is who you know not what you know as far as advancement .  Not trying to be negative just being honest here.
bad,"Stressful , forced to work overtime .Management was rude at a times,  luck of collaboration with employee. pay was good and training not bad . i  liked my supervisor."
bad,"No Training.... the guy that was my supervisor and also my process specialist they didn't know how to run the machines."
bad,"3M was a company who tried to drain their employees with every bit of authority they could. This was never a problem for me because I was enjoying the checks until my kid's mother left because I spent no time with my family. I was either at work, sleep, or getting ready for work. Even after she left I continued doing my job and when I finally got visitation with my children they refused to let me do a strait 40 hours like I signed up for, just every other week so that I could spend time with my sons. I also got ruined with child support due to high wages that I was making at the job. Not good for a family man."
bad,"I was a contractor. Contractors are treated as 2nd class citizens. "
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,"This is from a contractor prospective. "
bad,This is a temp job in Eagan until the facility closes and it pays very well but the management is terrible. Supervisors and leads are very biased too. Only company I know of that doesnt give their workers an extra 15 min break if they are working 12 hours.
bad,La collaborazione tra i colleghi ti dava la possibilità di raggiungere qualsiasi traguardo peccato che le troppe ore di lavoro (alcune volte anche la notte nel periodo di inventario) moltiplicate per i giorni della settimana ti facevano stare lontano dalla famiglia.
bad,"É uma grande empresa mas que parou no tempo."
bad,Did a complete flip of office management this Jan and brought in a bunch of pencil pushers who don't know squat and are ruining a good thing that's been around for 80yrs just for a few more bucks out of a profiting plant already. Co-workers were cool except starting out there u stay on graveyard for min 7years due to union seniority.
bad,The job is secure and the people are nice. You are made to feel welcome. Currently going through some positive transitions in regards to engineering. Money is poor for the shifts required. As an engineer its restrictive due to pharma rules.
bad,"this job will run you into the ground, but at least you'll die rich, maybe you could leave that fortune for your family, remember that you didn't have time for them in the first place."
bad,I have been having a hard time with 3m since I started because I was diagnosed with diabetes a month after starting and it's been hard to control and they haven't done anything to make sure that I was ok jus worried about when I was going to return to work
bad,"No work life balance in 3M, model is not sustainable. Too much unnecessary work pressure, unethical work practices. Non motivational team work, rather no team work at all"
bad,"Poor management of the facility. Co-workers make up stories to cover their own indiscretions. Overall, a very hostile and unstable environment."
bad,"Bom trabalho "
bad,Work load on individuals is high and man power shortage. Very monotonous job. Little politics and management is efficient. Good amount of fun with employees.
bad,"There isn't a typical day where I work, I can do something different every day but may include incoming inspections of raw materials or finished goods from a sub-contractor. If there are any quality issues on the shop floor then I would either sort out there and then or if the issue impacted other processes, department or customer then I would escalate."
bad,"Co-workers are good, There are some days were i have to sit for a long to finish up with all the stuff."
bad,L'unico aspetto positivo è lo stipendio raggiunto dopo tanti anni di sacrifici e responsabilità che nessuno vuole prendersi.
bad,There's not much variety in the day-to-day tasks of jobs at 3M. Most people who work here are lifers because they have very good benefits with decent vacation time and competitive salaries for some.
bad,"You make alot of money, but also have no life and get treated poorly from people above you. If they are busy your there 7 days a week 12 hours a day, the next week the business work load drops off and then the cur you back to 3 days a week 12 hours day"
bad,Pays well but a lot of overtime.  Not able to leave plant at all during shift.  Smoke free property.  Different standards for employees.  Management are on a buddy buddy system to get promoted
bad,"Every other day seems like a fire drill. Technology teams do not collaborate across systems and teams. Everyone has a differing view and direction. This is frustrating in a company this large. "
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,Worked a lot of overtime & a lot of the holidays & weekends. They don't believe in family time. The people that  I worked with meshed very will. The benefits where great.
bad,"la empresa como tal es buena, pero Gran parte del personal no tanto, en ocaciones ahi buenas oportunidades de crecimiento pero si no le caes bien al que te esta entrevistando no te consideran,"
bad,"3M pulled a product causing hundreds to lose their jobs without more than a day of notice. As a Person who moved here for 3M and then getting let go for no reason other than bad timing, I'm kind of salty."
bad,"The one of my big believe in my live is, we can sale any things when apply marketing by smart way. So this is what we are trying to do as agency of 3M in Oman."
bad,"I thought factory work was something  i would like, but not at all. There is a lot of drama and two faced people. They say there for there employeers but not true. I have only been there six months and ended up hurting my shoulder. I don't know if it happened there but had to use a lot of my vacation and many hospital bills and was denied STD and now appealing it. I think that is awful because that is a benefit we have."
bad,"The upper management at 3M Decatur Chemical is horrible.  Management only care about getting another notch in their belts. They can not see that the reason they are where they are at is because of an operator doing his/her job.  Under staffed is an understatement!  Total of 96hrs off in one month is mentally and physically draining, don't forget swing rotating shifts also.  We did not know if we were coming or going."
bad,"After reorg, asked to do too much with unrealistic timelines, work 60+ hour weeks to implement new product and Scrum.  Morale is extremely low, would not recommend."
bad,Extremely focused on keeping the youngest employees.  Doesn't put too much effort in any employee over 30. Little to no chance for advancement.  Average benefits and low pay
bad,"3M full time management is terrible, but the VOLT (temps) management is wonderful. Nevada 3m does not care about your at home/family life. They just want their work done and are not willing to attempt to work with any other schedules."
bad,"Management is terrible. More than likely working 10 hour days 6 days a week. Typically Sunday, 7th day, as well. They let you know that Friday if you work the weekend and hardly ever any sooner. Hope you didn""t have plans!. Hot in warehouse. HR is part of 3M. They don't help often and always do whats best for 3M. They will dance around answering any questions you have. Most people only stay for the inusrance."
bad,The management within the Customer Services Organization in the Business Services Organization is TERRIBLE and UNETHICAL. Employee Relations is TERRIBLE and UNETHICAL.
bad,"The company is great. Great pay,benefits, vacation/sick pay, and advancement. The management was awful. Its a favorites game and a who tell on others the most game. The employees were ok. Its kind of like high school with some of them. A lot of drama and gossip. Also a lot of long hours. Sometime the overtime would be mandatory and you would sometimes get notice the day of. Not a good place to work long term."
bad,"3M has made over 100 million dollars of my 4 patents and various inventions. I was laid off with about 2000 people in 2008. In the 1st quarter of the next year they were bragging about how big the profit sharing check were."
bad,"I worked here for over a year, the company at first was great. i really enjoyed the area i worked in along with most of the coworkers. Then it started to go downhill, coworkers being rude and going to management about anything and everything, then when I went to management about the harassing coworker nothing was done. Was let go due to medical reasons they didn't approve even with legitimate doctors note. They don't care about their employees as long as their is a body on the floor to do all of the work. They make you work long hours forced overtime, claim to do it fairly by the lowest hours gets it first but never seems to be that way when it came down to it."
bad,"Because there was not assurance that you would have a job there was no team environment. "
bad,"I worked at 3M Austin for just over 6 years.  When I first hired on I thought I was lucky to get the job. The first department I worked in lasted 1 year and then they decided the profit margin wasn't good enough so they shut it down.  My next assignment lasted 1 year and they sold that division off.  My next department became a discontinued product line . After that the next department was sold and moved to Mexico.  Finally the plant was shut down all together and I am now out of work.  All through this process I was treated somewhat nicely, managers always smile.  But there was absolutely no consideration for work/life balance.  Overtime is almost always announced at the last minute, and I mean the last minute.  Like 5 minutes before your shift is over.  I once had a one year stretch of 6 days a week/12 hrs. a day.  The OT money was nice but come Sunday I just napped.  The shutdown process was long and drawn out.  Your final day kept changing to some unknown date in the future.  And management was somewhat tone deaf, always saying ""wasn't 3M the best job you ever had, it will look great on your resume.""  I did get a severance package but am not able to collect unemployment for 3 months. All in all not a place if you want a stable future."
bad,Plain and simple. 3M Clinton is a site that only looks at one thing if you wanna have a chance to advance there. A degree and you have to be part of the crowd they show favoritism towards. Management cold care less about what takes place on the floor. and you don't even get performance evaluations at all. I would never recommend this place to anybody at all. Just a complete waste of your time and future career plans.
bad,"After just 1 phone interview, without reviewing any work in my portfolio, I was hired as a user experience designer. Ramp-up took several months, as there was no apparent UX work, no UX tools, and no design team. The actual duties of the job were to moderate content changes to websites by copying results from a change request form and pasting it into a development work order. Literally, copying and pasting, field for field. My job could have been replaced by a script. 3M had used ""UX"" as a buzz-word in their job posting without any concept of what user experience design actually is. Realizing that this position would not advance my UX career, I quit."
bad,"I feel like I've been held down by my management. I am discouraged to take more responsibility, and am hushed when I voice my concerns with the trajectory of my career. I have peers that would agree, middle management is so concerned with climbing upward that they hold down the people that report up to them."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,"When I worked there I was put through a service called manpower. This was a service for 3M as their own personal temp agency. They paid me 8 dollars less an hour, no benefits, no pto, no vacation days. They would say you could be hired after 6 months as a regular employee, but some people I was working with have been waiting years to become an actual employee."
bad,Big company made up of a lot of other big companies each one managed differently. Often one department or division doesn;t know what the others are doing.
bad,"Long hours with rotating shifts. Pay is good. Overtime is often available which is a plus. There are often opportunities to advance or transfer, also a plus."
bad,"start the shift, pick your equipment you're assigned to and either pick orders or you stock the warehouse with a reach truck. i learned how to drive a reach truck. The management here is horrendous during the spring/summer months. Sometimes we only get 3 days off in a month."
bad,"3M es una gran Empresa Americana líder en todo el mundo...salvo en la Argentina. Sus directivos no logran ensamblar la cultura americana con la local, ya que muchas de sus directrices se modifican constantemente y nunca se llegan a internalizar por las distintas áreas. Existen más gerentes que empleados y por ende la carga laboral queda absolutamente desbalanceada. "
bad,"Good company to work your way up with. However, be ready to teach yourself how to work because the training is very poor. The people are awesome to work with, although there is poor communication during shift change. 8 or 12 hour days depending on what you're looking for. Great benefits."
bad,not a family oriented company....unfair labor practices...has a swing shift that is not a healthy work environment...leadership is very weak
bad,"-Huge experience of team work"
bad,Can you think of one new innovative product 3M has created recently? Growth through acquisitions and global economy expansion in countries like China and India. Very old school middle management hanging on to receive very generous retirement benefits. I worked six + years here and quickly learned democracy ends at the door and fiefdoms and empires rule the day. Hoped for an entrepreneurial environment but only saw layers of middle management led by the good old boys / gals network. Very disappointing.
bad,not a terrible place if you dont mind working for idiots and working 50-70 hour weeks without any chance of having time for your family unless you use your minimal vacation time.
bad,Use to be a good place to work until new management came in and ruined the place. the plant is closing and 3m corp. is being unfair to its workers. They dont have to shutdown they just want to
bad,"there is a lack of the hierarchy and leveling of management."
bad,"I have only been here for seven days, I do not have enough experience or time in the workplace to give an accurate depiction or review of the job."
bad,"Atypical for 3M, this is a very unstable division. Management cannot get a handle on wild swings of business performance leading to hiring/firing on 2-3 yr rotation."
bad,"You'll be in a small team of at least 4 others. I did frame work, so we were the first to arrive at location at 4:30 am; and usually last to leave at 2 pm."
bad,"Trabalhei la durante 2 anos, era terceira , o profissional terceiro na minha época não tinha valorização nenhuma, você se senti um lixo, não eramos incluídos em nenhuma comemoração para receber elogios ou prêmios, eramos somente mão obra boa ,barata e qualificada, fazíamos hora extra sempre prontos a ajudar  ,dávamos nosso sangue, porem a cultura interna com terceiro e péssima, isso vem de todos os cargos, se você e terceiro você e ninguém la dentro, não são oferecidas vagas de efetivação para você, promovem que já esta la ou trazem alguém de fora e você ainda tem que ensinar tudo para pessoa, chegava ser frustante, e um ponto muito ruim, pois fazíamos toda parte cansativa do trabalho, íamos finais de semana e feriados, essa diferença já começá quando entregam seu crachá que e deitado na diagonal , totalmente diferente dos funcionários que e em pê, ate o cordão você tem que comprar pois não davam. A unica coisa que valeu a pena foi a experiencia de trabalho o volume era absurdo então você desenvolve seu profissional, suas habilidades, aprende trabalhar com muita pressão das outras áreas, mas do quesito `ser um lugar que você se sente feliz e valorizado e impossível la dentro não era assim``, me lembro de um episodio que a areá ganhou um almoço pelo desempenho, e nos não podíamos ir pois eramos terceiros, isso e muito triste e afeta muito o lado pessoal, pois nos também ajudamos e muito naquele resultado, pois todo operacional era nosso, festa de final de ano também não eramos convidados. Fui demitida nas minhas 1 ferias, não pude nem pegar minhas coisas e se despedir de ninguém,"
bad,"A girl literally reported her harassment and got suspended. Seems HR likes to protect certain people. Lots of hate toward all groups. The few transgender people there are periodically harassed or sabotaged. It's embarrassing the people they let work there, and what they let their long standing workers do to people."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
bad,Good holidays but generally treated very poorly. Lots of contractors which are not made permanent even after years of service. Changed pay a few times at the very last minute upon contact renewals.
bad,"aprendes de los productos "
bad,Regular 8 to 5 job I learned a lot about wire sizes and purpose of those wires and watts and ohms output and input. Management was very laid back but also unfair with certain employees. The work environment was very calm and sometimes fast. The hardest part was management and they did things. I liked the work I did and some of the people were great to work with also.
bad,Hardest part of the job is staying either coming in or stay over the hours so fast but you body starts slowing down and your tired
bad,no comment on this company at this time. they pick up employees as fast as they can let them go.
bad,Door to door sales is a difficult line of work to advance in esspecially if you have to pay to commute without a basic wage.
bad,"Poor management:"
bad,"Excellent place to work, concrete floors hard on the body over time. 3M is a fortune 500 company that is well known for its tape, medical bandage supplies, decals for commercial trucking companies, Commercial Airliners, and Professional race cars."
bad,La verdad no es para cualquiera trabajar ahi es un ambiente muy pesado para cualquier persona respetuosa y buena por ese motivo no estoy mas por lo q se vive adentro
bad,"You have to be from Brookings and have a family member work there if you plan to survive. This place will eat you alive, be prepared to be treated like a second class citizen. Be prepared also if you get hired in fully. to have a ton of money and great pension and great benefits, they put you through the ringer and you earn every dollar you make but if you can put up with the hazing you, will be rewarded."
good,"3M, a proud, successful and growing company. There's great pay to be had. Benefits too.. if you're willing to deal with the ignorant, arrogant and entitled. It doesn't matter your character all that matters is that you fall in line, do what your told and show respect to those who don't give it."
good,"On se croirait à l'école primaire."
good,Mostly just stood around not doing much and it's really had to be hired full-time through this company regardless of your work history management likes to pick favorite employees and disrespect others based on personal opinions
good,"Very fast paced."
good,"Upper mgt acquired other companies to enter a new market for road side tolling, without properly vetting obligation and estimating resources that were needed for success.  Mgt's wet dream eventually was abandoned."
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"I worked as a temp for 3 months in the tape plant. I got along great with the other employees except for the person training me. Management was very poor. My supervisor never called me by my name. It was always either sweetie or hun. The person who trained me, clearly didn't want to train anyone and was not a team player. I found myself just learning by watching and if I asked a question, I would be told to do as he says. He was also a temp who has been there for 2 years and all the temps he has previously trained had been hired full-time so I assume he was bitter about that and didn't want to train anymore. When I spoke to my supervisor about the situation, I was told he would talk to him about it. 2 days later, I mentioned it again and he still hadn't spoken to him. The next day, while I was on break, I got a call from the placement agency saying that I wasn't needed anymore...while at work! I went directly to my supervisor's office and he lied to my face saying that I never went to him about the issues I was having with my co-worker. "
good,"Poor bridging between departments mostly operating as induvidual Sylos."
good,"People there are jealous of each other for not reason. Lots of gossiping, people trying to get you in trouble just because you are a minority. Managers don’t care and you are just a number if you are a minority no true they  in brace minorities.  So if you are white you be ok there."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"The first time I came here for interviews I was interested to know more about the company, the culture of the company the way they operate, yes i got in but along the way i sow things that i couldn't expect."
good,3M has a lot of favoritism that plays a role in daily operations. Not everyone is treated equal and supervisors and management cater to first shift and have no idea about the job functions or how they are supposed to be done according to the sop they put in place.
good,it is hard to drive a PUJ jeepney because in the first place you need to be more patient and roving around the area is stressful like if there is a traffic around your vicinity.
good,había gente que tenia muchos años y no les tomaban importancia o darles aumento o la oportunidad de crecer laboral mente.
good,"HR does not follow company policies that are in  black and white, some of employees that break company policies don't get wrote up or anything upper management needs improvement"
good,"Typical day is 8 hours. I have learned a lot about asset management. Management is okay, but they don't pass along accurate information down the chain when you work on the bottom. The environment is loose. They need work to get completed, but it won't if they don't stay on top of their employees. Hardest part of my position is how many times I have to stop my process in order to ship equipment accurately the first time. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I leave my area to help a different area with an IT related issue, personal or work related."
good,Managers at many levels are dishonest and withhold information. The division is in a somewhat cyclonic state as management changes (going all the way up to the head of the division) are constant.
good,"Il lavoro è molto frenetico , ma spesso non c' è corrispondenza tra lo sforzo produttivo e il risultato ottenuto . "
good,Loved the people I worked with!! Learn a lot of new things everyday!
good,A bad experience.
good,It was good place work for if you a full time employee. People are good. Management not very good If there a problem they one take side story . And them temp are get let go even if they are a good worker. Temp dont get anything were but stay in postion
good,"Not the same company as years ago... Lets leave it at that... "
good,They are not concerned about job/work balance and can care less about working you 7 days a week. They do not want to put in any money to keep their equipment maintenance up. Their preventative maintenance programs are a joke
good,"The pay starts and increases way above industry averages. You do work hard for it. And there is a meeting at the beginning of every month that reminds you of this. There is usually a lot of voluntary overtime. Sometimes overtime is scheduled (“forced”). However, there are 6 chances to get out of it during the year. The supervisors are usually former warehouse operators or people with degrees in history or music. They are your basic paper pushing, lackluster, lack of personality supervisors that come down from their air conditioned/heated offices just to tell everyone to work harder. There are more SOPs for the boxes than there should be. You damage a box of sponges, you can get written up or even suspended. They spend a lot of time on paperwork for these boxes. The productivity requirements are set but nobody knows how it is measured. You just work everyday and stress about it until the end of the month. You’ll get a verbal and written notification of not meeting it. Then around 530am (if you work 3rd shift) you’ll get your name called on the pa system to either call one of the supes or to call the training room. If your name is called around this time at the beginning or end of a month you and everybody else knows that you’re about to get walked out on either a suspension or termination. For those of you who haven't worked here in a while...those 3 day suspensions are no more. Also, and the worst thing to me...no free coffee."
good,"Who you know, not what you know.  If you get on managements bad side for anything, your career is shot.  3M will state you can never find a job that pays so well, so they treat people like nothing."
good,"3M is a good company to work for, if you start you career at 3M.  It is difficult to be successful at 3M, coming in from the outside.  The work/life balance at 3M is difficult as well.  Depending on your role, there is an expectation of being available 7 days a week."
good,"Nice Co. to work for until I lost my job, due to a Death at the plant. I was trained in so many areas, I feel I have a lot to offer and bring to the next Co. I work for."
good,"So far I have seen that this plant does not really care that  people have lives outside of work. Your voice is usually not heard or cared about. What makes sense to you and your co-workers does not make sense to management. Facts can be shown directly to the management and they will ignore it. Used to have the freedom to escape the stress of work by going to your car after work just for that in your own space feeling but that got ripped away. Any time spent from your machine is considered break time so if your break area is a 5 minute walk away, by the time you get to the break room you would have to walk back. Constant deception from management telling you things and then turning around and doing/say the opposite."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"When employee requested to move to a different department or shift, request is denied on the basis of insufficient timing with the full time employee's best interest. Constant rejection of suggested recourse in personal safety of employee due to other employee's view on personal conversation. Denial of employee requesting consent to depart from position with intent to detain employee from leaving."
good,The crew I work with is the best part of my job. The days can be long and working every other weekend gets old. Many areas contain  harmful chemicals.
good,"A typical day consisted of clocking in, going to a safety meeting, going to my machine and working according to what I had to do. I was taking large rolls of tape and making smaller rolls out of them by putting them on a rewind machine. the supervisor never really came out and told me what was expected of me. The environment was loud. One of the cool things was I was able to wear shorts."
good,"Volt is a temporary job service, so do not expect to make a career there.  I did not report to Volt each day, only to 3M, to complete the services that they requested.  So I do not feel qualified to rate Volt as good or bad, they got me a temporary job, which was what I asked them to do."
good,"Typical factory work. Repetitive and hard on the entire body. Swing shifts are counter-productive to physical and emotional health. The only facility that pays well is in Hutchinson, MN. If you are looking to transfer between plants they do not help you unless you are in management or engineering."
good,I don't plan on working on a production floor like that again. Being over worked and not any respect to a person and there family life. They ask a lot from ppl that do most of the work and treat you like a number and not a human being. Great for management and engineers
good,"3M Austin is an average workplace. The management makes poor decisions and they do not recognize hard work. "
good,"The best thing about this job was the people. 3M almost never hires its temps. Instead, they have you work until your contract is up, and then cycle you out and back in until you aren't needed anymore. Extremely repetitive and fast paced positions for very little pay."
good,The people at 3M make you feel good about working here the only down to this is they don't have any opening but overall it a good place to work.
good,"good company , reliable schedule. good benefits and room for expanding your knowledge in other departments. good instruction from supervisors. room for advancements`"
good,"I was so excited when I got hired at 3m until I actually started working there. It's modern day slavery with higher pay and benefits. The plant is shutting down and I can see why. A lot of favoritism as well. 3m cares a lot about the customers but not much about the employees. Even in a recession they still use top quality products unlike other manufacturing plants I've worked for. Where others would try to skimp you, 3m would rather give you more. That's the best part about them."
good,o interessante de se trabalhar numa empresa com presença em tantos países é a possibilidade de desenvolver projetos em colaboração com outros países.
good,"New to Columbus so very scattered, doesn't pay well at all, president is very scattered as well and always changes her standards. Not recommended."
good,Things are always changing at 3M and you never know if you will have a job because your business may get sold. They seem to care more about image more than they're actual customers.
good,"Working at 3M as a General Laborer was a very laborious job, physically demanding. But that was the nature of that facility. I learned that I possessed the resolve to work in such a environment. My co-workers were mostly immigrants who where good natured and very helpful when help was required. The hardest part of the job was the almost continuous lifting of product that weighed between 45 and 55 pounds. But again that was the nature of that facility. The most enjoyable part was working with and getting to know the immigrants from different parts of the World. That in itself broadened my prospective of the world in which we live. If it wasn't clear this was a temporary position."
good,"I was employed by Arizant which is now part of 3M Plc, under a temp"
good,"If you are looking for a great paying job while attending NIU, there is no better place. Students can attend school in the morning and work in the afternoon."
good,"All that is good is the pay, the lifestyle is terrible if you’re on rotating shifts, my sleep and eating schedule has never been at its worst and my body cannot take it anymore. Lots of unhappy people in the work place."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"management sucks, not a good team environment, lots of clicks. major bureaucracy, no loyalty to years worked and contributions to the company, otherwise ok."
good,"Our company was acquired, and although all the platitudes about our value and importance were said, significant layoffs happened three months afterwards."
good,"Overall the workplace culture is not balanced.  However, the sense of pride on the product is present and strong.  They also have a strong believe that ""Safety"" should come first."
good,"I don't understand why 3M hasn't been completely shut down.  It can't possibly pass OSHA standards for safety, cleanliness, job hazards, polutants etc etc"
good,"So many workers are lazy and want the sit down positions, they like leaving the trash to the temp workers, product standards are not met by everyone, everyone wants to be a BOSS. Too many cliches and favoritism by managers, leads AREN'T professional with no people skills."
good,"It's a good place to work , management are nice, but I only work with"
good,this job was great. not enough money to make a living off of but you had a role in the company and it was a great place to feeel at home. managment isnt the greatest and human resources wasnt involved in alot of the promotions
good,"O setor em que trabalhei havia um déficit muito grande no que diz respeito a empatia e humanidade com relação aos funcionários, principalmente prestadores de serviço."
good,If you don't have a degree you'll never be more than a supervisor. Be ready to work a lot of hours. If you don't work OT you don't make all that much really. Most jobs average around 25 an hour.
good,"The culture is reminiscent of high school. Think what the popular kids think or be ostracized. Political perspectives were talked about freely in a manner that may intimidate those who have a different view. Did not protect the ""work zone""."
good,It’s a good job Kong’s as you like being around drama yelled at not taking regular brwKes having to help ppl that’s stopping you from your work and being able to stand
good,My twenty plus year experience was overall good but required great resilience and a few critical decision moments that could make or break a career.  It taught me a great deal about self promotion.  My employment brought with it the highest highs along with the lowest lows in my work history.   Culture is very fluid.  Diversity moves by management stifle individual ability to move ahead unless your in a favorable role in a profitable 3M business.
good,Was once a good place to work. Closing down.  Company overall a good one but the Atlanta plant products were moved to Missouri and Tennessee. The wages and benefits where good.
good,To many meetings aren't allowed to get the work done during the day. You are expected to work outside of business hours. Not a good work life balance. VERY poor  management in the IPD department. Lack of direction and developing staff.  Very reactionary not proactive in approaching issues. \
good,you really cannot complain about the work that's just part of the business what makes it difficult is we do not have a HR person on site which the satellite offices do not understand inner workings of the plant there for information that is transferred is from afar and not understood not being inside the facility
good,"Typically carrying out planned maintenance in addition to responding to machinery breakdowns."
good,"Prós - Bom nome, infra-estrutura;"
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"The training is less then stellar, management cares more about production numbers than they do training or quality. Benfits are good."
good,"Empresa com profissionais dinâmicos e atuantes."
good,Their was not enough hours in my week. They promised 24 hrs per week to start and it was only 5 hrs total per week. Never increased.
good,The management treated its workers poorly. A lot of disrespect and high school games. Job was only a paycheck. The only good thing about this place was the people.
good,"Travail laborieux physique car on marche pendant durant 7 heures parfois en portant des charges lourdes, tout ceci sans avoir des primes d'équipe ou panier repas donc salaire qui ne suit pas la charge de travail. Heures supplémentaires ""basé sur le volontariat"", il suffit qu'on refuse une fois de faire une heure pour que la responsable nous colle l'étiquette de ""fleimard""."
good,"Grande distribution du Bricolage"
good,No consideration for temporary employees. Management is very poor puts health and safety of temps last under union workers.
good,"Brak możliwości rozwoju w firmie, brak zainteresowania pracodawcy pracownikami produkcyjnymi, niskie zarobki, brak motywacji."
good,I feel that Volt only cares about getting paid. They liked mingling with the contracting company (3M). I could never really get a straight answer from them when I needed one.
good,"Came in to repair department started repairing equipment and reading daily e-mails. Had morning meeting, took morning 15min break, back to work, then half hour lunch, back to work, afternoon 15min break, back to work, time to go home. During lunch and breaks would interact with co-workers regarding personal after hours activities and work related issues. Learned how to repair fixed & mobile HD IR digital cameras, Mobile Processor systems, Assisted in organizing repair parts and part numbers for ISO 9000 certification. I think the hardest part was the requirement to meet a repair quota consistently of three units per day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the closeness of the employees and the stories we shared."
good,"A typical day at work was working/monitoring the assembly line and driving a fork truck.  I learned that in the midst of any environment that production still has to go on.  Management was a bit less than ideal but again, I was hired to do a job and to do it well.  The hardest part of the job was getting along with workers who did not want to be team players.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to have a job and getting paid for my services."
good,"3M has excellent pay and benefits, but as a production worker there are long hours with mandatory overtime and inconsistent work shifts.  3M claims to be health-conscious but still has workers working rotating shifts, often changing from 12-hr days to 12-hr nights 2 to 3 times a week."
good,Fun at times. The place went to plant wide layoffs. But overall there are numerous good person that worked for 3M Unitek
good,"No a very good cohesive team, environment was not very friendly"
good,"My day would start at 6, where I was placed on the assembly line inspecting glass for three hours, then switched to another station where I would wipe down the glass for another selected amount of time, lunch and to the belt, where i would receive the glass off the belt, inspect it and place it on a rack. I learned about touch screen systems and how to inspect the glass. I think the hardest part of the job was, the winter season where they had a lay off. I actually worked there twice, both times I was laid off."
good,Ótima empresa com muitos benefícios e excelente panos de carreira.
good,Not the best place to advance your career. Not the best management.
good,"At 3M we used and serviced GPS tracking equipment to monitor offenders on various systems (alcohol monitoring, home curfew, ankle GPS etc). "
good,"I was hired in a long term temp position. While the environment and people were very nice and knowledgeable, f/t positions with 3M corp. itself were not available. Any postings went within the company to 3M employees and the entry jobs were either closed or reassigned as ""temp positions"". I worked on the 3rd shift and after a full and through training period I did my duties. I was the only employee in my department on this shift. I struggled with maintaining a high production rate primarily due to this fact. I did however make my quota for my daily work expectations. There were company incentives for safety and production with a rewards program and luncheons. They also were involved with health and provided information and stretching times throughout my time there. The job required a lot of highly repetitive motion, which was the hardest part of the job to adapt to. The job itself was quite enjoyable overall due to the nature of the products, knowing that the work I did would help benefit others when they needed care."
good,Okay place to work if you are not looking to go any farther than the floor.
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"a typical day at work would be testing water filters in water, molding parts together, inspecting parts, packaging and labeling water filters to be shipped. co workers were somewhat helpful. I did not like there management they had other workers train me and they didn't know what they were doing so it made me look bad."
good,"The experience gained within my current company and position is invaluable. I have definitely developed a progressive work ethic through effective time management due to the nature of work I am involved in. Ensuring the efficient and effective expedition of daily customer orders whilst simultaneoulsy attending to customer / client (internal & external) queries, complaints and the like can sometimes proove to be a dauting task, but keeping a cool and calm head at all times has ensured that I always maintain a high level of work intergrity"
good,8+ hours spent multi-tasking many different product safety jobs for several divisions within 3M.
good,It was hard to work somewhere that people changed the schedule all the time.
good,People That work there are back stabbing  two face about everything it’s a buddy system  company needs to get cameras up and watch all employees and prevent drama
good,This company is not the place to work if you want a career and If you care about the work you do. Supervision only cares bonuses and hitting monthly number. Quality of the products are non existent. Poor training. Money is ok but the your life is over. Nothing matters but monthly sales. Nothing!
good,"Aucun avis spécifique, travail en plateforme avec un superviseur, casque audio avec micro et un logiciel assez bien adapté ,une ambiance assez stressante mais accessible"
good,"Bonne expérience, il faut le reconnaitre, entreprise intéressante, diversité d'activités, mais [trop] mauvaise communication en interne de manière globale."
good,"Ok pay, ok benefits has stock options, 401k got rid of pension for new hires.  If u go company they’ll freeze your pension from that day you’re hired.  Stupid stuff they do like that to keep you from advancing."
good,The overall aspect of this company was selective and superiorized! If  being honest equal opportunity was not enforced for the majority of the new hires.
good,"Es una gran empresa con innumerables oportunidades de mejora, sin embargo, la burocracia que existe dentro de la compañía en este momento complica la implementación de mejores prácticas."
good,"3M Zwijndrecht is een gemiddeld bedrijf om te gaan werken. Het bedrijfscultuur is conservatief met wat negatief kudde gedrag en soms ouderwets ondanks nieuwe technische ontwikkelingen. De meeste mensen zijn vriendelijk, maar er zijn ook negatieve enkelingen die het kudde gedrag enorm kan beinvloeden in een negatieve zin. On-ethisch gedrag wordt heel vaak getolereerd door het management, waardoor de sfeer verergerd raken. Hetgeen erg jammer is. Mocht er wat aangedaan kan worden dan is 3M Zwijndrecht zeker een work for life."
good,"Il n'y a pas d'opportunités de travail, la société ferme le site de Longvic (21)."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"As of recently, the hours have been better. Last year the overtime was insane, and there was nothing you could do to get out of it, The rotating schedules, makes it hard to plan anything in your time off. It is really hard to receive any kind of promotions."
good,"hired on as a temp, and then you need to have multiple interviews just to get in the hiring pool which doesn't guarantee  permanent job."
good,"Eu acredito que em todas as empresas em que existem os terceiros sempre havera muita diferença. Cabe aos diretores melhorar essa parte ja que no futuro a tendência e terceurizar a grande parte. Vendo por esse lado. , não deveriam ser tao desprezados em relaçao a beneficios como plano de saude.se um proprio tem essr benefício porque o terceiro não teria ou sera que a saude deste não é importante. O desprezo em festas que o terceuri só. participa se for para limpar mesa ou chão. Essa parte é muito feia.deveria ser revista.nem vamos entrar em outras questões."
good,"A 3M é uma ótima empresa para aqueles que querem conciliar um bom equilíbrio entre a vida pessoal e profissional. Na minha carreira houveram movimentações rápidas de crescimento para os padrões da empresa."
good,"•	On a crew of 10 that was responsible for the day to day maintenance schedule of high speed tape converting and high speed packaging equipment.  "
good,Decent job but you pretty much live there.. No work/home balance. Hard to move up and management is pretty bad.  Cant beat the pay for the area though
good,"A corporação passou nos últimos 17 anos uma mudança comportamental no que diz ao mercado e principalmente internamente com relação ao tratamento de seus colaboradores. Isto foi notado, principalmente, em países onde houve crise econômica. A agressividade comercial tornou-se um fator positivo pois trouxe mais venda com consequente ganho de ""market share"". No entanto, quando este comportamento foi transferido internamente, houve uma perda muito grande com respeito a relação profissional; fazendo com  que os profissionais mudassem de comportamento, acompanhando a tendência de ""agressividade"". As visitas a clientes assim como o trabalho de desenvolvimento de novos produtos é muito valorizada, no entanto, nesta fase na qual encontra-se a economia, está muito reduzida, chegando até a frustrar alguns funcionários, pois, como a própria companhia se autointitula, é uma empresa de inovação. A alta gerência é muito nova, sem experiência gerencial e assumiu a agressividade como forma de comunicação com grande parte dos funcionários."
good,"It was a hard place to work. I was temp tp hire and I was obviously promised I would be hired on full tine after a few months, and I was not. A lot of layoffs and rehiring."
good,Management has a very hard time in making timely decisions.  Co-worker have been a joy to work with. Very willing to help and share ideas.  The hardest part of the job is not having a proactive supervisor and working with a respirator.
good,"Not the worst place in the world to work but not the best either. The pay is pretty good but they don't treat you very well unless you're high up on the ladder. They ask for your opinions sometimes but don't listen. Your chance for advancement is slim. You can move around in the plant but if you want something better, good luck. They put up postings to sign but 99 percent of the time they already have someone picked out, even if you're better qualified. The majority of the engineers are fresh out of school and don't even have a degree in the field that they are working in. Management is horrible. The plant operating committee is a group of friends that look out for each other. All they care about is their next bonus and they will do anything they can to assure they will get it, even if that includes not replacing extremely outdated equipment that is not safe. One plus is there is a lot of cool people to work with that understand all of these problems. You can make a lot of good friends."
good,checked to see what product needed to be run. We monitored the temp of the plastic material was correct. set points were correct on the injection molding machine per cycle sheet. start machine and run it for an half hour depending on the cycle time.  Take part to the QA to have part calibrated to make sure part is correct.
good,"Work with financial advisors and independent insurance agents to help them grow their practice. "

good,"I worked many hours each week. Management was more focused on how things looked, rather than how things really were."
good,"be prepared to work overtime they don't care about home life if someone is missing it is expected that you work overtime whether you have plans or not"
good,"Used Softrax daily to enter data and bill millions of dollars to corporate clients. Reviewed contracts and amendments daily, knowledge of 3M's platforms.

good,"Very Corporate."
good,Being a marketer at 3M means that you have a strong sales background and that you know well the products due to their particular technological specifications
good,I hated this job. It was a dirty work place and had so many people watching and telling you how to run your job even though they weren't your boss.

good,"Ok place to work, decent benefits, like all jobs has its ups and downs."
good,Like I said above I cant see work life balance. They do have all SAP systems but most runs by consultans. Company should appoint more SAP senior staff.
good,Ótima empresa refeição no local ônibus fretado boa cultura e benefícios.embora deixa desejar não tem vale alimentação pra casa e tbm a hierarquia de gestão muitas metas embora muito bagunçado ultimamente cada ano e um diretor ou supervisor diferente sai um bom entra pior que dificuldade de trabalho em união e familiar..
good,Lot's of opportunity for innovation and creativity but goes over the head of management. Continued and mundane day in and day out with not much room for process improvement
good,"empresa altamente dinâmica, muita rotação de trabalho e isso dificulta muito o andamento do serviço para os setores, altamente competitiva, sem plano de carreira"
good,"I was contract only, 35 hours, no overtime or working at home allowed"
good,"3M offers good benefits, and stability. There is a diverse culture, and many stay with the company for life. Depending on the site, there can be lots of opportunities for management level employees. Below that, you can stagnate quickly, and risk getting stuck in a particular role if you aren't careful. There are not a lot of layoffs, but no bonuses on lower levels either."
good,"Uma empresa muito agradavel de se trabalhar mas com poucas oportunidades de crescimento, vai precisar de tudo conspirar a favor !"

good,"Do you want to work everyday for the rest of your life? Do you want to be so far on the priority list that no one does anything to fix your line? Do you want to get blamed for everything wrong with your machine, even though no one else cares enough to fix it? Well then my friend, the Food Safety department of 3M Brookings is for you. Watch as very friendly people work themselves to soul crushing depression. Be told everyday that it will get better and that people are working on the problem, and then see nothing happen. Be reminded everyday how replaceable everyone is and how you dont matter."
good,"I loved the job but if u get hurt, injured or anything that could cause waves for the company they give u the boot. Even if ur a full employee, which I wasn't at the time I was a temp."
good,"I was a contractor for my first job out of college and 3M doesn't treat contract workers with the same respect it does their employees. I learned quite a bit of the ""politics"" of corporate culture. A closed minded group into protecting departments instead of addressing and solving problems. That could have just been a management issue but was not my experience."
good,"Fast paced, always busy, good benefits, very big corporation. Good opportunity for entry level workers that want a stable job. Temp-to-hire. Great products."
good,"However, it’s not easy getting hired regardless of your work ethic and punctuality, they prefer hiring family and friends, despite them not having the experience. Good company when it comes to balancing your life outside of work, as there’s three shift and the occasional voluntary overtime. The pay is terrible, they’ll start you off at minimum wage, which is fair, but once hired you have to complete various tests to reach various levels of pays. My lead made $17 an hour with her having passed them all, AND she had been there 7 years."
good,Constantes mudanças da Presidência da empresa sendo que a empresa nunca teve na sua gestão um responsável brasileiro; muitas divisões e pulverização dos negócios o que dificulta a cultura da empresa; grandes oportunidades e desafios de crescimento. Processos para implementar os projetos sempre baseados na metodologia Six Sigma.
good,"It felt like I was working for a company in the late 80's early 90's rather than 21st century.. Benefits were good, but environment was behind the times."
good,"3M in Dekalb offers great pay and benefits but there is a huge disconnect between management and the staff, lots a hrs worked, and lots of drama throughout the company. The leads are in cliques and employees are treated favorably by certain people in charge."
good,"3M has amazing benefits.  I feel this is the key reason stay, versus enjoying their job.  Safety and quality are number one at the site.  You will at times feel like your leadership is disagreeing with you, but do your best to follow their rules and you'll be fine.  3M has a different mindset of how to lead the people and are not always careful on their delivery, which gives the appearance of favoritism and prejudice.  I feel 3M, like any company, struggles with work-life balance, especially when they are busy.  Overall, it is a good company to work for and even greater if you aren't in a leadership position.  Long hours and shifts can happen, but in the long run, it pays well and takes care of you by retirement."
good,"3M strives to make sure they benchmark everything against competitive companies, and therefore pay, benefits, work environment, etc. are absolutely average.  No real incentive for high performers to stick around.  Culture is VERY slowly transitioning to a more modern workplace, so some employees are utilizing a work-from-home arrangement.  Many others are absolutely abusing the newfound freedom.  Overall, they pay fine, are reasonably stable, and make for a fine place to hang out for 35 years until you finally feel death's cold embrace."
good,The pay and benefits are very good with this company. The swing shift schedule makes it hard to keep good sleep patterns. I ended up tired all the time on swing shift. Most days are busy and fly by.
good,"Nothing more or less. The company seems to have went downhill. People who worked there for 10+ years were complaining that the insurance was worse, the way they treated the employees was dropping etc."
good,It was a decent job that many had hopes of retiring from. They decided to close our facility. Worked under sometimes less than preferable conditions but the pay was decent for this area.
good,"Ett amerikanskt bolag där man (då jag arbetade där) bytte ut VD var 3-4 år och som oftast kom från huvudkontoret i USA. Ganska ""typisk"" amerikansk kontorsinredning där man måste passera VD-assistentens rum för att komma till VDs rum.  Det kändes väldigt amerikanskt och intressant att arbeta där som VD-assistent och jag trivdes bra men efter 5 år ville jag ha mer ""puls"" vilket jag tyckte saknades där och som var anledningen till att jag sökte mig vidare."
good,Entreprise qui fait d'énorme bénéfice sur la santé de ces collaborateurs et du voisinage environnant.
good,"Although I left the company some years ago, I worked there for 9 years. During that time I never felt like I fit in. Most of the employees were transplants from Minnesota and if you were not a part of that group, you were on the outs."
good,They can give you a good salary but but you'll have a hard time doing you work organized due ro multiple meetings. In terms of selling not enough time to do so.
good,3M was one of the best company i ever came across. The environment was so friendly and everyone was quite helping and assisting to each other. its been a good platform where one can start and boost his career.
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,There isn't a lot of training. Sort of thrown in to the deep and and left to swim. My job was made with a long period of trial and error. After years of trial and error they closed the plant and moved it to another facility.
good,"Even though the environment is slightly quiet, the colleague are the one that makes you want to go work every day.  Fun people to work with"
good,"Fun place to work. There were fundraisers for Goodwill, company picnic and games. Thanksgiving turkey coupon was given every year to all employees."
good,"It s a good place to work.The growth is restricted as it is a comparatively flat organization.Learned a lot in the company ."
good,Over the last few years priorities have shifted away from innovation and more to financials. Long term R+D projects are going away and the focus is on making quick hit savings.
good,"The work environment is a good one to work in, everyone gets alone with one another. The pay is not good and the benefits are not that good also."
good,A typical workday is keeping your machine running as much as possible so we can continue to make the best product for our customers in a timely manner. This is a 24x7 operation where I work a 12 hour shift and am relieved by the next 12 hour shift. I have learned how many different kinds of tape that 3M makes. The hardest part of the job is making sure that the quality is there on every roll because so many different things can go wrong at any moment and the faster you can catch it the sooner you can correct it and minimize any losses.
good,"Em função da crise, foi desfigurada a cultura cultivada na empresa mas tenho certeza que se renovará e se acertará em curto prazo por ser uma sólida empresa com excelentes profissionais."
good,"This was a good job until management changed.  Then, the call center began to decline as jobs were cut and work loads were shifted to the remaining staff."

good,"Company with employees from different cultures, background and experience. Diversified businesses with a single objective. "
good,"For the most part the job and family life balance was pretty normal.  Within the last couple of years we were told when we could and could not use vacation.  The benefits were very good!  I felt my job security was safe.  I thought I would retire from 3M, but my supervisor made it very difficult.  I loved the people I worked with, but management was quick to assume the worst and never acknowledged for good or outstanding work.  Unfortunately, it got to the point I had knots in my stomach when I had to go to work.  It was time for a change!  I want to work at a business where I am appreciated."
good,"A very comfortable place to work with,surrounded by your fellow co-worker which apparently became your friends.A work place where you can learn a lot of things such as communicating with high profile people such as politician,lawyers and even celebrities.A very kind and hard working co-employees,managers and even maintenance as well,the hardest thing at work was handling customer complaints,but the most enjoyable part was the x'mas parties held every year,the out of town swimming,getting along with this kind of people is unexplainable feeling,but the truth is..salary on this kind of job is not enough for my families everyday needs."
good,"Good atmosphere for work"
good,"Poor management, high turnover rate leaves very little SMEs, good money but that's all the employees are there for.  Flexible hours"
good,Une bonne ambiance avec les collègues qui permet la facilité de l’exécution des tâches qui nous a été confiés.
good,"worked on a line rotating jobs every 2 hrs. or so.Decent people to work with,nice management overall.learned somewhat of products 3m has to offer."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"I enjoy my work experience at my current job, I like how you have the opportunity to work in the different areas of the company. My only dislike is the job and life balance with working 12 hours rotating shift. It makes it difficult to continue your education with working those sort of hours. That is my reason for seeking different employment because I will like to pursue my education in Supply Chain."
good,I like the job because we work in group and i had a very hard working supervisor that always motivated me.I never worked as assembler before so i have learned all new things specially  how time is so important.Working overtime(10hr) including Saturday affected me to attend class.I get paid for over time but no other  benefits.
good,"Nessa empresa era tercerizado os serviços no entanto a empresa 3M do Brasil está no topo entre as melhores da regiao..."
good,dit was een sociaal makkelijk bedrijf waar je de vrijheid kreeg om de doelen te halen !
good,"Poor management, bullying of co workers, back stabbing, etc."
good,"Management only concerned with productivity numbers and not with teamwork.Wasn't originally that way until former warehouse manager retired and new ""regime"" took over.Most people who work there are good employees and deserve better."
good,"3M is a huge company but most areas are understaffed which causes each employee to have the workload of several people. Most employees end up working 12-14 (or more) hours a day 7 days a week. The benefits are ok and the pay is ok but if you divide it out by the hours worked...well, I wouldn't recommend doing that!"
good,"Downtime and spare parts are the main issue here, it seems people move up and get places not for what they know but for who and how much bull they talk."
good,"Good for Beginners"
good,"Pros"
good,"Working for the company is overall pretty decent. The issues and concerns are not compensation basis, but management is really not that good. With that being said, if your not part of the ""Click"", make sure you do what you got to do and stay out the way. Medical is great, 401K plans are great, vacation, STD/LTD(Short Term/Long Term Disability)  and personal days are given upon the first initial start date. 2 weeks vacation in the door!"
good,"collaboration tres bonne entre collegues, culture d'netreprise tres elevee"
good,Was a great place when I 1st started but many problems that management didnt want to fix. I would have stayed with 3m until I retired but when problems happen they choose to sell us without any warning.
good,"The job was simple and easy to follow, but left little time for life outside of the workplace. It was a good environment with an equally good pay, and the management was fair and understanding."
good,"Being a 3M employee I have learnt a lot like Disrtibutor management, spec in products, deal closure, Negotiations, High level presentations, Product development ETC."
good,"Diversity in workplace & good work life balance"
good,The pay was really good bit the job was not for me. I was not a fan of working in a factory. It was really hard balancing family and work with all the manditory overtime.
good,"I worked with some of the best folks at 3M, but left because the company is led by executives who aren't courageous enough to lead true transformation."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"The company environment is good and colleague are friendly and nice."
good,"Es una compañía reconocida mundialmente por la calidad de sus productos.  Destaco los valores corporativos, ética y orientación al cliente."
good,"The job is easy enough,  the pay is good, the benefits are okay, but the mandatory overtime makes having ANY life outside of work impossible.  Working mandated weekends for months on end.  The only way to get a day off is to use your vacation.  The management is good but dealing with the human resources department is terrible."
good,"HR is amazing but l seriously hope that they will come inside the warehouse more often to see what’s really going on with MGMT.  Allorders are in a timely manner and if you don’t put the order in a certain form, than it takes you longer to finish the order and that’s a point and if you get an error that’s another point and God forbid you say hello to someone when a Sup is passing by, that’s another point and your out the door."
good,"For someone who is self driven this can be good company. They have decent medical benefits, 401K matching, Stock Purchasing plans. Where it falls short is organization of goals and direction on priorities."
good,it slow and boring u do the same stuff over and over check badges and pack them their nothn really to differnet and u sit in a small room for most the day
good,"if you can work at a slow pace, and watch people get promoted because they were so bad at their previous position this is the place to work. "
good,"- Days spent on the phone and working within multiple screens "
good,Show up. Punch in. Go to assigned work station. Do assigned task. When completed move onto the following task. At the end of the day inform the incoming crew. punch out and go home.
good,Standing loading trailers all day. Get two breaks but the rest of the time you have to stand in a hot trailer loading boxes. Good for very short term employment.
good,"it was okay "
good,The equipment was very outdated for such a big company.  The training was very vague and I found it to be quite useless.  I pretty learned everything as I went.

good,"Lo que mas me gusto:  el ambiente de mejora continua. Continuamente desafiados. "
good,"Buenos salarios, pésima calidad de vida. Existen buenos beneficios extralegales."
good,"I worked my butt off to make money for this company and got zero return from the company itself. Other than getting paid, I was just a number. Employees that were part of the management clique got special treatment and had chance after chance after chance only ever receiving a slap on the wrist. They worked the system and got away with it. Not part of that clique, not cared about. The human resources department was a joke. I was nearly a two year employee that planned on making a career until retirement with the company, and I was thrown away and given the runaround until it cost me my job. Their loss. Not worth working for."
good,"3M is a regular company like any company,   It has standard benefits.    It gives s regular pay and competitive pay comparable to within the area.    It has desirable working area.   3M is a safe work environment and safety snd health is always the number one concern"
good,Long hours and swing shifts are hard for life/work balance.  Typical days are repetitive motions for packing supplies and running machines.  Management changes too much.  Work place culture can be competitive and people spread rumors easily.
good,"nothing special about the place, except co workers, were great, like a family.Work was mundane, could never get needed parts for repairs, because they didn't want to spend the money."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"Get ready to be in a sea of contract hires! Management is slow to react to ideas. However, co-workers are great and are always willing to help and teach."
good,Overall I can Go and Grow anywhere so just another place of Employment..There were places to go and grow but all the high educated Manadement staff were not people people and didn't know how to treat them so moral was always down!!!
good,Was family years ago not anymore.want to end my career in seven years with a bang.Not with a bad taste in my mouth thank you for the memories 3m😂 Time for a new adventure for me.
good,Came as a contractor hoping for an opportunity for full time position. It was clear that the chances of that happening were slim to none. Seemed to be more contractors than actual 3M employees. Seems to be the way 3M is going these days. Obtain the labor without paying benefits and having no liability.
good,"Overall, 3M treats their full-time employees very well, but to a much lesser degree, their contract workers (no vacation, benefits, performance reviews), with lots of politics in the way of actually getting hired. The office is comfortable, and work-life balance is well-respected. Leadership could be stronger; there is a lack of transparency and follow-through on decisions. The learning opportunities are tremendous."
good,"there is separation between contract and full time employees in benefits,PTO and any other benefits even buying from 3M store"
good,"Learning a lot in our demo rooms in the Innovation center."
good,very strict work environment as working with sensitive materials. fair working conditions. no room for growth. management is fair and relatively prompt in dealing with issues brought to their attention
good,good place to work i have learned alot of job positions at 3m i worked there for 18 years. the plant is really clean . i got along with co workers and management . the hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting .
good,"empresa boa de se trabalhar , bons beneficios, setor bem organisado."
good,"Freedom to tackle any problem you like in just about any way you want. Flexible work hours and environment.  Helpful and knowledgeable staff.  No sense of culture, however."
good,"3M offers some of the best wages and benefits in the area requiring very little experience. Most of your days will be spent picking product for customers and readying it for shipment. Starting employees will likely use a riding electric pallet jack vehicle to pick individual cartons to a pallet as a Job Grade 4 employee. The vast majority of these cartons will be well under 50lbs., and those that are heavier should be lifted with help. "
good,Alegre y mucha disponibilidad de trabajar en todas las areas referentes a mi perfil
good,There are many issues that need attention.  The culture is that of a small family owned business.  They need to think about technology and innovations that bring them to the 21st century.
good,i like working here but the management decisions are interesting in the PPS section of the business. things have not been communicated from management to staff.
good,had great pay and benefits. downfall was 12 hour shifts rotating nights and days every 2 weeks. didn't know if I was suppose to be sleeping or awake.  only working 3 to 4 days a week gave me a lot of time off.
good,It was a good job but the plant closed down. I would still be there if they were still open. I live five minutes away. There was great team work at this factory. I miss it.
good,It's productive work place were every gets alone with one other. Has ping pong table in the cafeteria. You can live on your lunch break to get your lunch or just to sit outside to get some fresh air.
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"company was going through a transition from Bondo to 3m when I started. job descriptions and duties were inconsistent and changed as the process evolved. I worked on and becamed efficient operating and maintaining several machines, that produced and/or packaged putty and adhesives."
good,This place is very professional and is a great place to work. There is not a whole lot of available job advancement. The employees are very knowledgable and they want you to do the best that you can.
good,"packing out product, cleaning, computer work. Moving to different departments working in different areas to get a feel for different products."
good,Staff is very team oriented. Organization is mainly focused on the Oil and Gas Sector. This can be good or not so good if there is a major sector in this Sector.
good,Got hired to contribute with an specific task. Even though I was good at my job there weren't many opportunities for me to stay due to company policies
good,"It is a good company. Great products and lots of talented employees."
good,"Bonne Entreprise, avec un climat agréable. Le management est plutôt bien géré. "
good,3M used to be a place that was better to work at compared to other companies.  Now they have intentionally benchmarked themselves against competition and used it as a way to reduce costs and now the experience is just like every other company.
good,"Learnt different fields of work such as"
good,"début de journée prise des commandes préparations et chargement des commandes livraison sur chantier ou particuliers"
good,It was a great opportunity to learn a new set of skills at a fast paced level.  Good management and helpful employees to someone new coming in to the facility.
good,"3M is a very open culture working environment and staff can exercise their autonomy in their work scope. There are no extensive hierarchical reporting level and also the culture encourage work independence and open discussions at work place."
good,"Exceeding what was expected for every order, 100% daily, i learned many things over my ten years with this company, co workers worked hard, hardest part of the job was  incentives dwendling yearly, my most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team with other employees and the organization with positive attitudes and management."
good,"Good place to work, friendly people & valuable safety measures"

good,"Corporate Culture "
good,"I worked with a bunch of really nice people. They took the time to instruct me on every job that i was to be doing. We made and packaged Post-It Notes of all sizes and types. As a temp, they treated me with the same respect as full time operators. The work was not hard but you are on your feet 8 to 12 hours a day. It is a laid back management team that was only there when needed. That is to say that they did not hover or micro manage. "

good,"The employee development is decent, and the compensation is fair."
good,3M DDSD is a great company for an individual thats trying to obtain some pharmaceutical manufacturing experience. This is a company with little room for growth within the positions due to its poor managment culture.
good,"For me, my work has evolved over the past decade. It used to be well defined, and since many of the changes within 3M New Ulm, the position of Manufacturing Engineer is a catch-all. Everything has become the responsibility of Engineering in New Ulm, and very little accountability is given to production and maintenance. These areas are critical to the success of any project or an of the metrics engineers are graded on.  Also, the management seems out of touch with day to day activities. They spend the majority of time in high level meetings with their parent divisions, and it is evident their understanding of operations and day to day issues is not a priority. They want to be handed information through tables and graphs to present to their bosses, and they don't take interest in how production is performing, projects, or anything unless their is a major issue. Then it's the engineer's job to figure it all out and report back. There isn't a proper delegation to any group responsible or follow-up. This is evident in the employee survey taken each year. New Ulm has a terribly low score within 3M. It's unfortunate, because it was much better at the beginning of my career."
good,"Diversely cultured & enjoyable place to with. Many highlights in challenges we seek on a daily basis through certain expectations, that overcome with a desirable taste of sheer commitment of teamwork. There are many opportunities given to proven worthy of such value within the workforce."
good,"eh they are okay but not great. employee doesn't get to choose placement. company is not transparent at all. bad managers, good in plant staff and nice people"
good,It is a very secure job. But you will work a lot of overtime. And there is a lot of different chemicals. The culture is good. It's just a lot of overtime.
good,"Job Security productive place to work, lots of overtime, very good work culture, friendly employees , team atmosphere. very good training and management"
good,"War nur Praktikant, daher kann ich nicht viel dazu sagen"
good,"Great hours, decent work,  most of the time we were very busy, a little downtime when machines went down and had to wait for maintenance.  Working with a team makes days or nights go by quickly."
good,3M pays its employees very well and observes work life balance around holidays. They do require a lot of forced overtime but compensate very well for it.

good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"I was a contract carpenter for the 3M in Four Points. It was an alright contract, but I left it due to personal reasons from someone who no longer is employed at that facility. The job itself has too much down time for me, meaning that I went 2 months sitting in a room with little work to be done. Everything there is about money so if they don't think they have the money to provide the proper facilities to get rid of the machines/metals/hardware, then you aren't going to be doing much at all at work. It was incredibly boring because I thrive in a fast paced environment and this contract was not that at all. I really liked the actual building itself because it was in a beautiful part of Austin. Lots of greenery and wildlife, but the job itself was not very interesting. I went in as a carpenter and didn't really do anything carpentry related so that was a massive bummer for me. My contract boss was a great guy though! Lots of love towards him, it wasn't his fault work got slow."
good,"Comes with the normal level of corporate idiosyncrasies. A very large company that is one of the DOW markers, very diversified with opportunities to move in multiple directions."
good,Benefits declined the longer I was there. good  benefits and job security .was a very well managed company with good pension program. Bad working hours with rotating shifts.
good,"Was a great opportunity to develop, but culture is one of high expectations without considering work life balance. Resources are strapped due to understaffing."
good,I really enjoyed the fact that 3m promoted all employees health habits and influenced that by adding a ping pong table and a basket ball court. They also added a walking area for our breaks.
good,"Overall good company, a great deal of micromanagement.  Weekly travel, when interviewed told minimal travel but it turned out to be weekly.  The division between management and staff and known."
good,"It is what it is. The job is boring, average factory work (very easy though, no true skills required). I had a great manager but many of the managers in the plant are rude and incompetent. Workers are treated as numbers easily replaced. Vacation and time off is not fair even in extreme situations. Your coworkers make or break the job."
good,A company that hires great people with amazing skill sets. Solid management that follows proven business methods and models to ensure high productivity results.
good,"good pay for the area! a very good company with good products ! management is horrible! most do not follow company core values :( by managment i mean Team leaders,supervisors,product managers. It seems like the less senority you have the more you move up it doesnt matter if one has a college degree or lazy. so sad because 3M needs to get back to the old way of doing things"
good,"At the time I was working, there were unsafe work practices involving lack of respiratory PPE as well as protective clothing, I left the company shortly after they implemented specific protective work uniforms"
good,There's alot of family and friends that work there. It's a job where you must know someone or fit in. If you upset someone they'll pressure and bully you till you quit. Very excellent pay and benefits though.
good,it is a okay place to work the management is over baring and usually has no idea how to do there job when the step back the job is easier and done with ease
good,Its a good job for someone who is single and loves to work alot. The Benefits is awesome and there is some room for advancement depending on what job you are applying for.
good,"Shifts are always rotating. There are some 2 crew and straight crewing starting to develop. Your jobs are often repetitive. I had some good positions that included variety, but they aren't the norm."
good,"It was an alright place to work. They were very strict with punctuality. I feel pay was well considering that I now am paid less where the cost of living is much, much higher."
good,"Great place to work but, laid off due to the company moving all jobs out of the state of NC. No other information can be given at this time because I don't have any other information to give."
good,it was very nice working there meet  all kinds Culture  people i enjoy with work them. Over times people brings foods for taste of their county foods.
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"I worked there for over 10 years, things never changed your family ends up being last on your list because they come first with no choice you live there. Yes the money is good, but kiss your life goodbye!"
good,It was ok - It was a night shift position and it was a good experience for me - Everyone was nice and helpful to me  It was just a job that I needed for the time being
good,"3M is a good resume builder, It is a good place to increase your skill set . 3M has great benefits however I would not recommend 3M for long term employment. I personally liked the group leaders some didn't. Its up to the individual. It is an integrated facility. In there peak season you have a great opportunity to make money hand over fist. Over time can be ungodly however at least mandatory 60hr weeks at 12hr increments for months on end. All major  Holidays are regular work days. So, with that said if you need money,  a safe place to work and knowledgeable leadership it's there. Mentally stressful. it is not a place to put roots but get out of debt yes or catch up on child support.  yes.  Not a good place for single parents who don't have reliable sitting.. especially someone who will accommodate overtime at 12 hours shifts. A great resume builder.  long term not a good place. Try it for a year."
good,"enjoyed my time with 3m, good environment, good people to work with. All seemed to enjoy their job, and employers alike.  Highly recommend people to seek employment there."
good,I was just a three months consulting job at 3M for Finance Reporting role. I believe having the right manager and being in the right team makes a big difference in 3M.
good,"Work consists of time management. Triage care to employees. Insurance claims and employee assistance frequent. Job includes meetings, reports and frequent injuries. Hearing conservation and Blood Pressure clinics are frequent. Hardest part of the job is limiting the day to 8 hours, and days are very long at times. The most difficult part of the job is that the facility runs 24/7 and I am on call all that time. I also need to cover weekend shifts for clinics, trainings and triage care. Culture is very diverse and often language barriers require an interpreter. Day may end with crisis to tend to or numerous employee concerns and questions. Enjoy the interaction with the employees and teaching health and wellness to many. I enjoy preventative medicine and assisting with proper eating and exercising if asked for assistance"
good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, muita flexibilidade."
good,You must have a MBA t advance or work very late hours everyday. People are great but need to work hard to stand out and not everyone is your friend in big companies
good,"wasn't a bad place, was small and had a couple bad apples but in small environmental they made a lot of noise and effected overall mood of workforce."
good,It was an okay experience with promised hours.. i felt like i made good money but after a while i felt like a robot and i was not happy at all. And that is why i left to find a better job. Also the people who work there are very immature.
good,"Interesting Company To Work For, High Tech and  Educational.Was their on temporary assignment, However I was offered A full-time  position elsewhere. Pay was competative in todays market."
good,"As an HR Coordinator, I have a lot of opportunities to talk to 3M employees and management base on their concerns and questions to find a solution. That was my job, and I love it."
good,"great place to work, folks are amazing to work with, never working in the heat. lots of standing on your feet for long periods of time. hope this helps."
good,Big company to work for. They provided guidance as an intern there back in my day. Not sure how it is now. Not to many opportunities as at the time they were not looking to hire.
good,"As much overtime as you want, but it is required to work shifts, which means you could work day shift for two days, have two days off, then return on night shift.  Hard to get used to that."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,i liked the hours and the monday thru friday. i did not enjoy all the meeting and the slow pace of the company. i was very micro managed. I also was always afraid for my health.
good,"Based off my own personal experience (may not be the same for others), they fully expect you to be available to answer questions/ask for assistance outside your working hours, even if you're paid hourly."
good,"Regular hourly employees establish roots, but upper level employees typically move on after two years. Each new engineer want to improve process so changes happen all the time."
good,"I started working at a young age and I was early in the story of how to integrate and adapt to people around you who are working with boss and costumers. At first I thought I could work for money but later I also learned that you should not just work to earn money but also work for knowledge. "
good,3M is not bad just some people are not cut out to work for a giant company. Multiple layers of managers and no one can make a decision.However the pay is good as well as the benefits.
good,Fast paced always busy never a lack of work could be a little better communication between employees and management a better understanding of mental illness
good,"Honestly this isn't a bad place to work if you don't mind having little family and home time. Pay is great, the benefits were great. The shift work started to be a bourdon for me and my family."
good,I worked through manpower at 3m. Everyone I worked with made it fun and interesting so the day did not drag.  I got laid off when it was very slow.  But loved the job and environment.  When I got a call back to help them out 3 months I had already gotten another job so I had to decline.
good,"I worked as a Sourcing Associate with the Sourcing Center at 3M Maplewood, MN. Its a great place to start a career, lots of good experience with the supply chain software but the workload can be overwhelming in the beginning. Multitasking was crucial working at 3M."
good,"My office was a small satellite office that consisted of two CSR's. Myself and my supervisor. It was a very busy and demanding office, but I enjoyed that challenge and responsibility. I learned that the culture in a large corporation is entirely different than working for a smaller business. It has its positives and negatives. But the positive aspects always outweighed the negative. My supervisor was wonderful, she never asked you to do anything that she wouldn't or hadn't already done. She was patient and always willing to share her knowledge with me so I could excel at my job. I think the work/life balance was the hardest part of the job. Being a busy office with just the two of us handling all of the duties was challenging. The most enjoyable part for me was the rewarding feeling of knowing we were growing the business year after year with hard work and discipline. I was trusted to handle all aspects of the job on my own with minimal supervision."
good,3M as a company is good to fair.  I believe I could excel here if I were on a different team. Customer Service are salaried which is rare.  There are lots of different opportunities for someone with drive and attention to excellence.
good,good jobs great times and a healthy work environment to thrive and grow professionally.  couldn't ask for more from my employer.  5 out of 5 from me exellent
good,Mi desempeño en 3M fue a honorarios por lo tanto no puedo opinar.
good,Everyday was like the last and after about a month in I felt like I was trapped in a never ending loop. Some weeks were better then others. Time would seem to go slow but some days it would go fast. I got along with everyone and made relationships with my co-workers. Overall environment was welcoming.
good,"It is a steady place to work.  The job is consistent with little changes. "
good,"Innovative company, challenging work, good technology, driven culture. Results oriented.  Excellent resume builder.  Work/life balance is very poor which can be an issue for some."
good,"The end  of the story , I have filled out this survey to the best of my ability and have found that 3M is a great company to work for. "
good,I was a temp worker and the experience was an ok one. Cant speak on benefits and things of that nature i was full time through a temp  agency. Temp agency boss was very nice
good,American style. Results is the key. Professional working environment. Flexible working hours. You must constantly show good performance to stay relevant in the company.
good,At 3M I worked as a call center IT representative. Calls would come into the call center under the subject matter of IT questions or help related to employee computer issues.
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"Would probably have had a better work experience had I been hired as a full time employee, and not a contractor. Most of the time, managers thought I was a student and forgot that I existed. No chance of being hired on full time after my contract was up, so I left."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was that the pay was really high. The downside is how clicky and catty the employees are. When trying to perform your job your have to watch out for senior employees. Very biased. Very relaxed for senior employees. Very easy to get in trouble other wise.
good,"Its factory work, repeditive work, managment isnt bad, workers can be childish, hot in some parts of factory, cold in others, hard to keep social life"
good,"Nice place to work. Good people, cool machinery. The work was not hard just had to use your time wisely. The job just needed to pay more for the work you had to do"
good,"Good group of people to work with, i did enjoyed working there too, management  was good, people was helpful to each others, it was good place to work, i had good experience."
good,"Good place to build experience and base skills. Forced overtime is a guarantee. Good benefits and pay, but the safety culture is not very progressive and often based on punitive actions."
good,"In general, the people are great and the work is interesting and rewarding at 3M Canada."
good,"É uma empresa de produtos e cultura muito fortes. Entretanto, ainda não percebeu que não está mais sozinha no mercado. "
good,"They are huge so they have phenomenal resources to pay you well above average, and they have fantastic 401k options too. "
good,"I have had 6 managers in less than 3 years at 3M. This is not atypical. Opportunities for advancement are there, but it's a difficult organization to navigate. Unless you know someone, don't even bother applying to a job on the internal job site. I applied to dozens of jobs I was qualified for with no response. The only times I was able to move positions was if someone I knew well had a job opening and thought I would be a good fit for it. "
good,El supervisor de ese entonces no apoyaba a los trabajadores o no tenía un liderazgo
good,The hard part of the job is to find a project to work on.
good,"Work culture was a bit peculiar, but could depend on your role. A lot of judgmental characters on the campus, but a lot of good people too. Overall a good healthy workplace, but not entirely ethical and not exactly forward thinking in its branding or its online presence. I saw high turnover during my few years here, and some people really disliked their work lives. As for my own work life? It was fine. 3/5 stars."

good,The typical day at 3M is fast paced.  You will have know a few different jobs because most days you are not doing the same one.  The management could use a little work.  You have 2 work team leaders and 2 lead operators per shift telling  you 4 different things.  Co-workers are great and everyone is pretty easy to get along with.

good,Ottima esperienza lavorativa sia con il Management che con gli operatori .

good,"I worked there for over 10 years and it never changed, you lived there, overtime was ridiculous, they are continuously trying to improve stuff, making your job more stressful and harder to do and achieve what needs to be done, but yet the ones doing the changes are not the ones working the overtime and are not the ones in there every single weekend. It may pay good, but it's not worth missing out on your life for, plus everyone that retires from there, dies within 5 years that says something..hmmm!"

good,they have placed support analyst in to dev environments and expecting dev knowledge later. that was hard for a support guy with rich production support experience
good,85% nice and easy going employees. needs keycard to access different areas of the building. no set break time for warehouse members. Supervisor was hardly around so the team had to compromise.
good,"I only worked there for a year on a project.  It's hard to give an extensive review based on that. Management was fine, co-workers were fine. I'm glad I got the opportunity to work on the project."
good,"It is a good place to work, its not hard. Management has a problem with communication and knowing whats going on. A typical day is repeating the same thing over and over, everyone is mostly laid back easy going. I would rather have a day position."
good,"Good place to work, although not much opportunity for advancement. Culture is typical of a large company, and it's easy to go unnoticed if you are performing adequately. Most employees have been there for years. Not much young blood. "

good,"Working with other technicians and the engineer was a great experience. Production is a huge part of the workplace. Some weeks, we would run experiments, which engages the technicians to work with engineers. This was the most exciting part of the job. The team were knowledgeable and engaging to new workers. But, I felt management was the downfall. Expectation was too high even when the team was understaffed."
good,"No advancement, Time wasted is approximately 40%, Productivity never exceeds 60% especially to mention permanent employees. Totally different culture compared to my earlier experience within 3M. Middle management are not well qualified to be leaders of the future. I thought I would enjoy it there but turned me to avoid to re apply for any post at 3M Canada."
good,Working for 3M has been a good experience. I've been able to cross train and enter act with new and old employees. The benefits with 3M were outstanding.
good,"My day consisted of various responsibilities everything from training, operating machinery and making chemical mixes.  The 32 years I was there I was in several different departments and learned all aspects of a manufacturing/warehouse environment.  Prior to 3M taking over in 2011 and even today the environment was one of hostility and disrespect of workers from the supervisors and upper management.  3M is working to improve that and has made great strides but has far yet to go.  The hardest part of the job was working with the hazardous chemicals to produce the products we made.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers."
good,"análisis de posibles clientes."
good,"3M FRANCE est une société offrant de nombreuses opportunités de découvrir des métiers différents sur des marchés complétement différents"
good,The hardest part about work is the days and hours that are required to work when forced. The workers are enjoyable for the most part. Management could approve some but overall the job isn't as bad. Just be ready to work 5-6 days a week.
good,There is a split culture of the owners and the not-owners. The owners don't give you the time of day until they feel you have earned your stripes.

good,"I'm Twenty years old and I worked at the 3M Purification Factory for two and half months. I was on third shift which is a very hard shift to adjust to, in which I found I finally could not. Besides the lifestyle change in my shift, the work however, is pretty easy. In my area of the factory, we worked at a fast paced force, which I may say was not very difficult when you have the right training; and training isn't really needed for this job needless to say. In the end, i couldn't adjust to third shift and tried to switch shifts which was not an option. Therefore, third shift isn't for everyone!!"
good,"I learned the copier and office equipment business here.Good job, company car."
good,A place where individual skills are utilized at full potential.
good,"A 3M é uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, garante os direitos e benefícios de seus funcionários. A estabilidade é sua maior virtude, hoje é muito comum ter na companhia funcionários com mais de 10 anos de 3M, no entanto, em função desta estabilidade e da baixa rotatividade dos cargos, a evolução da carreira é muito lenta, é muito comum encontrar funcionários com cinco anos ou mais executando a mesma função em um mesmo cargo."
good,I love helping people out an also I love to work I’m a very good hard worker an the things I done at my job is different processes an I also trained them on the process that needed help
good,Good place to work. Ive been an employee here for almost 10 years and don't have much to complain about. Could do a little more for employee satisfaction.

good,I liked my supervisor and my co workers.  I didn't really care for the work that I was doing.  Pay was okay I was a contractor not an employee of 3M.  Work/Life balance was good.
good,"3M is a great place to work if you value work-life balance and want to raise a family. However, if you want to advance, you would hit glass ceiling pretty quickly without knowing high up. Very political among management especially with executives, sometimes decisions were made slow and constantly change..."
good,"I worked as a temp for my first factory experience. I picked it up really fast because I had seasoned workers that were switching shifts training me. The department supervisor made this job so much worse than it should have been. The work and hours are not unbearable. In fact, it was pretty easy in my department. Our pace started picking up for the season, and instead of scheduling us for a set schedule, the next 3 months were awful because the supervisor pretty much avoided telling us what our hours were and let the whole department argue over what would work for the amount of labor we needed to cover. Meanwhile, we were told the day of or before to come in early, stay late, work 12 hr shifts, all because they needed the work done but nobody was actually scheduled to do it. Many people transferred departments and quit because of the craziness. I quit when the new ""set schedule"" was supposed to be out on the Friday before the following week, which was unscheduled, and instead of a schedule they just let me know what next week was. I wouldn't know what shift I was working, how many hours, or with who. Not even the full timers did."

good,"I only worked as a summer temp, so I didn't spend a long time there. I found it stressful working the swing shift, and the work was monotonous at best, but I really enjoyed working with my coworkers and manager."
good,"The only real complaints I have about working at 3M is the heavily entrenched and out of touch upper management all competing and jockeying for position between themselves at the detriment of their reporting staff. These are people who have 30+ plus years with 3M and no experience of the world outside of 3M and are incredibly resistant to change."
good,working with the insides sales was very stressful and sometime hard to get along with. They thought that they were beyond helping contact customers when we needed their help.
good,"Fast paced, sometimes a bit hectic. Filtrete area has no leadership, people are confused on who is in charge which causes a lot of drama. Makes it stressful to work with certain types of people and enjoy job."

good,"3M is a very exciting place to work for and you experience new things every day. We have a wealth of exciting technologies and event invent new ones. Management is great and have good people in those positions, but don't think they value the employees they have, when they don't hire them on as a 3M employee. The hardest part of the job is working 12 hour days, and having no PTO or benefits to motivate you to work that hard. I've learned more than I ever could have in school and even more. The people here have been in the industry very long so can teach any one a wealth of knowledge."

good,"Slow to modernize, old boys club (though slowly improving). great pay and benefits, many opportunities to learn and get new training, nice people, not overly political and mid-levels, very slow to promote, outdated work styles."
good,I would recommend the outside sales internship over the inside sales internship. The company treated the Frontline Interns very well and spent a lot of time and money on each individual.
good,"There are a lot of meetings that seem unnecessary and things get accomplished very slowly through the ranks. However, management cares a lot about the development of skills for people below them and give them different roles which will give them quality experience going forward."

good,"Todos los días te llevan tu cafe, puedes desayunar en tu lugar, el comedor es amplio, sin embargo los jefes son un asco no tienen tolerencia, te tines que quedar hasta mu tarde, no tienes contrato directo por la empresa hasta despues de un año si bien te va o hasta 3 años  no tienes prestaciones superiores, solo las de ley, no te dejan claros los objetivos  no los tienen escritos, no te dan un refresh  de lo que haz hecho  solo te piden que hagas mil cosas  las haces  te terminan corriendo, a parte de que esta muy lejos, no lo recomiendo y a los jefes me refiero con supervisores  gerentes."
good,"Work from 6 a.m. - 4:30 p.m., 10-minute breaks every 3 hours, 30 min lunch, standing 100% of the day, toasty indoor temperature (98-103 Fahrenheit in the summer), fun people"
good,we work as a line assembler or medical blanket assembler. I'll learn how to take care of a job especially in time to manage how our work can be done correctly and properly.
good,"Come ready to work, motivated, highly entergetic, and give your 100% effort daily. Dress due to weather ready to perform work duties at production paste."
good,"All in all, a good company/site, but as with most people at this site, too many projects/expectations with not enough resources.  Company vision and initiatives are good, but lack of appropriate staffing is driving many people to leave due to being overworked.  Most here are working 50+ hours/week.  And although pay and benefits are fair, it doesn't compensate for the stress of all the excess work."
good,"Good paying job, hard to move up in the company, very good coworkers. Three day on four days off or four days on and three day off gives you time to spend with family."
good,"Good Corporate Culture.  Very Flat organization though, corporate organization is very much hedged on sales functionality.   Very conservative company when it comes to compensation and benefit structuring.  Average age group of workforce is fairly young ,relatively high turn over rate"
good,"good work experience, was a good working environment"
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"3M has very good Benefits. The hours are great, they were 7-3 and"
good,"A typical day includes a pre-shift meeting review what went on the day before and where the previous crew had left off. Continuing on or starting the next orders produced by each line."
good,"My previous Job is Manufacturing assistant in 3M innovation, my duties are managing and improving production processes to enhance product quality and maximize efficiency. I also need to making sure that all production equipment is properly serviced and maintained. In my personal opinion the most challenging part of my job is I must improve the quantity of the out put and also maintain the quality of the product with the old machine and with the low quality of incoming materiel. The most enjoyable part is when we fight target we are very team work we helping each other and when we hit our target we feel very satisfied."
good,"It was a really productive work place, with supportive management and colleagues."
good,"beneficios,comedor en planta, horario de trabajo muy bueno"
good,"llenado de gondola."
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere of my team along with my peers.  They continue to grow as a company but there are still some grey areas about where the company is heading.  Upper management does not believe that they need to continue to coach and develop their direct reports.
good,"Productive Culture with Beneficial HR Policies."
good,Interacting with internal & external clients with the Renewable Energy Division. Work in a group of 4. Co-workers are great team players and easy to get a long with.
good,"Sold the benefits of tinting windows to residential and commercial clients, processed paper work for each account and performed the tinting treatment on the client’s windows"
good,"my overall experience as a ""Temp"" worker was great. Although I must say that the hiring practices are slow and not impressive. As a volt temp worker it is hard to get hired full time. I work the best I can everyday so that someone who knows good work ethics can see how dedicated I am and would give me the chance to better myself. I like who I work with and the enviornment they provide. It is very positive."
good,overall it needs more work mainly in management and the hiring of employees. a day at work its hot alot with it being a warehouse they only had so many fans to go around. but there was nothing hard about the job at all. the co workers are nasty with attitudes all day long. going home was the most enjoyable part of my day.
good,The co-worker are very good and the supervicer are very motivating.
good,"3M was outstanding at career development. From mentor ship, structured projects, and the dual supervisor/technical ladder, it was a great place to start my professional career. "
good,"I made a decent living, great insurance, met alot of really good people, was definitely a challenge! Just time to move on. I been an extruder operator all but one year that I was there."
good,It was a great month long experience.  I ran the biggest cafeteria on the campus.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  I had a very positive experience overall.
good,"Le travail dans cette entreprise n'est pas facile, énormément de défis, surcharge "
good,Aprendi que multinacionais podem te fazer crescer e aprender muito.
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"Know that 3M is a multi-billion dollar, multi-national for-profit company. As such, it operates and is much like any other like it. Personally, I found my manager was excellent and the people around me were all exceptionally talented."
good,"Excelente sitio de trabajo, las personas son amables y muy queridas, las instalaciones son algo antiguas."
good,"Great campus and office setting, good cafeteria, gym, and medical clinic.  "
good,"Molded me into a multifaceted person, with the many tasking given at once and transfers into different departments."
good,I take many calls for many different issues and escalate if needed. I usually keeps to myself since I'm on the 24/7 team and I have a different schedule than most other people on my floor. I've learned a lot and value the experience I have from there. The hardest part of the job is when I can't resolve an issue and need to escalate. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I can fix the issue and the client is happy.
good,3M is a well known MNC.I had a good opportunity to work there for some time.It gives its employees much freedom;It has got very good internal core value system.
good,"The daily work was busy, we were constantly busy working on a machine, packing masks, checking them for errors. I learned a lot while working at 3M, I mainly worked in the mask area, packing and checking masks, running the machines and making sure they were working right, making sure everything was filled and replacing stuff that needed to be. The hardest part of the job was the rotating hours, I was on the rotating shift one week I'd work 8 AM to 4 PM then the next would be 4PM to midnight. With a lot of mandatory overtime. It was hard for me especially with two little kids and another on the way. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other employees, they were all really nice and helpful whenever I needed anything."
good,"orden ,limpieza , ventas , quiebres,aprendí a gestionar e implementaciones ,con los colegas de la empresa poco nos veíamos por que no habían reuniones  y estábamos en diferentes salas,pero cuando había que ir a apoyar ahí estaba . "
good,I am pastry chef and pizza I make  all the misen place and the baking in pastry section and plate presentation and service and I make  all the misen place  for pizza ...
good,"There was opportunity to advance, but the constant threat to send manufacturing over sea was tiring. An American company like Minnesota Mining and manufacturing should be proud to be American and keep it's production in America. A shame that profits were never enough and always had to meet 'expected' profits. Upper management needs to bring their company back to America."
good,Every employee gets two 15 minute breaks and a half an hour breaks. Some employees have the option of working the mandatory over time.
good,I have learned more from working at 3M than any other company.  I also appreciate the challenges they put forth.  The hardest part about my job is making sure the employees are doing what is needed but still are enjoying what they do.
good,"3M is a great place to work at (at least my group is) and is far better if you have a degree."
good,"Poorly managed, revolving door for employees. Speak your mind and find yourself without a job. Powder over people is the motto. No safety training. Fire escape training for office people only. Production is to important to stop and train production employees on evacuation routes. If your thinking about working here, save yourself the headache and bag ice at buccees. Nothing against 3m just 3m Angleton.  Over 600 people have been throughout this plant. They only employee 80 employees and have only been open 3 years. See the problem?"
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"This is a good job with great pay with a reputable company. The only thing is 12 hour swing shifts, plus other employees who are less than reasonable to work with make it even harder to enjoy."
good,"Co-workers are always very nice. "
good,Trabalho com madeira serviço muito masculino... Tive muita dificudade de aprendizado Em montagem de moveis por isso resolvi deixar a empresa onde a unica que trabalhava de mulher era eu.
good,Sempre que alguém me pergunta como e trabalhar na 3m foi uma boa experiência muito boa pena que durou pouco
good,"3m is a great company to work for, but the don't have a real balance between work and home life. the salary I great for the area and the type of work that you do."
good,"hard for females and minorities to advance.  Too much OT and poor work/life balance.  great benefits for all employees and and great pay, but not work the sacrifice."
good,Its a ok company to work for. I don't like the fact that you must have senority to work overtime. It will discourage you not to want to come to work and do your best
good,"Era um bom lugar de se trabalhar, porem não assinava carteira, e não tinha benéficos nem promoções."
good,"La jornada laboral se termina a las 5 de la tarde, y te dan aumentos de salario aunque no lo hayas solicitado."
good,A typical day at work on this job included making anywhere from 200 to 1000 products. The hardest part about this job was that it was difficult to run the machine by yourself. The most enjoyable part of this job was that you were allowed to listen to music.
good,"I enjoyed this role as it was customer facing and something that I found interesting. My daily duties were topping up mobiles selling contracts and mobiles helping with general enquiries and providing a high standard of service representing a respected and well known company. This had been one of my first customer facing roles and it enabled me to break through and be confident when facing members of the public which I really enjoyed,"
good,"Uma bom lugar para aprender, ter  prática para se tornar uma profissional."
good,Good place to work unable to balance Life and work. swift does not work well with transferring shifts.
good,"The lab was a fun place to work, but the environment was terrible. This review goes for the Cordova location only. Management is concerned with themselves. My boss would walk right by me, didn't look at me, and never said hi. There was a major lack of communication at that plant. I learned so much about chemical engineering and adhesive work. I loved working in Quality Control and have ever since."
good,"A topical day starts wit a con call with the days work charted out problems discussed to solve issues in work, Vendor management is one thing i have learnt here, my co-workers are helpful, my hardest part of my job is the sales team promises time lines to the client with out checking with the design team. completion of any project is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I had a difficult time with the management.  I really enjoyed working with the other employees.  Excellent quality control.  Minimal parking opportunities.  Multiple shifts to choose from and just enough overtime hours.
good,"Staff was friendly, good place to work, its a commute to get to the Cordova Plant from the Quad Cities. The IT manager of the IT plant was very hands on."
good,This was a great experience and it helped me to grow in the customer service field. I enjoyed the people and management they where very pleasant and enduring when trying times occured
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"3M buys companies. Their footprint for a branch is one person in accounting doing all the functions,... financials, costing, budgeting, inventory, variances, and everything else accounting related with the exception of AR and AP, which are centralized at the home office.  When you are able to successfully do all that at one branch, they give you another branch with no extra pay."
good,"We had a  nice lunch room area where we always had fresh fruit waiting for us.the work environment was loud and slow work paced, we had to wear mask to proctect us from the dust as we were sanding away at pieces."
good,"La política interna está bien, los mandos intermedios no permiten que se aplique"
good,Great place to work. The people there are always willing to assist. There is always room for growth and make your way up the corporate ladder. Lovely premises
good,"jobs fine, management is insanely overbearing and office culture is toxic. the only reason the warehouse remains full is the pay is higher than anything in the rural area."
good,"Although I was a contractor, I was treated well. I learned a lot and worked in a fun place."
good,"3M was a great company to work for, they provided great training."
good,A typical day was either really busy or really slow. It was a family business. Was kind of hard working with a family because it was a team it was family against non- family. People showed me how to carry plates and be curtious to our guests.
good,"Excellent working environment and great management teams. Customer services, product applications support, technologies trainings were  very thorough and fair"
good,3M has a lot of positive points. It was hard to work rotating shifts with the 8 hr turns. One of the main reasons I left. Hard to balance personal and work lives with little to no sleep.
good,"goood value to ur cv but politics , no stability of jobs , nobody will apreciate your job until you express. way to look forward, and do not keep good expectation"
good,"Overall I didn't have any major problems working with 3M. The people I worked with were always nice and knowledgeable about their work. When I started 3M as a contract worker I had to be trained by other contract workers who had just started working there themselves, which was a little strange to me considering how much they stress quality and accuracy for their products. Also the company that I worked through did not thoroughly inform me about the toxic chemicals that I would be working around and breathing in daily,"
good,It's a big white elephant on which you'd have to go through the corporate lader to make sure your projects are approved. Strong differentiation between 3M direct employees and 3rd party workers.
good,"I liked working at 3M but the work was boring and it felt like there was very little movement to advance. Also my contract ended the same day I was told. Parking was also pretty bad unless you got there early, but my manager, coworkers, and the food services were great."
good,This is a very good job through the temping service. The jobs are easy and the pay is worth it. Over-time is offered very often. The managers are all very nice and understanding.
good,"This is a great place to work as long as you keep to yourself. There are a lot of meetings, No recognition for hard work. You may work 40 hours this week and 60 next. The site where i work is not a true 3M legacy plant. We are a bought company run by 3M. So there is a lot of doing things their own way. 3M preaches hire from within, this plant hires outside."
good,"If you aren't friends with someone in Management, you won't advance within the company. If you work in a larger setting, more than 50 employees, its better than working at a smaller site."
good,"Good place to work for the most part. The pay and benefits are good. The rotating shifts are kind of hard on a body and get really tiring. There is a lot of mandatory overtime, which could be good or bad depending on your current life situation. It's hard for people who have families or young children."
good,"International company"
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,I was a contract worker when I was there so did not get a true feeling of being part of the 3M team.  People were great that I worked with and my boss was pretty darn fair.
good,I have worked for 3M for 7 + years and I have enjoyed the coworkers I have gotten to know and respect. Beyond that I don't have anything good to say so I will leave it at that.
good,"We work 12hr rotating swing shift. Time off, pay, and benefits are a plus but the swing shift is a negative. I would recommend this company to a friend."
good,Terei o maior prazer de dar detalhes dessa experiência em uma conversa pessoalmente.
good,"Have been with company for a little while now and I do see improvements, but a long way to go still. Previous company apparently had better pay and benefits. 3M took over and some were eliminated and has brought moral down a lot."
good,amazing workplace to start the career and learn the highly technical products with unbeatable edge. give to time and space to perform and excel in the company.
good,"Computer systems were outdated, and management seemed behind the times on improving the working environment. work was ok for the pay"
good,Çalışanın kendini farklı departmanlarda geliştirmesi için olanak sağlayan ve bunu destekleyen birfirma
good,"As a Buyer, I was responsible for "
good,Traveling between Alaska to Nebraska as well as east coast to do Seminar selling. Assisted Chairside Surgeries for Dentist doing Implant surgery.My co-workers ( all 3 of them) are Awesome to cover the ground expected of them Management was missing in action with No true vision.
good,"not a lot opportunities to move up"
good,Work was fast but often too laid back. The hardest part was the odd hours.
good,what i worked here as an trainee i am shifting for other only due to career growth 
good,Would liked to have been in the maintenance depart. Did not have any relation other then my self working there.
good,"Pro: I cant speak for everyone but my bosses were phenomenal. I loved the culture of my team. I learned a lot. Con: I was contract with no guarantee of a job. Therefore I had no benefits, health, pto, 401k ect."
good,Work is mostly easy and the day goes by as fast as you make it. Management doesn't even try to hide bias in picking people for management jobs. HR help is hard to find if you have questions. A good example of a place where it is better to be bad at your job than to call someone on it.
good,"it is a friendly atmosphere"
good,"It really depends who you work with, and the management. The work is a walk in the park, but if you have terrible people to work with, it gets over stress."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"I have enjoyed my time in inside sales. They have a great group of direct managers, but I question overall leadership. "
good,"Good pay and decent benefits. Great people but poor management "
good,"Forced over time working 13 days in a row. 10 hour shifts with one day off, doing manual labor. Its a physically demanding job but they pay well and have great benefits."
good,This was a temporary job. It was over the summer and there was no renewal opportunity. The hours were very challenging.  Working overnights was the most difficult part of the job.
good,"3M is reducing its footprint in Austin dramtically. Laying off people and selling business lines. I was in a business line that they sold, so I'm no longer a 3M employee. But it was a decent place to work - mgmt. wasn't the swiftest, but OK."
good,"My division was IPD, they were more concerned with using the budget, as opposed to develop strategic plans for the future.  It was a very cut-throat culture where you had to fill the boxes not necessarily have the skills to succeed."
good,Very difficult in the training aspect training takes place among other coworkers which create a competitive environment for them to give you the knowledge in fear of them thinking that you would have the upper hand on them by the knowledge that you learn
good,"Expectation was so high dealing with 3-4 groups, it was impossible to complete the task given deadline by the management. It was impossible to please the management however hard you worked."
good,"I do not regret working for 3M.  I repeat I do NOT regret it."
good,Decent wages paid to full time regular employees . Good benefits and paid time off policies. Business casual environment. Very structured regarding internal processes.
good,"Working 72+ hours a week is fine, if you're at the age where you don't have young children, don't care much for the social life or just want to grind until retirement."
good,3M is an innovative place to work. Great benefits. People are absolutely fantastic to work with. 3M as whole is great on visioning for the future. However certain divisions seem to work with their eyes closed. They have antiquated systems.
good,"I would get up early in the morning to go to work for 3M. After arriving early for work, I would then start my job when I was officially on the clock. I would then spend the day sorting recall/returned products for recycling or restocking. When recycling I would have to sort the items based on what materials were used. The stuff that got restocked would go into inventory and then on to fill orders from 3M stores."
good,"3m is a decent employer. Some of the management is lacking in several areas, and as with any place, some of the coworkers can be difficult to get along with."
good,bien la parte mas dificil de mi trabajo fue lidiar con mi supervisor que solo me precionava ami dandome mas trabajo que a los demas
good,Nice place to work. Friendly staff. Could use a few more hours while working at 3M. The area I worked in was poorly managed. This is why it moved to Quebec.
good,"Pay and benefits are excellent, but you seldom get more than 4 days off per month. Picnics and Christmas party are pretty good. There are programs and activities for better health. Not geared toward younger people at all, everything is bland concrete with no windows and severe break rooms. Some issues with management not knowing how to deal with a younger generation, scrutinizing every movement and punishing ridiculous offenses. The work itself is fun, though it's so quota driven it's hard to enjoy or take pride in it."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,A lot of great people.  Little control over your employment.  They have exceptional benefits.  However the work can be monotonous.

good,my coworkers are awesome and are always willing to help. Also my work environment is well set up to avoid work related injuries and hindrances.
good,"É uma ótima empresa, porém é uma empresa e tem problemas como qualquer outra."
good,"I start at service desk, then got promoted to dispatcher. It is really nice to work face-to-face with clients. As a dispatcher you can manage your work day yourself to successfully resolve all the issues."
good,More on number game. Need to enhance the working culture !!!
good,"Excellent products to sell."
good,"I learned how to pack, feed and inspect quickly. Management needs to listen to the workers ideas instead of the engineers who seem to know nothing about the jobs. My co-works bring joy and fun to the work environment."
good,"Good place to work. Great pay and benefits. Little chance to advance, Management is not that great."
good,Fue una experiencia agradable por que he aprendido trabajar en equipo con todos los colegas .
good,Pays well. shift change is not healthy. causes sleep problems and daycare issues. need more focus on stretching and ergonomics. some co-workers are very rude and are not delt with fast enough or terminated quickly. forced 12hr shift even when working everyday.
good,"My typical day consisted of getting production sheets, setting up machine, assigning operators to stations and producing the product."
good,Good place to work and a professional atmosphere.  People willing to help.  Great chance of training on different machines.  Daily meetings that cover the shifts daily goals.
good,"3M employs over 90,000 people world wide and there are dozens of divisions inside of 3M that act like mini companies themselves.  There is a culture in 3M that allows for good networking opportunities both internally and externally.  Because 3M is a global company, there are opportunities to travel for those who like to do that, and also many positions that allow the employee to either work remote and/or have little to no travel."
good,"Très bonne entreprise , avantages ( mutuelle CE ) ."
good,"3M offers good pay and benefits. Trying to be more flexible with scheduling options, but still a long way to go. Very good communication for employee questions and responsive HR department for benefit questions."
good,"At the time I worked there, working remote/telecommuting was not an option even though I worked alone, and could have done meeting via conference call. This could have changed since then."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"swing shift no option for any other shift other than overnights, weekly pay is nice but only for temp workers, 2 year contract. not the easiest company to get into at all, good people somewhat."
good,I did summer internship with this company and I got lucky to work with a great team. The companies culture is awesome. I would definitely  recommend to work for this company.
good,I learned a lot from my work at 3M.  All jobs have good and bad aspects but my experience working at 3M has been a good one.   I was able to progress in my job to the top tier level of my work group.   It's a good place to work with great benefits.
good,It's a great place to work.  The culture of 3M is hard to beat.  Great coworkers to collaborate with.  You also sell a very high quality of product.  The company is well-known.
good,"ok place to work, no major complaints, would recommend working there, people are goog, care about their job.  supervisors were fair and helpful, decent hours."
good,"People who have worked there for years, like 20 yrs, could do what ever they wanted. Hard to get ahead because of seniority. Interviews for jobs in plant,they already know who there going to get before hand."
good,"The good things:"
good,"I had a great time working at 3M. It is disappointing that they choose to go with the route of only employing an augmented workforce. Other than that, I had a great time and experience working there."
good,Ótima empresa para crescimento profissional e aprendizado.
good,3M provides help employees by providing regular training and challenging but interesting projects and work environments. They groom their employees through regular training and coaching to excel in their work and move to the next level.
good,Definitely a good company overall. A lot of people to learn from. A lot of potential to grow. Good benefits. However your time at 3M is heavily dependent on what department/division you end up in. I've been with 3M for a while across several departments and its been up and down in terms of management and experience. There are a lot of late nights and weekends. It can be hard to change positions but not impossible. Overall its a good company.
good,Buena empresa para saber de proceso de concientizacion para el desarrollo personal

good,Uma boa  agência de RH a se trabalhar gostei muito
good,"I have worked for 3M for 18 years and I have enjoyed being able to move around to various departments thereby getting to know many people and work in different teams. I have also had the opportunity to work in departments, such as Accounts Payable, which was completely new to me, and also in that role I was able to learn and and widen my knowledge and skills. The majority of my time at 3M has been in European and/or Nordic roles and it is a pleasure to use my language and people skills. There is flexibility and trust and this has given me the opportunity to work independently as well as being part of a team."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"Well paid with good benefits. Bad management. Policies in place to protect you, but if company wants to find a way around them; they will. Room for advancement if liked/""Favorited"" by upper management."
good,Onboarding and initial training was non existent unless being recruited through Frontline internship program. Management varied widely across divisions.
good,It was a great experience. I was given a lot of independence with the ability to ask questions when needed. The people there were always friendly and welcoming.
good,"Oportunidades de desarrollo, se le permite al empleado ser dueño del proceso que lleva y desarrollar ideas de mejora. Desarrollo de empleados y métricas alcanzables"
good,"They gave me a lot of freedom when designing experiments, but most tasks were menial and boring. This was just a technical aide position so that is to be expected. No opportunity to make this a full time job since the company had a bad quarter. There pay, even for the tech aide position was low."
good,This job provided a nice means of living without a fear of loosing my job. I was able to work different shifts and numerous jobs within my 9 years of employment.
good,"Almost everyday you would go to work and have some fun even though you were at work. The people were great, the management was management, and the free giveaways and meetings were abundant. Actually enjoyed the job but had to leave due to physical injury done outside of work."
good,"I spent 3 months working for 3M through a program called 3M step and it was a valid learning experience that allowed me to develop my skill set. The tasks that were assigned to me was working with my mentor in doing different testing of materials for the advancements of projects that we were working on. Along with the testing I was also traveling between different divisions of the company to interact with them to continue with the testing."
good,Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"Front office was organized and easy.  Company should provide a 2-yr. TEMP time to work there.  HR dept./person was not receptive to communicating w/workers.  Professional, clean lobby."
good,"I would like to work here again if there will be job offers in the future."
good,Hight intensity work environment but a good oppurtunity to work with many driven and intelligent  individuals but I would say dont expect to be hired on from a contract position. I would take it as means to build refrences.
good,I was a contingency worker through an agency and worked for 3M for 18 months.  It was a great experience.  Wonderful culture but hard to be hired as a permanent worker.   Very insular and nepotistic.  They also have a huge work force of millenials right out of college and many contingencies.  Overall a positvie experience.
good,"It was nice working with different people everyday, I learned a lot from different cultures. The hardest part of this was being standing for 8 hours a day, I only sit during breaks (1 hour/day), but it was fun working with the people on my department that's why I don't really feel tired at all."

good,"company is awesome, good people, good working place, good pay, good projects, enjoying my work, super friendly management, healthy company for long time."
good,"A typical day is very faced paced and self motivated to accomplish deadlines and projects. The management was good but very short lived.  There was a high turnover rate while I was there. The culture is fabulous, there is a diversity and inclusion team that planned great events. The hardest part is there is minimal back-up plans to cover other employee's and it is a very quick self taught situation with little direction. The best part is learning something new all the time."

Lots of weekend work and overtime. Some employees are working 80 hrs a week during ""busy"" season.

This was one of the more mindless jobs at 3M, but it got you into the habit of working with your coworkers and proved your worth to the managers around you. Then the higher-ups will hopefully move you on to other places around the factory given you prove that you are capable."

That's probably the hardest part of the job, the workplace culture and environment. Most enjoyable part of the job is that there are enough people here you're bound to meet someone you get alone with."

They understand that there might be some weeks where I don't come in a lot, due to an upcoming midterm or finals week, and they are able to work around my school schedule. The projects I work have a pretty wide variety. Some projects are boring and feel like busy work, however occasionally I'll get assigned a project that is exciting and makes me look forward to coming into work. The pay isn't that competitive, but I prefer the flexible hours to higher pay."

good,"A typical day at work starts with listening to my voicemails, going through emails, answering any questions one may have and start reviewing my applicants that have been offered positions throughout the US 3M plants. We create the offers, extend them, and once accepted we begin the process of clearing them for hire. Which means having applicants schedule medical evaluations and consenting to a background check. The hardest part of my job is rescinding an offer to an applicant that has done a lot to turn their life around but unfortunately does not meet our 3M policies. However, the most enjoyable is when I have been working with an applicant for some time, finally everything comes together and hearing the appreication for what I have done to help them get to where their future is heading is a wonderful feeling. "
good,"es una muy buena empresa, me permitieron desarrollarme duramnte un buen periodo de tiempo de mi vida."
good,"I learned a lot about how to keep inventory in control and ways to improve visibility in order to prevent things not getting done. Having meetings everyday in our department allowed all employees to voice their opinion or report any safety concerns. Because of the meetings held everyday, management allowed employees to suggest any ideas or advice to improve the workplace for everybody in the building. The most enjoyable part about the job was that every 100 days of safety with no recorded incidents, the management would reward employees with a free lunch of their choice."
good,Typical day at work would be check the pumps in the mines.I learned how to be an electrician. The Management was ok. My co-works was ok. The hardest part of my job was dragging the pumps through the mud and water. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers.
good,"This office started out as CodeRyte, a small computer technology company. 3M purchased this company out in April of 2012. 3M is a great place to work, however it isn't what a lot of the programmers are looking for."
good,"TRabalho agradável, com as rotinas implementadas por nós. Nada de especifico simplesmente a sociedade se desfez."

good,Great place to apply some academic concepts to real world applications.
good,"While a completely different work environment than what I was used to, 3M is a good, solid company. The pay is good and so are the benefits."
good,"My typical day at 3M would consist of 75-100 calls logged into Remedy and offering technical support to our customers who purchased our digital products. I would also sell them parts, projectors, and warranties. In addition to these tasks 3M would send me out to perform training seminars for our new customers and teach them how to use our products. 3M would send me out to field work also to fix these products nation wide."
good,Day starts with meeting with clients.
good,"3M does a stellar job at hiring people that are capable of the job - but they don't do a great job at hiring people that will actually enjoy it. They do multiple layers of pre-employment testing which is great for weeding out the riffraff, but that does not mean that they hire for talent. Some people have a talent for a high level of repetitive, fine-detail kind of work that would test the patience of a monk. That's great, and those are the people that should apply here. People whose talents are more highly geared toward managing chaos, getting immediate results, passionately enjoying variety in their day, simplifying complex concepts - such people should apply for a technical role from the start or seek employment elsewhere."
good,The company was moving to SAP but it was not going the best. A number of systems were not working correctly. There  were some communication problems that they were working on. There were a number of invoicing problem that they were trying to correct. Working on a number of problem at the same time was challenging.
good,No all what it seems when you first start out. Seems like management is taking more away from employees every year I have worked there.  Benefits are still good now but slowly decreasing
good,3M offers a good stable job with lots of benefits. They are a very big company therefore do not expect for quick growth into promotions. Each department has different perks and it seems as though working in the sales side of 3M in Canada is the best way around job oppurtunity.
good,Best place to work for diversity and inclusion. Multiple divisions offer opportunities for employees with different back ground and related experience.
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,Una grandiosa escuela a pesar de que en el ultimo año el ambiente laboral cambio demasiado.
good,I loved working at 3m. I started as a temp and worked hard to get full- time which took me 6 months . I applied my self and had a positive attitude until vi got looked over on about 3 job promotions as a lead in which I had experience as well as trained an employee that went on to become a lead. I was very disappointed .
good,3M is a productive environment for one to work in. It allows one to have growth and stability within their life. 3M also grants one the ability to have great benefits.
good,My experience at 3M has been outstanding my only complaint would be management and the staff running Facilities. We have 3M events once and maybe twice a month where we get to leave the building go hang out with our peers and relax while eating food.
good,3M is a good company  when I started they were a family oriented company now it is just business to upper management.  But the people you work with are excellent and very knowledgeable  My manager was a Business Processing Manager and he knew everything about processes and computer software programs.
good,"Come into work, clocked in and start working right away. I start doing daily task and start running machines. very easing going. all the co workers are amazing."

good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, fornece excelente estrutura para o desenvolvimento profissional dos seus funcionários e para realização do trabalho. Não há MBA que você possa fazer para obter o aprendizado que você obterá na 3M."
good,"Pretty good place to work. Blessed to be here. Get paid great for what we do. Only issue (s) is working 12 hrs on rotating shifts. Can get hard on the body. Very difficult to sleep for me on day shift but sleep fine on night shift. Most people here are the opposite though. Either way you're going to be really tired on either shift. "
good,"3M was a great place to work. I ended up relocating to Corona, California for a few years. The job market was challenging and I wanted to relocate back to Minneapolis. This was challenging as there were so many local candidates fighting for jobs at 3M Center and the division that I worked in was not experiencing much growth."
good,"although the work was fast paced at times it is easy work and very well organized. my job as temp worker was to help on any machine that needed extra help, at times work would be repetitive but other than that for a factory job it doesn't get much better than a job at 3M."
good,Avuto un po' di problemi con i colleghi ma tutto sommato il lavoro non era male
good,"Consistently provides support to the team"
good,clock in do the work go home. hardest part is probably attitudes of coworkers when things go wrong. though the people are the best part.pay is great. as are benefits. but sometimes it feels like thats how they keep you hostage.
good,"They have way to much overtime, & not enough employees. Employee turnover is high. They have employee events. They train you. They changed how the employee works, to a scale of ladder concept. You start out as a picker for the lowest wage, then forklift drivers earn a little more, etc"
good,"Good company but hard to get full time work. They use contrtacts but then when the contract expires, you are separated from the company, and exempted for 6 months from working there again."
good,I was a Contract Technician and moved from lab to lab doing routine testing and analysis.  The job was very relaxed and were willing to train me in running a plethora of instrumentation.

good,"3M was a good place to work. It was a secured building. "
good,3M Industrial has been a good career but I am now carrying the full line of Industrial Products so I am looked upon as an Industrial generalist.  The demo supplies fill up my provided Company Van and my garage at home. I preferred being a Specialist with just one or two product lines and calling on mfg engineers rather than being in dangerous factory conditions on a daily basis.  I have a good  10 more years before retirement and want to get back to more enjoyable sales calls and customer visits.
good,"Way to much drama, good work environment, they expect you to just work work work and no family time. (Social Life) Can't even leave the building when on the clock. I understand being a big company you need to have your security but the moment you go through that gate, its feels like your in a prison"
good,I worked here for a little over a year as a contract worker. I only left because of the birth of my child. While on my maternity leave I decided to go to college for a better paying day job. I worked shift work while here at 3M and that would be hard with a baby so that was why I decided not to go back.
good,Management sucks. Always bumping heads and picking fights with the union. The union is also weak. Can’t depend on them. To work here you must not have union mentality.
good,I am a contract employee haven't had a chance to see what the benefits include. Won't know the benefits until I become a full-time employee. Wish I could become full-time employee but it's hard to get in here.
good,"I enjoy going to work, everyone is friendly, the only problem i have had is with the interview process, I am a contract worker there and have 2 chandes at applying with them, I have already been turned down once but have not received any feedback as to why"

good,"3m is a very good company to work for if you can get a contract that lasts, you are finished and started again as they see fit, i was there for 6 months the working conditions are very good .."
good,"Planning day to day production, procurement of raw materials and communicating  with customers and business leads on a daily basis."
good,"3M is a company in transition.  It is trying to centralize a complex web of independent functions, systems and subsidiaries.  This is absolutely the correct strategy for the company, but it has resulted in a number of growing pains.  This combined with the company's hyper focus on margins results in an 'all hands on deck' approach to Business Transformation that has forced P&L who should be focused on growth strategies to focus on business maintenance through this transition."
good,"Enjoyed the company, but had little work/life balance.  The benefits were great, but the salary was not in line with other companies of the same size."
good,"It was a fun work environment. At the distribution center, everyone was just working for a paycheck, so they had to try to make the work environment fun somehow. The people are genuine. The bosses can ride your back sometimes to get things done, but it's not hard to have a high productivity rating."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.

good,"A ambiente de trabalho é bom, ótimos benefícios e remuneração, porém a possibilidade de efetivação para estagiário é baixa."
good,"Working in the warehouse involved working with another 100+ employees at the same time. Safety was always a key factor in every day warehouse life. This job can satisfy anyone looking for a 40 hour week job to somebody wanting 80+ hours a week.Unfortunately during business rushes, you can find yourself easily working 50+ hours involuntarily."
good,"It is hard to stand out and get noticed. The benefits are unmatched, but its hard to break in if you are an outsider.  They don't do a lot to draw in talent from outside Minnesota, and they are missing out on paradigm shift, and huge growth opportunities."
good,"For the most part, it was a good place to work. Good benefits. Most people that worked here wanted to give our customers the best product possible. It is a shame that this plant is being shut down."

good,Excelente compañía para aprender formas de trabajo con sesgo prioritario de desarrollo técnico de negocios especializados.

It's seriously my dream job! I love performing laboratory testing, analyzing data, creating reports, and you get amazing feedback from the group! Also, there are so many generous benefits that 3M offers to all of it's employees! It's also a very technical/fulfilling position. I feel like I am making a difference to society every single day!"
good,"3M Purification (formerly CUNO Inc.) is a wholly owned subsidiary of 3M Company based out of MN. 3M Purification is located in Meriden, CT and has been in Meriden for 100+ years.  3M is a highly stable company but unfortunately has slowly been migrating its employees to MN. With that said, 3M is an extremely strong company where individuals choose to stay and work for their entire career."
good,"3M have changed considerably since 2005.  They no longer focus on long term relationships, concentrating more on immediate sales, and no longer investing in providing added value to the offerings, but retaining a premium price point.  A dramatic reduction in investment of its staff has seen team building fall to a point where the organisation is focusing more on the stick than carrot to get the best from its employees."

Not to mention that 3M company is a huge multi national company but the work environment is really a new thing to me in a sense of working in consumer goods industry.

good,"The bulk of my day revolves around ensuring that - when requested - a customer has access to a set set of products, at a pre-determined waterfall of pricing conditions. These rules are set out by our Pricing Specialists, and it is up to my colleagues and I to maintain these rules to ensure optimal accuracy and avoid price leakage. Beyond these 'listings', and setting up pricing for new products, I am also responsible for creating mass-buy lists, which typically involve five thousand customers or more, and ten to twenty of our biggest-selling Sales Districts. It is a very routine job, but when faced with new challenges - be it software updates, new procedure etc... - we as Pricing Maintainers work very well as a collaborative unit to strive to find the most effective new way to adapt to and evolve from these challenges as they unravel."

Some old timers got lucky with never being laid off, but many that I did talk to were laid off from 6-18 months before being called back. Good pay for easy work"

good,"good place to work"
good,"Overall, 3M is a good company to work for.  They pay competitive and livable wages and offer an incredible benefits package.  The plant I work in is very clean and environmental friendly and safety is pushed daily ensuring that I will be able to do my work in a safe environment.  There is also ample opportunity to change jobs via their posting system.  However, there are some issues with this company that make going in to work a less than thrilling experience.  One of the major issues is the excessively large management group.  Just in my plant alone there is four levels of management, with the lowest level having no real power or ability to do anything.  This means that in order to have an issue resolved, it must go through four levels of people before it can even be considered (though some less major issues can be done by the third, and in rare cases the second, level of management).  This of course leads to multiple months to pass before anything can be done about the issue.  Even if this issue is causing production issues, it takes quite some time to be addressed.  During this period, production is still held responsible to produce and high levels despite faulty or malfunctioning equipment.  There is also the matter of long hours and rotating shift work that is outdated and extremely unhealthy.  Long hours can be fixed by increasing employment levels, and to some extent they have been increasing personnel, but this is mostly overlooked.  Because of this, overtime is required when it really shouldn't exist in the levels in is currently in."
good,The self-starter and efficient worker will enjoy the relaxed atmosphere. There is not a feeling of being locked inside a cage for eight hours per day.

good,"3M is a well respected leader in almost every industry around the world. I feel proud to say I work for this company every day. The company treats its salesforce pretty well with benefits and company car, quarterly bonuses, and a competitive base pay. Can sometimes be difficult to advance in sales if you’re not 100% willing to relocate to wherever they want you to, but I think they’re getting better about that."

good,It is a great company but undergoing transitions and not as caring about its employees as it claims.  They will uproot you or cast you out without a second thought.
good,"3M offers a lot of ability for the employees to move up through the company, great benefits, and flexible hours. They have a wide range of jobs from IT, engineering, and assembly workers."
good,"A career at 3M means bringing 100% focus, attitude and try and that is just to meet expectations. You will be pushed harder, learn more and develop skills sometimes painfully through trial and failure. Expectations will be high and you will be given total control of your future and the position you are in. There are, however, not many leaders that can give the support, resources or budgets you might require to hit targets. It is a challenging workplace, but if you succeed you will comfortable."

good,"To stay ahead of world changes 3M have to make changes all the time as well as expanding and modernising. This comes with a cost and risk of moving people, assets and process changes. Like most, 3M have had to make job losses but the changes and losses are incredibly frequent and unnurving. Their attention to staff and rewarding loyalty is slowly decreasing."

good,"My role was to assist with the duties of full-time employees in the transition from legacy contract management systems to SAP. Aside from some communication issues in Chargeback Management, my time there was enjoyable.

good,"Excellent benefits"
good,Trabalho em equipe constante e há uma boa relação entre os funcionários.

good,3M is world wide known company. Benefits package are overall within industry standards. Having their headquarters in St Paul makes it somewhat  difficult to avoid the red tape.
good,"Had a great fun working and learning here at 3M. "
good,"For a place that's not union, they sure do things like a union plant. You can barely go to the bathroom without checking to make sure someone with more seniority has gone yet first. The pay is adequate but could be higher. Management is a mixed bag. Some are awesome, while others are jerks. I had a great manager, but his boss was a real pain. Benefits are decent. Those with the most seniority seem to have a holier than thou attitude, and some seem to look for a reason to tell the supervisor on you. Lots of back stabbers here in other words. If you sign on as a temp, rest assured many will treat you like the lowest life form on the planet, but others will treat you with respect and dignity. Just be careful, watch your back, and do your job the best you can."
good,"Had a good time, learned a lot, but ultimately felt there was little potential to get hired on as a temp.Great campus, generally good people, and it felt like they really cared about developing their employees careers."

good,"Nothing is wrong with the company. I did production work at the factory, and my coworkers were awesome and the management was tolerable. However, the rotating shifts (which any production job would have) are what are killer. If you want money and don't care about a messed up sleep schedule, then go for it."
good,"3M is a great company to work for, depending on you job grade. It is a company with high safety standards. The compensation and benefit packages are decent, although a little high. The work environment is clean, and the machinery is well maintained and up to date. The supervisors and managers are very hands on and helpful. The Human resources department is swift in taken care of any HR related issues that you may have. The down side to working at 3M is that hours and shifts are not consistent. It is hard to continue your education if you are employed at 3M. There are definite areas for growth and advancement, but if you need education, then it can be very difficult because of shift/hour changes."

good,"The Pharmaceutical Division was a great place to work for years. As long as you did your job, you had a job. Compensation was probably a little below other similar sized pharma companies, but it was worth it for the job security and the umbrella of the Mother (3M) company. In the late 90's the Six Sigma philosophy was applied to all aspects of the business, and it affected Sales dramatically. By the early 2000's they were trying to run Pharma like all divisions of the company and the identity was lost. They began to hire inexperienced managers and when the going got tough, there was no tenured management to weather the storm. Some difficult sales years, R&D setbacks, and in 2007 the Pharmaceutical Division was sold to a venture capitalist group."

good,My bosses were really helpful and I learnt lots within the company. The general salary was good for the market. I enjoyed working there.
good,Enjoyed working in this company. For people who enjoy the industrial market. Working remotely. More training in the field needed.

good,"3M provides more than most companies due for their employees.  Good internal job posting options. Pay is the same per job, not based on experience or time at job"
good,My experience at 3M was good as far as the work duties are concerned. My team was really helpful and friendly. you could ask them anything and they are willing to help. Be sure to ask a lot of questions. During training they don't teach you a fraction of what you really will be doing.
good,"Het is een Amerikaans, beursgenoteerd bedrijf. Betaling is uitermate goed. Humanitaire voorwaarden niet altijd. Vooruitstrevend en innovatief. Veel mogelijkheden om door te groeien als je bereid bent Europa in te gaan."

good,"A typical day in the beginning was stressful and confusing.They throw a lot of info on how to do what u need to do at you on your first 3 days and then they left me to myself.It was hard at times to find someone who could answer my questions.It was almost 3 months before they caught on that I was doing my paperwork wrong,I learned a new skill with new material.I learned how to use a new machine in a factory setting.The management was very nice but would bribe you to do something they needed done and then not follow through on rewarding me for job getting done like they said they would.The hardest part was being by myself the whole 8-10 hours and not talking to someone else.Knowing what to do and how to do it was hard too. Cause they dont give you enough time with a trainer.The most enjoyable was being able to shop at their store for products they produce at very low prices/"

good,"There's a lot of manual labor with the job. Everyone is very nice and inclusive. The hours weren't always that great, unless you were just on first shift. But for the most part people worked 12 hour days. I thought the pay was more than enough, as a college student. Only thing is it was different than what they described the position to be. I was told I would be working with the engineers on projects, seeing that I am a college student in chemical engineering. But I ended up just packing and shipping all of the products. I was hardly with the chemical engineers."
good,"Good company, good training, positive culture.  Various distributors pay their specialists vastly different salaries. The 3M portion is supposed to be half of the salary."
good,"Excelente empresa, inovadora,  com histórico de ambiente de trabalho colaborativo,  mas que vem perdendo este DNA."
good,"Need improvement on management and job advancement. Great culture and people to work with. Being a contract worker, feel like I have no value. Would like a better chance at full time."
good,"I am a 3M contractor.  I have been working for them for a little more than a year.  Recently, they suddenly cancelled our contract as part of a big reorganization.  So now I am a baby boomer that is out of work and too young to retire.  I have learned a great deal while working on this project."
good,"Empresa inovadora, atual, valoriza a pesquisa e qualifica seus profissionais."
good,"Great opportunities, but when they reorganize...all bets are off. They are penny wise and dollar foolish on many projects. They go down too many wrong streets before they find the correct one."

good,3M is a leader in the Industrial Market place.  They are innovative with a huge R&D budget.  It is a competitive place to work and upper management is highly focused on SFDC data.
good,"I enjoy working at 3M, but there are times when work is slow and I feel like there isn't a lot of job security (I'm also a contractor).  The best part about the job is the people - most co-workers are very nice, willing to help, and it's easy to have a conversation with them."

good,I was a intern so I have very little to say it was typical from what I have heard from other students at the time. 3M< has many opportunities to find entry level internships or co ops.

good,"First a meeting everday on what to do or not to do."

good,Great place to work...however there are many times a 6-7 day work week is required.  The company offers excellent benefits.
good,"At 3M you will learn a lot, wear multiple hats and grow quickly as a professional. Currently their business model is heavily dependent on contractors and offshore support. A good place for someone starting out career wise but not an ideal fit for a seasoned professional that transitions in. I will wholeheartedly recommend this firm for any new graduate or young professional."

good,"3M seems to prefer to promote from within.  In principle, I think that is a fine policy.  However, over several years, it's become apparent that unqualified individuals are capable of reaching a management position simply by seniority.  This does not necessarily make the company difficult to work with most of the time, depending on your position.  Because 3M is such a large company, though, your coworkers, and in fact most anyone employed by the company, are incredibly friendly and helpful when they can be.  It's like one giant conglomeration of a family."
good,3M is definetely a nice place to work in R&D and it's provide many opportunities to be involved with different technology plataforms. The down size is to handle a lot of burreocracy.

good,"I didn't work for 3M for very long.  I liked it there very much.  One of the problems was the commute and the second one was that there were not flex hours.  So when I came to work, the whole trip was in rush hour traffic and when I left to go home at 4:00 PM it was more of the same.  So travel time amounted to 3 Hrs. each day and that depended on the weather and accidents.  During one snow storm, it took me almost 4 hours to get home, any amount of rain, it was 2 to 2 1/2 Hrs. and if there was an accident, there was just no telling."
good,"Good place to work.  I was a contract worker for 3M.  While it was enjoyable, the advancement opportunity was not as fast as I would have liked.  I felt like I was not being challenged.  This probably would have been different if I was a full time 3M employee."

Then I go and check on my co-workers if they need any help on building more sub-assemblies, presenting materials or shipping. Everyone in there is very nice and chilled.

Up until that point I’d never had to deal with so much paperwork in my life- and it came as a bit of a shock at first how much had to be done in such a short period of time on top of my other duties. However- I was able to sort through the massive stack of work to be done and select what information was needed right away and what could wait a little longer. In the end prioritizing my workload became second nature- and is now something I do out of habit.
good,Supported engineering team with day to day objectives. Assisted with large scale task such as stock takes etc. as well as developing and optimizing new storage systems for ease of access to tools and equipment. On top of this I would work making small parts on lathes and milling machines.

The day would start off with a meeting stretch and flex and start picking or depending on what part of the warehouse you were working on. This job was out of the norm for me i always worked with kids or clerical, although this was probably one that i enjoyed the most. Always kept me on my feet and it never got old! The hardest part of the job would be when i would have to pick something that was over 100 lbs, it would be to try and catch someone to help me lift the product. Enjoyable part of the job i would have to say would be my quota i would give myself. I would always try to do more then what i did the day before!!!!"
good,"È uma Empresa dinâmica e agradavél de trabalhar, ela é conhecida em todo o território nacional e também em outros países."
good,More products available than one would think. Seasonality with BTS and Holiday are big drivers and allow for learning of every aspect of account managment from item creation through tracking sales.
good,"I was not an employee for 3M. My experience with the company was working with them as part of my Action Learning Program in HULT Business School. In company's U.K headquarters, you can see the State-of-The-Art technology and innovation as core of 3M businesses."
good,set up and operated machinery. use of forklifts and respirators. often handled hazardous materials.
good,Learned about using computers by entering time and quality measurements in their programs. Met some life-long friends while working there.

good,R&D
good,Worked for third party supplier on site - Was made redundant.
good,"Typical factory work and environment. Management was good depending on who you had for a supervisor.  Great pay, with the willingness to work overtime you can make a lot of money."
good,"You will make a lot of money and no time off to enjoy it. Not recommend for extroverts!!!!"
good,"3M recognizes that safety getting to work and leaving is just as important as actually working on-site.  They allow for a flex-time start so you are not stressed out by the time you arrive at the job sight.  Then, of course, you work your 8 hours and leave accordingly.  The people are friendly.  It seemed as if people didn't have a whole lot of opportunity to move to different roles.  They simply stayed in the role they were hired.  That was an observation.  You will work hard.  The have a whole lot of onsite resources available at the campus, allowing for employees to bank, visit a doctor, purchase their product.  They also promoted other vendors coming in to allow for employees to purchase on their lunch breaks, allowing some conveniences for the employees.  There didn't appear to be significant collaboration of employees sharing in knowledge/technology exchange.  If you had a leader, you may experience it, but that was dependent on that teams leader.  Seen more of that in smaller companies.  There seemed to be young experienced folks being placed in fast track positions, but without any tenure experience and proven sales in their back pocket.  It's tough being managed by someone that has no proof that they are driving the right direction.  It would have made more sense if they were partnered with a senior person to help build trust among the team and they had a minimum of 2-5 yrs tenure with qualified documented experience to support why they should be fast tracked; even if it was with another company, it would have made sense."
good,"One of the best warehouse jobs to have with not many but some small opportunities to advance. Starting hourly pay is good at $17, and you can make as much as $21 before a year if you're able to change job grades. Even if you don't change job grades, by the end of the year you top out at nearly $19. Lots of OT to supplement your income. I was once paid triple time for voluntarily working on a holiday (black Friday). Some of the managers aren't the brightest and apparently think too highly of their position. One of the three supervisors on my shift seemed to think his sole responsibility was to get people in trouble."
good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.
good,"Lovely if u work for 3M but made to feel inferior if u r agency or contingency worker, some managers team leaders are lovely but majority just look down at u"

good,I mainly worked in the lab and worked on different experiments in the lab. Exciting work. Convenient for students. Trained in different equipments and procedures.
good,"Was a good place to work at. Management changed and so didn't the moral. No job advancement and lack of leadership, has made this place into a ghost manufacturing facility."

good,"visitação de clientes, captação de clientes com objetivo de venda."
good,I learned how to become a better team player and how to deal with various types of people.
good,I utilized my knowlege and skills in 3 different departments during my time with 3M. Over-all it was a quite a learning experience. The company was a great company to work for and I do believe I would return if I was called back for another assignment. The hardest part of the job was getting there. The part that interested me the most was no micro-management. The co-workers were easy to get alone with. I had never worked with mold-injection before so now I can have with running injectors.
good,I loved working at 3m my job was rewarding and supervision was awesome and understanding with many issues of growth
good,"Trabalhei por menos de 1 ano na 3M e me desliguei para atender a uma melhor oportunidade de trabalho. É uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar, completa em todos os sentidos. Porém não atendeu as minhas expectativas de objetivo profissional. Recomendo e voltaria a trabalhar nesta empresa sem sombra de dúvidas."
good,"Empresa muito boa, ética, transparente em seus negócios, excelente estrutura mas padrão americano, muita hierarquia para o trabalho. Excelentes benefícios, VR, convênio médico e odontológico.. Único problema é a competitividade entre as pessoas do mesmo time, ""onde grande parte"" tem medo de ensinar o que sabe ou direcionar. As vezes tendo que ser político para conseguir muitas coisas."

good,3M is a large company with many opportunities across multiple business units. Benefits are very good and the pay is reasonable. Many employees have worked there a long time and advancement is somewhat limited because of this longevity.

good,3M is one of the best places I have ever worked and I would retire from here but unfortunately we have no set first shifts unless your 12hr or 8hr swing production office positions are very hard to come by I have been waiting 3yrs and was offered 1st 2yrs ago and they never added the position after calling to offer it to me. we also have no daycare options were I am. Everything else is great. So until then ill keep trying for a day shift job but I have to leave I will.

good,We had a blast working at 3M. It is fast paced and very diverse.  We make hundreds of thousands of products that you wouldn't eve think that 3M would make.   Unfortunately  life got in the way and i had to relocate.  This why iI I am looking for a new job.
good,3M gives it's employers the option to move up the chain as far as they wish to go.  They offer flexible work schedules.  3M is filled with many different technologies; some of the technologies they invented!  There is always opportunity to learn and advance if you want to.

good,"Productive, structured and efficient workplace.  Lateral movement and flexibility is encouraged when certain departments are falling behind.  Overall positive culture."
good,"3M is a fast-paced job, but the management is good. Expect to put in overtime. The pay-scale and benefits are good. If you are working on the production line EXPECT to work odd hours."
good,A typical day at work was very easy and was not at all complicated due to the fact that my job entails that I took out trash from people's machines and moved rolls of product for people. I learned to drive a walky rider.
good,Work was varied every day. Learnt new skills during my years at 3M. Management encouraged me to take on new responsibilities..Workplace was enjoyable and other employees friendly.Hardest part of job was getting up at 5am to go to work on a cold frosty or snowy morning.
good,"Otima empresa, cobra-se muito, mas vale a pena a dedicação"
good,"Co workers are great, management is something that can be improved. Seems alot of double standards are used when working there, guess it depends on who you are."

good,"I do internship in 3m for 60 days at the time of my summer holidays in 2017"
good,"Very good place to work, very hard to get into there full time. The only bad thing as working as a temp, you did not have any benefits, ins, vacation, etc. Pay was good for working as a temp, even paid more for working Saturdays and Sundays."

good,"The Nevada, MO plant was an excellent place to work! I have been asked many times since my departure if I would like to return. If I were to relocate again, I would definitely work for this company."
good,A fine culture with hard working people.  Everyone works together - a very friendly place.   Changes with Jim McNerny were difficult.  The introduction of Six Sigma to innovation projects made the climate very difficult.  Many of his mandates have been rolled back and things have gotten better.   I really enjoyed my years at 3M
good,3M is a great place to work if you like a big company that moves very slowly.  Results oriented people should avoid 3M.  The average employee has been there over 15 years.  It is not uncommon to see 30 year employees.
good,"3M provides a great balance between personal life and work. It is a wonderful work environment, although it can be a bit slow on changes, and confusing on career plans. Afterall, it is a great place to work in Brazil."

good,"Empresa honesta, cumpri com seus valores, ética, acima de tudo justa."
good,"Great place to work, people are fantastic.  if you are lucky enough to be an actual 3M employee the benefits and company activities are amazing.  If you are a Contingent Worker, however, you don't get treated like part of the team, supervisors tend to treat you differently than the full-time staff and you are excluded from some of the company functions."
good,"A great place to work!  Everyone is very nice & helpful!  I have learned a lot with invoicing and calculating taxes for different states."

good,"I've spent over 4 years at 3M in various product roles and really enjoyed to culture and flexibility in my position. The recent downturn at 3M has been unfortunate and is my only reason for leaving. Management is generally good, but as with any giant corporation, bureaucracy can sometimes get in the way of making progress or taking risks."
good,SAP production support. Good working environment. I was from Canada and it was stressful as  I was away from family. Rest all well and good company to work for
good,Show up get a good turnover from the previous shift and just keep everything running smooth. Communication is key if you want breaks. Someone usually needs to be there to oversee every machine you cant just shut something down.
good,"Great set of products, produced by dedicated and happy people. Work was fast paced but always fun and interesting. Great atmosphere to work in with a great bunch of people"
good,"Una empresa que brinda estabilidad laboral para poder realizar un trabajo adecuado, ademas  brinda las herramientas necesarias, promueve el trabajo en equipo, los jefes siempre están disponibles para darte su soporte y retroalimentacion. "

good,"Great place to work at and start off at if you're young and trying to make some money.Highly recommended but there is barely any room to advance.No way for you to grow in the company as there weren't any positions in the company, they hire through an agency."
good,Great Job! Management was friendly and helped create a positive working environment. Drama free environment. Collaborative staff that helped improve the culture of the workplace.
good,Good place to work - people are nice and the politics are low but they are not that progressive and some just need to retire.  I am only lookiing beacuse I want to be more involved in ecommerce strategy
good,"Can always create opportunities for yourself. The company however restricts risk taking and views execution as a nice thing to do. If you want to grow business and take chances to do so, this may not be the place for you"
good,The benefits are amazing & the pay is enough for living in the Chippewa Valley area.  I've only been in 5 different departments out of the many but I can say most departments are easy work. It's mostly you work hard for 20-30 minutes then let the machine run on it's own for 30 minutes. Of course this isn't for all departments but just most that I've been in.  You can easily become a group leader if you actually try to learn & do your job to the best of your ability.  The main cons about working at 3M is the uncertainty of your work schedule. A couple months you could be working 8 hour shifts then the next few months you could be work 12 hour shifts.  You could be working straight days one month then suddenly straight nights another month.  Another major con is management.  Only 1 out of the 5 departments I was in I would consider my supervisor adequate enough for their job.  The other 4 supervisors have never worked on the line that they're supervising or even knew what was going on with customer orders & where our numbers were.
good,"No início foi muito recompensador,pois era uma empresa que valoriza os funcionários,hoje em dia eles valorizam a empresa."
good,The job itself is great. The benefits and pay are great. The culture needs work. The lack of communication among leaders is an issue. The pay and benefits make up for the cons.
good,"The 12 hour swing shifts make it very difficult to have a life outside of work.  "
good,"Inter-company politics were difficult and people were elevated beyond their capability to perform.  That was difficult to see, however if you excelled at what you did you were acknowledged"
good,"Valorização do ser humano, plano de carreira, promoções por mérito e justas avaliação de trabalho e ser humano."
good,I work in Tape department .We slit tapes to our customers .The job requires me to slit a big jumbo of tape to small sizes in a way the customers want it. It can be stressful but can be done easily if you know the proper set up. The hardest part of the job is when sometimes the machine does not cooperate .Getting your products out of the door with any difficulty is the mos enjoyable part of my job.
good,"At Meeting to convinced management for situation of market."
good,"A empresa lhe da instrumentos para trabalhar, muito treinamentos, um pouco de falha na gestão de carreiras."

good,"opportunities for advancement, management shared interest in day to day activities, easy to work together in a team environment,"
good,"Learned to work well with others for problem solving. Also working independently. The hardest part of the job was covering 12 hour shifts, and the physical work. Great to see a product go from start to finish with a packaged product going to the customer."
good,"Desenvolvi experiências de prospecção de clientes, criação de ações estratégias para crescimento de vendas, identificação das necessidades do cliente e demonstrações de produtos e serviços; Fui responsável por treinamentos técnicos e eventos científicos no intuito de aumentar a penetração dos produtos e geração de demanda em clientes estratégicos (públicos ou privados); Adquiri experiência em atuar diretamente com distribuidores, realizando direcionamentos estratégicos de vendas.

good,"I love working for 3M.  3M acquired the company I previously worked (Aearo Technologies) in 2008.  Since that time, I've learned my value as an employee.  3M is very good at recognizing their employee's contributions and paying them well for their performance. My coworkers were all very personable and willing to pitch-in when needed.  The work environment was fun and serious at the same time.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the actual work.  I love working in SAP and the many other legacy systems utilized by 3M.  The hardest part of my job was having to leave it after so many years."
good,every minute being productive  really enjoyed my job so there was never a boring moment                                                               ..

good,"3-M Co was a good clean place to work. They send me to school to learn the trade of maintenance mechanic. If a machine was down, when I went in on my shift, I would go right to work finding the problem. I worked with some nice people and some that were not so nice, there were a lot of women working there and at times they would not believe you, when told they were the reason the machine was down."

good,I enjoyed working remote daily. Learning all the products was the hardest part of the job. Management was very supportive especially being new. I learned with these huge companies the selling cycle takes longer because of the cost of the equipment. my typical day was setting up as many appointments as I could along with cold calling. The culture of 3M gives you every opportunity to succeed.
good,"Enjoyed working as a temp. Good pay, but as a temp when things get slow you're the first to get let go. Things change too quickly. Would be nice if all departments adhered to the same policies and not some management people make up there own."
good,"I loved my job at 3M. It was a contract job helping with the SAP immplamentation. I would go back. I just wish 3M along with other 'high tech' companies would hire emplyees instead of contractors. It is hard be a forward thinker when any ideas/projects you may conceive - will not bare fruit before your contract is up. Though my was extended many times. I could not move forward with some ideas, because I was often within a week of my contract end date."
good,"Mi experiencia en 3M de los años 90 fue la mejor aprendí y me desafiaron mucho, como capacitador de ventas y como coordinador de Marketing."

good,"Good Client to work with lot of new opportunity to learn and upgrade our skill."
good,"Considered it a good/great place to work. Also considered one of my better positions of employment. Position allowed for autonomy/care-free as well.

good,"Spent 6+ yrs. with 3M, Ames. Relocated with my wife in '16 or I would still be there. I held 4 different positions during my time, some were more suitable than others. Job postings were fairly frequent making mobility around the plant relatively easy if you were unhappy in a certain role. My coworkers were, for the most part, capable, team players who watched out for each other when work got hectic. I finished my time with 3M as a material handler. My direct supervisor had years of experience in that area and was a great trainer and leader. He knew what he was asking of people and would never hesitate to run a truck himself if needed. The management was actively committed to improving processes and the safety culture of the plant. Some people would complain about changes, but when trying to make improvements there will always be growing pains. Many of the employees at the plant had 20, 30, even 40+ years in and that is because of the great pay and benefits and the culture of the plant. The employee stock purchase plan is a phenomenal savings vehicle, it enabled me to buy my first house and build a great stock portfolio. My wife and I are relocating again in summer of '18 to Mankato, MN and I would very much like to gain employment with the New Ulm, MN plant. Google the 3M vision statement, they really do live up to those ideals. Highly recommend the Ames plant. Really miss being there!"

Occasionally I do travel for a week at a time to train and teach clients on the software.  3M has an exceptional work culture with extremely high moral values.  The most difficult part of my job is getting stuck on a project and there not being anyone available to assist quickly to help resolve the issue.  Everyone is very busy with their own projects.  Their lack of training has made it difficult at times to figure some pieces of the software out.

The only ones consisted of a rotating schedule, where one week day hours would be in effect, and the following week, evening hours would be in effect, and both would alternate. Other than what was previously mentioned, management was excellent and the primary focus was on safety. The facility was great as well, allowed opportunity for breaks as well.

good,You never knew how your day as going to go. Some days good some days terrible. The crew that I was on was one of the best crews they have. We worked together others willing to help when help was needed.  I didn't know about something there was someone who did. I think the worst part about it was the rapid rotation. It was hard to get used to. I never had any issues with any of my supervisors as they were all great. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I did the best that I could do with the support of my coworkers.

As such, there wasn't much money and we were learning to be creative in keeping all parts of the plant up to date on a shoestring budget. The fact that the plant is still in business is a tribute to the terrific job that management did.  We all worked together to do as much as we could and when they couldn't afford me any longer. I believe we left the IT department in a much better place, more effective and cost efficient"

good,"Ottimo periodo trascorso con l'azienda dove la soddisfazione è stata reciproca ,inerente all'età biologica credo sia il periodo fondamentale che abbia contribuito alla mia formazione.Una gestione senza pregiudizi,dove la sana competizione ere una prassi leale che nel breve medio termine ripagava.Il massimo rispetto della dignità delle persone era un punto obbligato per qualsiasi scambio formale informale di opinioni.Contratto adeguato .Dei colleghi non posso che parlarne bene,mi hanno sempre trattato ed apprezzato per quel che mi aspettavo siamo entrati in perfetta sintonia ed ancora oggi ci sentiamo ed ogni tanto ci rivediamo(questo a garantire l'ottima intesa)Quando gli interventi erano cronometrati per problemi inerenti ai tempi di produzione,operazioni delicate da eseguire nel tempo concesso pur se minimo.I momenti di ""break""dove col folklore campano se ne dicevano di tutti i colori."
good,"3M is a worldwide business with many opportunities and great benefits. The typical workday would be filled with operating heavy machinery, or packing products out made. One thing I've learned working at 3M is that everyone's voice in a situation is welcomed, and important. Everyone's view is welcome. Many of the co-workers in or out of your work area are particularly friendly, and get along quite well. One of the most struggling parts about working at 3M, since it is a factory, is the outside temperature's effect on the inside. Summers can get hot, and winters get cold. As long as you stay hydrated in the summer, and dress warm in the winter, working at 3M can be a blast."

good,"Best job I ever had, I am currently laid off due in part to a sluggish economy, and I also think the winter we had this year with so much unusually cold weather and snow in areas farther south in the U.S. than is normal has played a role. I found the work environment to be very low stress, management personnel are very friendly/helpful. My co-workers are also very knowledgeable and helpful, a very teamwork minded bunch. The hardest part of the job for me was getting hired, as the process, which to my understanding is common with many of your high end employers today, takes some time to navigate through."

It was a family company everybody new everyone else and their families. we used to have lots of family activities. People suported each other both on the job and off and many of us made life long friendships at 3M. Whilst it was a big company with a large sales and marketing force as well as a supportive administrative force the company never forgot the human side of their employees unlike today in most companies.

good,"At this company I was trained in many different aspects of the job, which led me to numerous advancements. Showing initiative and job understanding led me to become cross trained as a trainer for new hires, a weekend and intermittent lead for the department. Becoming cross trained not only can raise your salary, but gives great job security. And 3M will give you that chance if they see you have a strong work ethic. The management and staff were very great, friendly people. As long as you paid attention in training you should very rarely have a problem you can't solve on your own here. Best employment there is to be involved with."

good,When working in a 3M plant you will experience fast paced and slow paced activities depending on the day. You get exposed to several areas of the company if you are willing to learn. Everyone is extremely helpful and willing to share their knowledge with you. The downside is that they use outdated programs that make it somewhat difficult to obtain data.

From my humble beginnings as a green manufacturing, wide-eyed temporary employee, to now having management responsibilities over multiple technical departments, 3M has provided, not only great benefits and a secure financial income for my family, but a fulfilling and challenging career with limitless potential for growth.  I have had the opportunity to travel to other countries and see what makes 3M great.  That is ethics and their embrace on diversity, and how that is inspired upon their workforce.  I have had the privilege to work for 3M over 25 years and have seen a great deal of change, and sometimes questioned some decisions.  However, in the end those decisions are made to ensure we stay true to our vision:  3M Technology Advancing Every Company, 3M Products Enhancing Every Home and 3M Innovation Improving Every Life.  I'll leave you with one final thought.  Can you find another company that has the wide-ranging portfolio to make a positive impact on every life in the world?"

We work collaboratively yet independently with inspirational leaders and colleagues.  The hardest part of the job is wearing many hats.  With where our economy currently is, this is a common trend.  People think that they can leave and go to another company and wear less hats.  Really, it's a hard-fact that if you are a part of a huge and successful organization, one will wear many hats and have to put in an honest and diligent days work.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with.  People here are Intelligent, Kind, True and ones I admire and respect."
