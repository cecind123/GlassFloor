rating,review
good,Their outstanding work when it come down to helping the customer with finding what they needed was up to the most respect you can get. Even when they could not help you with what you was looking for they would try their best.
good,It was a fast paced job but still fun to work at. Unloading a truck for one person could be hard though and sorting all the freight could be hard to if you don’t know where it goes
good,I loved it there just moved away and didn't have a vehicle. Always would love to go back but just to far to drive and to much hassle trying to go there everyday i would work. I wouldn't want to run into my ex or his family.
good,"I liked working there. They were flexible with my schedule and took time to listen to my problems."
good,Walmart Was A Great Place To Work The Best Thing For Me Was The Hour Consistency. The Pace Wasn't Steady Due To The Nature Of the Job ( Retail ) There Were Slow Days And Hectic Days.
good,A typical day at work is always positive. No matter the challenge the day will be what I make it to be. I learned from my job is to keep my customers satisfied and it is the key to making the company productive. A happy customer make a even happier Manger to know your labor have not been in vain.
good,A really physically challenging job. Have to be able to lift large amounts of weight. A very quick paced job where customer service and efficiency walk hand in hand.
good,come in as a temp and do remodels.. and work In a friendly environment and laid back people enjoyed it and i wish i could've been working for them longer but i got sent to another company after the next all the time to do more remodels. i learned how to do a lot of things like organize a whole department with a team and work In different positions through out the store.
good,"Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
good,Good starting job but not a long time career.  Pay is terrible only minimum wage but management is okay the work is easy But customers are a pain overall not a career choice
good,It's a great company they are just advancing to the future and not providing advancement. Ready to branch out and use my strengths at a new and exciting company.
good,I loved certain aspects of my job I liked interacting with my customers made some good friends with my co workers and liked what i did but did not like the direction management and company was going
good,You never know what to expect. You pay be hired for one department but you may end up working a completely different area. They pretty much put you wherever they need you...even on the cleaning crew. So dont be surprised if that happens.
good,I think Walmart needs to learn and understand how to treat their employees. other than that most of the customers and fellow employees are great. Some make you feel like family and some don't
good,"This job consists of offloading trucks by hand, in the warehouse, and placing them on carts.Each box was placed on the cart which is assigned to the aisle were the products are later placed on the shelves in the right location. Where there is a label and a price tag. We used a hand held device to help us find the products right location."
good,"Falta comunicação entre áreas, empresa de grande porte."
good,"The Walmart I was employed with was in Niles, IL and it was 24 hours. I worked as a overnight cashier and you'd be surprised at how many people shopped at 3am lol. The overnight managers and staff were very helpful."
good,"I have been with the company for 5 plus years, it is not a bad company however, i do not get paid enough, as a 29 year old I need to be making salary. I have to pursue other interest to get to where I want to be in life."
good,They are very lenient with your work schedule and certain things that need to be done. The people are very fun to work with and it’s never a problem. All of the people there are very understanding and they never judge no matter the situation.
good,I loved it but didnt like how management and crew was treating me at the Walmart I was working at. Its not a bad place but it just depends who you are and which one you work for. When you work for Walmart in the mainland they treat you bad if your from hawaii at least thats how I felt at the one I was working at.
good,Walmart is not a bad place to start your employment.  Those who are looking to advance their career should find other companies to for work.  Walmart does give their employees a discount.
good,"I liked my boss he was a very nice and fair man, the CSM's are very helpful, they need more cashier's , the one's that they have are all way's on stress"
good,"A typical day at Walmart was fun, exciting, busy, challenging, and rewarding."
good,"working in customer service with the public. Stocking selves, making sure that the product is available. having good communication skills with others ."
good,"Working at Walmart has taught me a lot , helped me with my skills and activity.. also helped me With helping others as well.. Hours was good pay was good and Availability was good as well they helped me work around things"
good,"It was a fun, happy place to work at, nice people, nice coworkers, loved the customers, clean place. If I could go back I definitely would love too for sure."
good,Tienen un ambiente de trabajo justo. Tienen beneficios para empleados. Tienen un equipo de trabajo  Los horarios son un poco no razonables. Tienes oportunidad de crecimiento en la empresa.
good,"Ienjiyed working at walmart, other than the manager that was there. Everyone was extremely nice and welcoming. The person that trained me for the job was very patient and understanding."
good,It was just a temp job but I liked what I did. I left for a job in law enforcement at sac and fox police department as a police officer. My supervisor was good to work for.
good,Walmart is a cool place to work at but with poor management & inconsistent hours it makes it a little more difficult to be comfortable working. I would work there again
good,"It is a good place for the first job. I enjoy the time with my co-workers because I feel like I belong to something bigger, a bigger family. I learned I can do anything if I want to don it."
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you are needing a job just to pay the bills. Their benefits are great but the management is poor. The only way to move up in the company is if you know someone.Its very hard to get management to support you and to make it a career placement. They will promote outside before promoting within. Training is minimum to none. You basically have to learn everything on your own.
good,"Walmart was cut-throat and ""too hard"" on the employees who did my job there was no ""going right"" or recognition for improvement if it happened it happened rarely and everyone Who worked there was always complaining about everyone else. Drama concentric, unfriendly, and rude employees. customers were exceptional i must say. The store also had everything you needed and good prices."
good,"If you want to know what goes on at the store ask the associates around the store. Because everyone has a different opinion about any walmart, or any store."
good,"You went in, you worked, you helped to do everyone else's work, you got poorly paid, got in trouble for any overtime, couldn't promote, played favorites, and couldn't call in sick."
good,I learned how to stock the shelves and looking at the product and being able to tell where it went just by looking at tho codes on the box. I was also taught how to better manage my time and use my speed to best of my ability to get the work done properly.
good,"It is a fairly reasonable job, you're being productive through out the day and rarely do overtime. The management I would say does need some work and communication to their employees."
good,"I wasn't there very long, but while I was, I liked the fast-paced atmosphere. It was quite a challenge to keep up the pace, but I've always liked a challenge."
good,"Not the best if you're not up for the work, can be very physically demanding. If you don't mind the work the pay is alright, starts at 18.65 for weekend shift and lots of raises."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. Management can use some improvement but, its bearable. the hardest part of the job was probably dealing with difficult customers but, you'll run into that obstacle anywhere you go."
good,Walmart is a great places to work at for the pay they pay you.I just wanted to try something new and see what else was out here in the world.Walmart nice places
good,"I mean, Walmart isn’t my personal cup of tea, but it could be good for some people. The associates generally treat you like you’re part of a team. The management tries their best. But be prepared for work you can’t catch up on and expectations you cannot meet. On the flip side, expect days you’ll have little traffic in the store, and the hours turn to days that turn to weeks."
good,"Walmart was a very great job. It was very fast paced, but if you hare a hard worker that comes ready to work, you will be able to handle it. It paid very great and also came with great benefits."
good,"Great crew and staff. Management is okay and constantly being shuffled around. The people around you really make the job better, but working with the public is difficult and not for everyone. Customers and rude people really do ruin the job."
good,"My main complaint while working at Walmart was the working hours. Since it's a retail store there are low and high seasons, if they are not making good money in a period they will cut employees hours, especially part-time personnel."
good,It is enjoyable and they let you take time off whenever you need to for school. This is really beneficial as you don't know when some assignment or exam might pop up.
good,"The business is very fast paced. You do make friends easily because there are so many associates. There is no feeling of family, it feels like you are a number. You are offered discounts though and that is nice. The customers are used to not being offered very good customer service so they are generally rude and impatient."
good,"I love my job, and team at walmart, I love it that i get to work 1-1 with customers with different sttitudes. Ive met so many nepeople who became friends."
good,Unfortunately the management can/should stop trying to fire everyone and replace them. management abuses their coaching's to threaten people to work harder better and faster or they are going to get fired.
good,Good for both part or full time. Management is nice and fair. There is opportunity to move around in the company. Pays well and is a good place to work starting in retail like i was.
good,"3rd shift stocking, unloading truck, stock all areas, work more than 8hrs a day. Self paste job, fast paste work environment. Stay on your feet 24/7. Walmart is a great company to work at."
good,Great workplace OK hours poor management flexible schedule but unfair task times poor training and inventory control measures indivisualistic culture held
good,The volume of prescriptions that were processed with Walmart was very high at the time of my employment. I felt we were understaffed most of the time to handle the high number of prescriptions that were processed at that location.
good,"I liked the opportunities Walmart had to offer, however, management was an issue for my previous store. They created a lot incentives (raises and bonuses) to maintain work productivity."
good,I have had the opportunity to work in places in the United States that I would have never had the chance.  I enjoyed meeting people in each of these different areas.  I have held many positions throughout the company and have learned a lot during my time.
good,I am a Personal Shopper. I enjoy my position and being able to assist customers within the store. I just wished the hourly wage was higher. The ASM is very respectful and easy to get along with.
good,I loved working for walmart.  I just feel like they should pay their employees more money for what we do.  Love meeting and working with new and different types of people.  Very busy. Very fast pace.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work and grow. I became and Dept Manger in less then a year and learned a lot in other Dept before promotion.I worked in electronics, pick up today, customer service and money center."
good,"Good atmosphere, fast-paced, competitive, willingness to learn, each day is different Customer friendly. working as a team is the best way to go. Walmart culture is very strong."
good,"It’s hard working at Walmart because of the managers. Some of them are rude and disrespectful, and that’s not work behave. The employees fight with customers and each other which make it hard to work."
good,"I only worked at walmart for about 5 months. I came in as a department manager, found out I was pregnant soon after. They care about your well being for the most part."
good,"A good place to work. Good hours with decent pay, and the associates are focused on helping customers as well as each other. I feel welcome here and I feel that the management is concerned with helping me advance my career."
good,"Good starting job, my store manager was a pain the neck complaining about overtime but wanting us to get the entire store stocked with only 6 people ()"
good,"Well what can i say, working at walmart is amazing. But the problem is alot of people quit and basically working by yurself which is hard and stressful, but i managed it."
good,Walmart is a good place to work in only if you can treat customers with respect and you are flexible with the hours they give you. There is so  many was to move around or move up.
good,We would stock up the shelves and make sure the aisle is neat. We provided top notch customer service. We were provided an area to watch over. We had to be knowledgeable of the items in the aisles.
good,As a cashier expect the reasonable and unreasonable consumers to show up and always have an eye on the product and the cashier drawer to prevent thieving hands and prevent consumers from getting large cash backs because of some consumers would empty the whole drawer by using a pack of gum when they could use the cash station just a few steps from the cashiers instead. Do this and you would have less of a headaches dealing with consumers that are paying in cash instead of a card. life lesson for you.
good,"It has its ups and downs like any business. At this point I do not feel like my job is secure. They have been displacing people and their jobs without notice,"
good,Walmart was a laid back job but at the same it was really fast paced. I enjoyed the job but the hours were always inconsistent. I would recommend that Walmart is a good place to work.
good,Working at Walmart for three years was a learning experience but sometimes you have to find better so you’ll be able to grow. Also I would recommend anyone to work there.
good,the team was great we worked well together it was very fast passed and an great experience to gain as team we motivated each other to do better and we all strived to succeed
good,"Fun place to work, alot of hard working associates ,long /short hours ,you get rewarded for your hard work you make a difference , good exercise , meeting happy people ,and greeting them."
good,"Good place for working at . Just needs better Benefits and higher pay rates, Needs more Help Improving store . Needs More customer services . Good work culture."
good,"Daily jobs varied.  Assisting customers at cashier stand and throughout the store.  Cashiering and watching for fraud and theft."
good,"Great job, great rate of pay for the cost of living, horrible hours. I was hired on as temporary help. Then brought on full term. I started out as an overnight associate getting great hours then I was forced to move an received terrible hours."
good,Walmart is a fast pace customer service environment you have to be a people person and willing to deal with all different types of people interact ask questions as well as multitask and doing daily activities and jobs request you have to be able to deal with the customers as well as projects that are given to you
good,I enjoyed being there. The work was good kept me but so the day went by faster.  The co-workes are really friendly and make you feel welcome. There was always help if I needed it.
good,Worked over night from 11 to 7. Hard to get used to working an over night shift. Managers wanted us to do twice the work for the time allowed. But made a couple of friends there.
good,They give u good benefits and u do get the hours u need to. There management does not always do what they are supposed to do when it comes to employees not get along
good,Walmart was the best place to be ! Great people that works with you ! Loved the pay and the people there ! I will always remember my tome there . Will go back any day
good,Better communication between management and associates. I enjoy working for Wal-Mart. My plan is to continue progressing with the company. They do encourage associates to move forward
good,"I worked night shift and was a stocker. Had a team meeting before we all start and have to end in a timely manner. Didnt have many workers so the work load was a little tough, but overall the work is not that stressful, and every job has all types of coworkers and managers who make the job harder. Life"
good,This was a great first job. would suggest other people to reach out and work here. would consider going back. discount was good too just wish it would be before four months.
good,"I learn hoe to use the labor system, how to stock, the codes for what items needed to be and where, how to zone the areas. How to sell things that was not in my department, great customer service skills."
good,"In working for Walmart there is a metric for everything.  It is easy dig in an find an answer to a problem for almost anything.  The challenge is not getting bogged down in the weeds and being able to remember the success of the company, its associates.  That is the true reward.  Watching each associate grow from being challenged."
good,Just wasn’t for me management was not the best at times. My coworkers were pretty cool which made things easier. At times was a lot of commotion. Starting pay should be more
good,"I started with walmart as a part-time cashier back in Sept. 1999. There was great opportunity to advance with the company. I was a cashier, sales floor associate, dept. manager, asst. Manager, and co manager in my career at walmart. My job responsibilities included: teaching and training, couching for improvement, scheduling, evaluation, ordering, maintaining inventory levels, inventory, producing financial numbers, and develop associate to advance."
good,First real job out of high school. It was fun and I met some really great people. Walmart offers a lot of great benefits. If you want a great place to work I think Walmart is a star.
good,"I had the short end of the stick, Paid for service desk, but was working as a CSM. got in trouble for things other CSMs were doing as well and I think it honestly was because my manager thought i egged her house one night (we were neighbors). Loved the environment, loved the people, Would work here again."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work. Just  wish i wasn't the only one working most of the time in the morning, by myself. Getting paid biweekly isn't as satisfying, because my last job i got paid $769 a week. But overall, walmart is great."
good,It was easy and simple to learn and I had fun working together with a team of others. I learned a lot from how to use a pallet jack and working in different parts of the store.
good,I enjoyed the work environment at Walmart the other employees made it fun. The work place banter made my time there enjoyable. Unfortunately the management at my store was not the best.
good,"Enjoyed working at Walmart"
good,"Minimum 1-2 trailers a night depending on personal speed. Associates must have basic math skills n ability to document items into system, while making expected production time."
good,I loved working at Walmart I was working at Walmart in Dallas Texas. It was fun and alot to learn while you work there they teach you new skill's etc..
good,"my review of Walmart was really good until I had to change my availability, they weren't willing to work with my hours. I had a doctors note due to my pregnancy and had to change my hours and they weren't willing to work with me."
good,"This place is very busy makes 100+ MILLION a year and corporate is constantly finding a way to make sure, in my opinion, that you fail by not giving enough hours for the people you need to do all the stuff they want your store to do. They make it very difficult to achieve mandated goal."
good,Good for a first job but management could be better good hours and break time u get Benitez’s but could be better would o go back to Walmart no I will not
good,"I've worked for Walmart for 8 years. There's a lot of multitasking..filling, bagging prescriptions, inputting...waiting on customers.. looking for better pay."
good,working for Walmart was fun. everyday wasn't a hard day and the hard days weren't as hard as the seemed. A lot of times you were sent to do someone else job that is not even in your field but some work places are just like that
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work, it is definitely never dull. You meet all kinds of people when assisting customers that you can help and put a smile on their face."
good,It's nice fast pace job those trucks have to be loaded and ready to go by a certain time.. the pay is good.. as long as you don't mind a little hard work.  I'd recommend this Job
good,De acuerdo al área de desempeño podras llegara a tus metas
good,"As a cashier my responsibilities included accurately counting money and giving exact change, processing purchases while providing excellent customer service, and following the CFF policy (Clean, Fast, and Friendly). "
good,"I worked at Walmart as a regular staff member.  I started in the Toy Department, but did operate the cash register on occasions.  It was a fun place to work, but unless you strive for management, it's not very profitable."
good,"A good place to learn retail, observe the different types of jobs it takes to make a store successful.  the different types of personalities that shop there and work there."
good,"bon travail pour jeune étudiant, la compagnie est bien structurée"
good,"Learn customer services, Cash handling, Stocking, Using  the handheld device to markdown, price merchandise, and learn others skills, Have the opportunity learn other skills."
good,I enjoy working here but I don't enjoy my schedule being flipped every week. I also dislike how some employees have to do the work for others plus thereselfs.
good,"Overall working at Walmart was a great experience, I learned so much within the 2 and 1/2 years I was there. some days it became stressful on me dealing with all the different personalities but through it all I was still able to manage and maintain a great attitude that always satisfied the customers"
good,"I took the job as a third shift stocker because I needed a job. It paid reasonably well, and it was enough to put food on the table and have some left over, but that was largely because I wasn't paying household bills by myself. It wasn't a bad place to work, but I definitely miss my coworkers more than I will ever miss the job itself."
good,You have a long leash if you are not incompetent. No one really cares that much about messing around as long as you get the job done. Indoors with air conditioning.
good,"A good place to work if you're still in school or need some extra money. Nice people, and productive company. You get a few benefits and can advance more depending on your area of work."
good,"Checking out customers on a daily basis, doing returns and exchanges at customer service, cashing checks and money orders in the money center. hardest part was dealing with the customers attitudes daily."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart, defenitevely learn new skills and the environment was clean and safe. Managers and employees are nice and very outgoing."
good,"I started at walmart as a stockman, which is the bottom of the totem pole. I wouldnt recommend the job to anyone. You have to work in the rain, sun, and snow and its just not worth it for minimum wage."
good,This job was more of an seasonal job when I was staying out helping family to be able to keep my part around the house in anyway but the environment wasn't too bad and not too intense.
good,"Walmart is great. The employees are amazing and the training really helps you, it’s also paid. And you get a dollar raise after the first 4-6 months of training. Definitely worth it"
good,"I'm not a very large person, so doing all of that physical activity all night was incredibly tiring, that paired with the fact that the floors were made from the leftover slag from when steel was a big thing in the area, really makes the floors hard and your feet ache after a few hours."
good,"It was a fast pace get up and go type of working vibe, most of the people were very nice and some weren’t. Everything was pretty fair and pay was as fair as it could be for the work we were doing"
good,The hardest part not get any 9 points leading too Termination. Typical day is spent stocking shelves and helping the customer find things or doing returns.
good,work load was steady but i enjoyed helping customers. managers where helpful and always willing to help. everyone worked together to make sure the job got dine correctly and on time
good,easy place to work … sometimes hard but there is  other workers that will help you …  management is ok as long as you get your work on time . the stocking there is easy and fun but can sometimes get overwhelming.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart and wish I could have continued.  I babysit my grandson and the days and hours vary, so I needed a flexible schedule.  When I was first hired, this was possible.  At some point, though, they began using a new system to schedule hours and I was told it was no longer possible for them to be so flexible.  I would have loved to have continued working there, and if my schedule becomes more consistent I may be able to return."
good,"Walmart is a good company to build character if you are soft or close minded, how ever there is good people at Walmart that can teach you about job opportunities and how to follow the proper lines for your job assignments"
good,"not a difficult job , not much pay, physically demanding at times. simple work. meet  many unique people. time off when requestedin a timely manner (2 weeks)."
good,"3rd shift stocking frozen,dairy, or deli wall. Very busy stocking departments. Learning curve not to difficult. Learned how to stock various products."
good,I decline participation in the review of this organization.  I am not inclined to express an opinion either for or against anyone pursuing employment with this organization.
good,"it was an okay place to work, not very flexible, people pick and choose the days they want to give you off even if you need it, and their schedules were all over theplace"
good,i worked there for 5 years and the associates while in each other's business are some of the nicest people i've had the pleasure of meeting. the management however (not all of them) doesn't care they hide in their office with their clique and do the bare minimum.
good,It was always nice greeting the customers as they would walk into the store and as they would be checking out. Also helping them go in the right direction to find certain items.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart as a cashier was friendly , independent work environment.I would most definitely recommend a friend to work at Wal-Mart based on my passed working experience at Wal-Mart. Wamart needs to work on their management."
good,A typical day at walmart consists of helping many costumers find locations for their purchases. Organizing cleaning cashing out. It is a fast paced company with lots of things to do.
good,"Benefits were great  and people care. "
good,"Good place to work, get to help and deal with customers 1 on 1 or assisting associates helping customers, fast paced environment  with the chance of advancing within the company."
good,It was average. The people that you work along side with are great but the management is not the best. Some days you are put to break way too early or they even forget about you.
good,"Was upbeat and fast paced. Very friendly workers and management. Everything was by the book, very stricked. Do not play games and would like foe phones to be put in locker along with other accessories."
good,Sometimes stood for hours at a time with no break. Reviews and raises given on time. Stools finally provided for associates with restrictions. CSR was understanding of outside activities.
good,Walmart is a good place to work for just really confusing sometimes depends what your job title is. There’s a lot of different options at Walmart to apply for.
good,"Overall, Wal-Mart is a great company with manageable requirements.  The benefits are pretty good as well as the staff and management for the majority."
good,"They are so fun at walmart, the people are amazing. From the customers to the employees. All outgoing fun people. Would go back there anytime i was able."
good,they have a lot of jobs to complete on your shift and have to move fast so get them all done but the people work with are friendly and we all work together to complete our tasks
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was flexible schedule and supportive coworkers. Managers were helpful. Hardest part was to satisfy customers. sometimes customers were looking for items, which were not available, therefore I had to find other stores for the products customer looking for."
good,Walmart was a good place to work.  There weren't very good benefits but the pay was not too bad.  I was able to get plenty of hours.  The work environment and fellow employees were pleasant to work with.
good,It’s a decent place to work however the management is terrible when it comes to scheduling hours. They’re trying out a new system where the computer makes the schedules which is making the situation worse. Some people had no hours for 2-3 weeks.
good,"Workplace can be adaptable to fit your needs. They are pretty flexible on hours, especially with it being a 24 hour store.  Can be stressful when workload gets out of control.  Customers are not the best.  You can work your way up on management pretty quickly if you pit in the effort."
good,"Its an easy job & you'll get everything done on time if your focused. The pay is great, the discounts are great too. The people there were good people to work with."
good,"I overall enjoyed working here, the only thing I would change is the hours but other then that not to bad of a place to work. Another con is that the work was super physically demanding."
good,"It was decent enough while I worked there. Not long before I left though, I did realize that some things vs were changing for the worst, mostly where scheduling is concerned."
good,"Customers were great most of the time. Managers understanding. Team play is key, very fast pace, hardly any breaks. stock as fast as possible and get the merchandise out on the sales floor."
good,Walmart is a great a great company to work for. It’s always something New everyday. The co workers are very friendly and helpful. I would recommend it to anybody.
good,"WalMart is a tale of two stories. You have the older employee that, really, maybe not have other options for work; and the baby employee, freshly entering the job scene. -- Just my opinion; Walmart is a place where you work when you: as an older adult, have no where else to go; or if you have no other work experience. But for those, high school kids or recently graduating from high school, or young adults working through school; this is a fair opportunity. For everyone in-between, if your not in management, or plan on making something of yourself, it's really not a booster of careers. No real skills required to complete tasks."
good,Management changes very often. I learned how to use a cash register. The workplace was okay. There are a lot of coworkers and they change very often. The most difficult part of the job was the absence points because of my medical problems. They don't like to forgive points.
good,it a productive work environment with high demand. there is a a lot of work to be done.if you have the speed and the will to get the job done you will be able to fit right in.
good,A typical work day would consist of cleaning the whole entire store and maintaining it. The worst part is when you were pulled from your position and placed into some one else
good,"Overall, it's a laid back workplace and I'd work there again. It was good pay, good benefits, and I made some great friends working there as well. I know it's changed some since I left, but still a good place to work."
good,Walmart was my first real job I ever had. It was my chance to prove myself. I loved the customers... sometimes. Working at a place like this teaches you patience and helps you get out of your shell to build relationships with your customers. Some customers would even come to see me just to show me pictures of their dogs that had beat cancer. I loved working there because as long as you were busy and had someone to talk to you would forget the pain in your lower back from standing so long. Breaks were short. Taught me great communication skills and cash handling. Builds your confidence
good,the work is pretty rough when you first start out but over all it gets easier and you get well payed for what you do. although sometimes you will not get the hours that you want.
good,"Typical Walmart work space and resting area. Nothing to complain about, but nothing special either. Overall, a good place to start off for someone looking for a job."
good,It's a good place to work. The People are good to work with. Alot of stuff to learn. There is alot of options to grow with in the company. So have fun and learn.
good,"I love working with others."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work at with a first job, and can be a place to make a career in. I would recommend. The environment can be fun and challenging."
good,The pay rate is good and come with good benefits for their employees. Position is great for persons with good customer service skills and patience. Easy to learn new things and advance for better opportunities.
good,"good place to work, good coworkers,they teach you how to do your job better, they treat you pretty fair,opportunity to advance,learned time management"
good,"friendly people make you feel like family. everyone get along, work load is minimum, do your job right the first time then you don't have to do it over again."
good,"Busy, lots of different tasks throughout the day."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, bons horários e benefícios. Só falta mais reconhecimento aos funcionários."
good,"During my time at Walmart, I learned the value of teamwork, and communication. The position of a cashier is stressful, but easy to adapt to.   The management is there to answer any questions you may have regarding how to operate efficiently in your position. Depending on the time of day, and day of the week, the lines at checkout may be very long, and sometimes very stressful. However, there are multiple other employees willing to help you understand anything that you do not know how to handle. The workplace culture is one of acceptance, and you will not feel unappreciated for the work that you do. It will give you a full reorganization of the meaning of ""The customer always comes first."" It is truly a very nice place to be employed."
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you can handle a fast paced environment and long work hours. The management isn't that great at my location although ive heard different things about different locations
good,This is a decent company to work for especially while that way you can decide if that's your career of choice because it does have it's benefit and you work your way up.
good,"The jobs that are offered are, in no way hard, but if you work on Cap 2, you will be highly underpaid for the amount of work you have to do. They do work very well with your schedule if you need a day off."
good,"I enjoy work daily, I just wish I had more hours.My original manager gave me a more flexible schedule and I preferred it that way. However I adapt well to change."
good,great start up job for young people looking to make a difference. Great opportunities for advancement with time on the job you can go anywhere. Individuals looking to learn and improve on their work or customer service skills should definitely apply.
good,"Communication lack"
good,"My work day was filled with customer service, filling scripts, handling phone calls, checking the inventory. I've learned to multi task. Some days are very stressful."
good,You need to be a energetic and 💪 to work there because order need to get fill fast and on time throughout the shift that can be from 8 to 14 hour a day.
good,i like work there but i dont like managment because of when i was sick that time i was working an i ask for off but they are not given me off and than next day i was very sick and need to see docters and i was in hospital than docter provide me off 3 days note but i did not call in work place beacause i was sick than 3 day after i went my work place and i given my docter not but they said you no longer working our team so they are fire me
good,"Working for the company really has 2 things that determine your experience, and that is your Store Managers and Assistant Managers. There are corporate things that are beyond their control that can drive you nuts, but if you are in a store where the management works hard and treats you with respect it can be an enjoyable place to work. I worked in a couple stores and there were some that had low morale and it usually came from the top down and on the other end there were stores where you actually feel appreciated and like its a big family. If you have a manger that treats you like you are easy to replace then it's harder. If you have a manger who appreciates the work you put in and it shows it can be a really good place. There is plenty of advancement in the company if you do the right things and stay on the good side of management and after some years put in you can make a decent living, but if you plan on just being a regular associate it will be a long time before you make good money if ever."
good,Socializing with associates. Management can improve the morale in the stores instead of focusing on the numbers. Interacting with customers and problem solving with other associates. Hardest part is to ask for help or requesting knowledge.
good,"great place to start out when your young, great place to stay for a long time and a great place to retire from in the future. great benifits, family plans and more.all around great place to be."
good,"good place to work, keep to yourself and get your work done and you'll go a long way. My experience at Wal-Mart have been great. It has its ups and downs but overall I would recommend Wal-Mart to anyone."
good,working in the shop at Walmart is probably the best part of what happened personally i would rather not work in a place like Walmart again just because i cant afford to live on what they pay
good,"My experience was good, but it's not a career I would want to stay at. Everyone is different. For me I just use this place for the income I need to pay some bills. The insurance is great the benefits are great. The matching of the Roth Ira is great. Also, the 401k match is great. Just the pay would be higher would be nice to get. I think if you need a job right away go apply for Walmart. You need to be ready for working at Walmart. They changed the dress code. You use to not be able to wear jeans now you can. They use to only be able to wear only Blue or white shirts. They now allow you to wear any dark color to work as long as its work appropriate. You do have to wear a vest you get when you join the Walmart team. They give you a box cutter and also access to the online part of the company. If you need things to talk to the management and ask for it. They will listen, sometimes they don't act when you ask them for something important. The hardest things to do at Walmart is to make sure you are ready for some hard tasks. They ask you to do stuff that is sometimes out of this world, but you just have to do it. Make sure that you are not a slacker. You are on a points system about your attendance. Not more than 4 points or you can get into trouble and let go."
good,The job was ok and my daily tasks weren't difficult. The weather conditions and temperature in the trailers played a important role in the aspect of attitude for the position.
good,"Empresa boa e tranquilo de trabalhar tem dias que e agitado mas normal,mas e pra você saber se vai dar conta do trabalho."
good,Walmart can be both the best and worst place to work at the same time. Being as though it is a very well known retail facility you get a vast majority of different type of customers. Management also plays a big role into how your work environment will be. My advice before applying there would be to either know someone currently working in the store you seek to apply to so that you can get a feel of management. Also to walk through the store during the hours you wish to apply to get a sense of the place. If you are someone who gets stressed out easily this is not the job for you.
good,"being a cashier at Walmart will definitely teach you speed and patience, and time management one of my favorite things was that it constantly stayed busy"
good,cleaning floors cleaning spills and cleaning restrooms and emptying garbages.helping with product and helping make cardboard and plastic baler. cleaning the back room.
good,"Un trabajo bueno cómodo , y diferentes personas con diferentes naciknalidad"
good,"-repetición."
good,"Although working here had its downsides there were a lot of upsides, that being said i would never work for walmart again due to terms of my termination."
good,The cash office is interesting and very quick paced. The challenges lie with the information turned in.  Fellow peers were compatible and friendly. The requirements were not too excessive.
good,"Lot different than stocking shelve. Had more to do with stripping floors extrating carpets, replacing florecent bulbs, and hanging signs,patching and painting drywall, cleaning bathrooms,empying garbage in break rooms and offices,collecting carts from outside,moving gondolas,and also stocking shelves."
good,"In my time at Walmart, I learned proper procedures with deli prepping products. I gained a great deal of knowledge about cold cuts and prepping party trays. it was a great experience."
good,This job has good benefits and ability to move up in the company. Pay was kind of low for the amount of work they expect from worker. Understaffed so the work load can get heavy
good,When I worked at Walmart I enjoyed it. I caught on to my job pretty fast. Enjoyed working with the people. Fast paced. Laid back environment. Manger was very easy going.
good,Checking customers out or over seeing self check. Great managers and co workers. They always make sure you take your breaks and lunch on time. They move you around so you don't get bored.
good,In Indiana I had a great work experience. Once I relocated Back to Mississippi after Injury I was not seeing the same value given to the workplace and The associates where not given respect . It makes a difference in Location.
good,"On a typical day I would straighten the products on the shelves and assist customers find the merchandise they were looking for.  Sometimes, I would need to ask my fellow Walmart sales clerks where to find something for a customer."
good,I would work there again. They hired to many people and cut my hours so I called in. And never went back. I liked working there. The people where amazing.
good,My particular job was stressful as only one person was in my area to do 5 or 6 jobs. Customer service suffered greatly most of the year because of that6
good,I am used to a fast paced environment. The people were friendly and I learned quickly. Training was paid for and free. Staff and managers were always helpful and nice to work with.
good,"Working for Walmart was one of my first jobs growing up, It was a good working for the company and it was also a great learning experience as I was young when I started working here."
good,"Walmart is in okay job to work for. The pay doesn't match the job that you do. They under pay you. It can be a stressful environment sometimes. They always got  two or maybe  three registers open which makes your job harder and the check out lines longer"
good,Most of the time managers expect you to take on other positions and other areas that are not in your job description w/out any compensation or acknowledgement.
good,"Walmart is a pretty fast paced work environment, you're always on your feet. You have opportunities for advancement in the work place. Your schedule can be very hectic."
good,I loved my supervisors and how they pushed me into new roles however there wasn't much room for advancement because all of the upper management jobs were already taken. I left for an office job but I probably would have stayed if they would have accepted my Doctors order for me not to stand. I still could have performed most if not all of my duties from a stool in all three positions I worked.
good,Management was friendly to employees. The workplace was calm but fast-paced. Hours are flexible. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"Over the pass few years maybe because of management changes the company made, associates inefficient progress in many areas has brought down motivation and decreased productivity. Wonderful place to gain responsibility and increase knowledge."
good,"Had lots of fun unloading transport trucks."
good,"My review is rather outdated. Pay for the job requirements in my opinion were a bit light. Very committed job. Must be available to work at a moments notice. Turnover inevitable. Was required to ""zone"" (clean) other departments after shift. Seasonal items are a disaster to organize, especially school supplies."
good,I became knowledgeable of the proper way to stock and how to handle late night customers . Working there allowed me to use my customer service skills .
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for if you are willing to work hard and be patient.  The opportunity for growth is there but you must be willing to work hard and prove that you are an asset to the company.  I have had great luck in working with amazing associates and managers but I will say that there are bad seeds at any company.  With Walmart, I was able to travel the country and provide a nice lifestyle for my family.  When hurricanes destroyed the south, Walmart allowed me to go help those in need just by asking.  The hours were very long and I actually gave up attempting to see friends and family during any holiday but it was a small sacrifice.  I would recommend Walmart to anyone that, like me, did not have a direction in life."
good,"I worked for this Walmart for a very brief time however I had a chance to do several contacts with personnel which helped me to have some take on the overall culture of that store. I believe in general Walmart has a good organization and also a very strong sale leadership. As for this store it was close to my place and also brand new which was exciting for me to begin working in there. Upon a few days of work I realized that some things were unfair and unbalanced. The training was completely off and there were several managers in there. We had access to computers to work on our training which was one part of the process and they were good at that, however, the follow up was nonexistent unless somebody had a problem which happened with many new employees resulting in some customers being openly critical about their frustration. We were also moved from all of our positions at their own liking at any time which happened often and there were a lot of camaraderie to some and not to others to accommodate certain favoritism fostering a lot of selfish behavior and toxic competition. This is a note to the credit of the store involving customer service... Even tough this atmosphere was lacking good team work, I also believe that I have never encountered any other Walmart with so many customers feeling entitled to complain openly and bitterly about the services they were being offered. It is unbeknownst to me the origin of this criteria of behavior...Some positive to this leadership was the fact  that they had our schedules ready and ahead of time regularly and the admission process was"
good,"Large plant with a lot of employees. A great place to work and great employee and employer communication. I drove forklift, packing, shipping, and jam running."
good,"Walmart has Good people to work with poor management structure, it can be very one sided and poor structure for crew and there family life.They have brought their pay more in line for personel, but make it very difficult for members to relocate and keep their postions if needed"
good,"Walmart as a whole does care about its employees to a certain extent. They offer computer training for the masses rather than individual training. However, they do provide each associate a supervisor guaranteed for every shift."
good,"My first job, enjoyable at most times.  Started school and could not work the hours they needed me too with my classes.  I decided during that time, school was more important."
good,Overall walmart is a good company to work for but it depends on which location you work at.  The benefits for full time employees were pretty decent and the 10% off discount came in handy.
good,Everyone I worked with was pretty calm and laid back. I had some awesome customers. But I have great customer services too. Management is cool. They would work with you on any problem you have. I loved working with the company.
good,Walmart was a good place to work at. Good friendly environment and the schedule was very flexible if it was needed to be. I would suggest working here to anybody
good,"The work is fast paced, but usually you work as an overall team to complete the many tasked required for your job code. The management usually works independent from each other and the team rarely has enough people to complete the tasks at hand, but it is not a bad place for a starting job."
good,"Overall the company is good to work for. But, it depends on what department you work in. Depends on the level of your manager and if they are willing to grow you or not."
good,"So far far i really enjoy working at Walmart. The people are great to work with, everyone is friendly. There are many career advancement opportunities. They help with school and have quarterly bonuses."
good,I enjoyed working for walmart.They gave me skills that I needed for other opportunities.They taught me how to communicate better and I also learned the value of true sales
good,Awesome work environment with management that really cares about their employees. You often get raises as long as you pass your quarterly assessment. Great benefits and great pay.
good,every day your greeted by many ppl smiles . I loved being a janitor it was challenging and medium pace most the time . A lot of  work to do everyday not a dole moment .
good,Job changes daily.always knew who was getting promoted before it happened.Hardest part of job was seeing management not being consistance with all asc
good,"I just don’t want to work here anymore. This job provides benefits, but Walmart will not move me from my position to inside the building until they can replace my position. I would stay longer but I just don’t like working on that parking lot. People will race to see if they can pass you, no turning signals, and people constantly keep nearly hitting me with there car. In all I just don’t feel safe there"
good,"Good big company chain to work with, fair treatment, good management, internal safety, flexible hours, company discounts for shopping at Walmart stores,"
good,"Trabajo tranquilo ,con buena paga con posibilidad de crecimiento laboral"
good,I am satisfied for the time I was at Walmart. It helped as a second job for the summer. The hours weren't always what I asked for. they were somewhat flexible.
good,I worked back in lawn and garden as a cashier and with all the long line of customers and no one to help me as a cashier it was Horrible..i wouldnt refer anyone to work at Walmart..
good,existe una buena relación entre todas las áreas laborales y puedes crecer dentro de la empresa si te lo propone
good,was a good job but i was promised advancement in my career multiple times and never was promoted. graduated college and left to make a living for my new home and first born child.
good,Grande experiência adquirida na área de hipermercados e principalmente na função para a qual fui designado que era de auxiliar administrativo com forte ênfase no auxilio da auditoria desta empresa.
good,"Depending on the area and state, Walmart has opportunities for those that work hard to earn it. If wanting to move up in the company, it is possible but there's a lot to factor in. All in all, it is not a bad company to work for. Again, depending on area, city/state."
good,"Most of the time I took payments for purchases.  I would answer customer questions, help push shopping cart when needed, fill in for other people on breaks in other departments, zone areas of the store, and clean or straighten areas when there were no customers."
good,They gave me a full time schedule even though o was considered part time. Overall nice company with nice employees. Sometimes the job was stressful around holidays like any other job.
good,"A typical day for me is I go to the apparel department. I checked out my department fix any messes that are on the tables or on the racks. I then go to the backroom and get my freight for the day. I work my freight into the department."
good,I loved working here until my store became an academy store. After that it became very stressful. Overall it was awesome! I wish I had continued to work there.
good,wallmart has its own set of rules and regulations if you abide by them you will be fine. the best beniffit was the discount . it saved me a couple oof hundred of dollars the short time I worked there. as far as management ic could be a lot better
good,would have been better if there was a few less mgr telling you to do differant things all the time to many bosses and workers was aloud to do what ever they wanted and stand around and ignore customers and never got wrote up if they would start firring a few to send a mesg to the mass would have been a great place to work would still be with them
good,its an ok place to work for. but theres no commutation from management to the empolyees. I don't know what else too say.  but In my point of view I really didn't like working there.
good,I loved helping customers although this could be stressful at times. I learned the store lay out so I could better assist customers find their products.
good,Working at Walmart was a very fun experience.Just meeting new people and be able to come together and work as a team because together everyone accomplish more
good,"First, we would start in the back of the house, we would unload our Walmart truck that had been dropped off for the day to be emptied. Once that was finished which actually took on average a day 2 hours because of the number of items on the truck but varied each day. But once that was completed we would take what was unloaded to the front of the house to be stocked on front house shelves to be sold to customers."
good,"Walmart can be a fun place to work. My coworkers were always willing to help. Sometimes it can be a happy, out going environment. I enjoy working there because of these reasons. If someone I knew was in need of a job I would definitely recommend Walmart to them."
good,good job pay is not all there and bi-weekly pay check makes a second job almost necessary. hour lunch break makes it a little better than most places.
good,I am a studios hard working person as well as having the ability to strive for excellence and work with integrity. by any means necessary at all times I'm focused on my work ethic and maintaining a well designed criteria.
good,Great place to work at as long as you have opportunities and a hard working management team. Team work sometimes has to be enforced and rules should be heavily enforced in some stores. Associates should be hired very carefully.
good,Wasn't a bad place to work. Just as long as you do your job you don't have nothing to worry about. Management isn't to bad they do have there favorites.
good,Often in this job you are the first person an upset customer goes to. Most of the time you have to just sit there and take the verbal abuse but aside from that the job is rather fun and fast pace.
good,"the job was ok. it got a little rough around christmas time but what do you expect, its walmart. i don't have any complaints about the job. i didn't make enough to support my family so i found employment elsewhere."
good,Enjoyed working with fellow employees and management. Always had work to do. Never boring and got excellent benefits and discounts on purchases. Really liked working here.
good,"The workplace was very relaxed but stressfull to an extent with well working employees with management being very strict to a certain limit, hard working busy days with some benefits"
good,you can get quarterly bonus and have special regonition parties.have tv in lounge and free coffee.i was there 26 years and learned alot and meet alot of nice people
good,Okay job lacking in management and leadership. Trying to resolve working duties with supervisors and managers didn't get anywhere left job because of this! It's under new management now so may have changed !?
good,This job consisdted more than stocking we also unloaded the truck . Everyone really helped everyone but also still had our own departments in the store.
good,Es buena pero no muy estable. Los pagos se retrasan.
good,Not every day was easy but helping patients in the pharmacy was very rewarding and made it worth any bad day that was had. I learned a lot from here and really can't complain.
good,"Every job has its ups and downs"
good,"I enjoyed working there.They are very kind and friendly. Doesn't have a good grip around management over one another. Great environment to work in, on the otherhand."
good,"A lot of great coworkers through my time there. Management is a mixture of really good and really bad, I feel like they push the wrong individuals into management at time. The bad ones are sorely lacking any kind of leadership or team building skills and seem to be there just because they wanted a raise."
good,"Very busy work environment, every day is different. Employees are great and the majority of customers are too. There’s always something to do never a dull moment. Management could be at times useless and inconsistent but overall experience is a 7."
good,"HAD FUN WORKING THEIR AND LEARNING NEW SKILLS."
good,Making sure customers put all their purchases thru the scanner and when they didn’t at times they would get confrontational.  Management for my department was very professional...you could feel the stress however from the upper level management
good,"here you go. honest review"
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Walmart, it was a somewhat a good job the time that I was there. Management was not always helpful. Above all the pay was great and also the 10%discount card came in handy whenever shopping."
good,Typical day is not enough employees scheduled. Management doesn't seem to want to assist you if needed in an emergency. Hardest part of job is management not getting enough employees scheduled to keep the customers happy.
good,"Scanning bins, stocking freight, top stock. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done, and the most enjoyment part of the job is my team."
good,Never hard finding something to do most tasks fairly simple and straightforward and an overall enjoyable job for the most part but lack of communication makes it difficult for all things to be accomplished
good,"walk around, catch people stealing, blend in, talk with customers and interact with employees, walk the outside and make sure its secure and then walk the inside again."
good,"On a regular day, I count registers to look for shortages as well as lead our cashiers to have a successful shift. I help our customers with whatever questions they might have, or any trouble they are in. I see many opportunities in which we can improve as a whole but its hard implementing those new ways of working when not everyone is on the same page, slowly but surely. I handle sums of money, either giving them to our cashiers or to even deposit into our machine. I'm very pleased with the benefits the company has to offer from 401k matching to discounts for different businesses, to even online schooling."
good,"The pay was really good, but the company struggled to give everyone the hours they were needing. Some of the customer service managers weren't good leader while others were excellent. Most of the department managers were really easy to get along with and were passionate about their jobs."
good,"If you have never worked before or have little experience Walmart is a good place to go, the pay you get for the experience required is really good but you won't have a set schedule more than likely, and at times you can get overrun by customers and it can be really stressful. If you think you can work with that, then it's worth a look."
good,It was a nice job very slow but bissy. Always feeler with customers who always need something. The best part to me is go backs it help u learned the store and each part.
good,i learned that not every job is going to feel like slave labor. This job made me feel more appreciated and less forced into max speed like other jobs have and it made me feel better about working for them and doing a good job.
good,"Enjoyed working here it is fun,fast paced, and a good learning experience. managers could have better attitudes and training. Over all great workplace."
good,It was Average experience working at Walmart over all I enjoy it. As time passed I found myself less and less happy with the place I worked at and I realized that I had no future at Walmart.
good,"Most days were about the same as every day. I learned how to deal with food stamps, credit card, checks, and even gift card. There was always sales going on not only in our store but we price matched so we needed to be aware of those sales as well. At times is was hard to get a mangers attention due to other cashiers needs. However they were quick to help or fix what needed  to be done. The hardest part would be the standing in one place for long periods of time. I loved the fact you never knew what the next person what going to bring to your day"
good,"The interview process was quick and simple. Looking back, I wonder if the process is too simple and needs a few more questions or tests involved, to weed out those ""seeking only a paycheck""."
good,I worked here for a few years with the intent of finding a career in  some time. Ended up here for 4 years and I knew if I got to 5 I would never get out. This place is good as a part time or between jobs. I do not think this is a good place to make a life long career but I have seen it done. The hours were crazy but manageable at the time until I had a child then it became an issue.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo aunque en ocasiones te obligan a quedarte más tiempo y no te lo pagan como tiempo extra.
good,"Good place to work, and expect to work your tail off. It's a fast pace environment so you can't take any time to sit and just talk to co workers even for 5 min."
good,When I was let go from Walmart I was told that I was going to be on the rehire list and it's been months since I was let go and I've been struggling to find a job I love working at Walmart and I would like to work there again but I'm having a hard time getting back in the door what is it that I have to do to get my job back since they did say I am on the rehire list?
good,"Its a good company for someone to start to gain experience, not enough money for the job. however you will gain cash handling and customer service experience"
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and employees.It was very fast paced everyday.There  was always a head cashier around to help when needed.I learned how to deal with a unhappy customer.
good,"You don't need work experience. Learned how to be a chaser the management is bad, the workplace is not smooth they also have a trainer that will work with you."
good,"Very busy in bakery area. Learned about donuts, how to make and package. Hardest part was trying to learn new system. Met and worked with some great people."
good,"Productive, great job. Great learning experience. Good work environment. Great co - workers, nice team atmosphere . Great customer service. Friendly customers."
good,"great customer service policies"
good,"Working for Wal-Mart was eventful. Always something to do and although we had a routine, we didn't always do the same things everyday. Overall good co workers, decent pay, and benefits."
good,This company is a great place to start or work while you are going to school. Due to being open 24 hrs. it is very easily to work with school hours. Only downfall are rude customers.
good,"My duties include restock produce on sales floor, stock and arrange back cooler, clean work space and counting old food. I interacted with customers regularly. "
good,working here was fun at times and also stressful. your day really is what you make it working in that place. the managers and supervisor and sit and around and gossip so don't ever go to them for help.
good,"La personas que trabajan son muy buenas, hay competencia como en todas partes, solo hay que saber manejarse y manejar a las personas. Recursos humanos son de lo mejor, comprensivos. Los jefes inmediatos son algo pesados (en especial si trabajar en caja), pero todo es comprensible debido al flujo de personas que hay en las tiendas."
good,"Walmart use to be a great place to work, I loved it! Now we hardly ever see mangers, always needing help, in my position I get all the complaints and half are about management not being there to answer questions."
good,"Working for Walmart can be a a fun and fast paced environment. The store is certainly a retail giant, but there are some times when the pressure can be high."
good,"The people was very nice to work with, I learned a lot there. The people I worked with were oh so helpful, my days were--check in, get my vest on-and go to my register start to work."
good,"A very accommodating workplace for people who have physical or mental health limitations. They create a safe and inviting opportunity for associates to advance no matter their age, sex, gender, and sexual orientation."
good,"Some managers are great, some are not. just like any other job. has its pros and cons. just from my experience, just do you and do not focus on others."
good,"Tive a oportunidade de aprender de tudo no setor de tesouraria, que foi onde me identifiquei e por isso tenho interesse em fazer Gestão financeira."
good,fast paced all ways changing with the times If one team falls behind on process then the next team picks up where they left off and they have to try to complete their tasks so the next team can start where they are suppose  to start
good,"Stressful. Fast paced. Constantly changing. Never had enough help on each shift to get the work done, therefore making it harder on the area supervisor. So they had to make sure freight was worked, binned, outs were ordered,  features were seasonally correct, helped on the registers when needed, be available to help customers,  do paperwork and the list goes on."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart the work environment is great the workers have wonderful attitudes for the most part and they definitely believe in team work. "
good,"It's a job that pays the bills. Barely surviving. Annoying that this company are always changing jobs, attendances, dress codes, management, etc. If you're single, not married, and no kids, then Overnight is perfect. More quiet, less customers to shop, and get more job done."
good,"Walmart distribution centers are a great place to gain supply chain experience and a typical day may consist of many things.  Receiving, shipping, orderfilling, or administrative functions are some to name a few."
good,I loved my job some times u don’t get wat you want but that’s life.love a lot of people there and management was pretty cool as well.i will love to go back
good,"Buena, oportunidad de crecimiento y desarrollo"
good,Its a good job its like any other place of employment you work hard you get far. Attendance is the key with any job you receive. Must be a people person and willing to go above and beyond.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. Other then my manager he was a very mean guy who didn't care about his employees or anyone but himself it seemed. But it's a fun job
good,"This job was decent, "
good,Walmart isn’t a bad place to work it’ll get you to where you need to be but they train you little to none here majority everything you learn is self taught.
good,Not really a set job . Hours are all over the place. You never have a set schedule.  One week you get 30 hours the. Ext its 29. People try to fight you over the lines being long or the prices not what they said on the shelf
good,Walmart is a fast  Pace place it has good benefits if you’re hard on and not through a temp agency. Even though you go to a temp agency they do compensated very well. The only thing about it is it’s a temporary job so it only last 3 to 4 months until the holidays are over. What I’ve learned at Walmart the time I did work there was always have a back up plan because you never know when It’s time for you to move again. The job is very enjoyable you’re just not secured a position.
good,"Walmart is a great place to learn new things, and meet new people. Walmart associates quickly become like a second family. Customers will smile and are friendly if the associates smile, greet them and thank them."
good,"Busy,non stop customer service,making sure we had adequate staffing for the deli,bakery,meat dept,dairy,could be challenging at times. Support manager,supported associates,and upper management,stocking,setting up displays for selling products, Had to be very good with time management due to the list of tasks that needed to be completed daily. Best part of the job,helping customers,working 4 10 hour days. Hardest part,working so hard ,no advancement."
good,"Worked in a warehouse environment. Had a set time that you had to get each order done in. However, they were nice and your qquota was based upon your average for the week."
good,"Good first job for people "
good,Management expects you to work above and beyond. Advancement is available. Like to promote from within. Employees treat each other with respect. Lots of long term workers.
good,Management was good to employees; had good hours; was asked ahead of time if  I could work ovetime if they needed the help; fair to their employees; management always listening to customers as well as customers
good,I was able to get work done competently and quickly and was given constructive input by my piers and those above me as to better fit their needs. The work environment was great and allowed me to exit to get lunch or a snack or take breaks as needed or desired.
good,I thought that job had a friendly environment it was nice. I thought that the breaks were super short and some times the customers were extremely rude.
good,"it's a good store , to shop and buy all your goodies . Wal-Mart is a big store where you can shop for food , clothes , and even gardening stuff you might need ."
good,Its nice company to work  is not benefict right now have a great pays but is not easy to hire person they have polocy no race they did some a I  person  I get any person a need oportunity to work more if have experience if that only me they happen to another person they have more experience like me is not just
good,I really enjoyed my position with this company. I was able to see people from all walks of life. fast paced enough to keep ya busy so you wasn't bored
good,"I liked working at Walmart. With the hours and the people, every day was different from the last. I had learned how to multitask different departments when fellow associates needed their area covered. I learned how to pierce ears, and set up lay-a-ways for jewelry."
good,"they told me when i was hired that advancmet was something they were big on, but thats simply not true. the store manager cut everyoes hours to make her bonus bigger, everyone who worked there at the time was very unhappy"
good,"Working with retail you expect to deal with the public on many levels.  Work is ""what you make it"".  I enjoyed my work.  You have to enjoy working/serving the public."
good,"The salary and incentives for salaried management are the best in the field.  However, the salaried management life with Walmart is not conducive to a functional home life.  In addition, there is much added to stress due to overall lack of job security."
good,"Fast paced busy store in the college town of Laramie,  WY. High turn over rate due to kids finishing college and moving off. Flexible shifts available."
good,"My co-workers were the best part while Management generally fell short. The Store manager would not take the time to learn the issues going on within her store, Nor did she seem to care when they were brought to her attention."
good,"i was literally in almost every department, was a back up support manager, customer service manager, cashier, sales floor associate, overnight stocker"
good,Flexible schedules. Theres always dvancement opportunities. Excellent training. Customers come first. Further Education opportunities. Some benefits packages.
good,At Walmart you’ll be able to find a department that best fits your skills and helps you to get comfortable with helping customers and keeping the establishment organized and properly stocked.
good,fast pace and different everyday. some days are more stressful then others but the pay makes its worth it. plus the schedules arnt bad either. they could use more fans
good,Good work place. Steady paced and always stayed busy. Good work environment and fun co workers. I was just tired of 3rd shift and wanted change. Medical issues also came into play with leaving
good,I mean it’s an ok job . Some people like it some don’t . You must have an great attitude to be an cashier and deal with customers . Hours and salary are good .
good,I learned how to keep a store clean in a timely manner.  I kept the break rooms and bathrooms clean at all times.  Made sure all trash containers were emptied in the store and out in the parking lot.
good,"Working at Walmart wasn't the worst. The hours were good, the pay was fair, and the people were pleasant enough. It was nothing compared to working at Papa John's though. That was a nightmare and a half."
good,"This job was fun at first but they expect you to be able to do 10 people's jobs at once. While I met a lot of fun people and had SOME good management, the rest was not great."
good,"overall the job is pretty good, just a lot of work for the pay. Management is kind of a issue. Most people quit due to mot getting along with the staff"
good,Empresa Boa se trabalhar fiquei 19 anos na empresa e tudo que aprendi fui no Walmart. De operador de caixa a diretor de loja.
good,I started at WalMart in the pharmacy when I was sixteen and it was a great job for to get me started on my journey to healthcare.  It allowed me to learn the different aspects of retail pharmacy and lead me to explore acute care.  I enjoyed my eight years employeed at WalMart
good,I liked the work and the employees I worked with and the customers were friendly. I would say the management was ok and easy to get along with. My supervisor was a good person to work with.
good,"I met some good friends at Wal-Mart. Even though it seemed as though the work was hard, we all worked together to make it as fun as possible. We opened up the store on 145th street and it was VERY busy for a while."
good,"Although the pay is decent, the balance of working an average 50 hour work week can be difficult. Many times lower management is expected to work extra hours when there is a problem, but no overtime is offered to the hourly associates who would be best suited to work the problem."
good,"Wal-Mart values diversity. Pay wages have recently increased, and benefits have always been affordable, as well as competitive. I enjoy interacting with customers and associates daily."
good,Being friendly to the mean customers was the hardest part of the job. Management expected you to work fast paced and didn't really care about the customers.
good,i have a very fast paced job at Walmart. i deal with checking in vendors and checking in various trucks. i unload the UPS and Fedex trucks at my store.
good,"Typical days are spent doing busy work mostly.  I did learn a lot and improved a lot of skills including people skills.  I gained a lot of knowledge.  Management is hit or miss.  You really are at the mercy of the store manager and every store manager is different.  Their isn't necessarily a Walmart culture, but more of a culture your store manager wants (not always a good thing).  Hardest parts are rude customers and there are too many chiefs and not enough indians.  However you do meet a lot of people.  I made a lot of good friends there and you can definitely feel like part of a team.  You just have to find the right store and right conditions."
good,My review of Walmart is this during my time at Walmart my work ethic was great my working was great my supervisor was great I learned a lot I was promoted fairly and quickly But I was let go because of violating the state policy of breaks and lunches  I was caught in catch 22 situation  I was working during a major sale and could not find an associate to take my place for me to go to lunch
good,I was a good workplace to learn skills and have a retail experience in my background. I was really nice to serve and interact with different customers.
good,"Wonderful work environment. "
good,"Can be busy and stressful at times , little bit of down time."
good,Its okay at times jus hard to get along with certain accociates and can be stressful. 40 hours gaurenteed in the area i work per week and pto is given
good,Is a place where if the person proposing to work can have a stability and a good position.  Managers highlight the way each employee works. You work as a team so that way all the work is completed.
good,"I am not comfortable sharing too nuch information. There are very good people that work there but it is very hard to promote or grow within the company,"
good,A typical day was rather busy which I prefer.There was always opportunity for advancement if you chose to do so. I really enjoyed my co-workers and the customers.
good,very low salary. but it is nice to work with other staff. not enough staff to work in evening and so sometimes we are very loaded at work. store manager is not approachable to the staff that has a lower position
good,"Enjoy working with others, and providing a service to kept the customers satisfied when the products are available when needed. I like the location , near where I lived."
good,"The worst part about working for Walmart can all be summed up in one word ""Management"" if you have a great Management Team all will be great. Other than that I met lots of great people and learned a lot."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with. Everyone was very laid back and loved doing what they did. There was room to advance as well to a CSM and I would have been one had I had not left for college.
good,Walmart was very stressful and A LOT of drama. Had a lot of problems and miscommunications with management. Other employees would slack off and everyone be punished for it.
good,It was the best job I’ve had so far i don’t work there anymore i lived working the cashier it was my favorite part all the workers was great and so where the customers
good,"loved it, and the customers work day goes by fast. plenty chance for advancement.  benefits are good,they offer educational advancements at wal mart its not just a job"
good,"On a typical working day at Walmart it’s vey busy. It’s never enough associates to perform daily work duties. The scheduling system is terrible . It’s not consistent hours being schedule, you will have some ok days. It’s just a overall overwhelming work place."
good,"Worked here while in college, worked with school schedule and gave me more hours on the weekends. Pay was ok for the job. Coworkers were mostly other college students, made it fun. Managers were mostly good. Sometimes had to deal with rude customers."
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking, cooking and washing floors. Management could be a little more inclusive of some of the departments. The best part of the job is the very kind co-workers I have."
good,"Walmart is what you make it. If you work hard, that is all they are asking for. Advancement sometimes depends on management, but i have also seen where hard work does pay off."
good,job could be as hard or as difficult as you made it be. can deal with difficult customers but you choose how the interaction ends up with your attitude and responses.
good,Working overnights as a stocker can be very exciting. You can stock just about anything in the store. The harder you work the more roles you will fill.
good,The people I worked with at Walmart were kind and helpful. They never minded helping out if ever needed. You are told when you are doing a good job and when you need to improve things which is important to me when having a job.
good,Loved working at Walmart the managers was just not very reasonable. The pay was great the hours were reasonable I just had to find something other than a 3rd shift job for the time being it was way to much stress on my body.
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. But the store manager was the rudest person that I have ever had to deal with. She talk to everyone like they were dumb.
good,"Basically a good job "
good,Walmart company in a whole is great but the managers and structure of everyday job is stressful. The best part about m job is when i'm going home. The managers do not work well with the associates. its a lack of respect and more like boss instead of a leader.
good,I would recommend anyone who is looking for a great career should definitely apply to Walmart great culture to work the manager are very driven to get ppl promoted and help.
good,Overall Good company. Working for Wal-Mart has afford an opportunity to work for a world class company. In addition I would recommend Wal-Mart as a great company to start with.
good,"Self work. There usually isnt a need for help but if you do need it, there will always be someone willing. This is a do it for yourself type job that pays off."
good,This job is very fast paced and fun. The managers can use some team work but other than that the workers are very helpful. Work hours are consistent and pay is very good!
good,"At times it was hard to be a cashier just because of customers that would come through your line in a hurry and they would get upset if the cashier wasnt moving fast enough. I learned that if you keep a positive attitude and smile, that it will also make that customer smile even if they dont want too."
good,It was a pretty good place to work some times it did get hectic during holidays. If you learned how to manage your time you will definitely be able to handle it.
good,"-spend a lot of time on your knees, lifting and stocking. not much time to talk to people"
good,"They send you home when system and work slows down, but they don't fire you out, unless you did something wrong."
good,"Walmart was overall a great job, learned a lot of new things there and also got a chance to venture off into another department which is really helpful because that’s what I’m in school for."
good,I do not have anything negative to say about Walmart. Everyone will have their own opinions on the environment. I would return if i had to. Go Walmart.
good,Walmart has policies in place to help keep APA's safe will minimizing loss to the company.  Good company to work for if looking into getting into asset protection.
good,Quick-paced job that requires a lot of customer assistance. The best job you could look for if you love to help people. You could probably get a promotion in under a few months depending on your work.
good,"I had an ok time working for Walmart. Management and help could be better and more help, but our pay was pretty decent and you can request over time if more help is needed"
good,Only worked here for a  year but throughout my term with wal-mart I did enjoy it with fun co-workers. I only did part-time. Great place to work for students.
good,"Working at Walmart is really busy also a fast pace job "
good,As a salaried manager this job is demanding and consumes a lot of energy to do your job. dealing with customers and associates is the most demanding part. I walk anywhere from 15 to 20 miles a day. that doesn't include all the lifting and moving I do on a daily basis.
good,"I'm a satisfied worker at Wal Mart, I'm thankful for a job with the current job situation.  The employment hirings have escalated somewhat during the past months.  I'm just interested in changing, that it, a change.  Nothing bad to say about my employer, they have been very fair, and good to me."
good,It was a good job. The workload was always heavy so you always had a lot to do when you came into work. Its also a job that you would be able to advance into the career as long as your a strong motivated worker.
good,"the distribution center is very high-paced and slightly competitive, with the goal of moving product from warehouse to store level. Good job and benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart and found it to be a great experience.  The environment challenged associates to work to the best of their ability. Overall, I enjoyed my time there."
good,"For a job it wasn't that bad overall. There was some moments where you had a breakdown and cry moment, but that's just retail. I loved the people I worked with. Some of the customers were actually nice. Other customers' missions were to make your life awful. But I think it also depends on the area that your store is in."
good,To start the morning we would make sure everything is clean and presentable for early morning customers. Most days we stocked merchandise and help customers with any questions and checkout process. The hardest part of the job would be when we couldn't find a product in inventory even though the computer system registered it. The best part of working at Wal-Mart was working with all the amazing people and getting to learn new departments and other work procedures.
good,Empresa perfecta para iniciar en el campo laboral.
good,"Working at walmart for me was a last minute decision. Although working there paid the bills, management is all over the place. I got full time there but every day I was being told how to do my job differently."
good,i loved working there untill they switched managers on my department she was always rude and had me working different departments and i would get in trouble by the main boss for leaving my area or work for following managers order. I decided to leave when i was left alone 3 departments to myself manger told me i either swim or sink they would call me on and on in intercom because i speak spanish so i was back and fourth to different departments and hardly in the department that i was hired for
good,"to many videos and not enough hands on and to tight on the time clock Not enough ""team Players"" and working together lot of time the shift was only me for up to 3 to 4 hours with such huge store but I love the challenge thanks"
good,First job that called and I took and kept it until left the area. It was okay people were respectful for the most part. Worked under questionable conditions but it was what it was.
good,"my time at Walmart was educational, now i know how and where to look for better deals and better quality of food, the job kept me and my co workers on our toes furthermore it was good work."
good,typical day was to attend store meeting getting assignments.  Pulling out freight to stock onto shelves any overages in stock required labeling and taken to the back to be put away.
good,"It was a nice slow pace and you got a long enough break so you didn't have to rush eating your food."
good,"Worked as stocking clerk,Worked with power pallet jack and manual pallet jacks. Worked with inventory management equipment. Assisted in the ordering and maintaining of store fright."
good,"When I first started working there they treated me like family and helped me so much to get trained to take my test. I'm grateful for what they did for me. It had the best people to work with. I haven't worked there in 15 years so I don't really know how it is now but when I did, I loved it. Just didn't care for the hours I had to work for being the new person but that is how it is. Its the only reason why I left."
good,Wal mart isn't the best place to work but when you start helping a customer it makes you feel good so you keep going to make more people happy there is a lot to learn at wal mart. But thats the fun part you can switch jobs
good,This place was fun to work at most of the time. People were great and friendly. Enjoyed serving people most of the time. Some of the customers were rude but most were nice. Staff would help when needed. Atmosphere was nice especially at Holidays. Much merriment.
good,"I contracted with InSite/Color Point (a greenhouse supplier for Walmart's garden center) through a temp agency, so I was not technically an employee of Walmart. Hours were flexible and the work was physical-- mostly moving plants-- but low-stress and management was easy to work with. I would have worked with them longer if they let me, but it's seasonal work. The work is mostly outdoors and often hot, but I didn't mind that much."
good,The place wasnt bad but one rude manager did make the job harder than i had to be. Most of the managers are willing to work with you to help you find the best schedule for you.
good,Walmart has its issues management picks favorites and promotes them and will coach u over every little thing such as apparently leaving a Empty box in ur dept it not a fair job the only reason people stay is because of the pay and the benefits
good,"Walmart was a fast paced job. At Walmart stuffed changed so often it was kind of hard to get used to everything. All management wanted people to meet certain times with stocking, but that wasn’t an easy task if you kept getting put in different areas of the store to stock. Overall, Walmart is a good paying job."
good,As Department manager in shoes it was a store within a store. I had two employees that I supervised.Great ladies! Learned what I needed to on my own at the time the store management was in flux so we were left a little high and dry. Hardest part was being stretched thin when I had to cover more than one department.
good,"La oportunidad fue agradable y pude ejercer mi labor de la mejor manera y ya mi renuncia fue por crecimiento,  gracias a que ejercía mi trabajo de la mejor manera ."
good,Always having something to do helping others finishing our jobb on time doing was its told to do getting to work on time no calling in count everything fast
good,"Great company, well rounded and provides many avenues for job choices. Need to streamline job placement for incoming and current workers to find the ideal job."
good,"Been with Wal-Mart for over two years, only just now deciding to look for employment elsewhere because of recent and unsettling changes made by the company and lack of chances to move up(promote)"
good,Taught me how to deal with different people also good with customer service and learning how to deal with situations in a different way and keeping a low profile
good,Walmart is a great place to work. Managers treat you like a friend and you meet new people and make new friends. You move up fast kn the company if your dedicated.
good,"This job is a good place to start, with the ability to advance to management if you wish. Not much  more that I can say about walmart. Its just a good place to start"
good,Wal-Mart is a big company. They take care of there employees to the best of there ability. You get Christmas off its the only day of the year there closed. Not only do you get a gift card after your first 90 days but your spouse can also get one if you prefer and you fill out all and any of the forms to do so. I would recommend working here to anyone. One big family is how it feels to work for Wal-Mart.
good,"Overall a good company.  :lots of changes made in the last few years.  Culture is not very strong anymore. hopefully, they will get themselves back on track"
good,"Walmart did not fulfill agreed upon working hours, at the time starting a family did not fit into their schedule or work hours.  But enjoyed the people and the environment."
good,It was good just not enough hours not dependable. But over all great job for students. To many turn overs. Not enough hours per department and a lot of help needed in departments lack of people
good,Walmart is a excellent job to have if your willing to move up and have open availability! Becoming efficient and working to your best ability is always a plus.
good,Interesting to work with customers and staff from other cultures; working different positions gave me the opportunity to lean more; received discounts on product purchased at Walmart
good,"I found Walmart to be a decent place to work. The pay was good, and the managers were understanding. I could recommended it to teens who are looking for a job that pays well."
good,"Wasn't fun, but the Seabrook branch had a lot of fum people and I enjoyed some of the tasks. Not too demanding, but also as retail is soul-sucking, could use some upgrades."
good,"New applications, ideas and jobs are great but not when others have to consistently work in other areas to achieve goals. Make a plan and give it the attention it needs to thrive."
good,I found it to be stressful at times but that is with any job when working with the public. I loved working service desk helping people resolve issues .
good,Great experience that gives room for opportunity in the future. Work with amazing people in  great environment. Enjoyable occupation with valuable life skills.
good,"I would recommend working here if you enjoy having to explain yourself several different times to several different people. I was fired from this job for taking time off for maternity leave, because my supervisors and the managers did not communicate. I was still being put on the schedule, even though one of the managers knew i was off for maternity leave. The other manager saw that i was skipping my shifts, and therefor fired me. If the two would have just communicated, then this problem probably wouldn't have happened. Other than that, working here isn't that bad. Its very slow and boring at times, but also very fast paced and stressful at other times."
good,"Enjoy coming to work, doing my job effectly and going home. The environment was positive. The staff was young. The experience of the other employees made work go fast but they kept a lot of extra stuff going."
good,"This job was only temporary, I was working and going t school full-time. The manager worked with my schedule so i could do both. Over all, this job helped me pay bills and finish school."
good,"Being a full time student with club activities made working at walmart difficult. When I had to take a couple of days off due to school activities, they were made up without having a day off and working till late which made completing assignments and studying difficult."
good,"I started as a cashier and within a week was asked to interview for department manager and customer service manager. Due to my school schedule I decided on the CSM position. The company encouraged me to continue advancing. However, due to the salary, hours, and the fact that I had completed my associate's degree I decided to move on."
good,Muy. Buena empresa divertido trabajo y desiplinado
good,"-Very relaxed/fast pace"
good,"While working at Walmart, I felt the company took care of their employees across the board.  The compensation and benefits for pharmacists were excellent."
good,"Decent place to work, good pay, a lot of overtime, good benefits and some opportunity for advancement.  Probably would have worked here longer but the commute was too long."
good,"fun place to work, it can be fast paced at times. Fun people to be around. Sometimes it can be stressful if the wrong manager is present, but all around fun job!"
good,Some managers were great others didn't listen. Mostly they did listen to the people that knew what they were talking about and asked question if they didn't. Had a great crew to work with for the most part. Had 1 or 2 that were difficult (personal issues with those around them) but that'a the case with most jobs.
good,Every holiday was a stress test that pushed each associate to their tolerances.  otherwise on lighter volume period of times the ability to relax made the job pretty decent.
good,The management  was ok but I enjoyed work for Wal-Mart and it was a good place to work  I love the pay and the people that I worked with and the customer
good,"I do like working at Wal-Mart, but I don't care for the hours that they schedule. Working a 5 or 5 1/2 hour day with only a 15 minute break is very hard on a cashier."
good,The job is pretty easy overall if your not lazy. Although it was part time I felt like I had no personal time to do stuff on the weekends. Getting time off was hard.
good,"In this company you will be able to move up thru the ranks, but it can be slow process. it is based off of senority for the most part and is curved if you know people."
good,"It is a good place to work.  People are great.  Management expects too much.  Switched to maintenance for more hours but they didn't have a pair of rubber gloves that fit without ripping down the sides.  I was told I needed to figure it out. I put one pair on top of another, they ripped anyways.  I looked on the store shelves but they had only xl and I needed 2xl.  I told them what was going on and they said to make do with what I had.   I walked out because it was not my responsibility to find gloves for myself and I was not cleaning public toilets without them."
good,"Constantly on your feet competing with coworkers unloading trucks, sorting on ballets and stocking the items on shelves.  Playing your own music in the backroom is allowed to get everyone in the groove and motivated. well as long as its not dirty.   I find it fun and challenging."
good,I enjoyed working with customers and other employees at Walmart.Job duties were cleaning front entrance greeting customers and helping customers find what they are looking for at Walmart.
good,Working here was a enjoyable experience. There was a lot to learn. Management was helpful and friendly. Each day I was able to learn a bit more in a different department.
good,7.5 llegas q ser multifuncional auq tu contrato diga otra cosa.
good,"I’m a cashier at walmart and I honestly don’t like it,they’re always pressing on us selling credit cards but most of the time these customers don’t want another credit card,yeah you get a few people who are willing to get one but other than that nobody wants one so i don’t really ask as much as i should.Another thing is them not having enough people on schedule during a certain period of time especially in the evening. Another thing is they don’t give you weekends off,most of the time you have to request them off . Last thing is I hate hate hate hate the smoke shop, walmart needs to take it outta their stores the amount of times i’ve been yelled at for us not having certain kinds of marlboro, it’s nerve racking,and csm’s love to put you on it after your last break and then have no one to take your place is the worst. Overall Walmart does pay pretty good especially if you work a decent amount of hours. HOWEVER, their scheduling system is awful they’ll have someone who is part time(me) working full time hours."
good,"Getting hours for part time is not difficult, and you are in control of your availability. You get a bonus quarterly from the My Share, which is a great bonus, but you can not make a good living off of the pay for part time. However, management does play favorites, not matter how long you have been there or how hard you have worked. There is no vacation or sick days, and having to leave for more than 3 days due to an illness is very difficult, and you don't get paid during that time."
good,Overall I loved working at Wal-Mart.I always got to see new faces everyday.My co-workers were always friendly and helpful.THANKFUL FOR THAT EXPERIENCE
good,It was a great opportunity to work at Wal Mart. I had an exceptional time working for this type of work. I would definitely recommend to others.  I absolutely loved working with the other staff. They made me feel so welcome when I first started this job.
good,"I learned a lot working here, I love the fact that I was trained for a week before actually working in the pharmacy. The staff that trained me were very patient and nice and I miss working there"
good,"excellent job to get overtime at, while staying productive the entire shift. excellent break times and scheduling  times. great management and staff to work with."
good,I feel like Walmart could pay more money with all of the money that they make. I liked the people I worked with and my supervisor but I could have used a higher pay rate.
good,it was a faced pace environment. it was a challenge and it was exactly what i was looking for in a job. i would love to work for them again if i ever had the chance.
good,Helping customers always in any way you can do for them. Fun place to work with and good relations with your co-worker. Good place and good management.
good,Good working environment with good trainers and easy to catch on.good workers and supervisor encourage you to be the best you can be.good way to advance your career
good,Manager always kept me late because people would call out for their shifts. I was in college and had early classes so it did not work for me. Manager tried to get me to sell alcohol to customer without an ID. I refused because I did not want to get in legal trouble. The manager got upset about it.
good,"A typical day for me in produce was showing up, putting my appron on and just getting the general vibe of everyone there and seeing what needed to be done whether it was working the wet wall stocking bananas or taking cardboard to the baler."
good,"On a daily I assist customers with their daily OTC medicines. Stocking the floor, inventory, unloading, ordering items that we're low on etc. When we have down time, we're on the registers checking customers out."
good,"It wasn't a horrible place to work. Some drama like anywhere else. Pay wasn't bad. Management at the time (different now) sucked. "
good,"I worked a couple different areas, if it was slow then I could work in other areas. Management was if you did your job and kept busy or asked if there was any thing that needed to be done in other areas. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help people, I enjoy helping others. A typical day at work was to pull bakery items for mark downs, get bread ready to bake, mark down items, bake bread, package, cut, mark and put bread on shelf, prep bread for next day, stock shelves and clean up."
good,"The position and coworkers were satisfactory --- "
good,"At my location, this is a fair company for which to work part-time.  It fills the need of extra income for basic customer service work.  I would recommend it as a supplemental source of income."
good,Walmart is a fun great place to work with people threw out the day it gives u a great chance to interact with people and gives u a chance to help others around u.
good,Everyday at work we clock in and go straight to work. we get our jobs done. we had to stock shelves collect carts from outside for customers. Stayed on task.
good,"Walmart was overall a good place to work, employees were friendly, management was friendly. Customers were nice. Grwat discounts and 401 k. No advancement though."
good,Great place to work for if you enjoy being employed by the largest retailer in the world. I am choosing to down size and work for a smaller one instead.
good,"I know everyone has their opinions on Walmart... however, that aside I loved working for this company and would love to work for them again. Yes they are knit picky about certain things but what company isn't these days."
good,For the time I was at Walmart I really enjoyed the workplace .the people were full of energy and ready to get the to work. It was a temp agency so I got paid every week.
good,Working here was great  They were accommodating and worked within your  schedule   Hours would fluctuate but was able to pick up extra shifts all the time
good,It was always fun to learn new things. And being a blue collared man indoor mind getting my hands dirty. Wal-Mart has provided and helped me to reach levels that were my dreams.
good,"Was extremely excited to get hired in until I actually started working there. Poor management in all areas of store. Weird scheduling, probation period is tough meaning 6 months and hard on you."
good,My job description was the service desk where returns were made. They have added many new features since I worked there. The management was open and considerate. I worked the evening shift since I went to school during the day thats one thing I'll say they support is education.
good,Being a cashier is pretty easy...the day normally flies by when your on the register and its a busy day....slower days they may send some people home early

good,"A typical workday includes shopping for customers and getting their orders ready. It also deals with any customer issues that come up, as well as helping other customers find something within the inventory. The hardest part of the job is setting up the orders to be dispensed. If it is not set up correctly you will experience almost 50% more of what you normally stress about."
good,A typical day at work would be me working about 10 hours a day and being off for 2 days. I have learned that you have to pay attention your fellow co workers and your surroundings. The management at this particular better than average management. The workplace was very quick-pace and you have to be quick in everything you did. One of the hardest part of the job would have to be that you had to be quick so you can load and unload trucks in a matter of time.

good,"Work is uneventful, but not stressful at all. I learned how to use a cash register and how to complete transactions. Management was very considerate. The most difficult part of the job has to be dealing with difficulties with items, such as problems scanning or pricing problems."
good,"Ive been working for Walmart for 2 years in the Automotive Service Area. I have extensive Automotive knowledge and have been promised moving into supervisors role on numerous occasions. As i am doing the job of my supervisor now. this has not happened and i keep being told that i need to be give it some time. Well times just about up. i have applied for different departments and have been over looked every single time. so as far as job growth HA-HA don't think so. "

good,"I really enjoyed being a cashier at Wal-Mart cause interacting with the public is fun. "
good,Wal-Mart is a fast pace company. They are very big on Attendance. If the job is done up to standards the employees can get a bonus. The company stress training.
good,Looking for a place to learn about retail then walmart WILL teach you that. Depends on which location you're stationed at the culture is OK and the work is easy but it's really hard to move up into management.
good,"If you can handle stress and difficult situations then you could be a CSM. But management is terrible. They don't know who to even respect the associates completely rude, unprofessional and lack role model leadership qualities."

good,As an Asset Protection Assistant Manager the roles and responsibilities recently expanded beyond the scope of typical Asset Protection work.  Tasks needing completed on any given day can vary widely and it is often hard to plan out your day. Overall there are good perks to working for the company. Generous amounts of paid time off are granted and it increases with tenure. Company match 401k up to 6% and decent health insurance.
good,"There is always opportunity for growth among Walmart stores.  You are not frowned upon for seeking new positions or even transfers to another store location.  Lead, Supervisory and Co-Manager positions are extremely competitive.  Payroll, benefits, holidays, overtime and vacations could use a major overhaul."
good,"Adorei aprender novo ofício, sobre NF, Logisitica."
good,I like learning new skills and being able to work where I'm needed. Walmart was able to give that to me. Everyone knows that Walmart has their pros and cons but it's the same thing you get almost everywhere you go.

good,"Loved the pace. Could always find something to do if you asked.  Management always seemed to want to catch employees doing wrong. "

good,"It has been years since I worked at this store, but they worked with my school schedule at the time to allow me to graduate college while earning experience."
good,"Fasted pacing job, learn customer services, closing is the hardest because your by yourself. Best part of the job is when the day is slowing down, which are the evenings."
good,This job was by far the best I had worked. Hours may have varied but the pay made it okay. I love the job. Interacting with new people everyday. Management was the best. They were on top of everything.
good,They give you 30min lunch which other pharmacy chains may not.  Customers were mostly friendly as well as coworkers.  There are always negative people wherever you go though.
good,"WalMart is a place where even with a large level of consistency, you can and will still find that the culture is location based. If you have no aspirations and this is only a job you can become really comfortable, but if you are looking for advancement you have to be in the right location to be given a ""fair chance"" at advancement."
good,"Loved meeting new people, friendly environment. Management was friendly. Only down side was the frequent late breaks and lunch. and not getting enough hours."
good,"Good shifts, when you get them. refuse to give more than 25 hours a week. the lunches were fair and gave you plenty of rest time. i would recommend this as a first job but not a long term plan."
good,"Fast paced, mutli tasking is required. You will need to be organized and pay really close to details. A lot of data entry and use of exel. Fun place to work at."
good,It is an income it is not a career choice. They will keep your busy you will make great friends and you will have some money but not nearly enough money to enjoy life.
good,I really enjoyed working the night shift without having to deal with customers directly.  It was awesome cause I wasn't stuck in just one section of the store.
good,It's an great job especially if you can see yourself moving up in Wal-Mart. The staff is amazing as ever. They're willing to work with you about anything.
good,"I learned a lot of people skills at Walmart; respect for the individual, team-work, Public-Speaking, Adaptability and time management. My Customer Service skills were also improve during my employment"
good,"i learned organizational skills, and how to move at a fast pace and to multi task in a stressful environment.  customer service skills and inventory accuracy."
good,Must be able to deal with customers on a regular badis. Should have good customer skills to work here. If not customer oriented this isnt for you. Meets great people
good,"Most of the time, since starting there, I was basically by myself. The assistant manager position was responsible for everything. Others working there were not held responsible."
good,"It Started at 4:00 AM till 1:00 PM."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of checking and filling outs, daily reports on inventory,  inventory maintenance for quality customer service and management."
good,"I went back to school to advance my career that is why i left. However, Walmart is a phenomenal place to work. The most enjoyable part of my job is the friends that you make."
good,Upper management was blind to the inconsistencies in the store. Blame was often misplaced. Mangagement was not in the know of the problems of the store.
good,"Worked overnight in the frozen food section,checked all aisles to ensure freshness and made sure goods were spilling opened or tampered with...Stocked all frozen goods on shelves inside trhe freezers and replenished everything when needed."
good,"Walmart is a great starter job for anyone. Truthfully walmart is not a place you would want to stay. Management is not great, coworkers really dont care and when i was moving between departments I never got the raise that I was not only promised, but was standard with the department I moved to."
good,The job is okay but I want to move up and make more money with the experience that I can bring to the next company that opens the door door for me to bring my qualifications to better any business.
good,A typical workday would be you clock in get assigned to a register and then clean your area load bags and go to the end of you register and red line for customers.
good,"Great job for interacting with customers and providing them god service , this jobs helps make a customer enjoy their time shopping at Walmart, by working at Walmart you can develop relationships"
good,Walmart was a great stepping stone. I received great customer service experience working for Walmart. I learned a lot about marketing and interacting with different walks of life.
good,"Very good benefits, Great Company to work for. I definitely learned a lot from this company and it has given me the knowledge I needed to move forward."
good,Nice place to work. Most management were good people. They knew their job and wanted to see you succeed in your own job. Breaks and lunches were also mandatory. So you had some time to rest.
good,The general atmosphere and moral was great. I was taught many things and given freedom to do my job. The hardest part was trying to please too many Managers. I enjoyed what I did and the moral.
good,"A typical day at work is always, full time at the register, with a 100% of my attention on the task at hand. The work period became quite routine and help was easily accessed when required."
good,"just depends on how much freight we would have. That would tell us  the amount of work we had, how busy of a work day we were gonna have. Didn't like that we were on daily speed objective where we would have to get a certain amount of boxes in a trailer. I work at my best when I have time to organize and plan an efficient work ethic."
good,The team was friendly and helpful. People were sociable and unified. The work was fulfilling and kept me engaged. No complaints about management or compensation. A decent place to work.
good,"It was such a good place tom work at, I loved my job just the management sucked because they never wanted to give u any credit for anything they favored people a lot."
good,I work here because the money was good didn't agree with our breaks and lunches but overall it was a pretty fun fast pace working experience for me that's all
good,This was a supplemental job but a good experience.  Was given an opportunity to move into the Cash office.  But I prefer working in the Information Technology field.
good,It was a great job to have while i was a student.The only real problems were other employees lack of work. Management always had trouble with employees doing what they were supposed too which lead to good employees picking up the slack of the bad.
good,they kept you busy. the managers were very laid back and understood when i had o eave early due to my son. that meant a lot to me. i had to leave not because the fired me.
good,"had to learn things quick, quite place to work. enjoyed meeting the new employers and i enjoyed having the manager that i worked with. I wouldn't mind working there again but on morning shift."
good,"Good job, very physical, decent pay, established company, decent benefits, consistent work, company has been around for a long time, need to be in shape to work here."
good,I enjoy working with my fllow team mates. Everyone works together to accomplish the mission for that night. It is a fast paced environment which the military prepared my for.
good,"It's a job to use as a stepping stone, I would not think of making a career here. The job is inconsistent, as some days it's great and some weeks you get hours, then the next week it could be the opposite.. I suppose that's retail though."
good,"Good experience, worked with great people. Will go back anytime. Learned a lot about backroom at Walmart and a little about management. All around great company"
good,I was a third shift stocker at Walmart.  It was quick paced and we were expected to finish (or atleast show 100% effort) of finishing the freight we were given to stock.  There is plenty of opportunities to learn new things.  Learned where nearly everything was in the store because of the diversity of the areas that you will work.
good,"Never a dull moment.  Expectations are high and the work is fast paced, but if you like retail and helping customers and team mates, it is a good place to work.  Good benefits and opportunities to advance."
good,"normal work day, some managers are ok and others not so much, nothing useful, customer service helping customers, finding the right spots to put product on the shelves, meeting team members"
good,This was my first job at Walmart i liked working here i was a cashier i would form mornings from 5am to 12am not on the same day though every days was a different schedule i would work morning and the the next day i would work night and vise versa  i would get stressed out sometimes
good,"It was a solid first hourly job. I started out in set-up then moved to a part time position."
good,Walmart was a pretty good place to work. As a support manager the money was decent. But when trying to get promoted they basically already knew who they wanted so it was never really fair.
good,"I enjoyed working for wal-mart when there were cashiers not just self check out. Managers need to be checked out more. You can't get mad at employees for not having work done on time when they are following policies on customer service. for example, Customers ask for help you cant blow them off."
good,"My time at Walmart was a great experience for me. Walmart is a great place to work and also challenging. In the beginning, it was fun, until the management system has changed."
good,Era un trabajo bueno pero ultimamente ya se llego al limite del aprendisaje
good,"walmart is a great job to start at, people here have worked 14 and 15 years. i never kept a job over 3 months but when i got to walmart i stayed almost a year but had to leave due to medical reasons."
good,"The job was easy to work, the co-workers were likely the highlight of the job as some would remain friends for life and others you couldn't help but not get along with. Benefits were high and it's a job I'd recommend to people starting out in retail."
good,I love working here with great customers and I have some great people I work with .but the hours are not family friendly..I never see my kids and by not beening home for them there school performance is suffering
good,"great hours, great workers, and a good working environment to be in. I enjoyed being able to interact with costumers, i feel like it was a great way to build me costumer service."
good,My superviser didn't watch the schedule so that I have had to a 6 days straight before with saturdays being the first day of the week.  The co-workers were great
good,Walmart was my very first job it was easy but very busy place to work and you were always on the go to help others or stalk the shelves. You had so much you needed to get done before you shift was done
good,I would go back if I had the chance to I jus had a situation (personal) dat I had to relocate and find me another job until I can get myself back together
good,I would say it is a good place to work if you don't mind not having a set schedule and never knowing when you work until the next schedule is dropped.
good,Take online orders and prepare them for in store customer pick up. I've learned how to unload the truck and price items. The workplace is relaxed and stable at times. Hardest part of the job is being able to juggle orders all at once.
good,"*Most enjoyable part of the job are the customers"
good,If you need a job it pays well. They require you to move at certain pace and give you goals to reach it. The only down side is that this can make people on edge when they aren't reaching their goals.
good,While I worked there the managers were pretty awesome as were the coworkers. However for holidays like thanksgiving/black friday it is mandatory overtime (I worked a 12 shift) because it is all hands on deck. Also pallets weren't always wrapped properly so avalanches where common.
good,If you can work around a bunch of awesome walmart customers around the holidays or the 1st and 3rd of the month. itd be the place for you. Most of the coworkers were pretty awesome. fast paced at times. Pay wasnt great.
good,Working at Walmart as a stocker was very challenging. After you get use to it though the benefits are astounding. It's like getting paid to go to the gym! The other employees there are always up for lending a helping hand if you are behind on your work.
good,Considering I was able to move up to pharmacy technician at 3 months it isn't a bad job. I did however have some co-workers who abuse the laid back culture.
good,Pharmacy is staffed well with pharmacists and technicians that the busy workload doesn't seem too hectic. Friendly co-workers that makes the workflow easier.
good,"It is always changing without much support from management. It was a good experience, and I'm glad I did it for the experience. I am just anxious to use my education"
good,While working for this company I performed physical jobs. The proper maintenance of equipment is vital. They offered proper job training for my duties.
good,"Great experience , working with customers and learning how to assist them and use the registers. Knowing where things are so that we can better assist customers or resolve their issue."
good,Can be a good first job for a person. no very many benefits however you get to meet a lot of different people and can learn a lot of different things here.
good,"During my time at walmart I truly liked it there i would go back if i could, when i started there i felt very welcome and I had lots of assistance to understand how to make my job go easier and make my customers happy. I recommend this job to anybody looking for a good first job"
good,"It was a great place to work. I like the people and most of the customers. The store manager likes to play favorites though. People that didn't deserve a promotion but were in his group got promoted while others that deserved it got nothing but "" oh sorry you didn't get it but you're doing a good job"""
good,the job itself wasn't too bad. it was fast paced and straight forward. i believe the two biggest problems were the managers talked down to their employees and treated them with disrespect and the pay was minimal.
good,The best thing about walmart has to be my coworkers. My department is very well run and I enjoy my job. My immediate supervisor is very productive and helps make the job enjoyable.
good,I was a cashier and was not there very long.  I just worked part time to earn extra income while I was a stay at home mother.  I enjoyed the fast pace atmosphere.
good,It was a fun place to work for the management wasn't bad n I loved working for them I would go back and work for them I just want to try something new
good,"I worked in the produce section where i unloaded new "
good,"Too many ""chiefs"" not communicating well with one another on what tasks are priority. In the beginning of the year they cut hours drastically unless you are a department manager or full time associate. Inconsistent directions and discipline."
good,It was such a good time at Walmart and it was a good company i have worked with but because of the salary i have left and because i have moved way to far from it
good,Walmart is a fun and friendly environment which offers several opportunities to grow within the company during this whole time i have to admit that i did learn a lot so far
good,I worked at the Walmart Supercenter then transfered to the Distribution Center as an order filler who picked cases in a safely and timed manner. I enjoyed working for Walmart and liked my Co workers.
good,"I worked in Photolab and what we did was get the online orders from customers from either off the shelves or out of delivery when they came in, then put them in the stores inventory and gave it to the customer when they arrived."
good,"Es una empresa estructurada, con buenos controles y principios. Muy Normativa que ayudan a los colaboradores sobre su deberes."
good,"Orderfillimg at the Wal-Mart Distribution Center made for long hours on your feet doing very repetitive work.  Made decent money, had to always be moving and working get through day"
good,"It was a great place to work and I enjoyed working there, but they could not give me enough hours. I needed full time work and they could not supply me with enough hours to support myself and needs."
good,working at walmart was hard and comforting place to work and you needed to have very good customer experience since it was like 50% of your job.  you also always need to smile no matter what.
good,C'est une tres bonne compagnie. L'esprit d'equipe est fort.
good,Productive work environment. Good work-life balance. Friday lunches are Ok. Very Knowledgeable and helpful team members and very approachable. Flexible office hours
good,needs more training for upper management. and better scheduling of associates to place where help is needed the most in every area of the store to better help associates and customers alike.
good,It is a great place to work but there is long hours and little to no work life balance. This job is retail so you have to know that they expect weekends and noghts at times.
good,"Retail pharmacy location"
good,their manager higher than the department managers and really not trained for their potion and is not organized at all. all under scheduling worker. theres never enough help in the store for customers
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart because I got to interact with a multitude of people. Between the customers, employees, and managers I have never been employed in a more diverse environment. The store was always clean and well kept. It made the conditions as a sales associate much easier. Over all it was a great place to work."
good,I've learned quite a bit. I've learned about meat and where's its cut at. I've learned how to make a bale. I've meet good people everyday and grown a relationship with the customers. The only thing I have to say that is bad is the management some stores management is terrible and some are really good.
good,When I worked at Walmart the pay was still 7.65. I know it’s gone up since leaving. Wish they had more full time positions as opposed to making so many ppl part time. Overall I liked working there just needed more money to pay my bills and take care of my family.
good,"nothing really that bad about the job, it was relaxed with easy work and friendly coworkers, management could have been better, pay could have been better due to my experience in the department that i was associated with, i knew more about everything than my coworkers did but didnt see much of a reward for it."
good,The working environment was extremely face paced. This required you to possess the ability to work in other departments due to workload. My position with this company has taught me exceptional customer service skills
good,It was a fast paced work environment that had a lot of weird people working there. Some people do a good job while others prefer to let you do your job for them.
good,I have no comment concerning a review of Wal Mart or any employer i have worked for.  What may be good for one person may be terrible for another person.
good,"They were able to give me training in multiple department, and I learned many new skills from them that I have been able to transfer to other jobs. Great work environment if you are willing to deal with difficult customers."
good,A typical day begins at 6 am and start by picking and stocking for the store. followed by price changes and ordering throughout. also zone areas as you go.  it is a great job and the team is great.
good,it was a great and friendly place to work the management cared about each employee and went out of their way to make each of us feel special and help us feel better
good,"Good job, difficult at times, but not to hard for the most part. Had fun while I worked there. Had a great crew of people to work with, and learned so much"
good,It was a productive workplace with a nice break system in place. It also had very understanding management that worked with you if you had any family emergencies.
good,"Great place to implement your professional skills."
good,"I liked working at Walmart if it was up to me I would've kept working there, the pay was good the hours were good, the people o worked with were great"
good,Different parts of the store are easier or harder to work in. Deli is a stressful environment. It can be hard to deal with the stress and coworkers if there is an issue. working with people you can joke with helps a lot.
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, en general el ambiente es bueno."
good,"For the 10 yrs I was there, I was reprimanded on the sales floor, and not backed up by management team, that my asst manager was in the wrong,  That incident cost me my position and she allowed to get away with it,"
good,Worked hard there.   Always called upon for different types of tasks. Always able to complete or find a solution to complete tasks. Asked to do jobs not in my job description.
good,"Though WalMart's management and number of hours have always been fair, their flexibility to accommodate a single mother like myself is lacking. The most enjoyable part of my job is coming in to my coworkers as well a my customers. While it may not be a difficult job, it is still one I enjoy."
good,A very busy place to work. The downside would be not enough  worker to accommodate the customers during peak hours. I've met great people while on the job.
good,"Decent place to work, always something to do, okay pay for the job, no healthcare for part time employees. It wouldn’t be so bad but I’m not provided enough hours to be able to pay to go to the doctor or dentist when I need to."
good,"Working at walmart has been quite a learning experience, and while the job is emotionally demanding (as we deal with a lot of customers) it's really not that bad."
good,"A typical day consisted of counting the money in the register, keeping the area organized while waiting for customers and checking out and assisting them when needed."
good,I think that working at Walmart was a great opportunity for me. I was able to work as many hours as I needed and that helped. I was also able to meet people that have continued to help me through life journey.
good,"Acceptable atmosphere, friendly customer service, clean to the best of their abilities. Employees help the best they can no matter what department they are in."
good,"The hardest part of the job was having to go super fast and making sure your customer did not get frustrated at you. Most of the time, if something were to happen to the P.O.S system, the customer would get upset. You have to learn how to control the situation and relieve the customer."
good,"Fast paced and ever changing. Walmart Canada is a retail environment that utilizes its employees and provides opportunity. When working at Walmart, there is never a dull moment."
good,I enjoyed my job at Walmart. I feel they truly care about their employees. There is great advancement with Walmart. They will take you through the training you desire to move you up in the company.
good,"I was in my first role in retail management, without much experience in retail, as an Assistant Manager.  I was just getting the ""big picture,"" managing Bakery, when I was told I would need to take on about half of a store and probably transfer to another store, further away.  It wasn't the transfer, as much as the ""half of a store"" that made me feel that I was not ready for such a move."
good,Cleaning the apparel area. I learned how to bin things in the warehouse. The management was okay. Hardest part was trying to clean up all departments The employees are very nice.
good,"Walmart as a company has got better with compensation. However, the management can be challenging. I held different position with the company which allowed me to gain more knowledge in the work force. With the proper guidence you can advance within the company."
good,"Walmart was a great  place to work for any stage of life, they were very generous with hours and were quick to help any employee with any questions or who were struggling with their customers"
good,my views on walmart its great place work to work friendly work understanding managment team but we have days where it up and down other then that it was great place to start your career if you ask me i was very please with the  company . would i go back yes but not now for sure but i love it while it lasted 7 yaers was long enought for life goes now thank walmart .
good,I started at Walmart as it was okay but there were people who were just out to get you but after so long i started to love it. Its like your being tested to show how much you are willing to do for Walmart and I give my all in anything i do so they ended up loving me in the end and i love them too.
good,Easy work and good pay but moving up in the company is impossible and you are just a number to them. They will fire you for the smallest of things but its not the managers just the company
good,"Most of the time you work the hours that are requested for you and off days are not optional. You get two 10 minutes paid break and 30 minutes lunch on 8 hours shift. Everyone is treated equal regardless of culture, age, skin color or natural origin. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes managers are not good at training new employees and it's hard to learn things fast and they expect you to know everything. Rather than that it's fun and nice environment to work at."
good,"I started there as a cashier, and everyone was so nice to me. The job was fun, the customers were friendly. It was very easy to work there. The hours are great if you are looking for a part time job, but you do get in trouble if you go over your part time hours."
good,It was a nice job I believe everyone should work at a Walmart after doing so you will start t value yourself a lot more the work they have you do or the pay is horrible but it has to be done.
good,"Definitely a place where growth is inevitable. In under a year I saw many people go from associates to managers.  A major plus is that if you are ever uncomfortable or ready for a different setting you can request a change of department and learn something new. The hardest part of this job is working with people. There are times where customers will come off as disrespectful and you have to train yourself not to retaliate. Also, my store has a very high percentage of people from other countries who speak foreign languages. Being bilingual would be really helpful in this particular setting."
good,"Walmart is a good place to start a working career but I want to move up to better jobs and it was hard to do. Good place to work, an okay place if you want to stay as a second shift stocker"
good,"Walmart was a pretty laid back job, especially in the garden center. I enjoyed tending to the plants, flowers, and cleaning the patio. I learned alot about flowers and other plantlife that i never knew. It was a lot of fun servicing customers and seeing smiles of satisfaction on their faces"
good,A typical day in my position at my store is about a 7 i guess on a scale of 1-10. We start off with a meeting sometimes then get straight to work. They lack an efficient hiring process for managers so i do 2 management positions at once. The management at my store is lack luster at best with managers not sharing the same ideas about how to move forward so you'll run into managers giving you different things to do than the next. No one is on the same page. They also lack the compassion for their associates and close to never show appreciation for their associates.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, are the coworkers. We all got along and helped each other with tasks, when needed. The shift supervisors, were informative and straight the point."
good,Walmart was one of my favorite jobs it was actually my first job and I enjoyed it a lot. The people were welcoming and it felt more like a family which actually helped.
good,Walmart is  good company to work and the benefits are great you have to work very hard to make it in the company I would recommend for anyone to work for Walmart. ive been a customers service manager for 15  years and I love what I do I get too meet a lot of wonderful customers and
good,I have appreciated the job at Walmart while in high school.  I have a chance to finish high school and work at the same time.  I am also in the Guards and they work around that schedule as well.
good,"A typical day would include going back and forth between the garden center and the toys as well as anything seasonal. I had to water plants, as well as check out customers at the register by myself. I would do all the cleaning. I would assemble grills. I would help customers find anything they needed."
good,"good customer service and clean place. The hardest part is in the summer and on raining days, but the good thinks is you meet a lots of people and good co-workers"
good,great store manager. flexible hours. I worked part time 32-36 hours per week  with no benefits. i wanted a job with insurance benefits so i left for another position
good,"I worked here for a few months, I lost my job because I was not able to perform all the work duties due to an injury that I received when I was eighteen"
good,"A typical day at work, I would go on in and clock in 8 hrs on cash register, every day i would learn something new, if not for work, it would be a customer that would teach me. Management was OK ...they would transfer departments quarterly so it would make communication a very difficult challenge. Loved all of the people and customers that i would deal with on a daily basis. The hardest part was the unstable schedule."
good,"At Walmart there are always things to do for example. I would stock my 4 isles and zone them, in other words make them look good. If I was done with that I would push carts, or work in toys/cloths sections."
good,"working at Walmart was a fun experience for me, I worked there my senior year in high school. Walmart allowed me to continue my education while making some money."
good,i learned a lot by working at walmart i learned about wic & how the register runs because dat was my first time being a cashier but i enjoyed stocking more than anything
good,During my time i collected carts to keep the bays filled. I handled other inside jobs as well. helped keep the shelves presentible when i wasnt bisy getting carts.
good,Management expects you to do the job of 3 people. Some people are held to higher standards than others. They will hire almost anyone. They only give annual raises.
good,well what can I say whatever I say will be twisted anyway. is there to be there but if you do not go you do not know.On the other hand we all need a job.
good,"This is a great place to work if you need flexible hours and an option of possible benefits.  It can be fun and you are certainly never bored.  For the most part you can come in, get to work, do your job, and you leave it behind when you get home.  However, if you are looking for a career, advancement is possible. Be aware, however, along comes with it long hours, strict, demanding expectations, and it's no longer hourly. For the extravagant amount of time you will work, the additional effort and focus there is little additional benefit than remaining hourly."
good,"As a Facilitator, schedule varies. And although we took the position to get out of operations we are forced back into operations and bonus based on the store."
good,The majority of the employees are hard working individuals.  The management is not properly trained.  I loved merchandising my department and preparing for upcoming events within the store.
good,"awesome place to work , I was always busy with something to do , great with customers, great with working with others on the job , great hours , good 1 hour break"
good,"When you walk into Walmart, you know you have a team. The front end was a place where not only do you get to work with customers but good, friendly co workers. Management at the front end, whether it was the supervisor or CSM they became family. I had regular customers because I was well trained and remembered to always look up, focus on customer's needs whether it was how to bagged or if they needed price checks.."
good,walmart was an easy and fun job. I had a list of things to do everyday. I would occasionally get more task added. I did the same types of jobs stocking and setting displays.
good,I started here as a kid in High School who did sports and the supervisor said she'd work with my schedule but didn't and it really messed with my health and sleep schedule and schooling.
good,"I did customer service, cashier,  stocking and anything else they needed help at. I help clean sections and restock returned goods. Employees were friendly and helpful."
good,working here was a life experience that is for sure time management played a really big hand in everything the managers helped me a lot told me things gave me different prospective
good,"cashier, greeter, stocking food and supplies"
good,"its overall a good job...fun environment, perfect management, great support.. along with beneficial salary along with great hours ..I loved working there."
good,"The managers are nice and caring, you  have to have a lot of patience with  he customers, they can sometimes be extremely rude. but you have to mange to keep a smile and move on"
good,Each store has it's own unique environment. Within each unique environment there are pros and cons. The company today is not the same as the company that I started with 14 years ago.
good,Great place to work. Very fast paced and offers annual bonuses based on sales. Pays decent for retail. Only issue with the company I have is that they do not allow any overtime what so ever.
good,"The workplace isn't the worst, but not the best. You will run into some very lazy managers as well as managers who work their tails off. Depends on the store itself. Overall a nice place to work, not super strict or demanding of you."
good,"Walmart is an interesting place to work. As a customer, all you see are smiles. As a worker, everyone hates their job one way or another. Management is terrible."
good,Muy buena empresa crecimiento laboral rápido por ende aumento de sueldo
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart in the tire, lube, express was the employees and customers. I also like that I got to work with my hands and good people."
good,"The company values it's associates and has many opportunities to advance, if you are willing. As a salaried member of management there are many opportunities to engage in Sam Walton's philosophy of making the customer number one. The most enjoyable part of my job is the one on one interaction with the associates. The most difficult part of my job is terminating an associate."
good,"buena experiencia, grato ambiente laboral muy conforme en los años de trabajo"
good,"Work was based around Customer service and stocking inventory on shelves and providing product knowledge to customers. I learned patience with this job. Ultimately a great place to work based on the fact that there was always something to do. Work was never boring. The hardest part of the job would have to be the difficult customers, but as long as you knew how to diffuse a difficult situation then it was overall good."
good,I really enjoyed working  for Wal-Mart. I worked for Wal-Mart as a sticker and everyday I just stocked the groceries department it was a very relaxed job
good,Working at Walmart is very stressful and competitive you are required to complete your job assignment in a specific amount of time if not you are coached
good,My job at Walmart was invigorating and enjoyable until there was a manager that called me a liar and didn't listen to anything that I had to say. I would go work there again if I didn't have to deal with her.
good,"not much to say about the job. the people were friendly but the hours I had were pretty brutal. Overall it was a good place to work."
good,"n/a. was such a long time ago, but what I do remember is the benefits are great, and the people really care about you, I highly suggest this workplace to everyone!"
good,Very fast paced work environment. My direct supervisors/management were amazing about helping out any way they could. Flexible with scheduling needs as well.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, the job isn't very hard but it's not real easy. Just gotta find a pace that works for you. I honestly wouldn't be looking for another job if i didn't need a day job."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you want to put a little money in your pockets. I worked part time, so I did not have any benefits. however the company made great improvements when it come to paid."
good,"Job responsiblities are checking customers out. Helping customers locate items and credit"
good,"I need full time and benefits which is not currently an option"
good,"Typical day at work involves unloading merchandise from truck and stocking these items to ensure they are available for customers to purchase. Along with this, I help customers with their questions and needs."
good,"Great place to work."
good,"Existe un buen ambiente laboral, hay casino donde sirven la comida (desayuno, almuerzo y once)"
good,"The first thing you will need as a Walmart customer service associate is people skills. You will work with the public on a daily basis, and the very nature of the job puts you in contact with customers who may be disgruntled or angry. Many customers come to customer service in need of a return or exchange, and they may be upset that their purchase did not turn out as expected. You must remain calm when dealing with angry customers while processing the return or exchange. You must be attentive and alert to prevent falling for scams that involve returning merchandise. You must use your best judgment to know when to involve a customer service manager to help solve a customer’s problem."
good,"Provides great opportunity to grow within the organization.  Typically 75% of all management hiring decisions are made from within the organization, allowing team members to grow their skills, while advancing their careers."
good,"This job was one of my better jobs. It was fast paced and most people were kind. I loved my job, it may have been better though for someone without children."
good,The company believe in training and building up their employees. They want to see you succeed as an employee and will invest their time and money to train you properly with pay. Great work environment. Lots of entry level and professional job opportunities. Many opportunities to grow within the company. Great Management team.
good,The management in the store that I worked at was not very good. Other than that pretty much no complaints though. If you were to go to another store with better management then I would highly recommend working for Walmart.
good,The job is not hard. It's more about who you know if you want to progress in your career at Walmart. I don't think all Walmarts are the same. But there are a few similarities.
good,"A normal day at work for me as a cashier was mostly scanning items, greeting customers, and zoning my area when there were no customers. Also once the store slowed down I would perform returns."
good,"Very easy and fun place to work coworkers are nice too, would recommend to a friend looking for a job but there is no way you could live of it, and you can’t get overtime"
good,Accomadating and flexible schedules. Management provides training to help employee learn and develop in their position to the best of associates ability. On the job training and plans are developed for advancement within the company.
good,los compañeros muy buena onda solo lo que no me gustaba es que  no se veia crecimiento laboral
good,"I worked there and we went through 6 management changes in the same number of months and that doesn't account for the number of team leads, or the department heads. The turn over rate is sky high which makes life difficult because the expectations are very different with each manager."
good,"There is a lot of labor intensive tasks each day. It is often hard to tell what is going on outside of the store because there are no windows. Overall, it is a great place to learn consumer behavior."
good,"- People are the key to everything"
good,"Some days are more frustrating than others, but you get that with any job. Management isn't always sympathetic to your frustrations and will often give into the customer if they complain enough. As long as you don't take things personally, it's not too hard to get through the day. I wouldn't want to make it my career, but I don't mind here to get me through college."
good,A lot of employees are friendly and helpful but you also get a lot of lazy co-workers and if you move up you get a lot of people you have to baby sit to make them do there job.
good,I enjoy working at Walmart. I’ll see my self retiring from the company one day. Wal-Mart has giving me a lot of opportunity to grow and become whatever I wanted to become with the company.
good,"I didn't work there long enough to have a solid opinion about it. But the day I did work was fun, fast, and very intriguing. It is a large work place and great for anyone who loves a fast pace environment."
good,"Fun, fast pace, which i like.  I love meeting new people which you do alot of as a cashier.  Management could  have been alot better.  But i worked through the difficulties.  Over all enjoyed the work ."
good,You earn your money. This is real work. The job is very physical with high rates of productivity that must be met. 12 hr shifts with that activity level got you is shape quickly.
good,"The job positions are good, fairly easy with good hours I just found that management was poorly trained and showed a lack of good communication and leadership skills. It seemed as if that was how most of them were trained and the good managers had to fight tooth and nail to get fair working conditions."
good,I was a cashier at the front end. Most days were quite busy especially holidays and weekends. The hours and workdays were very flexible while providing daily challenges.
good,Very hard work when dealing with customers making customers happy so that they will come back. They would sometime come back to me which was great. We would have lots of fun.
good,"its not a bad company to work with, as long as you dont mind working and watching others not. it can be fun as long as you have a good management team."
good,this job was a long time ago when they had a snack bar. way before they had a deli. but it was fun back then serving icees and making nachos. but it was fun
good,"From My personal experience Walmart was actually a lot different than what I expected it to be. from what I learned there was a lot of favoritism shown, a lot of unprofessional conversations/ bullying. it basically remind Me of High school so I was able be comfortable by some of the other associates. the hardest part of the job was trying to communicate with a person who is having a bad day, the most enjoyable part was I was able to time myself on what tasks I could get done fast and early."
good,"Have to say it wasn't a BAD place to work, but I would HIGHLY recommend anywhere else as a first job to getting your foot in the door. My time there was pretty good from what I can remember, being a cart associate gave me alot of time being outside in the fresh air and not really having to deal with customers as much as I thought I would, but as for progressing and starting a career with them, wasn't even an option."
good,"Fast paced. As salaried employee, can be required to adjust schedule last minute in order to meet job requirements. Fun and ever changing job responsibilities. Learned how to be flexible with job and family life and be successful with both."
good,A typical day at work would be handling customers with certain aspects...helping customers with anything they need...handling money transactions....the hardest part of the job is trying to make a customer happy that day....the enjoyable part is coming to work and making money of course but it’s really what you make it.
good,"i liked working there. it really isn't a bad place to work. you just have to learn to be friendly and have patience because some people believe in testing you to the highest, but its ok. you really learn how to be a people person and hold that temperance back"
good,"manager it the typical i learned on how to be different because i was a supervisor and i always wanted to be the best at it and to be better then my management to move up.the hardest part of the job was needed more hours and paid,but the most biggest thing i enjoy is making the customer happy when the shop at walmart."
good,"Nice place to work, Very helpful co workers.  Walmart does a lot to help communities. Always something to learn. Lots of classes to help with the job."
good,"Some of the upper management can be a pain to deal with, but as long as you do your job you get no real problems to deal with. They offer some of the better pay for the job type your doing."
good,Great overall experience with company. Can easily work your way up if you try. Poor upper management at times. Good pay but sometimes hard hours to work.
good,"A typical work day at Walmart was full of new things every day. One day things would be stressful and the next day things would be better. It keeps you busy and on your feet, but overall a pretty good work environment."
good,"Your work experience really depends on the Management team and your personality. You have to be able to deal with rude customers on a daily basis. If you have open availability, more likely to receive more hours."
good,"The hardest part of my job was how the hours changed, I would work a 2-11 then turn around and work a 7-4. I enjoyed some of the people I worked with."
good,"It's Walmart, so it's busy and stressful at times. Not a bad place to work. I only worked part-time, though, so I wasn't eligible for benefits or anything like that."
good,Es un ambiente bueno aunque la gerencia no se fige en lo que la gente ase para mejorar la compañía
good,"Very easy job , all depends on if you’re willing to put in work to move up in the company or stay where you’re at if you do not plan on staying with the company."
good,Walmart is walmart. Some like it some hate it. I didn't mind it too much. GReat people to work with. I worked at two different stores in my walmart career as well as assisting others.
good,i worked at walmart as a summer job. one of they benifits that they gives employees is the 10% discount of store bought products. you have to work there for 6 months before you can use it. everything but that was great.
good,I think that Walmart is a good company to work for.  Management was decent the department managers were hardworking caring individuals.  Great to learn about peoples families.
good,"Walmart is a pretty good job to have, especially if you love working with and helping others. You have to be open to learn new things and available whenever needed in a new department, so you have to be very flexible."
good,"The pros and cons of working at Walmart are pretty equal. The hours and shifts are decent, but sometimes they can be inconvenient and getting help for your schedule is a real pain. Unfortunately working outside is the worst because even in extreme weather conditions you are forced to go out and deal with it. There really isnt any concern or any help from management during those conditions which really makes working for them difficult. If you're willing to put up with poor management, a shady scheduling process and less than stellar pay, its not a bad place."
good,Walmart was  great experience for me learned a lot of great qualities there I learned things about myself there as well met really hardworking determined people . what I didn't like how it was ran supervisor wasn't reliable
good,"A typical day at Walmart for me is verifying, scanning, and slotting freight. the management staff are not really that great. Th workplace is just a regular retail drop. The most enjoyable part of the ob are the customers."
good,it was a fast pace work environment. co-workers were fun to work with and made many friends.  I worked in the cooler which was 34 degrees all the time and sometimes had to go into the freezer which was 0 and the ice cream was negative 20
good,"me gusto trabajar en equipo, trabajar en un ambiente de trabajo muy tranquilo"
good,Walmart is a great company to start off your career if you are in management and fresh out go college. You will work long and hard hours but it will definitely enhance your management skills.
good,The number one retailer in the world and growing massively in Canada. Lots of pressure but Great room for advancement. Be used to changes. Too much turnover.
good,Strong work for given responsibilities. Great environment to learn and shadow others. Structured job that has many new directions for new employees who are willing to explore
good,"This job was fast paced with many monotonous task. Not much room for advancement due to availability at location. Held multiple level 3 positions which made preparation for the day hard and mysterious to daily task. I was an jack of all trades, so I worked across the entire store, sometimes multiple positions in a day."
good,"Great place for a part time job, good admin and upper management, great place to gain starting experience for other jobs, overall a friendly place to work at."
good,Gostei e aprendi muito com as pessoas que trabalhavam comigo
good,"My job experience at Wal-Mart was somewhat what I expected, but definitely the opposite in certain areas. The pay is quite good, but they work you to death for it. I was making $9.50 an hour as a Photo Lab/ Electronics Associate, but after completing my 30 day computer training courses I was bumped up to $10.50. I was getting between 30-36 hours a week, and I was enjoying it for the most part in the beginning. I was enjoying it until I realized how Wal-Mart works. Management generally does not care about the needs of associates, unless it breaks corporate policy. Wal-Mart as a whole does not care about the personal lives of their associates as well. They simply want you to come in, work your shift, then ask you to stay over, and then tell you to go home because you have too much overtime. Department managers are treated like pack mules, except for the store manager's favorites, which means the DMs who get treated badly go off on their associates. Almost every associate in the store had a complaint about their department/department managers/ or the assistant manager over their area. Many associates would be given write-ups for the most ridiculous things, such as their productivity within their first week. Wal-Mart does not expect their department managers to go into extensive training with their newly hired associates, and so many of them are lost on what to do, and most of the time the department's self-trained associates have to take the wheel. I can't tell you how many times the other associates and I had to train new associates, or do our department manger's job for them."
good,"everyday is a different scenario, every manager is focused on a different angle of the business. It can be brutal work and you will find muscles in your body you never knew existed. Your time is tracked to the second and if you cannot handle that then don't bother. If you plan on working hard and taking it seriously then you will survive but if you are there to socialize and complain don't bother. They pay very well for the work with incentives based on production goals, the benefits package is pretty good although alot of people complain. The company has changed greatly over the years and the employee is not necessarily as important as they used to be but thats business folks."
good,Trabalhei  na Walmart  no período de 12 messes e considero uma empresa que só tem a crescer e que sempre vê os direitos de seus funcionários com atenção e eficaz.
good,It was pretty cool to work at Walmart friendly coworkers & customers. Working at your own pace getting things done your way but the right way. Overall I’ll recommend the job and do it over again.
good,When I started with the company the management was interested and paid attention to the employees but as time went by it was all about making the numbers.
good,"Come to work on time and leave on time. Always do what is expected of you and always, always greet, help and thank the customers. Follow process and if you have a problem follow the chain of command."
good,"Working with this company gave me the opportunity to meet different people on a daily basis, I enjoyed assisting the customers with day to day shopping tasks and customer related inquiries."
good,"Hermoso trabajo, buen ambiente y compañerismo de los compañeros y jefes."
good,Typical day is very busy. We all have to get done stocking in 6 hrs and zoning in 2 hrs before the store opens. You have to help the customers for a couple of hours before the store close.
good,"As a cashier, my job at WalMart is constantly busy, which can get exhausting at times. The work is never done, but if you enjoy a fast-paced environment, I highly suggest it."
good,Es una buena empresa el problema es el salario que son muy bajos
good,It wasn’t a bad place to work. It was a good environment and I got along with everyone. You get paid fairly for the work that you’re doing and you get a break every 2 hours.
good,"Applying to walmart is very easy. However, a lot of managers show poor leadership  to fellow employees,  and show a lot of favoritism towards associates."
good,"A typical day in Wal-Mart management is prioritizing the daily needs of the business and adapting to whatever comes up along the way. I have learned inner personal skills, the art of delegating, and how to prioritize tasks. The management team lacks necessary communication skills and sharing credit for others contributions. The overall workplace culture within the associates is amazing. The hardest part of the job is managing the amount of work with the associates given. The most enjoyable part of the job is the hourly associates and the company culture."
good,I loved it at walmart. sometimes they asked a lot of you and it got a bit overwhelming but otherwise it was a great place to work at. id do it again for sure
good,The job was a fair job with good pay. Just didn’t like how the people there were being treated after struggling to get to work when things were out of their control.
good,"Been working for the company for 15 years. Lots of changes have taken place, some for the better, some not for the best interest of its associates.                            "
good,"Working at Walmart may seem easy, but dealing with the company itself is a hard task. You have to be ready to work by yourself sometimes. The management is OK, could be better."
good,Fun place to work something new to see on a day to day basis and they help their employees when needed and you can further your careers in retail if that is where you want to continue your education
good,"good place to work but not a lot of hours and hours per week and shifts  are not consistent, friendly workers but managers have a high turnover. Generous breaks."
good,"It was a very good place to work, and the environment was enjoyable. The people I had worked with were nice, I was trusted to be left alone, and the management was excellent."
good,"A typical day at work included assisting customers with picking out frames, adjusting glasses, entering orders, ringing up customers, checking on insurance, scheduling, and calculating the money for the eye doctors."
good,"Working at Walmart, you will receive training in most retail-type positions as long as you are willing to learn.  From office management to receiving to sales, almost any career can be fostered from here!"
good,I was a cashier in this position. I enjoyed meeting the customers and chatting with them. Could be stressful at times if you did not get a break. Standing for hours was difficult.
good,The pay is pretty decent especially with the raise you get ever 3 months or so. Hours are usually pretty good during peak season. Time off is easy to get and managers work with you.
good,"Walmart was a good company to work for during my time there. It is not like what it is today. I enjoyed working there then, but I would not work there now."
good,First I would unload trucks it could be different types of things from beds to microwaves then you put them on a pallet next I broke down those pallets and put them on a belt
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart I wished that I did not take another opportunity. "
good,"overall a good job, co-workers and most of the management were nice people. There was always something to do but the work-life balance was tough being on midnights."
good,"Come in and start to get ready for the nights trucks."
good,"While working at Walmart I learned how to stock, drive a forklift, and stock shelves. I also worked in the garden center.   I feel like this experience helped me in finding future jobs. I liked the people I worked with.  I liked the work.  It provide a good steady income for me and my family."
good,Great place to work and get opportunity to receive experience in different departments and field through out the Walmart corporation. They give recognition for great work performance. Always someone to answer questions when you need help.
good,"I have worked there almost 3 years, management can be awful but the manager over each department changes every February. It’s a job and it is very secure however; it can make you not wanna work there bc of the customers"
good,A typical day at Walmart has its many ups and downs. But you learn to ignore the downs of the job. You learn excellent customer service. You meet lots of new people
good,"It is a fast pace work environment. Coworkers and Management are very nice. Hardest part is probably getting so many tasks done within the day, but can be done. the most enjoyable part of the job is that there is potential to move on up."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Walmart, however the commute was too long. Management was great. My job was outside, enjoyed the customers and helping the elderly to their cars."
good,Good to work here    peaceful environment. Career advancement. Learned many new things regarding work environment at walmart.Very huge organization with good facilities.
good,its an ok job to temporarirly help you get a few things and get by. its not something to keep long term. not enough money made working there. pay to cheap and have to work an outrageous number of hours just to see a descent pay check
good,"Making money is great every ones loves to make money, but what you don't wont is people who don't do there job. It was ok to work here but I got stuck with doing all the work people here are lazy and don't like to do anything."
good,Great learning experince. Fast paced extremely taxing physical labor. Great wages but no consistency in hours. Wish there was more oppurtunities to get more hours
good,"Walmart is a very good company to work for, although some days could be a little rough. I learned a lot about management duties and requirements. The hardest part was having to get everything done by yourself, because at a point of time  it was under staffed."
good,Great if you love people. Management could be sketchy at times but overall a decent place to work. Decent start pay. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
good,Es una de las pocas empresas que dan oportunidad laboral sin experiencia que habla muy bien de ellos pero la paga es baja.
good,the other associates and the management wore all very kind and everyone got along alright. and if you needed help with anything the managers would explain how to do something and not just leave you to fend for your self.
good,A empresa garante uma grande oportunidade de crescimento e estabilidade.
good,la cultura de la empresa es exelente lastima que en nuestra provincia no la aplican
good,"I never liked to just stand around doing nothing so I was always straightening and cleaning the service desk. If a customer needed a helper and I wasn’t busy at service desk I’d go and help customer shop. Overall, a nice company to work for."
good,"They are a company that is good to have in college as they are happy to work around your schedule. However, every now and then new management comes in and tries to do thing differently which results in unneeded stress."
good,"typically a fun high paced workplace. management treats the workers well, advancing with the company is always available and you learn each department throughly"
good,Fue una experiencia muy buena pero cuando uno da las gracias el personal de RH se portan muy groseros
good,It is a good co to work for.  It is fun and friendly good if you like to work with different people.   You will meet a lot of people.  You will work in different areas and learn a lot.
good,Walmart was a good company to work for they just were very strict about who receives benefits. They offered promotions but only to certain people. Even people I daily worked with were there 22 years and never got promoted.
good,"Don't be fooled, this is a very hard job. If you aren't athletic you won't do well. There is never a set schedule here. You may work 8 hours a day, you may work 16 hours a day. But the people are great. The manager's, the co-workers. Breaks are short, and lunch isn't cheap if you buy from the cafeteria, but overall its a great work environment."
good,"Very good company to start on or finish on. Some shaky foundations but means well. Solid company to work for, Has locations all around the world, so stable job to have."
good,Overall an alright work environment. Short staffed most of the times. Its a very steady pace job and I would recommend to a person with great customer service experience.
good,Worked overnights. Hours and pay was great as well as the benefits. Easy work environment. Learned how to properly restock the shelves. Met a lot of good people
good,"Great work environment and super supportive co worker.Helping members, my coworkers. Flexibility, good people wanting to do their best. Lots of opportunities to advance"
good,"They are giving raises, but are cutting back on associates.  More work for each associate.  Too much work not enough time to finish.  Ask a manager for help and the go the other direction.  Never send help when you need it."
good,"Its alot of work, responsibilty, quick thinking, lots to learn, fast paced, driven and challenging. Can be stressful with alot to take in and process ."
good,Working for renior staffing was a completely great experience. I really enjoyed having a great team to work with. I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to be successful.
good,"The mangement was fantasic, they really help train and show employees they easiest way to do the job without it being to stressful on new employees. The salary was great and they offered great benefits. I learn how to use the MC40 scanner and pick/package items. The most enjoyable part of my job was the workplace environment and how everyone was friendly."
good,"In Walmart, the core value is to provide excellent service and safe environment for shoppers,thriving to give every day low price to every customer, due to the fact that they remain the reason the business grows. When this is done the main objective of a good customer service relation is achieved. Giving our brand a good name for continuous patronage is also our goal."
good,"working on unload of order boxes from truck daily.  working with best team, they were respect and kind.  It was fun and interesting work with coworkers."
good,"Fast-paced work environment with a focus on the customer above product. Unfortunately, they do not seem to take care of their older employees, what with the Pathways program that  was introduced to help the hiring process that ultimately put a pay difference between old and new employees. I was given two raises (switched job code and then graduated their online Pathways) and found out I was making more than anyone in my department, despite being there only a few months."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart and I enjoyed the people that I worked with. Had great days off management was very helpful with things that were difficult to understand truck ordering inventory were all easy to do and everybody just pulled together to get stuff done
good,"I was pleasantly surprised with my time there. I think that the company as a whole doesn't always do the right thing by employees. with that being said, when you work there and get to know people on a personal level, there are a lot of great people who work there. I would definitely work there again under the right circumstances."
good,i was happy to learn the training they provided. We had computer training which taught us how to use the registers and then we learned hands on. the most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers happy that made me happy. The management was unprofessional at times which made me upset.
good,"Working at Walmart was great you got to see a lot of new faces everyday got to help the customers find the products they were looking for, and making sure they had a great shopping experience"
good,"I only worked part time, it was defiantly a much more complicated computer system than i was used to.  The way things were done were slightly backwards to me."
good,Was a cashier for the Neenah Wal-Mart. Co workers were friendly. Managers were there to answer questions. I didn't care much for being a cashier. I'd much prefer to be a sticker but will help wherever needed.
good,Ogres a good place to work for themoney. Quite a bit of over time. Decent pay with wage increase every 6 months until you top out after 2 1/2 years. Starting wage is about $16
good,"It was fast paced work but did not pay well and when I changed stores they cut my hours which did not help me at all, so I was forced to find a better job."
good,Walmart had its ups and downs. When it came to the actual work it was easy going. The pay was pretty good for the amount of days worked. Only worked three days out of the week.
good,"Like working for the company itself & managerial team was very nice, courteous and helpful. Other associates were friendly & very helpful, except for a few younger associates. Overall, it was a good job and wouldn't have left if not for medical condition at time."
good,i worked at walmart for 5 year  while i put myself through college so it got me by until i could get something that paid more money. its a great first job and you can move up it you want to.
good,"Every day was different overall and depended on the shift.  The morning shift was more about setting up the registers, the ending shift dealt with closing them down and the middle dealt with customers more that the other two."
good,Overall the company is a great place to work. If you are looking for a career this is the place for you. They have raised their starting rate to $11.00 dollars.
good,I worked at Walmart for three years as a jewelry associate. It was a great learning experience. I just wish there was more room to grow in the company.
good,"I am hesitant to write a review of Wal-Mart.  Unfortunately, it's a matter of public knowledge that Wal=Mart is not the best place to work.  Their compensation is sub par."
good,I very much enjoyed working with my team.  I found the over night shift was a good family.  My assistant manager at the time was a good teacher to those who needed to be taught new skills.
good,"Prior to accepting a job with the company you should definitely find out about the store you will be working at."
good,Walmart was a really good place to work when I started in 09.  i enjoy my interactions with customers.the hardest part is that the hours are a little inconstant
good,"Like the people I work with, "
good,The smaller Walmart’s are great to work for and if you want the. You have potential to move up. But the bigger Walmart’s and around the city they tend to be less controlled and less like an environment where you’re excited to work.
good,"Walmart is a very good company to work for, offering continuing education and training. Great for meeting and interacting with customers. Fellow employees are also helpful in learning about products uses and locations."
good,"Overall good company to work for with a good management team."
good,It was nice working here friendly environment fast paced can be stressful at times and the managers lack communication. But for the most part it was fun would definitely work here again
good,"A typical work day was stressful from the start but two hours in it would get better. I wasn't properly trained and had to learn from other people before I learned from the person that hired me. I didn't really have someone that properly told to train me, Management had no communication and when I told them I had to quit due to family problems, told my manager and they were to take care of it yet they did not and I was put as someone who abandoned their job."
good,worked all over the store. I like the variety. I didn't like some of the hours. especially around holidays. expected to much of the ones that worked hard.
good,Tâches simples. Beaucoup de pression pour servir les rush de clients. Développe beaucoup le service a la clientèle. Bonnes horaires et pauses.
good,I learned a lot while at Walmart. Some days were better than others. What job doesn't have problems but it's all in how you choose to react/ handle the problems.
good,"I would clock in, go get my radio and keys if there were any left up at the front. I'd go over the schedule to see who my cashiers were for the day or evening. I'd bring or pick u money from registers that needed it. I would have to do 10+ audits a day that I worked. I would run around helping other departments that had a register or even go get products for customers. I'd make sure the cashiers had their break or lunch. I'd ring if it was needed or hop on the customer service desk if they needed help also."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work I enjoy working there,I have learned alot. the most hardest part is when we are short of associate and my job gets a little more hard but over all Walmart is a good place to work."
good,"I got along with the other employees as well. I enjoyed working in"
good,"Decent job, some managers are bad. Plenty of chances for advancement but is based more on favoritism rather than work ethic or performance. Benefits are standard retail job benefits."
good,I worked there as a second job on a part time basis. Co workers were great.  Worked with my schedule and bonus each quarter were nice. Policies could have been enforced a little better.
good,Walmart is a Fortune 1 company that affords people and associates the ability to work and save money so everyone can live better.  I've been with the company for over 17 years.
good,In the span of 1 years they had honestly more than ten management changes which makes our job more difficult it is a battle of power. A change in the chain of command needs to happen
good,Walmart was a nice place to work. Everyone there was friendly and great to work with. Nothing there was hard at all. I enjoyed meeting everyone there and working with them.
good,very friendly would go back to work for them. everything was fast paced and i liked working with different people and different departments. I had fun working with the customers
good,"Comfortable environment to work at. Fast pace with good team work, support from managers and supervisors. There was always a solution to any situation."
good,"Some days are great and some days are not. Just like most retail jobs, you have to know the right people in order to advance or get favors. Overall, it had it good times and bad times."
good,good work for part-time only. not many full-time workers.  will work with school schedule. some managers are good to work with.  some will rotate schedule.
good,"I worked in TLE for a few months, then I was offered a managerial position. It was over TLE. I loved it there. I miss the store and the people I worked with."
good,Overall things go smoothly at WalMart. Aside from corporate pressure every so often things were mostly very laid back and as long as everyone did the tasks we were given that day things went fine
good,Worked for walmart 12 years. Became a co-manager 2 years ago with aspirations of becoming a store manager. Due to company restructure co managers were reduced.
good,"En medio de la crisis económica, varias empresas mexicanas han tenido que apresurar el paso para adecuarse a las exigencias de los mercados globales. Este esfuerzo implica repartir la responsabilidad entre los cuadros directivos y los mandos técnicos, y adoptar aquellos recursos y filosofías que han proliferado en las industrias de todo elmundo que parecen tener por denominador común un rotundo "
good,"Learned things everyday, worked with many different people. Worked many different hours. Fast paced company."
good,"The hardest part of the job was predicting what events are going to occur on a daily.  Anything can happened.  One minute you are taking out trash, the next, you are cleaning a blood spill in one of the restroom stalls."
good,it was a very relaible place to work the hours were consistint and the pay was avrqage the benifits were good and if u really enjoy working around difrent types of people and being around customers its the job for you
good,Working at Wal-Mart was an experience I would recommend to anyone. I could have continued to work at Wal-Mart but it just wasn't right for my life at the time. I would absolutely go back to Wal-Mart once it is able to fit my life style.
good,"A work day a Walmart could sometimes be fun and at times it can seem very exhausting. The Management Team Is Very Help For The Most Part. I Wouldn’t Say Wal-Mart Is A Bad Job , What Job Is Always Supposed To Be Fun ."
good,Its honestly not too bad of a place. Work is fast paced and yes you will have to do other areas of the building if you finish your isles early but that's not a bad thing
good,"i was either stocking the product on the shelves, running the cash register, or showing a customer where something is in the garden center. i learned a lot about the cash register that i did not know and learn how to stock stuff the Wal-Mart way. this is my opinion my management was not very fare to everyone. the work place it was alright not the best. the hardest part of the job was running the cash register when i did not know what i was doing until i learned how to run it. the most enjoyable thing i liked about my job was helping the customers out and knowing that they were happy just made my day."
good,Wonderful work place. Learned a lot of my team work and great interpersonal skills there. Great place to work At. I enjoyed my time working there. Great people
good,Good relationship with coworkers. Management was unfortunately very badly versed in communication.Working at Walmart is a good experience for a person who needs to learn how to work in a diverse workplace.
good,"There was A lot of jealousy/drama with the older coworkers that made it not fun, I didn’t like my checks every two weeks with how much I was doing/working."
good,Nice staff. The staff  treat each other like family. It is very fast paced. there are lots of vaccinations and cosults for otc meds and rxs. Flu season can be very busy and also more potential for getting sick. I love  getting groceries and other items that I need to purchase on my way home. Nice perk to get discount for certain items with employee discount card.  Huge convenience. Nice managers.
good,Walmart has been a great company to work for 31 years. They area charitable company who believes in taking care of their associates and have good benefits.
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart, until the current scheduling system was put into place. I enjoy constantly staying busy and helping assist customers. I enjoy my department."
good,les travailleur y sont tres accueillants et tres dévoués a leur travaux
good,Walmart is a good place to work. They need to figure to a better way to retain people. They need more compassion when it comes to people missing work due to things out of their control like the flue
good,Working was enjoyable. Learned slot about working on a register and how good the customers are. The management at my store wasn't that great. The culture was wonderful. Dealing with rude or hateful customers. Becoming friends with the customers and my Co-workers.
good,the reasons I liked working with because there was always room to grow with the company. Always did not like the politic that goes on at Walmart because management was not far.
good,I was hired help for the Christmas season so I wasn't there too long but I enjoyed the role as a cashier! I also enjoyed working with my fellow employees and management was flexible
good,Walmart is great for the benefits and for job advancement in the company. There are even chances for bonuses. The only downside is management is always switching around. Also salaried management do not always follow what they preach to the associates.
good,Did not get enough hours and was not on schedule full time. Asked to be put on the schedule full time since I was hired full time but it just did not happen
good,"Loved my job...Hours was always changing"
good,its a great place to work. flexible hours to work with you. friendly coworkers. would recommend others to work there. pay is also above average for retail stores.
good,You just can’t live off of this job and be financially stable. This job does give many opportunities it’s just when they cut your hours and you’re not full time it’s really hard to survive well at least for me because I have so many bills.
good,"A typical day at work would involve usually happy, friendly co-workers, but grumpy, rude customers. I learned to not let miserable customers get to you from day to day. Management was very professional and friendly. If you ever needed to talk, they were there. Hardest part of the job for me would be the very rude customers unfortunately. The most enjoyable part would be the co-workers and the actual job itself wasn't too bad and I learned to enjoy it. The only complaint would be that they didn't take what was going on in my life into consideration."
good,"This overall was a pretty good first job, however, the rules were very strict on call-ins and for someone like me that had gone through unexpected health issues, they would not work with me. The pay was good and honestly, it is a good job. They are just too strict with absences. And breaks were very very short. One 15 minute break for a 5 hour shift."
good,"It is a lot better than most jobs out there right now. You can advance through hard work, but the pay is not the best. You do get good benefits, but they are expensive, comong out of your check."
good,"As a cart associate you are meant to get a bunch of carts from the parkinglot and bring them in to be stocked in the bays. The worst days were Monday, Wednesdays, and Sundays. All others were rather easy going and without any trouble. You will be called in to do heavy lifting jobs like carrying a gun safe and loading it into a car, so be ready."
good,putting up displays and seasonal items up and  presenting them for customers with the help of the assistant manager approval and stocking up whatever is left over and making everything look clean and nice for customers
good,"A typical day at work would involve usually happy, friendly co-workers, but grumpy, rude customers. I learned to not let miserable customers get to you from day to day. Management was very professional and friendly. If you ever needed to talk, they were there. Hardest part of the job for me would be the very rude customers unfortunately. The most enjoyable part would be the co-workers and the actual job itself wasn't too bad and I learned to enjoy it. The only complaint would be that they didn't take what was going on in my life into consideration."
good,"Been there for a few years, and from my experience as long as you do your job and do it well, there shouldn't be any issues. There will always be a few people that you don't get along with, but overall everyone is fairly nice"
good,"Wal mart is a good company to work the people are nice, an we all worked well together. The mangers could sometimes ride you, but the were still cool."
good,"come in to work some times have the meeting, that is required, if the manager felt like having it. then i would go and get all my supplies for the day then head to the section i was gonna be working in. the managers would tend to leave me be after that point they were more focused on the other associates getting the fright done."
good,It was the place to work in a small town! It was not a bad place just a lot of rules. People where good and you have okay benefits but there was just   a lot to remember.
good,"My work environment was great but I do my best to make sure everyone around me is in a good mood, and anyone that was just too moody I did my very best to stay clear"
good,The work wasn't stable I always bounced from department to department the management could never make up their mind on anything. I learned a hard work ethic.
good,"Soul sucking but easy work. Varied tasks as well as lots of help. Plenty of training. Management isn't the best, but not too bad. Interesting job to say the least"
good,"Walmart was undergoing lots of changes in the areas I worked at, I had few associates to work for me and I managed to do most of the work myself.  Very tiring."
good,"People were always in and out of walmart, so it stayed busy if you had 2nd shift. Everyone had their own job to do and usually did it well. I didnt like having to stand up for 8 hours, because I have back problems."
good,Nice place to work if you are people friendly but you have to be a motivated person to endure the stresses of the job or you will crumble under the pressure.
good,"The management was terrible, heartless and inconsiderate. The environment was tolerable and I like working for Walmart. If ever employed there again, maybe the manger and staff may be more professional."
good,"overall good, good health benefits, good team work, good communication, good foreman, good supervisor, good safety training, good vacation pay, good qc,"
good,"typical day requires no micromanagement, and taking care of customers. The jobs within the company are physical and can take a tole on the body. The company is big on individuals learning more than one job function."
good,"I was a cart attendant. I removed the grocery carts from the parking lot. The only time you did not work if it was lightening. Otherwise rain,sleet,or snow your in the parking lot. They did give me 2 15 min. breaks and an hour lunch..which was nice."
good,It was really nice working here considering the fact you would get paid 9.00 an hour but as a seasonal cashier you really had to be buddy buddy with managers in order to keep a job here.
good,everyday was a different day depending on the people you worked with and the job you was assigned. meeting new customers was the best part of the job.
good,Served customers in a fast and courteous manner. Very busy environment. Most management were very fair and easy to go to when there was an issue. The hardest part of the job was cranky customers and long hours standing in one place. The most enjoyable part of this job was my coworkers
good,At the time management there was good no problems did my job was a overnight cashier for seasonal position. I would have stayed there but my assignment ended on January.
good,Es una muy buena empresa y lugar laboral con horarios accesibles para estudiantes
good,"I only worked a few hours a day and I seen so much turnover because the lack of management, benefits, and pay. There was never enough employees to cover a lot of the areas."
good,one of my favorite places to work. wouldnt mind going back there. the people were fun to work with and managers were cool. really enjoyable very easy job
good,It was nice working night shift. Working with a team making sure the store is neat before opening hours. The shift crew wasn't crowed. We got work done at our own pace.
good,Wal-Mart is a good company though your experien e kinda depends whether you have good managers. Some days you have a lot of freight and some days you don't also some days or weeks you have a lot of hours or you dont
good,The building is pretty large so positions in one area of the store is likely. You are pushed to do the best that you can do and it can be pretty fast-paced.
good,"If I could get my job back there I would, but I couldn’t unless the deli stocker they have now quit. It was a fast paced and hard job, but I enjoyed it."
good,"Anybody knows to stay away from walmart...The management is constantly changing, communication is horrible, shop lifting seems to be ok, you put time in weeks in advance and they still schedule you to work"
good,"the work is fast paced, must be able to withstand cold temperatures and provide excellent customer service. management is great and willing to cooperate with schedules."
good,The struggle with the particular Walmart I worked at was lack of management. The managers aren't knowledgable and they aren't availiable or willing to help associates.
good,Management worked with my hours and gave me extra shifts in different departments. I enjoyed how management treated employees. We received a 1 hour lunch break and a 15 minute break every 2 hours.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good stepping stone in the career opportunity chain. Although I did not think management at my store was the best, I overall enjoyed working there. My job was simple and easy to perform. I was never under too much stress."
good,"my mind was always busy and i was on the move constantly, i learned that no matter what there is always someone there to help you. the hardest part was the management i didnt have anyone to go to to report for supplies"
good,A lot of the reason that I did not like this job was because I did not like smelling like deli meat all day. We were also there for a long time after we were supposed to leave a few times cleaning. The reason that I quit was because I was moving immediately to Ohio.
good,I really enjoyed working with the crew that I was with. I had a great supervisor who was really understanding of the fact that I had another full time job in the day. He listened to any concerns and took care of any issues that we had in the back. He didn't just give orders he actually got in there and helped us unload the truck as well.
good,"depends on the manager you get"
good,I did enjoy working with my co-workers some of them at least. I also the hours I worked. Working on my hands and knees did my knees in. I have had several problems with my one knee.
good,A typical day at work include stocking the shelves and helping customers. I learned how to help customers and about product placement. I felt that the management at walmart was a hit or miss. Some managers were very effective and cared about their jobs but others were just there for the paycheck and did not care about their job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and keeping your cool. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people and learning new skills.
good,"Some managers were logical, friendly, and reasonable and some were worthless, trouble-makers. All associates are suppose to be cross-trained on cash register and the area they usually work,but only the women were called to registers when extra helped needed and complained about because the stocking was not finished. Again it just depends if you have a good manager or one who just wants to boss people around without regard for what he assigned."
good,Shift started at 10pm with a associate meeting .... information was given to us about our perfomance and how much are sales were for that day ... not really alot of micro managing due to the shift ... toughest obstacle was tring to help customers and get your task done %100 ... but helping the customers and seeing the joy in their faces was an awesome feeling for me anyway ...
good,"Flexible, hours tend to change, and does management, no over time, but good co workers and some good benefits. Can be demanding during the holidays, offers holiday pay."
good,"at Walmart I had to collect shopping carts for the customers, I had worked there for 5 years. The people who worked there was always willing to help. I always felt like I did a hard days work when I clocked out."
good,"a good temporary gig until you find the job of your dreams.  The hours aren't bad and if you're fortunate enough to get into a store with a good management staff, you may find opportunities to move up."
good,"Walmart was a very easy, laid back job. I worked as a cashier so my day went by super quick, especially when the tore was busy!!! Its a job I would recommend if you're patient, easy to get along with and just an overall good attitude. Make sure you always leave your customer satisfied."
good,"I loved this job. I just got sick from my cancer and wasnt a reliable emplyee anymore. I take pride in being dependable, so I left. If given the chance I would return."
good,"The company is a good way to get yourself into the work force. Your days would vary depending on how many people or how busy it was during the day. Management was good to work with, if you had any problems or needed help they were there to help."
good,Ok to work for didn't pay that great didn't give me enough hours to qualify for benefits. Management was ok employees were fine to work with. Again not enough hours.
good,"I worked at two different Walmart locations. They were really good with hours due to I was I'm school at the time.  Plus working another job. All and all, good."
good,Fast paced environment and hot in the facility when temperature hot . When cold it’s a little cold inside as well unless you’re working hard . Pay could be better
good,"Walmart as a company was very understanding of hour restrictions and any form of disability as per worker, although the company and store are massive it feels very individualized help."
good,My daily life at work was coming in clocking and in and being told where i was going to work to help customers better in the store. I liked Walmart because my customer liked me. It was a good feeling knowing customers liked you.
good,"It is very stressful because you are overloaded with more tasks than one person can handle. Also, you have several managers contradicting each other on what should be a priority for that day. Job makes it very hard to spend time with your family due to having to stay over and work at least an hour late most days."
good,"I liked working as a cashier at Wal-Mart.  I am a people person, and I enjoyed interacting with many different people throughout the day.  Some days it was difficult to stand all day, but I got used to it.  I eventually learned all of the departments.  Being able to work different departments as needed made the job more fun."
good,"Great job to have. Worked overnight 24 hours store. Decent management but the new store manager is very rude, self absorbed, and extremely petty! Otherwise go for it."
good,"A good company to work for, except I hated 3rd shift. Also they have a very strict attendance policy for the first three months. I caught the flu and was out too many days."
good,Very fast paced production based company.  I was a Fork Lift Operator but there were many times when you are stacking product and cutting plastic off of the Product.  Very time stressful due to everyone on a production based system.
good,"I enjoy Walmart I enjoy being a cashier the customers were nice. I learned how to use the  register ,cleaning the register I did reshop. Reshop is when a customer comes to your register and put stuff back that they don't want anymore and you have to go around the store and put it back on the shelves where it belongs"
good,Performs administrative support for the Training Academies by providing relevant information to the team and participants. Plans events and activities.
good,Al llegar al trabajo se relizaba un pequeña junta con un baile algo peculiar para iniciar operaciones de una muy buena manera
good,Great people to work with.
good,Good place to work. The high turnover rate for store managers makes it hard to continue to meet everyone's expectations. There is a difference of opinion between operations and loss prevention.
good,Working at walmart is pretty fast paced for the most part. However i dont think the hourly pay coincides with the amount of work the employees have to do
good,"It was an easy enough job, could be stressful at times but nothing to crazy. But a lot of favoritism. Sometimes it could be unfair and some employees got special treatment even when they weren't the best workers, however they were friends with the supervisors outside of work so there work didn't matter."
good,It's a good company to work for with many good benefits that are provided to the employees and there's a lot of room to move up with in the company for many people.
good,Very fast paced. Helping customer load groceries onto the belt and into the basket. Scanning items. And also doing special sales on items. Entering items upc.
good,Walmart gives you an opportunity to advance to a high position.  You will get breaks on time with no hassle.  The pay is good  but varies with different positions.
good,"Clean working space, mostly friendly coworkers, easy going atmosphere, quick paced but not hectic, fulfilling work, potential for advancement and benefits."
good,Typical work day ensuring customers orders went put correctly I was over online grocery where as 50 orders went out daily reports customer service managed a team of 15
good,"Fixed hours depending on job status. Some managers are friendly and work with the associates. The hardest part of the job is the hours, specially for overnight  workers."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work, it pays my bills and extras. The only down side is the amount of hours need to complete your job, but like any job it has its flaws."
good,"The work itself and the people were good.  I had to leave the company because it was to far from where I lived.  Overall, my experience working with them was just fine."
good,"Working for Walmart as a cashier was very stressful because if the customers were having a bad day they always took it out on you and you just have to take whatever they throw your way. The benefits of Walmart are great though, they pay a good wage and you also get a discount card."
good,Working at Walmart had its ups and downs. The staff was friendly but the management was always inconsistent. They showed so much favoritism. They picked and choose there favorite to do other jobs such as returns and restocking the front end. The most enjoyable thing about the jobs and the interaction to customers.
good,bad management thats my only complaint nice place clean good customers. management need alot more work thing get held up from waiting on management that is never around
good,"It was retail work. Clock in, assist customers, recover the store, repeat.  Learned the basics of inventory management here, it was fun but extremely important. You can't sell from an empty wagon, and we wanted to sell. Focus on associates as well, people are your best part.  The basis for everything I have become as a manager and leader."
good,Offered beneficial skills that'll be beneficial in pursuing future career. The Walmart I worked at was rather small but managed to revamp their store by changing employees at the time with associates like me and maximized their budget.
good,It was an exciting job that always changed. It was always different and exciting. You had a lot of chance to move up in positions. Discounts on products.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working with Walmart. My biggest gripe would be that stores will vary depending on who your store manager is. They have good structure that they are supposed to follow but Walmart allows some deviation at the store managers discretion. This can sometimes cause micromanaging and lead to distrust. Managers often have communication issues and could use assistance with delegation. If you enjoy helping customers, or just have superb customer service skills, Walmart is a good place for you. Good customer service is rewarded very often."
good,"Buen equipo de trabajo, pero hay mucha preferencia. Es un trabajo al cual no tienes vida familiar y aunque estes disponible todos los dias cualquier turno te dejan fijo en el turno que a ellos les convenga."
good,"Stressful but fun workplace. Great benefits  "
good,"Working in bakery is pretty simple and easy."
good,"I originally started as a cleaner for meat and produce. Over time, I worked my up to stocker, and up to Mod Team. The management was great when I first started, but as time went on, the management got worse. Stocking, and remodeling shelving for new/old product was mainly was I was assigned to do. Overall the job was peaceful, straight forward, and I worked at my own pace."
good,El compañerismo y trato con asociados era muy bueno.
good,"Sometimes slow, other times fast paced. Angry rude customers sometimes. Some managers were also rude and didn't seem to know how to do their jobs in my store most of the time. Easy work if you don't mind dealing with people."
good,"Great work environment, flexible hours, and has great advancement opportunities. Everyday is great day to work here. Employees help each other a lot here."
good,"First get there at 10:00pm. Clean all the registers and zone (pick up misplaced things) until 11:00. Then got on the register and rang people out, cashed checks and did returns/exchanges. Then when we got slow during the middle of the night, Stalk gum/candy throughout register 1-24."
good,It was fine to work there. its work and thats why they pay you. Good place to be. Hd fun and when they celebrate they go all out for there employees. like food in great amounts and gift aat holidy times.
good,"I'm working on my two years at Walmart, though I never thought I'd be here this long. I like my job, the people I work with are great, but I see people come and go because we aren't paid enough for the job we do."
good,They have a very clean building  long hours but the time flys they have paid 20 min. Breaks and you can bring you own lunch or but from their on site store they also have a smoking area
good,slow in morning but progresses as day goes on. Learned how to work in a fact pace environment  and provide excellent customer service. Enjoyed working in a friendly environment.
good,"Alot of tedious work to keep you busy. Some day are easier than others, but you can expect to work. Walmart is kind of like its own community with different social groups."
good,"Walmart is a fast paced and productive workplace, I have experience as a sales associate, pushing carts, working in the deli and unloading trucks. Walmart is a good place to learn about retail."
good,A typical day would include bagging items and handling irritated customers. The hardest part is getting used to standing in one spot for 2+ hours but you get used to it.
good,Dedicated route driver of tractor trailers for Wal-Mart. Delivering both good and general merchandise in a timely manor. Also doing dot physicals and logs..
good,"The daily routine mostly includes providing the utmost customer service at all times. Other tasks include stocking freight, counting money, inventory checks, and keeping building clean and safe."
good,"Overall great job, minor issues with management. Good hours, good pay, large workforce. Helpful in learning how to properly communicate with customers in stressful situations."
good,"nice place to work, it offers the opportunity to meet very interesting people. The people that i worked with understood that we worked in close quarters and that the work had to be done to the customer's satifaction."
good,"Pros"
good,Walmart is a very stressful place to work. There is alot of politics in Walmart. It's face paced. Very by the books policy kinda place. I enjoy a more lay back environment is
good,Walmart was a place that kept you busy and productive. I learned a lot about good customer service and how to make sure customers left the store satisfied with their visit.
good,I’d recommend anyone to work at Walmart. Great management and employees are helpful. It’s a great team environment. If a customer wanted to know if they were getting great information on products they would be very pleased with Walmart.
good,"Their open door policy is a joke that management bypasses. If management would properly deal with other associates who create a hostile work environment, everything about working there would be fine."
good,Its not a completely terrible place to work but the amount of work you do in one week does not equal out to the pay you get. When management gets yelled at by the big bosses for their screw ups they take it out on you. then you have the older associates trying to boss around the younger associates into doing their work on top of their own.
good,Love it. I love meeting and greeting people on a daily basis. I love to help others and make a difference in someone else life. There is space for advancement
good,When I worked in the pharmacy at Wal-mart in San Leandro. I love the people I worked with and the patients that I served. The Wal-mart I worked in Brentwood they employees were not friendly and the manager customer service manager would always avoid me. But I always made friendly conversations with the customers.
good,"nice palce and culture but not salary best on depend working "
good,"Working at Walmart for the past 6 years has been rewarding. Considering the flexible hours I was given during my years at school, my grades were good."
good,I worked in customer service. It was a fast paced and ever changing environment.  I sincerely enjoyed meeting all the different people. I usually worked late evenings.
good,CSMs don't know what they are doing or take forever to respond to their call. Managers seem to just walk around the store talking to another. They hardly seem to do work.
good,"Mostly Stable hours with strong benefits if you can slog through the buddy buddy way of handing out work."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart . It was a good place to be.  You got a chance to meet a lot of interesting people. I didn't l8ke working overnight.  In all I worked for Walmart 20 years.  I have been a sticker, a Department manager, a supervisor over ICS, an a tech in automotive.  It's been a fun journey"
good,everyone knows how walmart is. so knowing how it is going in will help you working there. not too hard on people. pretty relaxed as long as you do your job.
good,"The company and it's policies were always good for me. Management was not always up to par, but changed regularly. "
good,Walmart is a large employer for this area and struggles to keep good employees with constant hour reductions and inconsistent raises.  Loved working here and the people.  Left for more hours.
good,"a typical day would be stocking the shelves, cleaning the sales floor and backroom, and working picks. poor management is the only bad part of the job"
good,"This was a fun part-time job to have. While being a physically demanding job, work was fast-paced and fun. There was plenty of time to talk with those you worked with while getting the job done."
good,"Busy, you'll meet different kinds of people."
good,"Working as a cashier at WalMart can be both rewarding and frustrating in the same day.  At the Holland one that I work at there is a  very diverse group of shoppers.  One must be on your best game to be able to properly wait on them and give them the utmost service they deserve.  You also need to  be a very talented multitasked person to be able to check out groceries, bag groceries, talk to the customer if need be and help load their cart if they have a large amount.  Next, you need to collect the payment and process it accordingly.  Thank them for their business.  Of course this is the"
good,great company to learn self esteem and happy that i worked there because i learned too much there because i have been trained by the best managers and supervisors
good,"Walmart is and interesting environment for a job many different events took place there. There pay just was not cutting it for me and my 3 kids, so i parted ways. Being a single dad was rough."
good,"Siempre me eh destacado en todos mis trabajos komo uno de los mejores."
good,some of management was ok the poeple that work there are also ok it all depends were and when u work its deff not the worst but deff not the best by far
good,Walmart was a nice company to work for as far as the hours goes. They definitely pay pretty nice for people who need a consistent income. Sometimes you can be over worked though.
good,Overall it is a good place to work if you plan on staying a low level associate. Majority of the managers that are hired in at Walmart were hired in as managers and didn’t have to be a regular associate and do all the dirty work so to speak. The thing about promoting is you have to kiss enough of the right butt to get anywhere and that’s not the kind of company I want to work for.
good,the days were tough the hours were long but we had fun and enjoyed spending the times together working with each other. good pay and great coworkers that were all there for each other.
good,"The day gets very busy and hactic during the afternoon time, Get a decent lunch time and if you are not feeling good your team is always there to make sure you are good"
good,"The company is a great company to work for. Management at store, market and regional level lacks continuity with Home Office Policies. The company takes care of it's associates; however, store, market and regional direct you to do tasks that are not and should not be assigned to an hourly associate."
good,"Great place to work for high school and college students, co workers were friendly. Discount card shows their appreciation for their employees. Fast work enviornment."
good,It was a new location and they were very under trained and had a lack of knowledge on how to schedule hours and plan for busy times. So to cut everyone's hours at the busiest time of year was stressful to a lot of employees.
good,Walmart was a good company to work for. The only thing that I did not enjoy was the amount of work you were expected to do with such a small team. Some managers were disconnected from the staff and did not make me feel as if we were a team.
good,"A typical day is coming in and making sure that front end is cleaned and zoned.  Assisting customers with scanning their items, helping them look for certain things, helping them with returns or cashing checks."
good,I went through an agency. It was really fast  paced and competitive. management cared more  about numbers than employees safety. If you did get hurt they basically fired you.
good,productive workplace. had a great time working here. great pay. the management were very nice and helpfully. i learned a lot working for this company.
good,"It was a pretty good place to work, but should have gotten a raise for the amount of overtime I put in.  Some managers knew what they’re ere doing other had no idea how to schedule properly, there were days when no one was scheduled to come in. But the days when we were given free snacks were awesome, and the people were great to work with."
good,It was always something new and it was always busy so you had to constantly be moving in order to get everything done in the time you were actually given.
good,Es un trabajo donde puedes desarrollar varias habilidades y capacidades
good,"i worked here for awhile and had nice co-workers. management was nice but didn't communicate very well with each other, i sometimes would have three assistant managers come up to me and ask me to do a task differently then i was asked before. if they communicated i fell this would not have been a huge issue. other then that it was a good place to work, decent pay."
good,"This job was great. But the pay wasn't enough and they wouldn't hire on fulltime. Met lots of great people, you constantly stayed busy so it made the shift go soo much quicker."
good,I enjoyed working there. Dont have any complaints so far. Would refer them to anyone looking for a career. You can easily move up in the company as well.
good,Walmart is a really busy store to work at. Also a fun place to do your shopping with associates always there if you need help on finding your items. It’s a good place to start your first  job
good,"Bon travail d'équipe , gens sympathique, bonne gérance."
good,I worked there for a number of years and advanced quite quickly from part time to full time employment. It is great that they post in house before posting publicly.
good,"I work there as a seasonal worker. They give you a lot hours. I worked in many departments like shoes, baby , grocery, health and beauty , clothes , jewelry and even was a cashier. You got to have a flexible schedule."
good,"Very fun place to work at. The staff were great, the customers were great and the overnight Walmart team I worked with felt like a very good co-hesive unit"
good,"Nonstop Hardworking environment. I learned about working on oil changes, batteries, and tire work.  I also learned how to be a part of a team and no question was bad. I learned to get along with authority. The hardest part of my job was getting people not to call in all the time.  The most enjoyable part of  my job was the satisfaction of a job well done."
good,Wonderful experience and it become more interesting and challenging when you have a good supervision. And you feel the difference. I give all the credit to the night crew.
good,"cashier job was good"
good,meet and greet customers and help with the daily sales of merchandise. I learned to have patience with the elderly and help them a little more. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,For the most part wasnt a bad job managements inability to plan ahead or even think things through left me constantly trying to fix the holes in their ideas
good,"Considering the Stigma attached to working at a place such as Wal-Mart, it actually isn't that bad of a job. Pay is decent for the work required, and the employee culture is great."
good,Fast paced environment with great managers to help make your job easier. Hardest part of the job was stocking new items. Most enjoyable part of the job were team meetings
good,Walmart is an good job and is a very productive work place da associates are friendly and helpful sometimes the manager be pushing too hard and over working. Wal-Mart taught me a lot and was my first real job
good,Walmart gives you a good look at what retail is really like all walks of life go to Walmart and you get to see the full spectrum and you can learn just about anything that you will use out in real life outside of the store and you can meet long time friends who you will never forget
good,"I learned to handle monetary transactions and met some wonderful people but management were always telling everyone conflicting tasks to do, starting childish drama, and started to cut everyone's hours majorly."
good,"Es una muy buena empresa, que tiene facilidades para que sigas creciendo"
good,"Walmart is a very cool, family oriented place to work.  I went to work with a smile on my face everyday and my customer service skills surely increased."
good,"Fun while our office existed,  office in Bartlesville closed down or would have still been there.  great woek life balance offered flex days and fun work environment"
good,"Constant moving of product to sales floor-Most days you will feel like a donkey dragging product to sales floor day in and day out!  Schedules are never the same way twice, no matter if you are full time or part time.  You may close one night, only to come in first thing in the morning, you will not be able to work another job, even if part time.  Pay is better than fast foods, and gets better the longer you work there!  Eventually, leaving can be hard, as other retail will have hard time matching, but will take years to get there!  You get benefits even at part time, some paid holidays, some paid time off, and some benefits, not a lot, but better than TARGET for sure!  Customers are on lower end of wage scales, education and hygiene.  Stealing seems to be a full time job for most and frustrating for store employees to witness hourly!  Can be fun, make lots of new friends and ever changing lines coming and going.  Mods change daily, as well as pogs and products!  Be prepared to work, pull freight all day to sales floor!"
good,I am actually still hired seasonal with Walmart it is a quick paced atmosphere with plenty of room for advancement the pay and benefits could have been better but overall great experience
good,"A typical day at work would begin by unloading a trucks freight within a specific time frame, which was usually two hours. After unloading, everyone would be given a specific department to stock the inventory. During work, it was important to prioritize customer satisfaction, and safety of everyone."
good,Enjoyed pleasant customers and did not care unpleasant customers  there are nice associates and unpleasant associates . I liked the constant busy times  but was a office worker before this so I kind of miss that
good,bad management and people will tell on you for no reason. problem is the people never get in trouble for integrity. great pay and nice shop area. bad health insurance.
good,"Was fun and had very happy and playful coworkers. Job wasn’t to stressful unless it was around the holidays. However, you received holiday pay for working on those days."
good,un ambiente laboral muy agradable como también una constante capacitación en sus áreas para sus trabajadores
good,Lots of people don’t think Wal-Mart is a good place to work at but it really is. Pay is not the greatest but you can always get raises and there is lots of room for advancement.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance                                                           "
good,I really enjoyed working for walmart i ended up having to relocate with no ride to get to or from work & no family or support system for help in anyway since it was just me & my two kids at the time.  I had no choice but to give up my job now that my whole family has moved here from hawaii I have the best support system & all the help I need to get back on my feet.
good,"Aprendes de todo un poco:"
good,A typical day of work would be pushing lots of carts and helping people to their cars. i would have a good amount of rest to the amount of work i did.
good,"Es una empresa preparada , realmente buena, solamente tienen muy mal ambiente laboral , cosa que es fundamental en una empresa de esta magnitud."
good,Was able to learn different departments.  Was trained and worked many different areas of store.  Management was real good.  Quick response time.  Management worked with staff on issues with staff on a timely manner
good,"Field Project Supervisor is a traveling job. Traveling is fun but because of being away you tend to work longer hours. You have an opportunity to get a close bond with you team because of being away for so long. You tend to lose track of your work home balance, and your days off don't always line up with normal days off so its hard to hang out with your friends and family when you are home."
good,Low job security with little room for advancement. Compensation to low. Benefits poor. Poor management. Management failed to address concerns of the customer. Customers were great.
good,"Fair wages, good management, inflexible schedule. Great way to interact with customers and learned many valuable Customer Service skills. Ended up leaving due to lack of schedule flexibility."
good,shifts go fast when its busy. They did generally make sure you get your break about every 2 hours. $10/hour is not bad pay. but t was just a Christmas thing to make some extra money.
good,Walmart is a really cool place to work I liked it but the mangers sucked like seriously ever nowhere to be found when you needed them the customers were rude but the pay was cool . The most I ever made
good,"The day will consist of taking care of customers needs, hearing them out and making sure the customers  were satisifed in a courtesy  and friendly manner."
good,more pay would be nice and more of an incentive to stay as well as being able to train in differetm areas versus what you was hired for so that one can progress quicker
good,"Me gustó mucho el ámbito laboral ya q trabaje en Chango más cuando abrió en González catan y quiero el trabajo"
good,"great job, learned a whole from diffident people and diffident skills. pay was okay, off days sucks, but good money and get days off. hard to keep on track."
good,Working in retail is extremely fast paced and at times very stressful.   I learned a lot of patience and better communication skills.  I really liked the people I worked with there.  Contrary to popular belief they offer great benefits and the pay is decent.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get so much done in an 8 hour day.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when I can help a customer with something and they truly appreciate it.
good,Aprendí a trabajar en equipo y a tener tolerancia.
good,It was a good place to work. If you are looking for a job that can be fast paced in a team player environment then look no further than your nearest Wal-Mart supercenter.
good,I do have to say I have been with Walmart for 10+ years and have no way to move up. I have a Bachelor's degree in Business Management and just 1 of 7 managers congratulated me on it and I was not happy. I should of stayed at the other Walmart I was at in which they would of moved me up quick but I had to leave for family reasons. So therefore I have decided to move on and start a new career in Sales.
good,Great opportunity for college students who have not yet chosen a career path. You will gain experience in many ways working at for this company. You will also gain leadership attributes.
good,"Working at Wal-mart was a good experience, enabling employees to gain meaningful experience in a fast-paced, physical environment. Company policy allows employees time to become accustomed to the physical aspect of the job and will often work with employees who struggle to be proficient in certain job duties. This often results in success and long-term stability for Wal-mart employees."
good,this job was very a quick passed job i was always on my feet had to remember codes work with money all the time i had to learn to get out of my shell and talk to people overall a bit stressful
good,A typical day at work would entail unnecessary stress beyond beyond belief. 32 hours of working and after tax i'd have 600 directly deposited into my account.
good,Work was relaxed but needed a fast pace when busy. Hour long lunches mad you look forward to breaks and not rushed compared to the regular 30 minute breaks.
good,I Enjoyed the job but I people were just acting funny as if they didn’t want me there. Everyday i Still came in and did my very best everyday no matter what .!
good,Great place to work however they laid me off.  Have to be quick and must be able to lift weight.  The hard part is you have to multi task.  The other downside is you have to work every weekend.
good,its a nice place to work an to build you social skill but the management can be a little more understanding. an its not a hard job to perform. if need help its there.
good,"Liked working there, it was just a temporary job. I also had school so my hours were cut short. The distance was far from where i lived to it made traansportating difficult."
good,"I worked as a zoner. That meant that I folded clothes and pciked up missing items and place them in their corresponding places. I worked from 11pm to 7am."
good,"Team Setting"
good,"Constantly helping customers, learning how to deal with difficult situations, a long process when asking management to help with something, coworkers make it fun and enjoyable."
good,Walmart gave me good hours and treated their employees well and were understanding if I had to take time off because my kids were sick or during family emergencies.
good,helping sort the items that the customers didn't purchase and make sure they got back to the correct department. then I would check out the purchases that the customers wanted.
good,It has good days and bad days. Anywhere you work in the DC you had challenges and difficulties that made you better at your job. Once the day was done you go home and enjoy some time off before you do it again.
good,"stressful, fast paced. Doesn't appreciate the hard work of the associates and especially long term associates. unfair disciplinary actions. fantastic benefits"
good,"I loved working at Wal-Mart,  but for the work I put in and time, the pay and advancement options were not very good. "
good,"Walmart has wonderful dental, vision, and health insurance. Walmart also offers good paid time off for Vacation and for health related issues. The pay was also very decent and the work if fast paced."
good,"I was a cashier at the pharmacy so I would check out customers prescriptions. Sometimes I would take prescription orders or fill some scripts if we were short staffed. I learned about customers and how to work in a more fast-paced environment. The manager of the pharmacy is phenomenal. He is very personable and great with customers. Customers love him. He is also very flexible with scheduling hours, and if you needed a day off, he would make it work. He is hard working and doesn't give himself enough credit for how well he does. The hardest part of the job was just dealing with grumpy customers, and it would become very stressful if it got busy all of a sudden. I loved the people I worked with. It was such a laid back friendly work environment."
good,If you’re into fast pace workplace this is the place to work you know is that you meet different people it’s family-friendly once you get to know everybody like your coworkers you go to love them some of them you know it will be a better place if  management. Was on the same page as everyone in the weather so quick to not honor your availability everything would be better
good,"I really enjoyed being a cashier and electronics sales associate, but my favorite part of the job was running the 1 Hour Photo Lab. I loved developing customer film and printing out their pictures."
good,"Fast paced office, Good management, some policies are a little weird and the pace of work can be overwhelming to some. Must be able to deal with large portion of public looking for something for nothing."
good,Its a busy store where people from multi culture come and shop; and you should stand for very long time on your feet which is little bit hard for people who didn't do physical jobs. I learned about the customer service and it has a great management which is so enjoyable.
good,"I worked at Walmart part time during high school, it was a relatively fun and friendly job in terms of working with the people and customers. A typical day of work included stocking shelves and helping customers find items. The management changed very often, but other than that it was an enjoyable part time position."
good,"its fast paced  job. you don't  realize the time passing which is a good thing.the environment is great, lovely people to work with, u get breaks every 2 hours."
good,I appreciated most of my years with the company.  Customer based was appreciative of the attention they were given when I would consult with them about their medications.
good,they are quick paced and very friendly i worked in ga and it was a good experience for me i would recommend the job to someone else if i had the chance i would work there again
good,It was great. I would show up early to work so I could get my things together. As soon as it was time for me to clock in I would do so and spend the remainder of my shift completing the tasks that were given to me.
good,Overall the people and work were good. Some stress during holidays .Mostly good working .Still in contact with most of my former coworkers.I made some very good friends.
good,"Relação com colegas, supervisores e gerencia boa para se trabalhar. administração não muito atenciosa com problemas a serem resolvidos com uma certa relevância/urgência. Higiene geral não muito agradável, baratas nas esteiras do caixa (dava vergonha quando uma aparecia quando o cliente estava passando sua compra), no estoque muitos gatos (dormiam e faziam suas necessidades para todo lado). Salário compatível com o cargo. Refeição no local ( Cobrando 1,00 por refeição). Não tinha cesta básica. Chegava tarde em casa devido a ficar esperando todos na perua pra ir embora ( mesmo o motorista dirigindo igual um louco e desrespeitando as leis de transito totalmente). Mercado pegou fogo e não esta mais operando."
good,"most pf the hardest parts are dealing with the management and with the customers."
good,"Walmart was a good place to be if you like going at a fast pace when times got busy, the holidays was like a mad house but it's Walmart...I liked the discount ya got but could have been more"
good,"Walmart is very fast paced and sufficient well the supervisors i worked for  ,I learned to stock fast on timely matter you have  the store looking nice."
good,"Greet customers as they come into or exit the facility, scan items being purchased, bag customers items, take customers payment method, give receipt, offer customers a credit card, to always maintain a clean check out stand,"
good,"I liked working at Walmart. It was definitely a challenging job, but it was pretty fun and rewarding. There's a 10% discount for an employee and they give decent healthcare benefits as well as sick-days / unpaid time off. I ended my career there because a new person who did the scheduling kept having me work days that I needed off, and when I confronted that person about it, they did nothing about it. I didn't like working for Walmart for two reasons: 1 is that they usually expect you do kept an unreasonable amount done and 2) is that you have to work on Black Friday. Other than that I would easily go back there."
good,"Working at walmart was a good experience, he hardest or the most stressful part about it was the limited time given to complete an aisle. Besides that, it is a fun place to work. It has good employees, and management is decent."
good,"Poor Management, but overall good place to work. The hardest part of the job was the high school drama. Good pay for the job that was being done. I would go back if i had too."
good,"It was a worthwhile experience. Walmart does not treat its associates the best all the time, but this can vary store from store wildly. There is a lot of inconsistencies."
good,"Possessed the ability to communicate effectively with others"
good,A lot of great people there working with you and manage was good to me. They like to hire within so if you put in the man hours chances are you could move up to a higher postion
good,You get to meet lots of interesting people. Most days go by fast because you stay busy. The only bad part about working as a cashier was when business was slow.
good,"I was a stocker for the pharmacy department, my job was to replenish the shelves,clean and put back re-shop at night. The hardest part was putting all that freight away b efore the shif ended. The work culture was diversed but the best park you got to work as a team"
good,"Some of the management was amazing to work with, but most if not all of them have moved on. Either promoted or left the company. And granted there was some impossible ones too."
good,"The life at Walmart is pretty hard, to be honest. You really do start from the bottom and it is hard to get up through the ranks to be a ""valued"" member of the company it feels like."
good,"I work Monday through Friday, from 5am to 2pm"
good,"No two days were alike, it was fast paced but the coworkers and coaches helped when needed. If someone needed help all they had to do was ask, example if someone didn't have their forklift license and needed someone to up stack pallets or get a pallet down from racking whomever had a license would help them. The best part of the job is that everyone had to clean and help keep the dock running smooth so everyone played a part working as a team!"
good,They have good customer service and good breaks. They have many options for work areas. They have the options to advance to higher positions. They are looking for hard working people.
good,"Uma empresa boa, mas presenciei algumas coisas que prefiro não comentar."
good,"Walmart is a pretty easy job if you pay attention, as with any other job. The management isn't always so great but it never get out of hand and you always have help."
good,Worked a lot on our own. Scheduled appointments for delivery. Entered inventory into system to match what was shipped to stores. Figure out any errors. Make charts of trailers in the truck yard.
good,It's a good place to work starting out but I wouldn't recommend staying there longer than a year. At least in my experience the managers play favorites really badly.
good,"L'ambiance est agréable et plaisante à y travailler, les autres employés sont gentils."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was actually entertaining and educational. You meet new people, make new friends. I am the type of person that loves the fast pace. The fact that you are always busy makes your days go by fast."
good,"From the time i would clock in to the time i clock out, people were non stop very caring and say hello when walking by. Management was very nice were always on top of there game. I learned more communication skills, i learned mainly all basic things you would need to know for a first job. The hardest and most stressful times were when i would be close to clock out time ( at midnight ) many customers would come in at one time and it would only be one or two cashiers handling it. which made it hard to clock out on time and i would roll into over time."
good,The people are OK to work with. You get breakfast on Fridays. Some of the mangers are alright to work with. Most days were alright if we we didn't have much to do.
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you really want Walmart as you career. if you don't want Walmart as a career opportunity then its not the place for you.
good,I enjoy working with the customer but some days can be stressful. The management there is good. I don't really have a hard part of my job. A typical day at work is making sure i do my best to keep the customers happy.
good,working at Walmart was a delight the company treats there employees with respect and it a good place  learn different jobs and you can climb up the ladder pretty fast with hard work
good,It is extremely satisfying to be able to guide clients about any doubt related to the merchandise and to be able to help them locate it within the store.
good,A very fast pace job when trying to unload the trucks on time and making sure everything is stocked correctly on to pallets. We would take the pallets to the floor for the overnight workers to stock.
good,It is extremely physical. I love the people I work with but the job itself is hard and they don't give much notice of overtime. Most managers are easy to work with.
good,The work place was fine but the organization was horrible. They hardly ever had enough people working and i was poorly trained. Thanks to my prior experience and the fact that I am a fast learner I was able to learn as I went.
good,ok place to work if you are flexable with your work schedule and can live on part time. Most of the time thats all that walmart hires is part time people.  Insurance is ok  at least you have the option to have insurance if you work enough hrs.
good,Folding clothes and covering the fitting room was a typical day at work. I learned how to answer phones and fold clothes. The hardest part of my job was when everyone would give me their stuff to do on top of what i had to do.
good,"I started out on the floor unloading trucks, then went to loading trucks, then was able to drive a lift.  Much easier work.  Hard to make quotas. But decent pay."
good,"The pay was good, the hours were great, and the management was good and you didn't have someone breathing down your neck shouting orders at you. The only negative side was that you had to pick up the slack for some workers, or you'd get in trouble for their lack of completed work. But you have to worry about this with most jobs."
good,Walmart is a fun but stressful environment to work in at times. The pay is decent and you get a ten percent discount after being there for six months.
good,"Working at Wal Mart was a good experience, 8 hour shifts, no overtime. The management for the most part stayed out of your daily work, let you work on your own."
good,"I liked working at Walmart , it was a nice environment other than the messiness and favoritism , I was There 2 years and when they changed store managers It got worst .!"
good,This job works with a person so that they can work around family lifestyle. A typical work day would involve duties that help customers and put up stock. The hardest part of this job is some heavy lifting and the most enjoyable part is working with a lot of different people.
good,"During 4months in Walmart, I improved my work pace as workload increased I also improve my communication skill as interactions  with customer in daily basis .Using polite words and good attitude could provide a better  service to customers and the customers will come back ."
good,steady work throughout the day. Learn about working on vehicles. Management always busy. Employee's easy to get along with. Hard to stay ahead. Enjoy the work.
good,once you clock in it is usually non stop work.  you get a n hour lunch that goes really fast then it's back to work. there is no sitting. lots of walking and lifting.
good,"Between 250 and 350 prescriptions daily."
good,It was one of the greatest places to work at. You were told what to do once you got there and you did your tasks without being bothered. Everyone was so friendly.
good,"Placed orders for department, performed daily price changes, placed product on shelves, used suggestive selling techniques, costumer service, worked with some really nice people."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work until they changed all the benefits last year, and stop the paid holidays ( you would have to use your Pto hrs you collect and request the day off , that a supervisor can deny) AND if your are working minimum hours your not collecting PTO so it can become a no win situation. and they wont accept a doctors note if your out ill."
good,Typical day involves motivating 75-100 people to function in a safe yet very productive environment.  Service our customers by exceeding their expectations.
good,"good and bad days but the store manager is horrible no matter how you work she will find a problem, very rude and disrespectful."
good,It was enjoyable and a good start to my working life. The manager i had tho definitely was a tool however. But otherwise people were nice and work was consistent.
good,A typical day at the square one Walmart would consist of receiving shipments and working skids. Along with assisting customers with their shopping needs.
good,"Typical day involved assisting customers as well as completing 'to do' lists provided by manager, typically involved areas to clean, items to relocate, displays to set up or take down."
good,"A typical day was short."
good,It was a normal hard working job. I loved it. I learned a lot of things and i would not mind going back. I just got back to a different store or position.
good,"As a cashier I would ring customer's purchases up whether it be cash, WIC, check or credit card purchase. You could be called to perform various roles inside the store as needed."
good,i can and would recommend walmart to a friend. there is room for advancement and flexibility for everyone. the management team is usually very understanding and helpful and will work with anyone to give reasonable accommodation
good,I worked 12 to 15 hour days as a manager. Throughout the years of service at Wal-mart I was taught different aspects of the entire company. The culture is presented and the employees were the most enjoyable part of my job. As a manager I ran the entire store with 100 employees under me on a day to day basis. The hardest part of my job was the process of a new store manager coming into effect after one manager was there for years prior. Excellent company to work for as salary or a full time associate. Wal-mart deals with a lot of volunteer work and I contributed to this as well while working at Wal-mart.
good,i liked working to Wal-mart it was a friendly environment . The service was good. The manager was excellent at solving problems in a timely manner. The store was always easy accessable
good,The store i worked in was very clean and well keep. They took pride in it every day. The management was great and they always took care of there employees and customers
good,This was my first job. I got it because I knew I would need to work while I went to school. Walmart was just a stepping stone for me to get more work experience because it was not what I wanted as my career choice. However I did notice there always seemed to be opportunity to grow.
good,"enter prescriptions into the computer, dispense prescription, fill prescriptions, order medication "
good,"it was good place to work at times. How to load trucks."
good,"Lots of different managers all telling me to do different things and complaining when I do them, despite doing them because a different manager told me to."
good,I like that cuz I work that over night and there was not so many people around I like that we have 15-minute breaks and an hour lunch breaks overall it was a cool work place
good,"Politica muito boa, tratam seu participantes com muito respeito."
good,"Busy "
good,"Walmart was a good place for me to work, I worked only in the summer months when I wasn't working in the school.  As a cashier you must know the codes to  the produce and be able to stand on your feet anywhere from 6 to 8 hours.  You do get 2 breaks in a 6-8 hr shift.  It was nice to get the 10% discount,"
good,"Walmart is not a bad company to work for, but there could be more communication between corporate and store employees. Depending on what corporate decides, your job may be more difficult than the day before. Lack of formal (face-to-face) training is a major part of the problem. If you want to know anything regarding policy, you must look it up. It is not offered to you."
good,"I enjoy my time working there, peers were nice and helpful. I was allowed to work in more than one area which increase my experience in other areas of the store. The majority of supervisors were helpful and gave good directions of my expectations for the day."
good,I loved my job. I looked forward to the day to day challenges. I enjoyed helping out where I could. Sometimes I would help in certain areas if they were short for the day.
good,"While pay is more than fair for the job, I would not recommend working at Walmart.  The main problem comes from lower levels of management.  While the GM is professional and a good leader, lower level managers tend to have big egos while offering little in the way of training.  They expect you to find out on your own how to complete the job and often work non busy hours and take weekends off.  All of that is really not a big deal, I'd rather supervise myself anyway."
good,"Loved being here because it helped with my stressful moments and my depression. I valued each day I worked here and cherished every moment. The people were as friendly as myself, yes there were some frustrating days. But, that didn't matter if you had the patience and tolerance to with stand the angry people."
good,"Good company, good pay, long hours. You get 2 15 minute breaks, then 1 hour lunch break. People are nice, stocking is hard but is worth the pay. Social life is almost cut off entirely though"
good,"Greeting and assisting customers in the selection of products Provided support by making sales and for special promotions"
good,If you do your job and keep the customers happy then there is always room to grow. The job is easy and lacks challenge but its really a no-stress atmosphere if you do the handful of things asked of you
good,Working During the Seasonal Holiday Months. It was nothing special. The wave of customers was constant. And working at night was more relaxing than working in the Day time.
good,"I've worked in the supercenters and markets. Because Walmart is everywhere it is always busy. The time I worked there the pay was onle $7.90 for a CSM. I believe that rate has changed, luckly. The customers is what makes the job worth it."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was difficult at times. I worked at Customer Service and I tried my best to make sure to treat every customer with kindness and respect and even though most was unkind, I still treated them the same. I did enjoy working at Customer Service seeing the regulars that would come and cash their paychecks."
good,It was a stressful environment but that's because we were always under staffed. Management was hard to work for because they expected you to go above and beyond for them bit would treat you poorly. Management liked to talk down to their employees and treat them harsh and always needed you to stay late or pick up extra shifts last minute but threw a fit if you needed a day or two off or if you needed an hour away for a Dr's appointment. You are supposed to take 15 minute breaks but a lot of the time I had to work through mine because I wouldn't have time to finish my tasks if I took my breaks.
good,Stocking products and unloading trucks. Good management was fair and understanding. The most enjoyable part of job was unloading truck and seeing new products
good,Good place to work not much stress. Can work with you on hours. You can't have overtime and if you do then you have to cut hours or take longer breaks.
good,Wal-Mart is a company that provides lots of possibilities within the same company. It's a great place for high school kids to start and learn the importance of being a good employee and what to expect in a career before getting to college.
good,"Wal-Mart has changed over the years and now you don't get holiday pay, no overtime at all. besides all that Wal-Mart is a nice place to work. I just need a change in my life."
good,Walmart is a great company! Always room for growth and the benefits for long term employees are a plus! A wonderful thriving company to be apart of. I loved my working expirience at wal-mart!
good,"I applied three times for a transfer to another city and store as I had to relocate for personal reasons. I was told that if the store manager likes you, you will not be granted a transfer... after my third time of applying for a transfer they fired me when I went back to tell them that I had too much time on my paycheck (one hour). They told me to keep it at severance pay and that I was terminated."
good,"Its Walmart, you get what you get. Nothing too special but its also just a job. People you meet can be cool. Of course there is the unusual customer here and there, but all jobs have that."
good,"I love customer service so I enjoyed my time at Walmart. I learned so many different jobs within that store and that was beneficial to me. However, an older person can't have Walmart as a primary job because the pay sucks unless you are management and im not so sure they were happy either lol"
good,I worked at Wal-mart while I was in college.  I always intended to go to work in the dental field.  I worked mostly evening hours and weekends.  They did a good job of working around my school schedule.
good,"A typical day at work had the feeling of ""keep moving"" and ""get it done quickly and well"".  I learned that hard work is not often equitable to what is paid out to the hard worker.  Management seemed to care about their employees, but the rub came in with what policy dictated at times versus what an employee's need may have been.  This would often give the impression that management did not or could not care for their people properly.  I could empathize with both management and those they were to manage.  Workplace culture felt rough mixed with some levity.  Associates tended to make friendships with one another; part of this bond came out of stressful workplace conditions coupled to low to average income.  The hardest part of the job was working with the mission of ""the customer is always right"".  This simply is not true, though it is what company employees are to adhere to.  I have seen such a mission leave employees vulnerable and battered by inconsiderate customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working and building relationships with both customers and Associates."
good,worked alone baking bread and stocking. baked hot french bread and put it on the floor for customers. cut and packaged after it was cooled down. sometimes helped the cake decorators.
good,"Stocking Merchandise"
good,This was one job that helped me with my people skills. Walmart taught me how to work and handle different personalities hat you are faced with on a daily.
good,"Resolving customer and staff issues"
good,Walmart is a really good place to work. It comes with a lot of good benefits depending on how long your work period there is. It also gives you the chance to start a new Career.
good,"Progressive organization that is working to adapt to a rapidly changing retail landscape. Very corporate, which can both provide security and limit options."
good,"This job is a culture of meeting goals and each department works hard to achieve those. I am a competitive person, so this was a fun part of work for me."
good,"La empresa contaba con un buen ambiente laboral, sin embargo las posibilidades de crecimiento personal eran pocas."
good,My typical day at work Involves stocking merchandise and keeping the sales area tidy. working with Walmart I learned how to communicate with customers. the hardest part of the job was stocking goods. the most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and rendering help.
good,My experience working in walmart was very productive. It was a good experience learning a new work environment and meeting and communicating with people everyday.
good,"Osl is a great place to work, they prefer to promote within and have lots of online training available. Hardest part of the job is there's no separation between you and the Walmart staff so you get hounded a lot about something that is not part of your job and you're not able to help with."
good,"This work experience have given me the ability to relate what is considered and excellence of customer service verses providing good customer service. This company values their customers and customer feedback, complaints, and demands were mostly met. The company will move employees around to departments where see fit and current pay rate. On most occasions extra working hours are available to employees. The staff and co-workers are generally easily to work and get along with."
good,"learned to drive an electric pallet jack , good supervisor , was a job that kept you busy , hardest part was you were given a certain amount of time to pick things , thing i liked the most was the fast pace"
good,"Pays better being an hourly manager than a salaried manager with a food company. Processes are always changing and upper management does not follow the same things. Market tells you to do one thing, while Regional tells you to do the opposite, System is outdated and needs to be updated to make processes faster."
good,"My working experience at Walmart was a positive one. You have the opportunity for advancement and great benefits. Walmart culture is respect for the individual, great customer service and community involvement."
good,The company was good at recognizing when you accomplished you goals.  My co workers were great.  The walmart I worked at was a very clean and organized store.  It was well managed
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with new people and learning different skills. There is plenty of room for advancement and they give you the training needed to do so.
good,It's a nice place to work. But it does not offer enough hours per day or per week. Most of the time it is a fun place to work because you get to meet new people.
good,I process invoices to match up with what was order. Process store merchandises orders.  I made sure that all items scanned through the registers and ran up at the correct prices.  I learned that i can manage lots of different task at one time.  It is a very fast pace work environment.  The hardest part of the was the managing everything going on around the job. The best part of the job was being asked to go help check other stores office.
good,"You would deal with rude customers everyday you work there, but you would have to have a positive, and strong mind/attitude. You would meet new people, but sometimes it is best to just work."
good,"I learned that it didn't matter how well you did your job that counted it depended on weather management team liked you personally. I call that""butt-kissing"" which I never did."
good,"Starts off by sorting all the stock into the separate departments, then you take a section and fill the shelves with anything that needs restocking. Great for building teamwork skills."
good,it was good workplace but short maybe week or two enough for some learning about Walmart and what they do in store it was part of department of labor for va
good,"Loved it. can be stressful when lines are long but for the most part its not too bad. common knowledge of using a register, from time to time you have customers that can stress you out but its easy to get over, you also have your CSM;s to help you with anything"
good,"travaille plus physique ,clientèle agréable bien aimé travailler pour eux"
good,"A typical day at Walmart for me, was to punch in, get the keys for the electronics department. Then I would open up the registers, put the delivery away from the night before. Then I would take inventory for the contract cell phones and take care of customers."
good,Plans are laid out well. Enjoyed working with the employees and the customers. Everyone was very help full with anything that you need help with. Great selection.
good,"Everyday at work I get people who make me smile! The costumers are mostly pretty great! The management is wonderful, and I really enjoy the managers I have had!"
good,"they should pay more . people work hard and not paid well.no benefits, or sick pay. they need more people o the floor to clean and make sure thaings are noton the floor."
good,Its a fast-paced environment. I worked as a cashier. Sometimes we would get unfriendly customers. Great benefits however you have to be an employee for 6 months before receiving any increase or bonuses. They also have a point system for absent and tardy employees.
good,I loved my job at Walmart I felt like I did a good job everyday but its fast passed and management can be cut-throat. If you upset 1 assistant manager then it can go down hill from there. I loved the customers and the associates that I had the opportunity to bond with. It was very hard to leave but it was something I left like I was forced to do.
good,"In the past, my experience at Walmart was very good. When i started it was around Christmas, which was the craziest time of the year. That was one of the most intense moments i have ever experienced."
good,"Very fast paced environment. A lot of team players I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I had to replenish freight onto the shelves and assist customers when needed. I learned about matching upc keeping my department clean ans shoppable for the customers, making sure I could assist the customer to the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part of my job was to make sure the customer was satisfied."
good,"It was a normally 8-5 day, we went in had a morning meeting everyday where we were given specific tasks to perform on top of our daily routine. I enjoyed the structure. Some days were definitely more busy than other but for a working family a management position was more suitable. I love that I had fixed hours and days that I worked besides certain times throughout the years were certain projects called for that to be changed where i worked around it. I enjoyed the Walmart I worked at and my co workers."
good,I worked in the deli as a sales associate. The tasks were easily learned. The day consisted of keeping a safe and clean environment as well as providing quality customer service.
good,Es un lugar donde te negrean por un salario mínimo y a veces las gerencias son un desastre y Nunca tienen plantilla completa lo cual hace más difícil el trabajo pues quieren que hagas todo en un determinado tiempo además de que con la entrada del proyecto promotoria eficiente despidieron a varios promotores lo cual hace que hagas su chamba de ellos por el mismo salario sin contar que velas una semana si una no y cuando no hay personal te mandar a velar hasta por meses o semanas!. Realmente una lástima de empresa
good,"Greeting customers, data entry, ensuring each client is fully aware of the medication that they are receiving, counting medications,filling the orders as they are received,  calling and notifying customers  there order is ready for pick up,experience calling insurance companies and doctors offices."
good,"it is a good starter job for graduating high school students.  The pay sucks, and it is a very fast paced, and very busy.The managers are great, but not really concerning."
good,"Wal-Mart is a okay company to work at temporarily but not for a very long time. If decided to be at the company for a long time do not stay in the same position, try to move up in the company."
good,I liked working there at the time because they had flexible hours. you could requset days off and it didn't count against you. they were always willimg to try and accommodate me when I needed time off.
good,Nice company will work there again not bad fast past friendly growing company meet new people approved in great work ethic also improve great customer service skills
good,I was one of the few employees who actually liked working for Wal-Mart.  Most employees were hard working and helpful and easy to get along with.  Pay was reasonable depending upon experience and education.  You do get benefits after working there for 1 year.  Management was very poor.  They do not back up their employees when it comes to irate customers and treat the associates uncaringly.
good,The people that work there are really great and are very friendly. I think some of the cashiers need more training. Hardest part of the job would be when you have to tell a customer no or that does not follow our policy.
good,This job is definitely one that you can go fast-paced or you can stay going slow. The customers will still be happy even then. Everything will work as crazy or as fast as you want to. It was very fun here but it is definitely something that you will enjoy but have to work hard.
good,"Amazing environment"
good,I liked working here.  It was fast paced and something always needed top be done.  My Co workers worked well worth b me also.  We worked as a team. ..
good,I loved working in the optical and loved the patients. I had to leave due to family illnesses that I needed to help with. I would work in the optical again.
good,what I learned from Wal-Mart  is to provide good customer service. I also learned about all the different departments Wal-Mart has from grocery to retail.
good,Overall easy paced job. Duties were easy and the managers were flexible and willing to work with you. They offered you time and good pay. I would recommend.
good,"A typical day consisted of coming in at 5 am, management had a brief meeting about the day ahead. After we teamed up, we followed up with following night imports on 40 teu. Hardest part of the job was the heat inside the trailers."
good,"The job is good if you like to work hard, but they don't care if you get hurt they just want you to be able to work . besides that its an OK job to have if you work under the right people"
good,A workplace that will help you be a customer oriented employee and it also helps me to be productive. Being able to help the customer and employee is satisfying experience.
good,I enjoyed my time working within an environment I felt comfortable in as well as had the opportunity for growth in skills and leadership roles. I would recommend working there.
good,"the room for career advancement was limited.I learned how to work well with my team, adapt to my team. The room for advancement and long term is just not an opportunity available in this position. Hardest part of the day I would say is organization of the store."
good,"170 days a year away from home. It was a  great place to work but as the years passed, management changed and started adding rules and regulations that made it difficult to do your job.  They change the delivery schedules and made it tight to deliver on time.  They initiated new company rules on cell phone usage that was above and beyond federal regulations.  No phone calls over 10 consecutive minutes and no more than an hour a day.  Being away from home days at a time, that is ridiculous. They demand to audit your phone bills to make sure you obeying company policies.  They put cameras in the trucks that are forward facing and rear facing so they can see the driver and monitor what the driver is doing.  Too much BIG BROTHER policy!"
good,"I am choosing to not review at this time, company changed when the founder passed away. The culture was not the same, the care for fellow associates were not the same."
good,"This job was a great environment, I was always doing something different it was never a routine that's what I enjoyed most. I would oversee all the cashiers & manage the cash draws. Also make sure the lines aren't to long & the customers are getting checked out at a timely pace."
good,Would unload trucks of freight put them on pallets store them in the department they belonged in. would pick freight from the backroom or bin the freight would also stock freight as well
good,"-Boring environment"
good,It was a great company to work for. I learned a lot about my job and I was able to perform many different jobs before I departed ways with the company
good,"i would have been fine if my schedule wasn't such a mess, like honestly. They were extremely strict for no reason and i never really felt comfortable."
good,"If you enjoy working with the public and with a knowledgeable and friendly staff, the people of Walmart are some the nicest people I have ever worked with. I learned most of my customer service skills and how to keep smiling no matter what the situation. The hardest part of the job is to keep your sense of humor but what I enjoyed the most was working with the sales associates in the various departments"
good,"Was very relaxing but very stressful with no communication.  The managers weren't very sympathetic when it came to sicknesses or children.  Also, didn't follow through with scheduling days and availability."
good,It is such a physically demanding job. As I am getting older I would like to find something  a littler easier on me physically. I like my job and.do.well at it.
good,They worked great with my schedule. My manger was very nice. The training was by computer and very through. They staff was fun to work with. The best part was working with the customers.
good,Liked my job at Walmart. Enjoyed working with people. Not too stressful that I couldn't handle it. Had a great super-visor. Had a set schedule on days.
good,it's a great place to work if you don't have anything else going on. they want you to be all about walmart. the hardest part about this job is dealing with the rude customers and tryimg to hold your composer.
good,"A typical day of work is or can be somewhat slow at random times, but mostly fast pasted based on my work days at Walmart.Over time do to my job at Walmart .I've learned their organization staff member system.Along with how to greet every costumer that shops at Walmart. Their work crew and staff members are and boss are friendly,polite,hard working.Well cultured with their work crew and  staff members including their Walmart customers.Learning the location of all the products within the store.The easiest part is gathering the carts."
good,"Didnt get paid enough , Managers werent all that helpful, Training was horrible, I was just thrown in there with no training. Felt like i didnt get respected."
good,I would work there again if I had the chance . Some management cared about you and your personal life enough for you to feel special like you mattered. They would work with you and your life as much as they could. I feel like $10.00 is barely enough for the work we do as employees. Its a hard job but a doable job. One I would do again.
good,"I loved my coworkers and the jobs are tough especially during the holidays but simple. Only thing is watch out for management, very unprofessional unless you like crossed arms, eye rolls, and mumbles as a response. You guessed it, I'm no longer there."
good,No wal marte pude aprender as mais diversas areas que contrubuio e agregou  para meu conhecimento profissional quanto pessoal.
good,I don't know. I was not given the hours I needed and I was put into a department that I did not want to work in. I like my first department. but once other people started quitting they would place me in a department I did not like. I feel that I should be able to go to work at a place  that I enjoy.
good,"Chez Wal-Mart, le garage n'est pas l'un des plus productif car, il n'y a pas de publicité pour le garage et il n'y a pas le nombre d'employer qu'un garage devrait avoir."
good,Walmart offered really good benefits as well as time off. Good place for job advancement as well as great environment to work in. Able to learn different positions.
good,I worked over-night fresh and they mainly had me doing it instead of the others. some days it wasn't bad but some of those days you just want to pull your hair out but that was probably my job.
good,"Preparing my work station, taking care of the register, watering plants, sweeping, various other tasks as needed."
good,I don't have many complaints about Wal- Mart. It was not hard and they provided several different training modules. I wasn't crazy about how they would flip flop my schedule from late nights to early mornings.
good,Overall a good place to work.  Too many mid-level managers trying to get to the next level makes doing your job difficult.  Pay and benefits good for the job.
good,"The raises were small at the time and they would take money away from you when you had to change positions even though you had been there a long time. "
good,"You have amazing managers and coworkers who help you complete your tasks on time. Management is decent,  most understand any issues you may have that get in the way of your work schedule."
good,"For the most part Wal-mart is a fantastic place to work. Great benefits, good people and good customers. It is a very fast pace environment. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day. I loved working with my coworkers and my regulars that would come in daily. Never a dull moment either."
good,"As someone who rides the line of general contempt for life and zombifying depression this has been a rollercoaster of a job. At times Wal-Mart's free cook-out style of lunches and ice cream parties have made my day or my entire week but in that same breath having 2-7 managers circling your workstation telling you to work faster, cleaner, do things that are far out of your job description, and do it all with a smile..this can drive me personally to the part of my brain in which I realize I am nothing but a worker ant to these people. Valuable if compliant but easily squashed. Working in any Walmart superstore can be comfortable and profitable if you know a few tricks but be ready to sell your soul and know if you try to get it back, it will only be returned in the form of store credit"
good,In the electronic dept it was always fast pace. We sell tv cell phones cameras and any other electronic devices you can think of. Some days thy pulled us to other parts of the store to help
good,Not a bad place to work. Great people on every shift. Management is fair depending on the situation. Easy job as long as you are willing to do what you are suppose to do.
good,Placed on LOA while pregnant is not beneficial to employee due to not employed for 1yr with company employee receives no benefits unless you apply for it the minute your hired. Suggestions are to immediately requests benefits otherwise start looking for another job cause you'll be an employee receiving no pay.
good,"It is a well rounded great job experience, with the highest pay grade options available.  It is very flexible, teamwork and customer driven.  You dont have to worry about being micromanaged."
good,Trading videos are played at orientation and then its kind of a fly by the seat of your pants kind of deal depending on the department you are in. There are not enough job aids.
good,"I worked in the deli at Walmart.  I worked many hours, sometimes not getting a small break. I liked what I did in the deli. I sliced deli meat and such.  I had no problems with any customers. I however had issues with the way some of the employees did their job including the manager of that area and some of the hire up management.  I never confronted anyone because I am not that kind of person. I was taught to work hard in life to get what you want and need. however some of the people I worked with probably didn't feel the same way or so it seemed.  I found myself doing my job and the job of others as well.  as the saying goes... "" To many chiefs and not enough Indians"".. In some cases not enough gumption in some of them. It was not my place to correct them because of their behavior of being lazy. most of the people in the deli didn't respect the manager of that department."
good,"I had a good crew to work with.  Some day were stressful; however each person could submit an idea that could save the company money, and it would be considered with shares of stock as the reward.  One of my team submitted a medical savings account idea and got the opportunity to go to Washington DC to submit it before Congress."
good,It's good to work there ..the management are doing good..try to be fair to everyone..  but I need to get more hours.. the company needs to stop cutting hours .. they expect  to get everything done with half the people to takes to do it..
good,"good culture . Management was able to dictate hours over 50  without pay. Store Manager was a very micro manager  . She stated that if you didnt get all of your work done , you would stay over till the work was completed."
good,excellent company to gain experience in large scale infrastructure. Challenging work environment and uniquely big data. Overall good place to work at.
good,Walmart Is Really A Decent Job. Especially Once You Start Receiving The Hours You Want. Managers Can Be A Little Iffy At Times But If You Stay To Yourself Show Great Customer Service & Willing To Help An Fellow Associate Then Its A Breeze Working At Walmart.
good,Working freight everyday gets overwhelming at times. I enjoy helping customers and creating features. Would be better if management seemed to care a little more.
good,"it is a very good place to work but it depends which level of the pyramid you are in. for example, i was the primary level. worked really hard, but really nobody cares how much effort you put in, which is the harsh reality. no proper training at all"
good,"Growing small town pharmacy and store, fast paced work environment. The people usually always smile and are always willing to help customer, the value of being positive is an infectious thing that can keep morale going among the tough days."
good,The Walmart Distribution Center was a very good place to work for. The pay was good and the job was also good. I would recommend any to apply and go to work for them.
good,walmarrt gives you great opportunities to advance but trying to advance and have a family life is not good/ they do pay you very well but the benefits have gotten worse over the yrs
good,"have to work hard and come into work every day and be reasonable, and have a great personality and give the kind of customer service you would want. Have fun but work hard"
good,"I didn't think that I would like working for WalMart. After 2 weeks, I found that my co-workers were very friendly and helpful. Other than lack of training for new employees and how to operate inventory tools, to better do my job, I was happy. However, shortly after leaving, I was told employees were afraid of upper management. I find that to be shameful for a place like WalMart."
good,Good to start off for a career at a young age and work your way up within the company had good benefits for employees and spouses and children would recommend too young adults
good,"Overall, Walmart is a good place to work, but the increased competitive pressures and lack of sufficient re-investments in systems enhancements is overwhelmingly frustrating.  "
good,Good place to work. Was a great place to meet new people. Great learning experience for getting my working career started. Would recommend this as a great starting place.
good,"Would start the day by getting the deli ready for the day, started salads and sandwiches. Learned how to multi-task when lunch rush was there. Most enjoyable part of my day was when I got to go home in all honesty."
good,Walmart is doing a great job of figuring out how to stay relevant in the ever changing landscape of real estate.  Walmart is somewhat competitive between employees
good,It started off amazing but since I am getting closer to my one year mark they seem to care less about the ines of us who have been there the longest and don't treat us as good as they used to.
good,"Walmart was fast paced, the day went by fast because there was always something to do, I liked that every time there was a big load chances are you'll be making overtime."
good,Its start out to be just a place to work to help me get through school and I have been there for years. A lot has change over the years but over all its not a bad place to work.
good,It's a good first job but not one for a long term career obviously. As long as you keep your head down and do your job and don't let anybody else effect you then you will be fine but like i said only a job not a career.
good,"Job was stressful but demanding. Too many asstiant managers per department, never knew who to speak to about certain things. Customers were friendly, but demanding and would start arguments if proven wrong."
good,"Everyone is extremely friendly at Walmart and you'll feel more then welcomed and they have great benefits, you'll most likely be trained for multiple departments and you get trained by the sweetest and simplest people (:"
good,"I enjoyed working there and I would work there again given the opportunity. Great customers, great staff was there very short time. At the time the pay was minimum wage."
good,La jefa de el area de panaderia sabe tratar a sus trabajadores. Convivimos realmente como una familia.
good,"I really wanna to get a job to better myself. I liked working there just had problems with staffing, i was told that i wasnt supposed to work on certain jobs and i did"
good,"Walmart can be a good place to work, and a bad. However, currently, I am stressed more than anyone in my position should be. Upper management, is hard to work with primarily because they are constantly getting yelled at by their bosses. So, in turn, they yell at you."
good,Walmart could always do better as with any company.  For the most part as an associate you are always treated fairly and the open door policy has always been great.
good,WalMart was just a job until I could find something better.  Plus I worked in the liquor department located by the freezers which is one of the reason's I left.  Too cold and no other jobs available.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo con prestaciones de ley y vacaciones
good,"Great staff, environment and growing experiences."
good,The job was easy they do a good job of making sure you know what you need to accomplish each day you come in. The staff  was very helpful when you need them.
good,Working at Walmart was quite easy until the busy nights. I stocked different types of merchandize. When stocking food you have too keep everything fresh in your area by shifting. Overnight stockers come in at ten o'clock and stock and clean til 7 am.
good,Working as a cashier at Walmart was challenging and rewarding at the same time. However it was tough to try to get into a different position within the store
good,Unload trailer Stock freight  on palits pull palits  to floor  so the night stock can have they work setup for them when they come in for they shift cleanup
good,A typical day there stocking shelves dealing with unreseanonable  bosses. Helping customers with whatever they needed. The working culture was ok defintely good be alot better.
good,My typical night at work was breaking down the trucks that came in that night and taking the merchandise to the floor to stock it. The hardest part of my job was the lifting of the heavy items. I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,Paid well. Enjoyed co-workers. Schedule was rough at times. Rarely got 40 hours in a week. The commute was a bit long for where I live but not really a reflection on Walmart. Management turnover in Warehouse department was very high.
good,I really enjoyed working here only because the coworkers became like my family and my best friends. The management was awesome and really good with me. Very understanding with my disability with major depression and anxiety.
good,Overall it's ok to work for. I've had better but i've also had worse. The benefits are good as well as the convenience of already being in a shopping center.
good,I didn't feel like a team member when at work. Managers did not take the time to know you. The most enjoyable part of the job is serving customers. Other employees where not as friendly and could not rely on them for guidance.
good,"working at walmart was easy, management was easy to get along with and so were most coworkers. working in produce all i basically did was throw freight all day"
good,"I liked walmart, they need to have better balance and understanding of their team members I would recommend walmart to a friend. There are some really great people that work there."
good,"it is not easy and not hard to work at walmart. i learned a lot, the hardest part , is you have to do many ask task at the same time. working at walmart is a great experince."
good,A typical day working at Walmart was it was when the people came into the the store to do holiday shopping. The management always wanted to keep the customers happy.
good,I was a cashier here. I had to stay around in the area of my register to be able to keep an eye on it. I was responsible for keeping that area cleaned and organized
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart; it is a nice place to work.  It is a good company to work for when going to college to save money and to pay off any college loans.
good,"wal mart was good to work at it is also a very busy place to work. you are always on the go , you are always up moving around . you laugh have fun but it is very busy"
good,A company filled with smiling faces and friendly co-workers except when it comes to the people leading us. The management isn't the best but the co-workers you have make your job a little laidback and fun. You definitely learn a lot and it's easy to promote with this company. Change some management and I believe this Walmart will grow very well.
good,"Being a photo lab technician was fun and entertaining. Accepting customers film and digital photos, working and maintaining the developing/printing machines and printing then packaging the photos was the daily routine. The hardest part of the job was keeping all of this done within your one-hour time limit. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see everyone's memories and adventures in their photos."
good,mucho trabajo lo que mas me gusto fue trabajar con clientes
good,Walmart allows the opportunity to meet many incredible people from the door greeters to the regional staff.  The hours can be long and stressful to get everything right.  The end result is worth it.
good,I liked working with the customers. If was nice when you were able to help the customers find what they needed. Most of the associates were enjoyable to work with and made it feel more like a family. I learned over the years that it is important to listen to your customers and provide the best care you can.
good,kept busy all the time meant great people made some friends along the way . wish they would have paid more or made me fulltime and been able to work with my schedule alot more
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. They pay really good & between holidays they offer over time. You get great benefits with this company. Go for it
good,I liked the people I worked with and loved the customers and being able to help them. The job was fairly easy to train for. It was something new and exciting everyday with the different people I met.
good,Fast paced and friendly working environment.Working in different areas of the department. Worked as sales floor associate and cashiering as well as checking in vehicles for maintenance.
good,"Overall, I enjoy working for this company I've been employed with them for awhile now so I'm pretty much all over the store I can take on as many roles as they need per night. I've met so many different people, this job taught me how to be responsible and be dedicated to your work and how you provide for yourself. The hardest part now for me is the overnight shift, I feel like I'm getting older and its just not for me anymore."
good,Great Business model that is moving forward. Biggest detractor is too much time putting fires out due to poor pre-planning and communication on non-emergency rollouts.
good,"i used my previous cashier experience to assist costumers. most days went smooth , everything was fast paced and easy. everyone worked as a team to ensure costumer satisfaction."
good,"Slicing meat and cheese. learned how to run a rotisserie and slicers, and also the bigger fryers. management was good. The job was not hard at all. It was enjoyable for me because I like working with food."
good,"if you need to make a pay check to get by I recommend Walmart. if your going to school, maybe have a scholarship and need to get groceries I also recommend walmart"
good,I learn that having a good customer service does good justice. The job gets done and people get their items price matched and their complaints get taking care of from management.
good,It was a good job but it takes a while for you to get a consistent schedule and the managers can be rough on the associates. But over all if you do a good job and work hard you should have some really good opportunities ahead of you.
good,"overnight stocker and then cashier.  Stocking merchandise, recovery. Learned to fold clothes the Walmart way. Made some new friends that I still have. Hardest part was cleaning up."
good,"Typical day in the life of a cashier at Walmart, fast paced and rarely boring. Customers are overall pleasant. There could be more of a 'team' feel with co-workers but very friendly overall."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart and getting to know my customer. Staying organized being on time and getting my job done.  Getting all transactions done currently and Fast.
good,Was a fun place to work.  Learned about retail and was able to pick up rather quickly.  Learned how to operate a walker-stacker and forklift.  Learned to run a cash register.
good,I enjoyed the work there working with the other team members serving customers with a smile on my face each day was different and so were the team members
good,walmart will accept anyone within good reason and the work isnt hard as long as you can stand to be on your feet for long periods of time. not a bad first job
good,It's a good place to work. Good place to shop.. decent prices.. good people... good bosses..  would definitely go back... i loved the work I did and the people I worked with
good,I'am a good worker and get along well with my co-workers. Get asked to do many tasks out of my regular job duties and always do for management. I don't appreciate how certain management baby certain associates and others get no help. I have never been at a job for a short time always stuck with the job and did the best I could for what ever are I had to work.
good,"I just got burned out. Human Resources, were very helpful when coming into a new store. But every body, knows you are and outsider,"
good,I enjoyed working at wal-mart. The two years i worked there ive met some great people . You work a set 40 hr schedule which is nice if you have other things you need to do after work.The most enjoyable part of the job is that everybody works as a team to achieve one goal .
good,"i liked working at Walmart, they give you many hours, and your paycheck usually looks good and somewhat satisfying if you work overtime.the only downside is that they are not flexible with your schedule. You must work on the days they've set forth for you."
good,"I enjoyed working with Walmart Superstore and would highly recommend another person to work there, the environment is awesome and the work is great, when you do your training on the computers its way easier once you get on the floor. Good long term benefits."
good,"My experience working at Walmart, was a learning experience for me. At the time I was just getting out of high school, so it was my first real job. I enjoyed working there."
good,"Walmart is at the forefront when it comes to benefits and competitive pay, but their attendance policy could use some tweaking. They do not accept Dr. excuses (no matter the reason). Advancement isn't as easy as I feel it should be, and heaven forbid you get stuck with a bad manager because it just makes it all worse."
good,Walmart was a fast pace working environment that required you to work quickly with customers and to keep your area organized. All rules needed to be followed customers satisfaction was a plus.
good,its a very flexible job sometimes demanding as far as how much freight is brung in per day its a team work enviroment and its room for advancement rather quicklly depending upon your performance
good,I worked there for a total of 2 years as a cashier and let me tell ya something it sucked! Management there had no clue what they were suppose to be doing ever! Other then that the job was pretty easy and a good job to have.
good,"As a over night grocery stocker, I felt that the management was pretty good they treated me with respect as i did for them. Job work was tiring rushing to get all the groceries stocked but not too bad. Defenitly good job security long as you work hard."
good,a typical day at work would consist of a heavy work load depending on what time of the day you came in i learned how to manage time in between projects i enjoyed the workplace culture the most enjoyable 'part about this job where working the holiday events
good,there are friendly co workers keeps you busy no time to talk or play.always busy doing things you get to meet different people the pay was good very busy
good,I worked in just the cashiering and customer service desk.  I met all kinds of people and had good days and bad days. It is a very  fast-paced environment.
good,Nice place to work but would like more support from management to help do my job efficiently. I like my benefits but there is nit enough workers on overnight shift
good,"Fast paced on most days. Decent benefits for retail store. Flexible hours and good at getting amount of hours needed. Overall, nice place to work with friendly people."
good,I enjoyed working in my department at Walmart. There was always plenty of work to do and the people I worked with were great to be around. The managers were always accommodating.
good,"It's a popular wholesale in north america, hence the increasing popularity in the chain and so  the number of clients is increasing. Thanks to that, the number of employees is big as well and so we meet different type of people in our surroundings."
good,Enjoyed working and helping people find what they were looking for. Really liked stocking the shelf and seeing products that I would have never thought to look for.
good,"A typical day at work started with putting the stock on the shelves and making sure that all the plants had been watered. From there we were to clean the area and set up both registers. The rest of the day was all about assisting customers in any way we could which included sharing information, building grills and patio sets and loading customers cars with heavy bags of soil or cement blocks."
good,It wasn't that bad of a place to work at. Coworkers were pretty friendly. I had only worked there a couple of months before being let go due to being only seasonal
good,"The working environment was relaxed, I didn't have to drive to far to get to work, all my co workers was on one accord which was trying to eliminate carts , so we wouldn't have to work hard on the weekend."
good,"Excellent company. Great culture, structure and room for advancement. Strong sense of support for employees with extremely challenging and excellent projects, programs and people."
good,"I loved working at Walmart , but at times it wild really get nerve wrecking because I will be the only one doing my job right . If I could have another opportunity to go back I would most definitely take it ."
good,"Aprendi a ser mais responsavel, conhecer e conversar com o cliente sendo simpática e mostrando interesse pelo trabalho."
good,"By far the best work environment I have ever experienced! Very productive and competitive. Managment is great and the shifts are great! However, this is a job and nothing more. Walmart is focused on the now, rather than the future. Regarless of your work experience, work ethic and qualifications; You are nothing more than just another working body. If You're over qualified for an entry level position, don't apply. They will tell you that you must have a Bachelor's degree and have been with the company for a few years before even being considered for anything more than an entry level position. The pay is ridiculous, and unlivable. This is a great job for college students or for those who want a temporary job."
good,"The employees were the best and the management was great."
good,"Lot's of opportunity for advancement for those with a go getter attitude."
good,Je sers les clients derrière ma caisse tous les jours.
good,"Greeting people, customer service , answering phone , assisting with returns  in the departments. Departments managers were sometimes great to work with. The most enjoyable about the job was meeting new people everyday. The hardest part was keeping up with the returns and keeping the departments clean."
good,Walmart provides a safe work environment for all employees. Employees are trained well and fairly by management. Advancement opportunities are easy to come by.
good,Worked with steel to make office furniture.  Even though most days it's hot in the factory they make sure their employees are well hydrated.  There's opportunity to advance and for raises. Good insurance and other benefits.
good,"Buen ambiente pero muy cansado y salario bajo , tambien te regalan el desayuno."
good,This is an ideal place for individuals who want to supplement their income because of the flexible hours and schedules. Employees can normally choose their hours and days which can be ideal for college students who need extra incomes throughout the year.
good,"Everyday presents a new challenge.  However, benefits could be more individualized.  Management at my stores does care about you as a person.  They have always been accommodating for family issues that might arise.  My only complaint would be pay/hours being cut."
good,"In all, I'd have to say my supervisor's we're understanding and easy to work with. The managers above them however seemed a little green. Some of them just added stress and unnecessary complications."
good,This is an awesome job where I am able to work with people from many backgrounds. Although the turnover rates are high I enjoy the family that I have gained over the past six years. I'm looking for a career change and I have goals to challenge myself to do better in the area of helping others.
good,"Walmart is a very large retail company that has many moving parts. I have heard many people complain about the way Walmarts management team applies itself, but of the four years I spent working there I loes every minute of it."
good,Trabaje como empacador voluntario y se me brindaron todas las facilidades para desarrollar mi trabajo.
good,I enjoyed most of my time at Walmart. The CSMs were friendly and helpful. I did not like standing on my feet for long periods. Breaks and meal times did not always come when it was supposed to. I did not like my placement and talked to the assistant manager about it but nothing was done. I loved working with the ones I worked with and meeting new people. I also loved getting to know people. It was a fun atmosphere that made working fun. I believe the hardest part of the job aside from standing for long periods is dealing with the more complicated customers. It was a fun and enjoyable environment.
good,"Working with Walmart was okay. I was a 3rd shift cashier, so it was pretty smooth, except for working special holidays. I loved the customer service experience I received because I was trained to do a lot more compared to my previous customer service jobs."
good,I personally think the management could stand some improvement at the Moraine Store. There seems to be a lot of issues when it comes to race at this particular store.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. It was a great friendly place to work and the staff was very friendly. We worked as a team to keep our store very clean.
good,A fun place to work and try and grow as an employee. The compensation wasn't the best but there was always room to grow if you show the initiative that you want to succeed in the environment.
good,"I worked in the pet dept.  was in charge of stocking and cleaning the fish tanks.  Also was in charge of helping the customers with live pets such as birds, fish, mice etc."
good,Great first job with understanding management.  They knew the employees they were getting generally weren't going to  be cut from the best cloth and respected the ones that actually put pride in to doing their job.
good,Working for Walmart I learned how to work in a very fast pace .Walmart helps you with your communication . you have to speak with everyone that comes through your line . I really like Walmart & wish they hire me back asap.
good,"While the typical work day has many tasks that require completing, generally there is enough time and access to the proper tools to complete each task appropriately. Current coworkers work as a team with moderate communication to ensure all work is done and done properly. Unfortunately the current work schedule, 3rd shift,  is having a negative impact on personal life and health."
good,this a great place to work it has great oportunities you dont have to do the same job everyday also they dont stop you from getting money you can work over if you want.
good,"Workday consisted of setting up displays, serving customers, and rotating stock on shelf. I've learned a variety of retail techniques while working this job that helped in selling product. Management was willing to work with me to adjust schedule/hours for other outside professional income gigs. Overall workplace culture was relaxed during night however, there were issues with certain individuals not pulling their weight as a team. Hardest part of job were the early morning shifts in which I had to stock the floor from the freezer, sometimes while simultaneously holding down the deli and bakery due to lack of coverage. Most enjoyable part of the job were the relationship between coworkers and manager."
good,"If you are a hard worker and let your work do your talking for you, you will be disappointed. The ones who stand around flirting and talking with the supervisors will soon be promoted to leader positions. There is no accountability."
good,I had a lot of fun working with the customers I was sad that I had to quite the coworkers made me feel welcome and felt like I was part of a family it was a wonderful place
good,"stay busy, never dull but put to work . have more work then a person can handle . put a lot on co works that can't be done in 8 hours the store needs to work as a team more"
good,"Suite à un grave accident sur place (magasin), j'ai dû quitté et avoir une longue convalescence."
good,Very hard working job. Working as a cashier you have to be fastpaced and have excellent customer service. I liked working here just did really like the hours.
good,I loved working here because I love to help people.  It was pleasing to see people satisfied with the service provided and the associates I worked with was loving and kind.  The work culture was friendly and family oriented.
good,Its overall a good place to work once you finish your pathways you get a bonus quarterly the hrs are good and the job isn't that hard. I've worked at the service desk also as a cashier a mod specialist and putting put freight an none of it is bad.
good,Overall I love walmart its great i love the people I work wit. It can be bad at times with drama and people act childish and they don't do anything about it.
good,"It was a great place to work. Never a dull day. My manager was fantastic, and it was a great learning experience. I am glad I had an opportunity to work here."
good,"Life at Walmart can be rewarding at times, but there are also times when it is frustrating and you're wondering why the tools used are not 21st Century tools. You learn patience and develop a sense of ownership with your business. I truly have had a great experience here."
good,It was pretty fast-paced. Management was pretty good about talking to you about progression in the company. They were very willing to help with any family situations or personal business.
good,"I worked at Walmart for 7 years, and not out of necessity, I genuinely liked my job, my coworkers, and my ability to move and control my hours. However, it wasn't until I left Walmart did I learn that there ARE better jobs out there. As a college student, Walmart was perfect for me, I worked in 5 locations over 5 years and moved laterally several times. I was offered promotions but they did not fit my schedule. A lot of people complain about Walmart not working with their schedule, and I have seen issues for parents, but as a student with a very set schedule, they always worked with me for whatever I needed."
good,"Come to work with the attitude that nobody is going to ruin your day. Customer service is key. The employees are friendly, and willing to help a fellow associate at a moments notice."
good,"in a typical day of work you would attend between 50-100 customers, at least in the cashier position, if you have really good communication skills than there really isn't anything you can do in this job"
good,I learned great customer experience and really loved this job. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment and work with people from all different walks of life
good,"Each day was filled with surprises and a good, friendly environment. The management was good at supervising the floor. The workplace was definitely manageable."
good,good place to start flexible schedule with a fair wage good part time or full time position easy work when done right. Managers were good coaches and helped a lot
good,Usually mid week early mornings were slow and laid back. Breaks were usually on time as well as lunch. But weekends were so busy you might miss a lunch or break every now and then. But once I got used to the routine it wasn't so hard to handle. I learned alot about walmart policies that most people have no clue about. I learned that the csm's and cashiers stood together as a team and that most of the people i worked with would've gone above and beyond to help if they could. My favorite part about working there was when it was slow and I would zone my isle I got to people watch. Which was probably the highlight of my day. The culture was like family. But the hardest part was having to bit my tongue when a customer would give me attitude for requesting to see I.D for alcohol purchase or movies rated R. That's just company policy if we get caught not asking we get fired. Also black friday. You have to be strong in every sense of the word because it's a mad house!
good,"Didn't mind working for Walmart. the pay wasn't the best, but it paid my bills and it was pretty easy. management were always helpful and on top of things."
good,"Eu tenho muita vontade de trabalha para mim ter , uma grande espreincia ."
good,"usually stock "
good,"Provide excellent customer service"
good,It can be relaxing but then it can be balanced if you choose to work hard and honesty. I enjoyed working with customers and helping them out. It's like a independent job.
good,Good place and environment  to work.                 Some times stressful.   Good benefits and pay ..                  Need more floor support for my job.
good,Wal-Mart is a nice company to work for. Always have chances to better your self. You can change job titles within the store if a position is open. You can become manager or assistant manager if that what you so choose
good,"A typical workday involved working on 10 vehicles personally on average.  They provide on the job training, other techs often do a good job teaching new techs as well.  Management is exactly what you would expect from Walmart.  The shop culture is a lot of fun and feels separate from the general retail portion of the store."
good,"I wasn't there long, do to transportation issues, but it was nice from what I saw. Everyone had been very friendly, and the environment wasn't bad at all."
good,"A typical day is usually busy. Policies changed without notice at times so you learned to adjust daily. Management support was not always good but for the most part they had your back. The hardest part of the job was getting customers to understand that when policies change, we are still required to follow them. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I did all I could to help a customer with a problem and they walked away happy."
good,Overall they make claims and promises they don't keep and a lot of favoritism...  It's easy to promote to department manager however once your a DM your at a plateau.
good,It was a good job at the time. I learned a lot of great people skills on the stock floor. They just didn't offer full time positions and I need a full time job.
good,I worked so hard just to get over looked for promotions and other I like the way some rules are but others sometimes makes no since I would like to advance but there are favorites
good,Work with customers to meet there needs and work with associate to get the job done. Work on project to help the store grow and look to always important customers needs.
good,Working at Walmart is a very good experience if you want to learn some new things it's a very Hands-On type of job but the only thing is that the pay is not very good well for the type of job I was doing it was a really paid really good also the only good thing about working in Walmart is that you meet tons of good people can you help them which is the best thing also. No over time
good,Every job has its down fall but overall I believed Walmart was great compared to the job I have now. I may get paid more but I get treated unfairly at my current job
good,"Typical job day involved filling 30,000 prescriptions.  I was cross trained in both Pharmacy Tech and Shipping and Receiving side.  "
good,The neighborhood Market is a grocery store.  Typical day included running the front of the store completing financial transactions for customers as well as problem solving and providing excellent customer service.
good,Sweeping and moping the store. Cleaning bathrooms. Taking out the trash. Its a good place to work for. I liked it. You got a 10% discount on everthing in store for been a employee
good,"Stress passado de Gerente e encarregados para com os subordinados é desnecessario."
good,A typical day at work is kind of fun because I love to work. Working at Wal-Mart have it's good n bad days bit mostly good days and the people that I've worked with there our wonderful it's really like a family there everybody helps out the only negative thing that I have to say about Wal-Mart is I hated pulling them heavy water and juice pallets
good,attending to customers needs. helping other coworkers with their work area. keeping clean and good looking work area. stocking selves with proper merchandise  .
good,"The atmosphere depends on management .  10%discount, minium 30 hr weeks . Some show favoritism . Can be stressful at times . Not always herd when speaking to management"
good,They expect ridiculous numbers and great customer service all in which is not attainable in a regular work day. Getting customers and patients to commit to vaccines is hardest
good,"If you want to make a career out of Walmart, then it is a good choice. As part time worm goes, it isn't the greatest option. There are a hundred different jobs to do, so if you don't enjoy one area, it's pretty simple to change to a different one."
good,I loved my co workers there always fun and the best part of the work environment was the customers. I loved how some customers shared there everyday life and sometimes they become really good everyday customers. The hardest part of my job was management they were really unhelpful and really never seemed to care about the associate's.
good,"Very good workplace.  Plenty of opportunities for promotion. Managers were always very helpful. The training was very good."
good,A minha avaliação é baseada na minha vivência profissional nesta empresa.
good,The work place wasn't too bad until you worked with certain people. Those that think they are better than you that doesn't make you want to stay. I always worked hard though at everything I did.
good,"Busy nights stocking. I learned to build promotional displays and endcaps, where and how to place overstock items, how to stack-up a pallet. The hardest part of the job is the freezer ramp."
good,Una empresa donde aprendí a desarrollar mis capacidades y mis habilidades.
good,It was a good place to work at. The pay was pretty good. For overnight it was a set schedule. Employees were fun to work with and got along pretty well.
good,"The growth and advancement were very positive. Had a great start to a permanent career, but because of envy/jealousy from a higher lead management, because of my fast movement up the corporate ladder, the problems began and I had to leave. otherwise I would have remained and had gone further than ever anticipated."
good,Transferred from another store out of state.  Work environment was good.  Liked my coworkers.  Management was great to work with for my schedule.  Learned a lot about stocking groceries.
good,"My job was to work in customer service and sometimes in electronics department, also my job was to satisfy customer needs and wants. Walmart is basically a neatly, well mannered environment"
good,"It started out easy enough in the deli, however it seemed that the more you do the more they expect from you until you are buried under so much work it is impossible to complete in the time you are given for a shift and you are constantly being coached for not completing work that should be spread between more than 3 people. I adored most all of my coworkers and I liked my boss, though I was far more comfortable as a cashier than in the bakery/deli. There almost never seemed to be enough time to dedicate to the computer training they wanted done while still completing the tasks they demanded in deli though as a cashier I had no problem keeping on top of it."
good,"A typical day at work started with me clocking in and receiving my register assignment. After receiving my assignment I'd prep my register for my shift (occasionally this would mean getting a cash drawer for the register). Once the light is on the customers start flowing; I'm ringing and bagging items, helping customers load their carts and answering their questions to the best of my ability. If I can't answer a question I find them someone who can. If the line was slow but the store was still busy I was either ""red-lining"" (drawing the customers in), organizing the candy displays at my register, clearing up trash or finding items in places they weren't meant to be and putting them in their designated bins so they could be put back in their proper places. "
good,Tiene buenas prestaciones y jornadas laborales buenas pero en ocasiones falta apoyo de los jefes
good,"Reliable place for the community to get various necessities. Provides home items, groceries, and clothes for all different seasons needed. Provides good customer service."
good,"Very fair and I might return later in life. a good experience"
good,A typical day at work was to clock in find my department and begin breaking down pallets of merchandise.I learned to read product numbers and scan bar codes. As well as how to place perishable merchandise on shelves. The work place culture was very diverse and fun everyone for the most part got along with each other and supervisors. Hardest part of the job was to get home in the morning after working all night. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedoms to get it done my way.
good,"Good company to learn about the retail company policies and procedures. The opportunities to moved on inside the company are challenging , but they need to grow up in employee relation and human resources."
good,A typical day at Walmart. Where you could never expect on how a day is going to be. I've learned a lot from the two years I've worked there. For example dealing with customers & understaning that we are there to serve them. Along with with our co workers that we are a family. We have to work together to make things work out just fine.
good,They taught me how to keep invtory and how to give great customer services .Also I learned to how important is it to be organized so I can keep everything in order .
good,Da horario flexible a estudiantes entre otros beneficios.
good,"In my opinion, there is a breakdown in the management staff with the reality of day to day issues encountered by the hourly staff. Unrealistic expectations due to the lack of management having the experience of all areas within the stores."
good,"Of all the big chain pharmacies, Walmart is easily the safest when it comes to putting patient safety first. If you are looking for a place to work and want to feel safe with your license, Walmart is for you."
good,"What I learned the most was having punctuality and being professional kept you from being promoted to a customer (inside joke) the moment you stepped into the facility you practiced those two things until you clocked out. You are constantly being watched even when you think you're not. Management doesn't believe in spare the rod and spoil the child one makes a mistake we all pay, some managers are cutthroat while others are lenient. Most of all keep to yourself and do your job and you will be fine."
good,"Walmart is a great job, even though it is open 24 hours so you can work all hours of the day. The night shift is not to rough you actually get more done at night which is nice."
good,It was a good place to work depending on which store you work. I would have stayed longer if management would have treated everyone the same. Learned a lot about inventory and how to maintain a low inventory with a high rate of sales.
good,"Just another job. Not much to say about walmart, is a stable and well grounded company. Got the oportunity to work with them but I wouldn't work there today."
good,"I actually loved working at Wal-Mart Super Center here in Lexington , well that was the name when I was an employee. The pay was awesome and the hours we're decent ."
good,"A very fast paced work place. Promotes self sufficiency and a rigorous work schedule. Typical day starts with unloading the truck, followed by restocking shelves."
good,I truly enjoyed my time at Walmart.  They were always sure to give employees breaks and lunches on time.  An 8 hour shift seemed to fly by due to volume of customers.
good,Fue una empresa que me ayudo a aprender a trabajar con una gran cantidad de empleados y a la resolución de problemas con empleados y clientes.
good,Although I've learned a lot and I am able to build my team skills and people schools some days we deal with too much merchandise for the amount of people we have.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, Pass Christian.  Great management, friendly co-workers, good company to work for.  The only drawl back was the hours that I was scheduled."
good,Provided help to those who need assistance with any location of item. Meeting new faces and be able to put smiles on those faces is the best experience in my life to help those that have bad days or stressed because they can't find what their looking for is a pain but being able to provide my assistance is a joy out of my time
good,"Me gustaba trabajar ahí debido a que empece a conocer productos y personas, tenia contacto con los clientes por teléfono y les gustaba como realizaba sus pedidos"
good,"I started at the optical lab which in this facility it was air conditioned and involved light lifting and minimum walking"
good,"At my job back in Delta, CO I used to put everything into that job, it wasn't just about the paycheck, but for how much my associates and I on our shift did our best but heard of no recollection but when we were to it was more of a lecture of us doing something wrong. I know it's hard to always tell associates they're doing a good job because of how they would take it, but some people take the time to stay behind and finish the job without even thinking of overtime because at the time I was doing such, we had to kill every minute of the overtime we had gained throughout the week. I liked calling the associates my family, it was the managers that felt that they would not take the moment to notice about the associates unless told."
good,"I learned a lot while working at Walmart. The customers was great to work with and I enjoyed helping them. I want to one day be in management, because I enjoyed working there and shopping there. The flexability in the schedule is great. You can tell a manager when you need to be off or when you need to work and they will work with you."
good,I worked full time for produce at walmart and it was actually my favorite job. It was very simple and I was always busy. It was a very independent job so i worked on my own. The workplace got a little hectic sometimes but I didnt mind it because that meant I was going to be busy and not just sitting around. The job wasn't hard at all it was very easy.
good,Tive experiencia na area administrativa e foi muito gratificante.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart and would work there again inn a heart beat if I could have had the weekends off. I would encourage others to go to work for Walmart and any of it's affiliates.
good,Was able to move up from cashier to service desk in less than a year. Management is supportive of helping associates advance themselves. Management also pitches in to help when needed.
good,i enjoyed my opportunity at Walmart. i enjoyed being a cashier for such a large company i enjoyed it so much i transferred my employment when i left from my original location. being in the new environment i had minor management issues and decided to leave the negativity behind
good,Wal-Mart at hartford is lacking leadarship and organizations skills store is daily in a mess due to lack of employee motivation to keep the store organized.
good,There attendance policy is cut and dry they need to understand that sometimes things come up that can't be avoided not everyone abuses the system and they could and have lost good employees do to not having any understanding
good,"typical day at work"
good,"During a typical shift, I would drive around on the stock picker and pulled merchandise that was being shipped out. The hardest part of the job was time management. The most enjoyable part was being able to work on my own."
good,The scheduling and point system was difficult in the beginning because if you are within your first six months you can't get 4 points or more regardless of the reason or it could result in termination
good,"Walmart was a good place to work when it came to your coworkers around you, when it came down to relying on management it seemed they were always too busy but nothing was being handled in a timely manner. When it came down to promotions i did not think that it was fair decisions. Management already has their mind made up when giving the mandatory interviews. When talking to certain managers they have nothing good to say about their jobs, always a complaint, and stating to ""get out whenever you can, this is not a career."""
good,"I had tons of fun working for this company, they have great benefits and great team players. They treat you like a family and understand if u have famly issues"
good,"Typical Day: Of course a very busy place to work. "
good,"A typical day at work was fun and productive most days. I learned a lot working for this company. Not only things about the job but things about life in general. Management was understanding, workplace environment was great, and the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"The store where I worked was mainly a store where mexican people would shop. It was a nice store to work for, the only thing was that there was a lot of favoritism, which didn't give some of us a chance for advancement. The day was a routine, same thing over and over each day, which made it boring after awhile. I learned to do  some new things, but not as much as I was supposed to, for the time I was there. My job was a part time job. Management wasn't so communicative with the employees, which sometimes made important news or upcoming events catch us by surprise. There were also a lot of schedule changes made at the last moment, which sometimes interfere with our personal obligations. Management seem so disorganized."
good,"If you love working fast and always keeping busy, this is the perfect job. There's always someone there to talk due to so many employees. It's a great place to work and go the extra mile for. If you're concerned about getting hours, toss that worry to the side. It's easy to pick up shifts and talk to management about extra work. They're always in need for a helpful hand."
good,Working there was one of the best jobs i had it was fun fast paced and great environment for me. I would love every opportunity to work there again. Thank you for listening
good,its a good job if you are looking for solid  employment at a company with lots of benefits as well as the opportunity to advance in your pay and in to position you work at
good,It Was Actually A Good Experience The Co Workers Were Friendly Supervisors Really Did There Job It Was My First Job Now I'm Ready To Expand To Other Levels At Work
good,Walmart is a good place to work just do your job and follow the safety rules that's applied to you and treat the customers with good hospitality and you don't have to watch your back
good,"i enjoyed working there for the amount of time i did, i would refer this job to friends of mine hands down because they works are all friendly it doesn't feel so much like work it."
good,loved working there but the store needs to work on training better for the employees so customers can have a better experience in the store and out side
good,Work hard and never give up because hard work pays off and I just know when u set your mind on a goal the sky is the limit and the goals u set for yourself can make your dreams come true
good,Trabjo con mucha movilidad y estres con mucha experiencia laboral
good,Walmart is based on customer satisfactions. Most workers of the company forget this key detail. In an environment where workers split the load most forget the key fundamental leaving most others overwhelmed.
good,Wal mart is a good place to build stability and a good place of business to start a career. Wal mart has holiday bonuses employees rewards days and a lot of friendly co workers to work with.
good,"Walmart is changing daily they are more focused on numbers and how to push the product to the shelf where we would stock the shelves and take care of the customers now we are spending time scanning the shelves and not stocking. Walmart was family oriented, overall Walmart would be good if someone is on that fast track of moving up in the company, I have been with Walmart for 17 years and seen a lot of changes some for the good I'm all for change Customer focus is gone."
good,"I'm a former Walmart associate."
good,Come in and do your job and everything will go as planned. Don't take anything or do anything that is not supposed to be done because you are on camera and will be taken to jail if do wrong

good,"Stocking, unloading truck, sorting and heavy lifting.  Helping and greeting customers on the floor. Being professional at all times and following safety rules."
good,"I was so happy when I first started working at Walmart. I loved all of my coworkers and managers. I was so eager to work every day that I was scheduled. After about a year of working there, the job just became a drag and I dreaded going to work. I just need a change in my job journey."
good,Walmart was also another job I enjoyed. The people were great and they all were funny and very helpful when I needed help on something I didn’t understand.
good,"prepare and complete orders for delivery or pick up according to schedule ( load, pack, label, ship) keep a clean and safe working environment and optimize space utilization"
good,It wasn't the est but the my was gooI.  I hate that they only give you 3 days off for 6 months. And the manas never have to take responsibility for their actions.
good,Walmart is not a bad place to work store manager is great and Assitant managers are ok from time to time . the atmosphere was good and not all customers were very happy about certain products were not stocked or have been deleted.
good,It wasn't the worst time of my life. Even though I was only seasonal and it was always super mega busy is wasn't horrible but it did make me hate the company and people for awhile
good,Walmart is always hiring for one reason. They a high employee turn over rate. Its easy to advance to a management position being they have so many departments but no set schedules. And they only hire you part-time or seasonal.
good,"Run register ,keeping station clean,helping people with what they need and always being polite to everyone, even the rude.The cams are great. Love the people I work with. I've learned that there are some crazy people out there and they are always at walmart."
good,I was a cashier at Walmart and had to check customers out and make sure my area was clean before leaving. You would have to stand there all day so you would leave hurting but overall it's an easy job.
good,Always changing and evolving. Great place to grow customer service skills and always willing to develop skills when given opportunities to do so. Flexible scheduling and allowed transfers to multiple locations.
good,balanced multiple cash drawers reasearched shortages reconcilied bank activity reports answered customer calls about credit card charges that were incorrect
good,"Provided customer service, including problem-solving and answering questions to ensure customer satisfaction. Accountable for a cash drawer and used computerized register. Disinfected workspace and organized according to company policy. Pitched in where needed to stay busy when there were no customers to cash out. Kept current with company policies on alternative payments, such as WIC, Traveler’s checks, and personal checks"
good,"Hard on Family Life, Hours are often sporadic, No guarantee of full time hours, Insurance is decent with vision a plus but medical at a high deductible."
good,"This job i was taught a great deal of things however though it also taught me the cruel lesson that management avoids those in need, i was always understaffed for the most part, didn't have enough people there to ever take a normal break or be destressed for more than 5 minutes."
good,"es una empresa buena donde hay un ambiente agradable ,"
good,"Wal-Mart is the largest retail company in the U.S.  They have a wide variety of jobs, and on the job training.  Their retail distribution is world wide."
good,"Good working environment, constant flow of work to be done. Good teamwork between employees. Little down time, there's always something to accomplish even when there is no customers"
good,It gets very busy and when it is not busy there are many things to keep yourself busy.  The managers are very respectful and understanding of problems
good,"Working for Walmart is like working with a family of co-workers who know how to help you push forward and don't leave you behind. The associates are always in great sprits, as for the management staff it can go both ways good or bad depending on their mood. But its like any other work place with the ups and downs. the company is constantly change and it gets really frustrating trying to keep up with all the changes."
good,"I cashiered, customer service, layaway, and put away returns. I helped customers find items that they were looking for and put away new stock. The hardest thing about the job is being on your feet all day."
good,"Everyone in the store helps out when needed. Even if it's not particular persons department. It's a good atmosphere for the most part. Everybody usually got along and tyou could always count on a few laughs on a daily basis, it could of been with a co-worker or an outgoing customer."
good,"Enjoyed working there"
good,Wal-Mart can be busy one minute and empty the next. Customers come in waves but there is always something to do. I am always on my feet. Constantly finding ways to help customers have the fastest and friendliest experience possible.
good,"Shifts are very variable, depending on the demands of each days order.  Benefits of the position are great and schedule flexibility is a plus.  The hardest part of the job is that it can be physically demanding."
good,"This is the same Wal-mart as mentioned before, I was just promoted to a higher paying job. However, I loved this job better than being a cashier. I was in charge of the front end and loved every minute of it."
good,the mangers are terrible to the employees dont work here also the pay sucks i was told that i would be getting 40 hours a week but im not getting that im getting in between 32 or 30 hours.

good,somewhere to grow at and learn new skills and talents. the location is close to my house and I enjoy their discounts and staff is friendly and helpful.
good,I loved my job at walmart supercenter. I worked in many different areas while being with the organization. The benefits where not great and hours was very hard to come by.
good,I like helping all the people that come to the store on a day to day bases some I got to know a a first name bases I do like the work I do at wslmart.
good,"Great pay, horrible policies. They are VERY strict upon employees. They also have a terrible holiday pay policy. Great benefits. They have a strict attendance policy as well."
good,interacting with different customers made the day go by fast.  the coworkers was another important part of my day because getting along with them made the day run smooth.
good,my work experience there was an interesting one. I did enjoy the job at times but some of the time was not a joyous time. sometimes I just did not want to work there anymore.
good,"Like I said, do your job and go about your business. A great company to work under. Always show up for work and do your best! This company needs to revert back to days of family and caring. Remember, not everyone is your friend."
good,"I worked at the Walmart in Louisburg. I had many difficulties with Walmart, starting with poor communication between management. It wasn't all bad I loved my coworkers in the bakery. The job wasn't hard, you just needed to find a good routine."
good,"It paid the bills and it was easy work,  but management team lousy,  except for one.  Competitive pay,  but lacked in holiday pay and bonuses.  Would work there again,  maybe a different store would treat me a little better"
good,Nice place too work.           I am a temp worker that Is employed by INdemand services a vender that was hired by Wal-Mart.                                                              ------------------------------------------
good,"Started the night with a safety sweep of the store followed my re-waxing of a select section of the store. By morning a final safety sweep is done before heading home."
good,"Very clean and productive environment. Strategically oriented, every shift begins with a meeting to discuss and go over the game plan for that shift, day, week, and month."
good,"A typical day at work would be handling customer transaction such as returns and exchanges, cashing checks and money orders. "
good,Seguimiento continuo al aprendizaje y ofertas de rotación de áreas cuando adquieres la capacidad para mejorar.
good,Was a good place to work. Never nothing to do. associates were good to work with. Management was sometimes good but had their days when they did not know what to do
good,"left there because the pay was not good at all , they expect you to work alot without any compensation. Not any benefits for a big corporation that it is."
good,Walmart was fine I didn't liked how I was fired. Some guy came in who was from corporate and said I was sleeping on the job. 5 and a half months I was there. I stocked also which I was find with.
good,"The job is very easy, the hardest part is dealing with rude customers but if you can get over it, its fine. Managers are great and it's not hard to get a day off."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo gracias al apoyo que existe entre compañeros y líderes de área ."
good,Walmart can be a friendly place to work. It has advancement opportunities. Good for part-time jobs. Does not always offer full time hours or benefits.
good,"I had a good work experience at walmart, very bust at times, i learned to deal with different people on a one on one basis, management was good, hardest part was when other cashiers would not show up for their shifts."
good,"organize my section get my cash box"
good,"there was a lack of training and general knowledge on the part of the  supervisors. Otherwise my experience wasn't bad. "
good,"fast paced environment, very competitive, have to be very strong minded and self motivated, proactive in all areas, respect for individual, strong manager skills"
good,My job consists of sorting through the produce for expired items. I know exactly what is expected of me on a daily basis. I work in very cold climates.  The customers are great and I always try to help or assist them.  Management changes very often and sometime not for the better.
good,Easy days work show up on time and get the necessary requirements of the days work done. In other words dont make the job hard on yourself. Go in with a positive attitude and everything else will fall in place
good,"Walmart is not a bad company to work for. The only downside is that there is too many managers that collide with each other frequently. The customers are in the middle, the works are fun to work with."
good,The company has benefits that are helpful and discounts for associates. Good working environment but the pay is far too low for survival in the United States.
good,"Fast paced and on the go."
good,I was an order filler during my time at walmart. This was a job I had in the interim between job within my field of expertice. I found this job to be a great experience..
good,Working at Wal-Mart was a good experience for me since it was my first job. I also think that if they raised the starting pay up a dollar or 2 maybe they would receive lots of applicants.
good,I have to help customers with their items by ringing them up and bagging them.. I also help at customer service taking care of returns and sending money to others or making bill payments.
good,Receiving products off the truck and scanning it and receiving it into the building.Allowing for the pickers to pick to and out for delivery. Once shipped out delivery is then complete.
good,salaried members of management usually don't know what they're doing! They will tell u something wrong and then act like it never happened! Its really ironic to me how I haven't had an assistant manager over in in almost two years and now the person they hired is from outside the company and has no idea of what to do! They have my new assistant manager shadowing me for 2 weeks (basically i am  training someone who will get paid more than me and tell me what to do!)
good,"it was a decent place to work."
good,I worked in apperal. And in apparel there is supposed to be 4 to 5 people working 6 departments.  But there was only me and sometimes another employee. I don't feel lije they were proplerly staffed.
good,"Most of the people working or shopping at Walmart were very nice.  I only work there a year but became friends with a lot of people. "
good,The people are ok to work with. The managers tell you something and they usually forget about what they said a few moments later. At the time I was working there they didn't have enough workers and they refused to hire anymore.
good,"Very demanding scheduling depending on location and time of year. The work is often straightforward, and easy to understand. The people are nice and management is fair. Be prepared to mix between departments and jobs as under-staffing occurs often given the few employees hired, as well as the constant flux of temporary workers hired on"
good,"The work is easy, they train you throughout the year. Someone will always help you if you have questions. Depending on the section you work in, work pace can either be slow or fast."
good,"When I was hired on, the position I was initially interested in had been filled, but they were able to get me into a different one. I appreciate their flexibility in that regard, and hope to continue to find other companies that are able to do as such. I would recommend this company to a friend."
good,There is bad seeds in every job but i do have to say they do listen and open door is is way better than my current job where your not protected n kiss the big sales n do what they can to get a sale. And structure. Since there is pwople with disabilities. A fair market n job for a wide range of people to employ
good,"I loved working here even though it was 16 hours shift. I loved the fast paced environment, dead lines and the pressure. I loved being pushed so I can show my managers that I a hard worker and show them that I could accomplish what was assigned to me."
good,"It was a great part time job, I would go back, the reasonable time did help with a full time college schedule, but for the pay it wasn't a career I would continue."
good,I work there thought a temp agency. A typical day at work for me was to stock merchandise on shelves all day. Management was ok didn't really help you unless their manager came out.
good,You tend to see a lot of people working in walmart just during normal shopping hours so you have a pretty rough guess of how the work is. Stocking isn't all that hard and once you learn where the majority of your items are shelved its not hard to develop your own steady pace.
good,"Very steedy work area,self checkout,some nice some rude.Still do my best.Management always closeEnjoyed busy past,made days go quicker.Very good Sercurity.."
good,"This employer is good for college students! It offers flexible hours and the management team is willing to work around your schedule! However, there is not much room to move up the ranks."
good,Management attitudes could be worked on but overall good place to work. It was great being able to help customers and fellow employees with everyday problems
good,They used to be the place to go as a pharmacist.  But then demanded more and more with less help.  They at least paid me very well.  Had very good schedules up until the last couple years
good,I liked this work place at times and sometimes I didn't. The managers are rude. I felt over worked and not appreciated. I would go back if they offered better pay and a different position.
good,Quite stressful. I learnt a lot being my first job in Canada. It is a good place to start building your experience from. Friendly co-workers and also good associates in General
good,always busy fast paced environment I learned how to deal with difficult customers and management could use a lot of improvement and learn to listen to their employees more. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people.
good,job was productive. managers made it hard for workers to do there jobs properly because of different orders. overnight pay was not what i thought it would be.
good,"Everyday we see a decent amount of people. I learned how to use the fry machine how to use a rotisserie oven and slicing machines. Every night I would wash all the dishes, rotisserie oven, slicers and fry machine."
good,Fun and great workplace a lot to learn from thy are always running out of bags but it makes up over it all the employees are friendly and helpful makes you want to return
good,"Wal mart was overall a very interesting place to work at. I did anything from cashiering to stocking items. The workplace was very fast -paced and stressful, but exciting. The hardest part about the job was standing on my feet for long hours, but the most enjoyable part was being able to interact with my customers and brighten their days. I learned how to be patient and provide my upmost help to customers when needed."
good,During my time working here my experience was good. its a pretty good work environment to be in and most of the employees are friendly. I did not mind working their.
good,You work with friendly people everyday get to meet new people  it's different sections  to work in there's excitement everyday something to look forward to
good,"Just like any job it has its ups and downs. Bad management plays a very big role in keeping great workers. Most people are willing to help you and sometimes you are forced to learn on your own. You can meet really cool people, but the best thing to do most of the time is stay to yourself and do not build a personal relationship on a business level."
good,Walmart is an amazing company to work for. They offer numerous health and insurance benefits to both part time and full time employees. All management are often very knowledgeable and quick to respond to any issues.
good,A great job for someone looking to make extra cash or someone that can't find a job due to qualifications.  I am not sure what else to write.  You stayed busy and the work made the 8 hours go by fast.
good,Working at walmart was nice knowing that I had a nice team behind me. I could come and talk to my boss if I had any questions or any problems with how the customers or the workers was treating me .
good,I worked as a cashier at Walmart. I loved the face paced environment and the companies wiliness to work around my busy school schedule. Great place to work.
good,"I was an inventory associate. I picked during the first part of the shift, which meant I would climb up ladders and get items from the backroom shelves. Then I would bin, which means I would organize and put barcode stickers on items."
good,Went to work at 10pm started working right away.  I learned how to work as a team.  some of the managers were ok.  The workplace was pretty friendly people seemed to get along.  The hardest part was working until 7am.  The most enjoyable part was some of the people I worked with.
good,"I was a cashier, stocker, and also, help with the phone system.  I learned to interact with many cultures."
good,Some of the people try to be boss while they are not your boss. some days are better than others. like no other job someone would have. mostly it is not all that bad.
good,"it is good working at Walmart, but it does not provide job security to any of the employee. In last month Walmart Canada laid down around 500 of their managers. If managers are not secured there so it is hard to expect job security there."
good,Good workplace and deacent oppertunities to move up if you do a couple years in different departments which i wasnt completely convinced with cause apparently college doesnt even matter if you wanna move up faster where im from
good,loved walmart  get bonuses if store bonuses.management is fair..learned point system stinks...only insurance if full time... there really is no place that is hard when you r a cashier hands on is the best way.
good,"Its a fun place to work once you get comfortable, but the managers are a hand full so if any one has a bad temper or what not Walmart is not the place for them."
good,"This was my first real job. It was easy for me. However, there are times when you will encounter a rude customer. I had to deal with that a lot at this job."
good,"I like working at Walmart, but the pay is not good. Walmart does not pay there employees enough money as there deserve. It's unfair. Walmart employees need to get treated better,"
good,"I enjoyed having this job.  I worked with a great group of people and we worked well together.  My favorite part about this job was that Walmart recognized the skill set I have been taught by the military as a pharmacy technician, and they compensated me appropriately as well as gave an environment conducive to continue to build upon my skill set.  Being a pharmacy technician is often discredited because the pharmacist has the final check, and their name is the one on the bottle.  Walmart did not make me feel any less for that, in fact they gave credit where it was due and recognized the amount of work a technician does to ensure that what the pharmacist hands to the patient has been done to perfection."
good,Major retailer with headquarters located in Bentonville Arkansas.  This large corporation offers various job opportunities at all levels of experience.
good,Fue buena la experiencia apesar de que no avía sueldo
good,the place is great. the people were nice and the experience was great to get however moving up is difficult and at the time of working there the pay was little for very hard work.
good,Walmart is an okay place to work with easy money. Mostly everyone gets hired and the work is easy. The managers are easy to work with and gives you an hour long lunch.
good,very good work environment family orientated good pay great hours unlimited job opportunities great health care vision dental 401k vacation time and benefits
good,"Es una empresa que tiene una rotación excesiva, en varios departamentos, mucha gente piensa que es fácil pero es todo lo contrario demasiado demandante. A comparación de la industria y la gente que trabaja en estas tiendas sabe lo difícil y lo complejo que es."
good,"I started at Walmart right after I moved to Minnesota while I attended technical college. I began as a cashier, and from there I moved to the service desk, and after I received my Accounting Clerk diploma they moved me into the Cash Office. That position was a great and opened future opportunities for me."
good,Good job worked in automotive section was quite busy but was easy to learn the system with the help of my co workers the management wasn't to good at my store so I can't really say to much about them
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart as a second job. I worked as a cashier and in the garden department. This was my second job so I did not want to advance but they do promote good workers. Most people are there on their way to something else.
good,Every day was a surprise. I fill my cake case then do orders then I start my back up cakes. I did kids cupcakes and jumbo parfaits. Management was okay but co managers were the best.
good,I'm an overnight stocker.I like it because you don't deal with that many customers. The only bad thing is when you have a lot of freight it gets stressful.
good,"A typical day involved working with fellow associates, assisting customers, performing maintenance on equipment and working with inventory management to ensure products were readily available for customers."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart Was very fast-paced and steady, management was great. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The best part was meeting new people."
good,I love how WM is involved with the community. They treat they're associates and customers well. I like the innovative ideas they put in place quickly.
good,enjoyable part of the job my co-worker sharing each other and good team work. the hardest part of the job for me was always being late. I learn for that.
good,"Worked for Walmart a short time, enjoyed the time spent with them. The work was hard from time to time but everybody worked together till the job was done."
good,"The management was very lackluster, and inconsistent in management styles. most enjoyable part of my job at walmart was when i was able to help a customer. hardest part of my job was getting my job done because i was always getting called up front to help check when i was trying to move freight."
good,"Good place to work. They train you very well so you can be effective at doing your job with the company. The benefits are very good, such as health insurance."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work, it was like every job. you did you're job. management was good. The pay wasn't as good. The associates were very lovely."
good,"This job started off awful but I knew if I took my lumps it would or could be wonderful. The overnight support job consisted of me keeping track of all the overnight stock that went out to the floor. CAP was working with the team that unloaded said stock from the Trucks in the afternoon. Department manager is fairly self explanatory."
good,"un ambiente de trabajo sano y fluido, una que otro alto-bajo departe de los trabajadores de gerencia, buenas prestaciones y sueldo competente"
good,"Although it was a great place to work with great benefits and people, schedules have to be flexible and you have to be able to work over night as a manager to cover shifts needed. Would not recommend for single mothers or fathers or people with young kids"
good,Nice place to work because you get to see all walks of life come through the door. Your lunch is an hour they are really good about giving you a break throughout your shift.
good,"Typical day as a manager was to push out your routine in a timely manner. Unrealistic expectations and limited help and support. Every store is ran differently, therefore this is just based of my store experience. Flexible with breaks and lunches. Credability was pushed on DM's even when they had nothing to do with it. Overall I enjoyed my time there, the pay just was not there for some of us. Pay was unfair upon DM's."
good,"The Wal-Mart on Georgesville Rd is not typically sough after. The management is a bit shoddy, leaving much to be desired from those beneath them. I was personally trained to do the job of 5 separate people; Electronics Associate, Fabric Counter, Paint Mixer, Sporting Goods and Connections (Wireless) Center. I was fully expected to perform above and beyond those roles every day, but was never given a raise to reflect the extra responsibility during my six months working those 5 departments."
good,"Work is hard and not for the week, but the management is worse. You have to work ALL YEAR LONG except Christmas Day. That is the holiday you get off. They do not care how the work you as long as they look good."
good,"Come in, go to a meeting, get assignment, stock shelves and make your isle neat/clean before 7am. They want stock on shelves before 6am. Hard place to get fired unexpectedly, you will get fired for reasons you already knew about. They do anything to keep employees good and bad for the most part (they stopped doing drug-testing and made it a one question interview in just the year between my applications. I worked two summers for them). Don't expect the most professional environment, manager quality is subjective, great ones the first time around, bums the second. Do not expect much overtime, will be short-staffed the vast majority of the time."
good,the managers were good and friendly the coworkers were very friendly as well. easy hours. hardest part was working the busy hours or having to deal with coupons
good,"I worked at Walmart for several years and would say that it is a great place to work. The management was helpful and the community was friendly. The only thing I could complain about is the job security, felt like everyday was hanging by a thread."
good,"Get to meet many people, work cash register, sale transactions, assisting customers, cleaning, selling products and food, working different departments"
good,Productive and friendly environment just too much schedule being switched around constantly and hours being cut just became all a bit stressful for me.
good,"Typical day was Stock Groceries and help customer"
good,not my favorite place to work but it pays the bills so i can't complain. Helps me with my needed hours so thats good too. Good if you're needing a job desperately.
good,It's like having your own practice with very little over hesd costs and no headaches of running a practice.  You set your hours and they provide all equipment and assistants.
good,"Job not as expected."
good,"The company does not demonstrate any ethical standards, but the employee must do so.  They lie, make false accusations, and are untrustworthy.  There is no respect for the individual! They care more about the un-certified tech that has been employed about 3 months and lies than they do about a 13 year pharmacist .  There is always a high turnover with technicians and cashiers.  Definitely favoritism in the workplace."
good,"I liked working with Walmart. If only I made more money and had more room to grow. It seems like for the facility that I worked for you had to ""Know"" someone to get ahead"
good,"Great work experience, learning new things and ways to deal with certain situations customers may have; Plus all the friendly staff members really helped make the days a little easier and made sure that I got the hang of the job(s) I was working they really knew what they were doing. On the other  hand their scheduling technique could use some work, it's always too many working one day and not enough working the next."
good,"Walmart was a nice place, but the only thing was the wages there were simply not enough for the requirements of the job. The hours are never the same and there were always lots of shortages."
good,Before being able to go on the register you have to go through a lot of computer courses and shadowing a person on the register. The computer courses are fairly repetitive and can take a long time to do them. Lunches can be an hour long so that is good and the register is easy to learn.
good,"Wal Mart was a pretty good place to work at. The store manager and supervisors at the time were rude, were caught in a few fibs, and very unfair. But I still loved working there. It was good income."
good,As long as you do your job and do it correctly or attempt to accomplish the task at hand you will succeed here. It is very fast paced and you must be able to think on your feet.
good,My experience with the local Walmart store was somewhat fair my training for Loss Prevention was not fair ended up being a cashier depending on the member of the management team either they are fair or not and all this statement is only for my time at one local Walmart
good,"Work hard and the opportunity to meet great new people,"
good,For the most part I enjoyed working at Walmart but some managers will only allow you to go so far. I can not really complain about my managers because most of them was very respectful and supported if you did what you were suppose to do. A typical day would be to go in stock and assist customers with purchasing.I learned good customers service skills. The work place culture where I worked was not very diverse. The hardest part of the job was stocking merchandise in your department and having to go help out in other department when they where short staff.
good,I was a team member at Walmart it was fun and flexible. the only thing wrong was other team member who wasn't professional at all. the management didn't do anything about the behavior.
good,"el apoyo es mutuo si das recibes, pagos puntuales buenos beneficios"
good,"Hard worker willing to learn team player.Love To Work With People. I'm a great man. Willing to sacrifice, nice with customers, fun with everybody. Will do what ever it takes to get this job ."
good,"deli worker, cleaning, lifting, stocking, working in walk in coolers, customer service rep, high volume customer service, loading and unloading trucks"
good,"Wal-Mart has many good benefits for its employees.  You must be willing to work hard, work as part of a team and individually, manage your time, and be a leader.  "
good,A little strict on the policies for new hires. I would definitely work there again. Fast way to make money with a full/part time job. Discounts came in handy for black Friday.
good,working at Walmart lets you learn about a variety of things and helps with learning patience. Walmart allows you to move up with the company and with each position learning something different. You get to interact with customers so your not always doing the same thing.
good,"didn't appreciate ones worth to the team, when you put your 110% effort towards work, displaying customer service, then its still not enough eventually you'll become fed up"
good,"Working from 2-11pm, the days always went by slow. But I liked working at Walmart and the staff. My manager was also very helpful whenever anyone of he employees need help."
good,This stocking job was basic--bring out a u-boat and stock the shelf in the correct spaces. my co-workers were friendly as was management. it would be frustrating when we were out of an item and could not help a customer get what they were looking for at our location.
good,"Mi evaluacion, excelente empresa,regular pago liquido, buen equipo trabajo organizado"
good,"I liked this a lot but I wanted more pay. This was like one of my first jobs so responsibility was not a big factor, I guess I was jut being greedy. Happy to have the opportunity to work with them,"
good,your able to move around the store freely and gain opportunities but you cant move too fast or the managers will team up and get you out the door when they feel as if their job is in jepority
good,"Too many managers telling you what to do, low moral, can't fully help customers properly, polices, benefits, can't finish what I started, made friends"
good,It was a good place to improve my social skills while working with civilians and to help customers find what they were looking for. I prevented theft at the store and assisted the management with certain jobs that they had.
good,I really enjoyed my job and what I did on a daily basis. My co-workers were very fun to work with and my managers in various sections I stocked were top notch.
good,Being a cashier at walmart was an ok summer job. The days could get long at times but the pay was fair. Sometimes it was hard on the feet but other than that it wasnt a bad job
good,The managers don't have anything in order. Breaks aren't long enough.Managers and employees are rude. No managers in 2b shift to reconize the employee work progress .
good,Employees act like family. Management doesn't know how to treat employees but the caring atmosphere from each associate makes up for that.  It is a great place to move up fast with hard work and dedication.
good,"It was a fun environment to work at, employees and company wise to. Working between the electronics and photo department was always a good challenge for the day."
good,People are great but the only missing four days in 6 months is a little unrealistic sometimes things happen that can't be avoided like a hospitalization
good,Keep them coming. Love all the job offers that you send to me. They are really helpful in search of a career. Cool and great how you help out so many people.
good,"Good pay, worked with good people. Good benafits and you have the option to buy stock in the company. There were to many managers and they moved departments to much. Managers were not there long. It was fun and you always stayed busy."
good,It is very busy sometimes you may get 15 minutes break sometime you wont. schedule is not set sometimes you close one night or 3 nights in row same goes toward working on weekends. people i love people i work with but management needs improvement.
good,I didn't think the job was bad! Just be nice and have a good outlook on life. Other some people could be very rude you just have to ignore them. There were some managers that were bad but most were good!
good,"good place to get a job easy to get just very unorganized need to get it together will be able to get hours after you work there for awhile "
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart. The customers were awesome. My coworkers were awesome. My managers were always caring and nice. I spent two years working for Walmart.
good,"Sobre um dia típico no trabalho, é corrido. Mais tem que ser ágil, prestar atenção pra não sair nada errado."
good,"I was actually a produce Department Manager at Walmart, i was a very hard worker, even when I'm done with my department they always send out to help other department that's why I never had time   when i was working there."
good,"The management is very lacking, making it hard to work with the people in charge of scheduling. Otherwise it is a good workplace culture where fun is allowed."
good,For 11 years I provided great customer service and enjoyed the shared responsibility of tasks with the other associates. It was our honor to make sure that we put the customer first.
good,"14 years great company but things changed. Company be came too coprate ran instead of family oriented "
good,Stocking items at garden center. Sometime you can meet the job set for the day because you are by yourself. Work mostly outside which is not too bad. Operate forklift and move heavy items to different locations.
good,Fast paced and a person can work in different industries all within one company.  It's one of the largest companies and that provides a great training ground.
good,I knew what my job was every night. So the people I worked with made things easier. We got along and got our tasks done almost every night. I'd go back if I had the chance.
good,"Worked with Walmart through a temp agency, depending on the store job was pretty good, some of the store managers in the Kissimmee are not fair, they want you to do grimy work which themselves refuse to do, when they finished using the workers with the temp agency they would tell the agency they didn't want them back, yet they would not get their regular employees to do this work."
good,"Walmart is a very productive work place, and very fast pace. There is always something there to keep you busy throughout your shift. The employees are very nice as well."
good,It was a nice and fun job. I really enjoyed my co workers they felt like a second family. Being on your feet can be a bother but if you wear the right shoes you should be alright
good,"very understanding with school schedule, dynamic work environment always with something to do. Interactions with customers were on both ends of the spectrum with the majority being very good."
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers."
good,They offer quarterly bonuses to all employees. They have what is called an open door policy in where you can go to the store manager or any higher up without fear of retaliation.
good,Wal-mart is a place where you can advance. New positions and promotions are available to you when you excel in your current position. Its a cool place to meet new people and serve your community.
good,"In this first job, I learned what hard work, team work, and customer service was. My days went like this: Cooked food, served customers, took orders, stocked, marked prices down, cleaned every inch of the deli, from the dishes to the ovens to the floors; underwent inspection, then closed. Management was excellent, friendly, and helpful."
good,A typical day at work really just consist of stock an area or areas that has been giving to you for the night. Its really is not a difficult job to do as long as you can keep a quick pace and finish your task in a timely manner.
good,"good place to start working as a young adult. Flexible hours, good management, unpaid lunch break, has good benefit options for employees. would recommend."
good,"Its everything you've ever been told about walmart. There is good and bad with it. The good is that you do create friends out of co workers that become family. Management was ok, some good some bad. Forget about having a social life outside of  it. But the only for most and me is that they do provide great benafits."
good,"Walmart is an okay company to work with."
good,"The staff was very friendly and helpful."
good,"I have been with this company for 21 years. It can be fast-paced, especially on weekends, but it can also be a fun environment. There are morning meetings as sort of a prep rally with information passed on to those in attendance and always ends with a cheer. "
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and the co-workers.  There are rough days but that comes with any job. I learned how to make people smile even if they probably didn't want to... Smiling is infectious.
good,"handling of cash register, ringing up sales, and processing of payments. It also involves applying discount and scanning of coupons. work at very fast pace, especially during holiday sessions when people would have more time to visit the store."
good,"Typical day starts with Standup calls and learned so many new things about managing work and development."
good,"As a cashier and sales associate, the typical work day on third shift includes operating a cash register, helping customers, and restocking merchandise. "
good,"what is there not to do at Walmart. All work is different at Walmart depending on the department you are working in. For the most part everyone will have shelves to stock, and show customer service"
good,"You learn how to be able to balance your every day tasks with tasks at work, Management is amazing, hardest part of job is dealing with customers that are not all that pleasant but makes you feel accomplished when you are able to brighten their days.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public."
good,"It was good except no hours, the management was sometimes very polite which makes my day go by better."
good,"For one of the hardest jobs you'll ever love, this job compares to most I have held in my lifetime. I always get to work at least 15 minutes early to soak in the atmosphere of the day.(knowing how hectic it might be). Always ready to dive in and start helping customers with finding what they need as an associate cashier. Using my own hand held technology instead of waiting for a service manager with a store computer in helping finding and locating products. Feeling accomplished at the end of my shift when the day slows down."
good,"Jobs were pretty simple. Management can be too demanding for what all needs to be done. Hardest part was dealing with rude customers, employees, or managers."
good,"Overall, this is a good company to work for. Communication needs to be worked on and some management should be more considerate. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unsatisfied customers."
good,"On a typical day, I would start by checking people out at the register, then I would stock or restock any candy. Next I would help any with the buggies of returns that had to be put back up by the end of each night. Also, I would help count the money and deposit the money in the money machine for the night."
good,"I am a hard worker. I am looking for something light duty part time. I've gotten older. Can't do some of the things I used to do. But I do give everything my best. I was working temporarily as a back up for two individuals who had live in clients. But their situations changed. So I was no longer needed. I did meal time, putting them to bed and getting them up and ready for the day.Laundry when needed, cleaned soiled accidents."
good,I had a lot of fun at work and liked the people I worked with. I learned that you don't get along with everyone you work with but you still be nice to one another because of work. I managed how much food we made every time it needed made and how long we cooked it for. My workplace culture was to make friends and engage in what was going on while at work. The hardest part of the job to me was trying to make sure everything was done when it needed to be done. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to meet new people and make new friends.
good,"You will be faced with different situations everyday."
good,"Employees are nice and respectful, good environment of working if you like take it easy, in the other hand if you like to work you ender up doing most of the job."
good,"Hours were decent, but management refused to keep a full staff leading to overtime issues such as half of management demanding you to work overtime, and the other half telling you if you get so much as 1 minute over you would lose it or be fired. Often you would be forced to go home early or take a long lunch so you wouldn't go past your scheduled hours whether they be 40 or 21, but if asked you could be given extra hours depending on the manager. Management also often tripped over their own feet in figuring out what to do and when, resulting in some very confusing mixed orders."
good,"Wal Mart is a mega company. hey say they care about their employees but I did not see much of that. All hey cared about was emptying the truck. In the 3 and a half years I was there not much changed, except they got younger more arrogant managers."
good,"Fast paced place to work, there is room for advancement, it is not a good place for someone that is not flexible. no one is off for the holidays. But it is a large corporation the benefits are good."
good,The staff I worked with was awesome! We worked well as a team and the management was very flexible with your needs as long as you worked hard for them.
good,"Diverse culture, lots of room for cross training and some advancement.  Each location has its own unique atmosphere with challenges for personal and professional growth."
good,people friendly and helpful great place to shop can find what you are looking for most of the time can also order on line products sometime management act like they don't care about your life outside of Walmart
good,"Working at Walmart was a fun experience. Great people, communicating with new faces, everything is there. A one stop shop! It's really a great place to work and grow"
good,"Very typical place to work, we unloaded a Truck in a timely fashion then put everything away where it needed to go in the store. The people i worked with were pretty cool which made the job a little better."
good,EL ambiente de trabajo es bueno pero el sueldo es poco y hay exceso de rotación de turno.
good,"Great company to work for.  Offer good career path as well as great learning experience if you chose to be in retail."
good,"Great job, good pay, and benefits. The company has great learning experiences and growth opportunities. I loved my job and the customers, even the rude ones. My hours were 3pm-11pm or 7am-3pm. Self checkout out host typically keeps open availability so i didn't really have too many days off."
good,"Walmart was a busy environment to work in, also was a great workplace to be a part of. Friendly, and family oriented, as well as being a family in itself. The employees definitely care about one another, upper management need some work definitely."
good,"Walmart is an adequate place to work. Of course, you need to be able to answer customer questions, but if you shop here, you should be able to answer most questions. Sometimes it can take a bit of temper management, due to the fact that some customers can be very upset and misunderstanding with the company policies. The environment around other employees is generally pretty peaceful. Sometimes you'll need to keep asking to move to another position in the store, but with good attendance and if you spend enough time there, you should be able to get any position you ask for."
good,"A lot of layoffs in the last 3-4 years.  This was always a ""secure"" place to work in NW Arkansas but not anymore.  Seems to be rounds of layoffs every 6 months."
good,"learned a lot of  positions customer service, front end , produce, bakery, deli, commercial bread and running a area , and doing schdules and cleaning these areas."
good,"Pay is not the best but the people are fun to work with and make up for alot"
good,"I liked to work there because the customers are nice, the workers are very professional and organized. I also liked that if you needed help with anything, they were always there to help you with whatever you need help with."
good,i enjoyed working at Walmart. the customers were friendly and fun. although the employees did not have those types of characteristics.On a typical day much wasn't really a difference. i just minded my own business and did my duties as i was suppose to. i left due to lack of leadership there on the job and the fact that management did not want to work around the fact i had two partime jobs.
good,"Good place to work. Nice people. Good at helping you. work with your schedule, don't get rushed to finish, uniform everyday, its a comfortable work environment."
good,"Great at hiring people who need jobs, are special needs, etc. It's your typical job. I got along well with others, enjoyed the time I spent there, which was less than a year."
good,It was my first time in customer service and it was really enjoyable. made a lot of freids and the manegment was very reasonable. if i could go back i would
good,overall good experience with main opportunities for advancement. had some problems with management not performing their tasks and having to pick up the remaining work.
good,"•	Accepting various phones and answering guest question to the best of my ability."
good,"Meetings every morning with a team chant. Hard job is working in grocery dept, alot of physical labor involved. You must possess great customer service to be able to work there."

good,"A stable company to wok for. Good environment. Friendly co-worker."
good,"Work wasn't too bad, easy enough, supervisors were good, hours were okay. Good work environment because I could do my own thing most shifts. I worked in an area I liked."
good,Walmart was my first ever job and it was one of the best places I ever worked at. I do not think all Walmarts are like the one I worked at because we were like one big family and I was a trusted employee who was able to train new cashiers and given extra jobs by the managers.
good,Very flexible work schedule and very nice management staff. Veteran friendly work place. Many opportunities for advancement and betterment of oneself.
good,"It is a very busy business, that provides vast amounts of merchandise for almost any need.  Provided me a fair wage and good hours to balance my social life."
good,I came in on special assignment by the manager of that department. I started as a customer and because of the amazing service I received I decided to join the team.
good,Every day was always different because of the customers so it made the days interesting. Helping out a customer was my favorite part of working there.
good,Great people to work with. Great management team in place at Gretna. Be prepared to work and to work hard. Employee number and availabilty do not come close to being sufficient for work load.
good,"Great store bad place to work over nights."
good,A typical day at work moving trailers in and out of dock doors. The hardest part about the job is keeping up with the quota of moves per hour and staying safe.
good,"this job is so easy people dont take it seriously sometimes. there needs to be more direction and peoples working ethic needs to be better, just because its ""walmart"" doesnt give you a reason to slack on the job."
good,"The management was friendly and the staff was excellent. My time there has helped me with my social interactions and customer assistance, whether it is ringing them up through checkout or helping find a certain item."
good,I unloaded the trucks daily and stock the merchandise on the shelf. What of the best tools I got from Walmart was customer service. It challenged me to open up and deal with customer complaints.
good,"Buen ambiente y pesado"
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers and working to get our task done in a timely manner. My day starts at 4am and have learned many things about the grocery business.
good,Airdrie Wal-Mart has a great group of people that are fun and easy to work with. As it is a very busy store there is always lots to do. It is currently undergoing management changes in order to better provide direction and customer assistance. when all the new changes are done it should be a good place to be for both customers and employees
good,Always do your job. Ever be late great everyone with a smile  great staff and management  great hours had a lot of fun working with the people that qork
good,"Empresa multinacional, muitos associados, grande líder em vendas."
good,"The money is good the people are nice you get good hours and it was local and they work with you if you can't come in.Some of the cons is hours, certain departments have limited hours to give. Not cashier's or the cap teams."
good,"Being a general Hospital, all sorts of patients are encountered; adult, pediatrics, psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology, labor and delivery, emergency, you name it."
good,"As a Frozen, Dairy, Deli Stocker, you'd clock in, go to a short meeting over freight, then you go to your area. You'd break down pallets then run the freight to their areas. Management was pretty easy-going if you did your work, if you didn't management would talk to you and try to help."
good,it was a nice place to work meet nice people you work with co workers and the customers where friendly also we treat each other like a family we helped each other out when needed
good,"As an overnight stocker, the hours were already stuff with me having to balance school as well. Depending on who was shift manager really determined how the night would go and that included who would be working there as well."
good,"Scanning freight coming in from other Walmart stores, Scan them and send them back to vendors. Scanning in the computer if the freight is damaged or not."
good,"Al igual que muchos trabajos tiene su ventanas y desventajas, es un buen lugar para aprender y crecer laboralmente"
good,Price changes-clean department-fill stock from receiving to put on the floor.  End of shift  clean up. Learned a lot in 7 yrs. I have been here. The people I work with
good,The job was not too bad. The management at my store was really nice and made the work experience worth it. I learned more about being a cashier and proper disposal of certain items. Trying to keep a smile on your face while being yelled at by a customer who is annoyed at the world is probably the hardest part of that job.
good,A lot of the time when working for walmart you will feel like you do everything on your own and its frustrating. Managers and highers up mainly walk around bossing people around with disregard for professionalism. Teamwork will mainly come from being forced to work together or friends deciding they want to work together. Sometimes you will even get confronted about tasks you didnt even know you were assigned.
good,i got along with everybody most of the managers where very nice and treated everybody with respect they had great benefits and where a good job to keep i wish i never left
good,It's a great work place and environment great workers great mangers reasonable hours easy work but fast pace hard working crew members and reliable good people
good,I have enjoyed a 24+ year career at Wal-Mart with opportunity to make an impact in a number of areas of the business.  Challenges are always present and opportunity for advancement is available.
good,A nivel general empresa con una cultura de ambiente laboral con valores y enfocados sobre todo al cliente y su satisfaccion en experiencia de compra
good,My day at work starts off good as usual but what I learned from my past work places is to work hard fast an efficient an in a clean work place help the customers an be kind to your workers an customers as well
good,a typical day is great its always work never boring but management needs to learn how to communicate better overall its a good place to start off with work
good,Always changing and fast paced. This helps make the day go by faster and gives you a felling of accomplishment. We work as a team to meet category goals.
good,"Typical day at work: "
good,A great place to work. the workers are pleasant also. the pay was good too. I enjoyed my time there. I was given a chance there with no experience at first.
good,when i worked there they seem to have a problem with job titles and people would have to assume other rolls because alot of higher ups wouldnt do there jobs
good,"It wasn't a horrible place to work, like everyone makes it seem. It's just so busy with 1,000 things going on at once, which can make it hard to get things done."
good,"Walamart is a good place to work for, for someone who doesnt have a busy schedule with kids and school schedules. I definitely think the management needs to come together more with trying to agree on things."
good,"This company was very helpful when scheduling around my school. I was able to receive enough hours to pay for my schooling. I feel the workplace was nice I was able to get along with all of my coworkers. This employer had an open door policy, had I had any problems I needed to bring to them."
good,"I loved the job, it could use more help with  management as far as working with the employees. We could've used alot more help as well. We were extremely short on cashiers."
good,It was fun to work there but the managers seem to never know what they were suppose to do. It was very stressful because the tasks would never be completed and the next day would just be the same thing all over again.
good,Training lasts for a week. People I got hired with just disappeared after 2-3 weeks on the job. I'm still unsure what happened to them. Some co-workers are friendly enough. I rarely see workers smiling.
good,Lots have changed since 2002 . Fine place for employment. Everyones doing there job like they should. Attitudes could always use working on but as long as ur thick skinned you will be just fine.
good,"Would go back and work there any time except they just don't pay enough."
good,"If you are highly meticulous and detail oriented, this job is still going to pose a challenge. If you like a fast paced job and enjoy dealing with constant problem solving, then this is the place for you. Don't forget that there will be endless amounts of tasks that can rarely get all the way finished and it all seems worth it at the end of the day for the medical benefits"
good,"I worked night shift and realized by the time I got off shift the first night, that night shift was the way to go, it was way less stressful and there were less shoppers moving about the store."
good,Great experience to get me going in the direction of the career I really wanted. Pay was horrible but if you need extra work its not a bad place to go.
good,"Heures flexible, travail qui ne neccessite pas de d'effort en dehors des heures de travail. Possibilité de travailler avec des collègues dynamique et bien sur, la possibilité d'un bonus a la fin de l'année fiscale."
good,"There's really nothing wrong with working here, except for the fact that you only get paid minimum wage. The culture is great and everyone is friendly and willing to help."
good,It was a good job I love working with most of the ppl hot came in but store overall stinks bad management rude coworkers and mangers won't work with ur schedule
good,"- A typical day at work can be grinding."
good,"good place to work for, good company overall. Benefits are a plus, the system is easy to follow and is very self explanatory, people are nice and the hours are flexible."
good,Friendly co-workers that you team up with to take on huge tasks. Serving the customers in directing them to merchandise they cant find. Team work is the biggest accomplishment that is needed to move productivey
good,there was a lot of young workers fun to work not a hard job a lot of nice people great place to start working they work with your time nice place to work.
good,Management has NO Communication. Its difficult finding your task for the day because management gets everything confused. its like they are not prepared to do their job.
good,The company very coordinate in their employees. Every employees can express whatever ideas they can share for the company's benefit. And the immediate superior is nice.
good,"I worked at a brand new Neighborhood Market. The staff were all very friendly and easy to work with. The management was fantastic! I learned how to operate their cash register in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment, I always felt like I could ask for help if I needed it. I would say that the hardest part of the job was learning where everything was in the store. I only struggled with this for a short period of time until I learned my way around the store."
good,"Good for first work or for new comers to the country. Nice management. Cut hours, not always good schedule. Bad coffee :) good education programs. Take several years to take promotion."
good,"It's a laid back job, you would probably run into someone you know everyday .... it's a great job, everyone is nice and cool, you get to learn different departments"
good,"Ever since I started with Walmart in 2015, the company wants to see its employees grow in the company. Walmart has given the tools necessary to its employees to grow. From going to the Front End as a Customer Serivce Manager to a Training Coordinator, you can see what Walmart will do. There are so many opportunities for anyone."
good,Looking for the store is a pain in the butt sometimes and I wish you people would stop with this questions Wal-Mart is not as great as people think move on
good,Good learning experience with multiple responsibilities and it's a great way to learn leadership skills along with excellent daily problem solving issues of many kinds and to work as one big team.
good,"awesome benefits, family-work balance, great incentives when you do a good job and OT available throughout the year. Ability to work from home after 6 months in the office. Managers and Supervisors are willing to assist and go above and beyond to help you out."
good,"I did not mind my time there, I have no complaints. The work was easy to comprehend and kept you busy. I didn't stay long due to my own personal reasons."
good,"It's a good job, but communication problems within the company are unreal. The benefits and pay are good, management is pretty understanding. But the lack of proper communication makes things very frustrating."
good,Always put the customer first check the customer out in a fadt and friendly way help the customer when asked to do so and always give your all to the customer
good,Assisted customers with information and advice. Re-arranged work area to promote special sales and seasonal plants. Monitored plant life. This department was seasonal.
good,A mostly serious workplace but it is obvious that you are valued as an individual. The environment of work is high pressure/high reward. You have a real chance to make a difference in the business.
good,"No complaints, i actually enjoyed working at walmart. Decent pay, nice team of individuals i was able to get along with. Management and supervisors had nice attitudes."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart.At first I had a lot of trouble with what I was doing. I did not know anything about sporting goods, but I learned a lot. It was great when I could finally help customers without having to say I don't know what you are talking about."
good,Busy environment. Always more projects to complete. Customers are very important to the company. Pays good and provides many hours. Good health benefits.
good,I have enjoyed my time at Walmart Pharmacy as a pharmacy technician. Love the people I work with and interactions with the customers. Such a thrill working with the public.
good,"Great place for those looking for 401(k)."
good,"Buen Ambiente Laboral, excelentes prestaciones, cerca de mi domicilio, horario flexible"
good,"working at walmart  its hard to advance the manager dont like to help you out but just do your job, get your money and leave and be careful who you call friends"
good,not to much to say about Walmart mainly because a lot of management up there turns their head at you especially if you are not a favorite. I would unload a truck for gm (general merchandise) then went and stocked isles.
good,My son had a bad accident and was unable to work for close to a year. I requested a hardship transfer from the Hammond Walmart store where I was employed to the Harahan store so that I could assist his family during this difficult time. The Harahan personnel department made the transition very easy and the employees were friendly.
good,A great place to start out learning customer service and how to manage your attitude. Management can be a pain in the a at times they have their picks. Its a place where its busy on some days but most days they aren't as busy as .
good,"Etre associé chez Walmart, c'est avoir le sens de l'autonomie. Tu as des taches à faire, et tu dois savoir quel est le moment opportun pour la faire, parmi les demandes des clients. Un mixte entre le service à la clientèle ainsi que le travail d’entrepôt."
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work.  Team members work as a cohesive unit and are very friendly and nice. Wal-Mart tends to hire part-time/no benefits. Advancement is limited.
good,"Walmart was my first job out of high school, and I don't think I would ever go back. The pay was okay for a part-timer like myself, but the management was not understanding of the job/life/school balance as described when I was hired in. They went against their word over time, and school was more important."
good,"Uma empresa agradável de trabalhar, porém poderia haver um acompanhamento dos proprietários, porque seria valorizado o trabalho de quem realmente se dedica desempenhar o seu melhor, afins do desenvolvimento da própria. Deixo o meu agradecimento pela oportunidade de ter feito parte do grupo Walmart."
good,"Although very young , Wal-Mart taught me a lot about corporate big box companies."
good,"I had a wonderful time working here, but I also had some times when the management would go out of their way to find an employee making a mistake and scolding them, rather than helping them."
good,Its an Okay job to have. It comes with a lot of benefits if you are looking for that type of job i did learn that working overnight yoy make a lot more than in the day time.
good,"dia tipico: si las personas que estaban a tu cargo no faltaban, se trabjaba en orden pero si el personal no estaba completo no se lograba la productividad."
good,"Many times, management don't like to answer questions and can be rude when talking to others. Coworkers are very helpful and will go beyond the call of duty to make sure things are done."
good,Fun fun work place and experiment i meet a lot of people and made a lot of friends the only thing i would say negative about working there is all the ladies that work there or shop sometimes its hard for eveyone to stay focused
good,"un trabajo agradable con muchas responsabilidades, pero compañeros agradables y caritativos."
good,Always on your feet never enough workers there and you are always late to breaks or meals. managers are always changing and when you call for change you may as well shut your whole line down because it will take a while to get it.
good,el ambiente de trabajo es sobre mucho resperto pero también es divertido
good,It was always busy & there where multiple tasks to be done . We were sometimes short on staff which it made it hard when it was a busy day. There would be a lot of customers that needed help but there would be only two of us which made some customers angry . I managed to multi task . Other than that it was a fun workplace where I could greet & meet new people & make customers happy with good customer service
good,a good world wide company to work employees are able to transfer anywhere in the world if necessary....................................................
good,"Working the 10 PM to 7 AM shift is pretty decent. It's rather face paced and an easy job. Most of the employees are pretty friendly and helpful. It's a good job for people that like working the ""graveyard"" shift."
good,"The best part about this Job includes the flexible hours around school and also the quick promotions. Walmart also offers great benefits, such as paid time off and health care."
good,Needs management improvement. When i was working with the properly trained management everything ran very smooth. Its always nice when they step in to help when someone calls out sick.
good,A typical day at work is filling orders and helping customers and other employees if needed. The only hard part of working here is that there is a lot of favoritism shown with workers that rely on others to do the work for them. There is also a lot of spiteful and vindictive things that happen to employees that have a voice and try to go to management to make their work environment better for themselves and others. Although the job could be very enjoyable as long as you have others on your team that come in to work ready and willing to work and listen to others. There are a lot of awesome people that work here and that make working here very enjoyable and that notice a hard worker when they see one.
good,The store I worked at in my opion was not that bad man mangment at the time I was there was a little over the top but all in all it was an environment you could go and work an leave without worrying about work when your not there
good,"Walmart has bad reputation about how they treat their employees, however it really isn't a bad place to work. They expect you to be a hard worker. They are flexible with your schedule. And have pretty good benefits. I would recommend this place of employment"
good,"This company has been able to take care of my families monetary and life needs for a long time. It may not always have the best work conditions, but it does provide a necessary stability."
good,Working in tire and lube for Wal-Mart was good it could be hard at time manual labor wise but the days went by fast and. The managers and Co-workers were great to work with.
good,The managers are very cool but they don't know anyone names in the place. We can't except any tips from any customers or you will get fired. It was a nice working place.
good,it was a good first job and i enjoyed working there and meeting new people but management could be iffy and some people could not work and still keep their job
good,Walmart has helped me increase my customer service skills.and allowed me to continue my path to work towards my business administration degree so i may attain a career that is both profitable and rewarding.
good,"Working here was a lot of fun, but management rotated quite a bit. One manager would tell you to do something one way, and then another would come along after telling you to do it another way, very confusing and frustrated."
good,"The management was fun, listened, and always helped out when needed. The Coworkers where nice in general. When you see the people of Wal~Mart online, lets just say they do exist!!"
good,"Experience with customer service, Positive energry at the same time. Very fun, meeting new people and making peoples day as i help them find what they were looking for."
good,"Walmart gave me a chance to proceed with a career instead of just another job. I only wish that I could have transferred like I was supposed to. The Walmart in Goodland, KS is one of the best there is"
good,"Used to live working for this company. Started at the bottom and worked to Co Manager in a short time. Definite opportunity for advancement. However, salary means salary here. 70-80 hour weeks were the norm. This will burn you out fast. Upper management will never acknowledge your success or say good job. It is constant negativity."
good,I had the pleasure of working as a cashier and also an electronics employee. I liked helping people to speedy checkouts and with their questions about electronics
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. I was very excited to help with things I knew how to do with different customers. Always a people's person. it was a new challenge everyday to learn new things with different departments.
good,I enjoyed the other people I worked with. When I started management was great but when they did an overhaul on management and almost everybody was replaced moral of the entire store went down. We worked hard with no reward. Nothing was ever good enough.
good,"Work hard and listen to others, whether it is another staff memeber or a customer. Remember, the first step to good work is a great work ethic. Always work with your head up and be aware of your surroundings."
good,"Well before I left they where doing nursing home orders, but somebody didn't see a future in doing that. The Hanover store was not the busy store in the area but learned a lot."
good,Walmart is a good place to work at if you have patience with customers. Alot of the associates are nice and respectful as long as they get the same treatment in return. I would definitely keep this job if I weren't moving to Texas.
good,"A typical day at work included building as many bikes and furniture as possible. On busy days, it also included helping unload the general merchandise delivery truck. "
good,Great place to work if you have flexible hours. Good people and on job training.decent benefits. Lasting friendships. Good management. Good retirement and Stock.
good,worked extensively in the operations area; worked as a scrum master for the walmart transportation management system; implemented operations in multiple areas with onsite offshore model
good,Management wasn't always the best to work with and could use some training on more efficient ways to communicate.  The rest of the staff there is very easy to work with. Great benefits.
good,"Walmart is a very easy going company. The pay is a lot better than most places for people to work at. It is a strict company on being absent or late, but is very easy going in all other aspects."
good,"Walmart is a good employer, their benefits are good for the times. They do work you hard and is no time for hanging around. But they do share store bonuses with their employ. And they do allow growth within the company, but again, you work hard for it."
good,"-Buen ambiente y cultura laboral. "
good,I learned the importance of paying attention and being focused on the task at hand. A normal day at work would be zoning and cleaning up my area and making sure customers found everything ok.
good,"learned a lot while working at walmart pharmacy. I learned how to make a good communication with others, understanding problems and try to solve them."
good,"A typical day working here is over all great. Knowing how to help in a department is always a plus, and other employees are willing to help anyone who is in need."
good,"A typical day is stocking freight on the shelf then zoning, I can't say I've learned much while working there. Management is ok, but they don't seem to know whats going on. Meeting the people you work with and the customers are what make the job enjoyable."
good,Walmart has a great culture and you are surrounded by amazing and talented people who believe in making a difference. the company provides many opportunities to advance skill sets and achieve goals.
good,"Didn't like working with people. Co worker were great to work with, manager was very nice and everything ran smoothly.....i like working my area. Task were easy and obtainable"
good,good company to work for and you and get to meet a lot of different people the benifits are good flexible schedule fellow employees are good people to work with
good,hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and trying to help them even when they get rude and disrespectful. But the most enjoyable part is knowing you did a great job at helping a customer and they are 100% pleased with your service.
good,"I've been with walmart for roughly 6 years. I've worked for 3 different stores, and overall, each experience depends on how management works there. Some are more understanding and supportive than others. Some are more by the book, and zero tolerance. My most enjoyable part of my job is working with my coworkers. I've learned several things from working through this company alone. I get to help customers, and in turn, they help me. I learn new things from them as well. Automotive or fishing knowledge for example."
good,"Hours were not the same every day, which was hard to work around a home life. Extremely tired by the end of the day. Management was all about themselves and were not helpful to the staff. Enjoyed working with my coworkers, they made the days go faster."
good,"Overall staff was nice, but the rules are way too strict, and you can't even control the A/C. Dress code was way too strict, and it's impossible to get full-time hours. Nice for the pay, but not ideal if you need flexibility."
good,"You are always expected to do a lot of work when you are employed with wal-mart, and the compensation is questionable if it is enough for all the effort you put in. However, you have to consider the fact that Wal-mart is a huge company with plenty to do at all times, in order for them to hire enough people to make the job easy for everyone, that would be incredibly expensive for them."
good,"I loved my work at Walmart, and my customers! Working for walmart the management was horrible and they made things so much worse then what they were  and that's the only thing I didn't like about working there because of the management team."
good,On any given day we could be overrun with customers. Cheeks tend to hurt from smiling so much. Once you get to know each other you kind of feel like family.
good,it is a great place to work for if you do not have a family that needs you home so you can see what going on they like to let you go after a few weeks if they feel like that you aren't doing good enough
good,The customer service managers were often standing over my shoulder. I felt like they did not trust me. It seemed like their number one priority was to get MasterCard applications.
good,"I have manger skills that I have been taught by the asstant manager's and all the regular managers I have put those skills to use. I also work a total of 5 departments sporting goods,hardware,garden center,electronics and fabrics."
good,my normal day was at work was to clock in ask a csm what register to get on then I start ringing customers up and take money and handing back the change I also had to keep my area neat and clean. the most enjoyable part was talking with the customers and asking if they found everything they was looking for and answer any questions they had. the hardest part was some of the managers nasty attitude.
good,There was open and diverse atmosphere. Upper management was supportive and helpful. Good job to start and expand your career. I would definitely recommend.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. I liked the interaction with the customers and some of the employees."
good,working at walmart has been a very good experience. it has its bad and good days. What i like about walmart is helping customers feel appreciated it really makes my day to see a happy customer. Some things get very old at work as far as favoritism being shown toward certain people what i cant understand is how some people choose what they will and will not do at a job. If we are all grown and thats your job do it
good,"During the time I worked at the service desk in Walmart,  I also was responsible for keeping my work area clean and neat. I was also checking customers out and each night after my shift, I was expected to help clean the store before leaving n"
good,Very fast paced environment with a lot of room to grow and move around in the company. Also a very fun and beneficial company to work for. Realistic expectations are given
good,"Management is horrible, theft is rampant, the work is monotonous, and the bathrooms are dirty. overall a terrible work experience. so glad to never go back in there."
good,management could be better and raises and benefits needs to improve other than that its good it was great to meet new people everyday while working and to get to know the community
good,"while working at Walmart you had to be very careful about your actions, they are very strict about customer service as well as appearance. they also requested that you not joke in the workplace as someone may be offened"
good,"Walmart has had many challenges to overcome in the last few years and so has had many changes. However, Management is aware and is constantly attempting to orientate their staff to the new challenges and offering solutions"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo , horarios fijos , comida gratis, comedor con espacio de recreacio"
good,"I enjoyed helping others and meeting new people. I was a sales associate but I did several things, we where a team so sometimes you have to help out in a area that's not your expertise."
good,It was fun to work there but it had its issue's. I was tricked into quitting because I was sick and it would be quite now or be fired for leaving early due to illness.
good,"I entitled this job very much. It's straight forward the staff is very good at what they do and they are very helpful. This is a very easy job a very laid back work place environment ,"
good,I loved that I could work fast in scanning people's items and that I could do well at that. I don't like that walmart fired me 2 weeks before I had my baby because of having to miss days for pregnancy related issues. I had a doctor that wouldn't sign intermittent fmla papers because she felt they were for people whom had problems in there pregnancy. Walmart does not accept doc notes and so I got fired for attendance. When I applied for unemployment walmart tried fighting it. A judge ultimately decided in my favor because walmart didn't have the proper paperwork to prove there firing me.
good,"I liked working there. The work atmosphere was good, and the bosses were understanding. If you had a work problem, they were there. Also, other employees would help. They had a training program that was a mix of computer and floor."
good,"Communication could be better but overall a great place to work. Nice people, very productive, understanding with certain situations, just needs to work on their communication."
good,"I worked there to help put myself through community college, specifically in the clothing department."
good,Walmart is a good place to work. Especially when your in high school or college or just sitting around your house and just chilling and just looking for a chilled job to work and not get bashed in the head all the time but sometimes you can have a lot of work depending on what position you got hired for.
good,The employees really looked out for one another. we all tried to make sure everyone completed their tasks and was done on time. Long hours for minimal pay but my fellow co-workers made work fun.
good,Es una empresa muy responsable donde comenzar a trabajar con mínimos requisitos y aprendí mucho
good,"I moved here from Kansas and trying to find my way, I'm a very loyal person and always on time for a job etc, I enjoy any job I'm working at and don't"
good,The job is as good as the people you train. If you invest your time and knowledge into a better company then that is what you will get out of it. The hardest part of the job was the hours a salaried manager has to work because of the staffing.
good,walmart is good employment for many of various ages... there seems to be much management destruction at most stores...but once this issue has been taken care of of it a great place to work...
good,"Unload and stack cargo in proper location to be stocked using pallets.  Store items in an orderly and accessible manner by departments.  Receive and count stock items and record data electronically.  Examine and inspect stock items for wear or defects, reporting any damage items to supervisors"
good,"cash handling"
good,I didn't mind what I was doing because I got to meet a lot of different people and get to know them and be social with not only the employees but also the customers. The hardest part of the job was meeting the expectations of the supervisors but also following the instructions of the different managers that we have at one time. The only enjoyable thing about this job was seeing the customers happy.
good,A typical day at work was very busy if there was a delivery to work on. Routines in place ensured that we met maximum productivity and followed all guidelines in the food service industry. I enjoyed working with my team and there was a sense of family in the workplace. I visit often to see them again and I am welcomed warmly!
good,Good place to move up if u work hard. With new ways to earn more money after working for 6 months and plenty of departments  to fit your job preference.
good,The job was easy and consistent.The hours was not what I had needed at that time.But I worked there as long as I could under the conditions of my sick wife/
good,"Wal-Mart is a reasonable company to work for.  They never gave me much grief.  I actually enjoyed my time there.  I was glad to not be there forever, but it had it's charms."
good,"Management is touch and go, but you had work everyday scheduled. Came in and had work, and if it was a full day then you would get your hour lunch and a 15 minute break, it was nice."
good,"Really good team work, all the staff worked together to help everyone get their jobs done. I wish we had more hours and a longer work time with the company"
good,summer days were easy but winter is tuff because they won't get someone in to de-ice the parking lot making it very hard to push carts without falling
good,"enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart was put in growing areas of responsibility at the beginning of my working career. "
good,Climat de travail agréable.  Cependant ne convient pas pour un étudiant à temps complet aux études universitaires.
good,Walmart in generally a good place to work and earn a decent wage.  Benefits are typical and comparable to other like kind stores.  Opportunities for advancement are good.
good,"It's typical retail work. Walmart does pay a lot better than most retail places, and they do offer quite a bit in healthcare and discounts. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers wanting something for nothing. It happens everywhere, though."
good,"It was a good work force because you constantly stock non stop. There aren't many people to work with, but the  staff were always friendly. I learned more about customer service and stocking the right way organizing materials into categories. The management was excellent. The hardest part of the job were the employees because they were arrogant. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to keep busy and knowing I made people's days by keeping them happy."
good,"Since I have been working for walmart  you can advance through the company if you choose too. "
good,"Cashier, Friendly Customer Service, Cash and Credit Transaction, Counting Money, Help customers in need of Services. I enjoy working with the staff. Management was cool."
good,"its a retail/warehouse job. and it can pay the bills if you budget your money well. a basic day has you unloading the truck or going out to zone, then working freight in a chosen department, at 8:30 you pull freight out to the floor for overnights."
good,"There was a lot of aspects to this job. You definitely have to be quick on your feet. Not a ton of structure though. The raises were pretty meek, and not very significant."
good,"Oportunidades, qualificação, horário,alimentação ,transporte"
good,"Meeting are held to inform associates of news as well as to assign departments to be worked. Associates are assigned a set of task and a work partner, if needed, to stock merchandise as well as organize all aisle in the department within the estimated time given. Every associate is given two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch break for the nine hour work period each day."
good,"The job itself is pretty laid back, but my co workers had very negative attitudes. They were lazy, rude, and very self centered individuals. The management was no different either. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone with a short temper or a sensitive personality."
good,"Walmart as a company has been very beneficial in my life. It has allowed me to grow as a person as well as in my career. I have committed to Walmart since graduating high school and have grown into a position I didn't believe possible. The company as a whole is one that I would recommend to anyone to work because of the culture, benefits and opportunities. Store specific situationsituation have at time not been ideal because of management style, execution and inconsistencies which make it difficult sometimes to want to continue to develop and grow or to actually be able to develop and grow."
good,a great place to work if you love interacting with people. This was thevpartvofvthe job I loved the most....every now & then you have to deal with unpleasant customers
good,"My typical day at work included:"
good,Working at Walmart taught me a lot about how to work with others and how to deal with customers that are upset. Walmart are very reasonable on there prices which helps the customer save more.
good,It was challenging and exciting. I absolutely loved it it's very rewarding can be fast paced and not very difficult I found it very satisfying. Working with the public and trying to resolve customer issues is the priority responsibility and I enjoyed it.
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart.  It was my first experience in a pharmacy.  I learned a lot and enjoyed my customers.  My co workers were very helpful in my training.
good,it varies because there are so many different jobs. My experience was good but you were almost always short staffed so you end up doing the work of 2 or even like me 3 .
good,When I first started working at Wal-mart I really enjoyed my job and always told my peers to apply. Once we got the new manager things changed drastically. I ended up really not wanting to come into work. The atmosphere changed. Management was not right.
good,Walmart is a nice place to work even though at times it can be a bit over whelming at late night hours when it's only one or two cashier's pulling the whole work load
good,Walmart was an interesting place to work it was a easy place to learn different areas and to learn additional skills it to me just didn't seem like the place for me after two years. i enjoyed meeting all the different people and all the different people i worked with it just wasn't for me.
good,"Dias produtivos"
good,It was a fun place to work. Everyday was something new and exciting. Work could be hard or easy. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday. Hardest part was dealing with difficult customers and not being able to help sometimes.
good,Go into work and get of the register you sometimes get nice people and sometimes you don't so there for you have good days and bad days. But overall i do love my job and just looking for something different.
good,it was very hard at times especially when they have you to work a night shift and expect you to come back very early and not all of the csm's weren't always helpful to us cashiers.   I actually applied for sales floor and stocking.  they just ended up placing me in as a cashier because of my politeness and friendliness.   The hardest part of my job was when i had a unhappy customer and my supervisor or csm would walk away and tell me good luck!   I had even asked for a transfer and requested it in a timely and nice manner and they refused me and let another associate that had requested the same thing two weeks later after i did.  The only thing i really enjoyed was meeting new people and seeing returning faces.
good,This is a good place to start out and get some work experience.  Alot of pressure was put on the unloaders at my store.  Overall i liked the actual job.
good,"I like that they challenged me and I advanced because I met every challenge.  They are quick to judge people and dispose of them.  I liked most of the people that worked for me so it made for a nice workplace.  Long hours 70 a week, so no home life."
good,Very good with working with hours around school schedules and doctors appointments.  nice people to work with and for.  Very good with handling unfortunate circumstances that arise.
good,I loved working at Walmart but there were some managers that weren't fair. They played a lot of favorites and some of us didn't get our break on time because of that. The CSMS were never on the same page so we were told to do different things constantly.
good,"Fast paced, good work environment, knowledgeable staff. Overall good place to be employed. Treated employees well and catered to their needs. Very friendly and dependable."
good,"Walmart does offer a decent benefit package. It is hard work, but there are fun times as well. Some of my best memories involve my team at Walmart. It's like a giant family."
good,I love working here but i feel that its time to move on. It's a fun place to work they dont mirco manage. The director is awesome. I just question most of the ghetto people that they hire.
good,The management is nice and they make sure that both them and the staff get their jobs done. The hardest part of the job was the hours and the not so flexible schedule. My coworkers were my favorite part of the job.
good,"I worked in the pharmacy at a Walmart.  That was a terrific job. I enjoyed my work environment, it was clean, orderly, and climate-controlled. Even the back storage rooms were well kept. My pay was always on time and I was given breaks when required or needed."
good,Working at Walmart was a great experience the people I worked with was very nice and they were also very helpful when I started I had a very hard time figuring things out and they helped me and I made some real good friends there.
good,"muy demandante el trabajo,buena remuneracion.crecimiento en distintos sectores."
good,Management at Walmart is very helpful. Tasks are very easy to handle. Hours of work and salary are manageable.Learning about new merchandise or products is fun.
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work if you make it. Your gonna have the rudest customers of all but just smile and go on. As far as the workers, there are Alot of different point of views and it's all open ears."
good,Aprendí el funcionamiento de lo que es trabajar bajo presion
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart for the most part. It helps if you have managers that know what's going on and their is no favoritism. Unfortunately there was favoritism going on. The people you work with help make the job more enjoyable. Overall, its not the worst place to work."
good,One of the best places i have work. friendly coworkers and upper management are very helpful. would work here again if they gave more hours to their employees.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work especially as a first job. Depending on the location, you could be working with either really good people or really bad people with some in between. My personal experience was not too bad. My main issue generally revolved around upper management. I was overlooked multiple times for a higher position and even told to do stuff that not only went against Walmart's standard operating procedures but also would affect the store itself in a negative way. My co-workers were always the best though. They are what helped me get through the day."
good,"normal as any job great employees but superviser would not do her job. In my opinion a leader needs to be a leader and an example, when she was needed she never responded or came. a moth later I got a job offer somewhere else."
good,"This is a good place to work, if you want to grow and learn there are endless opportunities to do so with this company. If you're willing to work, you'll go far, and you'll get there quickly."
good,"As a photo lab associate you have to be able to multi task, use people skills and have a good eye for quality pictures. It can be very slow paced at times but it can pick up very quick and you'll need to be prepared for when it does. It's a cool job to help people capture and keep memories."
good,"As I only worked weekend it was always busy."
good,"Leadership responsibility and accountability for over 250 Associates, and Customer traffic flow.  Facility Management of over 205,000 SF of retail space and complete Inventory control.  Full ownership of Sales, Profit & Loss, and Expense Control.  Servant Leadership is the key to daily success and routines.  Respectfulness to direct reports gains trust and maximum productivity.  Fast paced, and work is done with a sense of urgency.  Work life balance is the challenge for sustainability.  Helping Customers, and Associates is the greatest daily satisfaction."
good,"A typical day at Walmart was never to overwhelming."
good,"Dealing with cash, and providing cash audits to the cash office. "
good,This job requires lots of hard work. Duties have changed over the years and they are called CAP associates I believe. The work is alright.
good,"customers, the pay is far every week no tips.very nice place to work at people are friendly. the co workers are nice peopel and great to work with"
good,"Walmart has great benefits/ health insurance. Provided great customer service and interacted with customers/hospitality,"
good,"Was good job, liked the people but wanted to work as a contractor and found job at Clear Reflections so moved on to other job."
good,Was a very friendly and pretty relaxed place to work. Spent most of time stocking freezer/ cooler area but was aloud coat even if it was out of dress code.
good,"at this job i learned alot about a cash register but most of it i had to teach myself . management is very over forceful . a tipical day is coming in working the cashregister for more then 2hrs, stocking and working self check."
good,walmart has been a good place to work for.  the atmosphere is great. the people surrounding you are kind and helpful. it is a very fast pace company.  you learn new things everyday. the most enjoyable part of the job was being abl to go to who ever to help you.
good,"I really like the work I do but the managers are very self-serving and have favorites which causes problems. It also becomes a ""every man for himself"" environment so you are on your own (depending on the store)."
good,"Fast paced and always growing! They say the one thing you can count on is there will always be change at Walmart. This allows associates to constantly evolve in chair, and makes for an engaging and dynamic work place."
good,"Typical day at work, is pushing till you get to where you need to be. "
good,i was a customer service and cashier representative and i enjoyed working at walmart. it was my first job and my co workers made the job fun. i obtained a lot of experience with customers
good,I deeply enjoyed working for the company. I liked working my own area when trying to make friends other people there would make difficult. There was alot of he said she said drama
good,I really enjoyed working for this company as a cashier. After about a year they put me in the cash office to work. I would of still been at walmart if it was not for the schooling.
good,At walmart the job was to come in and receieved shipment from truck some days and on other days restock isles in the store. First stock job and you learn something new daily
good,"Everyone shops at Walmart. This is a company that will not be going anywhere. Decent job, it's a paying job, awesome people to work with. Working Holidays has to be the worst complaint, nobody wants to work Holidays, but you do get extra for working those days."
good,the hours where not very good. customers were great to be around. Walmart cares a lot for family. I couldn't work the late hours due to having kids at home.
good,"Non  discriminate against organizations "
good,Nothing to really complain about with the store I worked at.  Treated fairly and had no problems.  Shifts were not bad but needed more stable schedule.
good,"I loved working at Walmart. I think it was my favorite job, period. I was a cashier, and the hardest part of my day was saying goodbye when I went home. I enjoyed the people that I worked with, and I enjoyed serving the community. I liked being able to work with the public, and I even had a few people who were my regular customers."
good,The normal day consist of managing time soon as you  walk in the doors of the store. Being able to endure the work hours while being productive and greeting the customers and employees with a smile and great attitude.
good,"probably filling 400-500 scripts per day, phones nonstop, typical retail pharmacy. best otc manager in the business. some good techs with lots of experience."
good,"crazy busy pharmacy filling about 600-700 scripts per day on average.  phones are nonstop, but time goes by pretty quickly"
good,The job was very smooth and fairly easy. The management was poor and the east Albany location. For the most part it was a great experience. would not recommend as a career if your not in a management position.
good,"It was enjoyable for me to be alone on my aisle stocking and occasionally having a customer to help. Before we got started stocking, we would all have to sort the product on the pallet, and everyone was helpful, did his/her part. Some employees were even funny."
good,"Walmart offers long hours when not cutting hours, which they do too often, Stocking shelves can be tiring and yet fun at the same time. Employees tend to get become family."
good,Work schedule is ridiculous. They are not understanding of family issues. While at work it is ok. Always get breaks and lunch. Plenty of second chances.
good,"show up to work, great benefits, don't work well with schedule conflicts, decent starting pay, hands on training, great people"
good,Good benefits and regular work schedule. There is also opportunities to move up if desired. I enjoyed the consistency and knowing what to expect everyday.
good,Constructive and pleaseant workplace with exceptional staff who oversee all job requirements. Friendly customers capable of warming up the work environment with happiness fun and satisfaction every time one makes a purchase. It will continue to excel until decades from now its will have capitalized on more locations and benefits for the families in the community throughout the entire world.
good,This job was a temp job. I helped remodel the store. I like who I worked with and I liked the pay. I didn't like that it was temporarily. Would've liked a long term job with them.
good,I absolutely love the job it kept me busy.  Also working at Walmart gave me the chance to work with all type of people with different ethnic backgrounds.
good,"I was a cart associate during my senior year of high school, when my parent's home was struck by Hurricane Ike, they were great people to work with allowing me time to be at home to assist my mother with repairs.  The hours were good for a student and the job was demanding, especially in the Texas heat in summer."
good,"I worked at Walmart full-time (Less than a year)"
good,Lo que más me gustó que empecé desde empleada de mostrador después subjefa después jefa de departamento eso para mi fue un reto muy grande
good,A typical day ia getting a trailer unloaded the best you can and as accurate aa you can.managment helps through out the day. Hardest part is the cases not being properly stacked.
good,"This is place where yo just come and do your job repetitively. It would be a good first job with no experience but it is overall okay and if you looking to get in a professional position, you could look for programs to become an pharmacist technician or management. Its always room to grow."
good,i enjoyed working at walmart and enjoyed working with the people i worked with and the hours were alright but they like to cut hours and sending people home early
good,"I worked the night shift stocking shelves and loved it. I was largely left on my own to complete a task and I always enjoyed being solely responsible for getting my work done."
good,Working for Walmart these last eight years has showed me the advancements you can make in retail if you apply yourself.  Sometimes the hardest part of the job was disgruntled customers and at the same time the best part of the job was the regular customers you saw on your everyday. The faces are ever changing but the friendly environment was always the same.
good,I liked the job. I just didn't like the fact they were trying to schedule me for only 2 days in a pay period. That is ridcolus cuase  I couldn't do that.
good,a great building block and stepping stone. you can learn and better your people skills and learn how to react to various workplace situations. management and hr were great s well.
good,Loved working here its overnight so it can get tiring but overall this is a real smooth job I had to strip and wax floors and take out the trash threw the whole store
good,"Overall, Wal-Mart is a nice place to work. The people who work there (both associates and management) are pretty friendly, although you don't want to get on their bad side. Schedule wise, they try to listen to what you ask. They are not lenient on call-ins or any issues/emergencies that may arise (though many large companies are that way). If attendance and work ethic are both good, a nice place to work."
good,"Working in the front end helping customers, ringing up customers with their items. helping out in returns. placing things where they needed to be helping others"
good,"In my experience with this company, the management team didn't care about the employees, over worked and under paid. Short staffed all the time. Not a very good place."
good,"I was an assistant Manager at Walmart in the Jewelry Department.  You have to have good communication skills, and be people friendly when working in retail.  I enjoyed making someone happy by assisting them in finding the right ring for engagement, class rings for memories, birthstones, fixing watches, etc...  The look on the customers face when they are 100% satisfied is priceless.  It gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about retail.  I also became an overnight stocker.  I do well working alone, because I am self sufficient."
good,"There was really only one complaint I have. The hours were never set and I never had time to spend with my kids. Other than that I did not have a problem working there. The pay was good, most of the managers were great."
good,"Walmart does try to care about the people it employs. It all depends on how good your boss is. If you have a good one, they will be flexible and be willing to work with you and allow you to be late or miss work within reason. The ones that truly give Walmart a negative rap is the regional managers that come  up with new rules or policies without giving enough thought to how it would affect workers in the area they work and with the processed they have built up with their managers and fellow co-workers."
good,"I like working with the patients."
good,Fast Pace work place. They help you try and expand your abilities if your looking to move up the ladder there. Great place with team atmosphere and very high in safety.
good,"walmart is a big company with many employees so i know for management it would be hard to keep everyone happy. i for the most part enjoyed my job at walmart, most everyone is nice to each other, except a few which i bound to happen"
good,"The job wasn't something hard, it was just really long shifts and when you arent used to being on your feet that much. But my boss was really helpful."
good,Walmart is a good company to work at. An individual can move up in the company to becoming a manager or supervisor. I get alone with the people there.
good,"Working for Walmart was largely a positive experience for me. I started as a CSM and asked to step down about three months before I left their employment."
good,this place used have good management but now it could use a boot in this area. over all it ok to work for but be careful how they treat you.
good,"When it is time to shift product, change a display, restock for a surge in customers, team efforts really shine. There is no job to big or to small for the co managers. I have learned no matter what get product out for customers, keep behind the scenes where they belong. "
good,"Shelving product or unloading truck "
good,"The store would get so busy we did not have enough staff to help all the customers. Some departments had no floor managers, stretching my job capacity out and losing focus on the front end to cover these departments when needed."
good,it was an ok job not much pay not much room for adavancment i guess thats why i left to get my cdl and better myself but other then that liked my co workers
good,"This job has everything to do with patience. If one thing I learned was patience, the diversity in the people is a add on. I learned as well to count money in an orderly fashion."
good,"Most days were very busy ,fun and productive "
good,"I work with great people who work very hard to make the customers happy."
good,I loved the people I worked with. Loved some of the managers too and some was a lot to handle and I would go back to work there.
good,"Help with customer service, Delivers and picking parts, checking inventory and receiving, Shipping parts UPS to customers and overseeing 13 employees."
good,I had a very easy time learning and getting used to being a cashier at Walmart. I gained most of my customer service experience here. My only problem with my employment was that they could not accommodate my school schedule.
good,It is hard to get transfered around in the stores. And also policies change very often so you have to make sure you know the policies.
good,Was good clean place to work. Had many employees who took job seriously. We were know as a model of hard working employees who made the store Number 1.
good,Fast pace good benefits .I enjoyed the people I worked with. Good pay. I stocked shelves. Get your job done and no worries.
good,"they really make sure that you feel comfortable in the work place, they work with you not against you. you also learn alot about the company and how they provide for customers"
good,Great service and team members loved the people I worked with great team skills could be better with proper training from management but they do on job training where you learn as u go
good,"O trabalho era sem pressão e descontraído no dia-a-dia, aprendi a me relacionar melhor com as pessoas, tive mais noções de informática, ótimo relacionamento com os colegas, difícil era apenas o trabalho em equipe, pois se um não ajudasse, prejudicaria os demais, pois dependíamos uns dos outros para determinadas atividades, tirando esta pequena parte, era tudo bem agradável no geral."
good,"I would get to work and I loved my coworkers, we would always enjoy each others company. We would all unload the daily GM truck together at a fast pace then take what we unloaded out onto the sales floor and stock the shelves successfully."
good,Liked nightshift when the store was closed. Could get jobs we needed to do done and then make sure store was ready for the public the next morning. Nightshift was more organized than dayshift. On days we would start in our own departments then get called somewhere else once management would come in.
good,Not the best job but an easy job. A lot of people to talk to. Slow and fast paced depending on your job. Management isn't very friendly.
good,Very goal oriented company. Strong foundation in which you can actually progress through the corporate ladder you're not stuck in one position there is always room to progress in your career choice.
good,"- Deal with lots of interesting people"
good,Walmart treated me like it was the place to work at and it felt like home. the hardest part of the jobs is when we had to remove all the items off shelves.
good,"The types of responsibilities I had was orderfilling, stand up lift driver, and loading. I processed shipments and made sure that the correct labels was on the pallets. I loaded the shipments on trucks and made sure they were properly stacked and secured. I really enjoyed working in a logistical environment."
good,Communicating with the public can be challenging but you learn to make someone's day a good one despite their attitude towards you.
good,Employees were treated poorly and brakes were never on time. Hours were cut and they never had enough people scheduled to work. Management would never get back to anyone with a question or concern.
good,Management helps you with multiple tasks that were assigned to you. Need to have good customer service skills. Good about working with your personal/work schedule.
good,It was an ok place to work. There was never any time to take a lunch. some co-workers didn't get along with each other. Management was hardly ever there to assist with issues.
good,It was an overall good experience but not the best that I have has in compared to other jobs. The pay is ok but it is not career worthy unless you want to go the management route. They really skimp on the hours except when it comes to holidays. I loved gaining new skills but other than knowing how to sell licenses it was the same as any other job.
good,"The pace is fast during the first part of the day when unloading trucks, but once that is done, it is more relaxed, even if the pace doesn't slow while stocking product throughout the store."
good,"Customers can be irritating, but the job itself is not bad at all. The pay is good for an easy job. The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on your face when customers feel like they know more about company policy than you."
good,"learned inventory control,ordering and receiving, managed variety of departments, made a lot of friends, management training program"
good,"Reclutamiento y Seleccion de personal"
good,"I loved working at walmart but don't get me wrong.. the management was terrible. I don't know how it is now but when I was there it wasn't very good.. although the people were amazing, and I loved working with them so it made the year I worked there fun."
good,I enjoyed working with people.  Sometimes much was expected of you and it seemed you couldn't get enough done in one day.  Customers always come first.  I always felt like we were understaffed.
good,For some reason management at this store feels as though they are better then everyone else who works there. They constantly work associates for unrealistic hours. Their time management is all over the place. They lack common respect one person shares with a co-workers. But non-management associates are the best co-workers you could ask for.
good,These company help me grow as a young men i was young when i started these jobs they help pave a way to gain more other jobs and other people things i didn't do before.
good,A typical day was never the same. Your position sometimes got changed a couple times in a day. It gave you opportunities to have change throughout the day so you don't become frustrated by being in a repetitive positions.
good,They let me go. i had too many points. An hour lunch break. Met nice people. Handled different types of food. Learned helpful things.
good,"My duties required me to handle customer service "
good,"Most days it was busy, management was always on top of everything the Associate I work with were friendly and very helpful. But it was days where some Associate and management was very moody, just had an attitude for no apparent reason. Overall it was fast pace and very challenging hard working days."
good,Work was simple and routine. Although very unorganized as far as employees went. Managers weren't as helpful as they could have been and minimal training was given to employees. High expectations for employees who weren't properly introduced to the job.
good,Managers at Walmart are helpful and its great company for work especially for students. It offers a flexible schedule. Off the job and on the job training both are given before you actually work on the floor.
good,"This job was really fun, got to be myself at the workplace and it has great room for growth. I was promoted to a supervisor 5 months into the job."
good,The only bad thing about this job was probably the managers just dealing with them would make anyone uncomfortable but other than that it is a really good job like working with customers and helping them out
good,"I met a lot of people at this job, both friends and customers alike. I enjoyed working here and am glad to have gained experience that I can carry from one workplace to the next."
good,You work under production so you constantly need to be on it. Its not hard if you maintain your flow and just do what needs to be done.
good,It was a good job. I enjoyed helping customers with their purchases. Worked both inside as door greeter and outside bringing shopping carts back into the store.
good,"I worked overnight in the freezer section of Walmart. We would unload multiple skids off of trucks, and stock the items for the next day. It was hard work, but with team work the tasks was lightened. Overall my experience at Walmart tought me good team working skills and reliability."
good,"Workload varies wildly. Environment, depending on the pharmacist, varies wildly, customers vary to certain extent. There are good days with charming customers and laid back pharmacists and there are bad days with high stress situations."
good,"Working at wal-mart was overall good, I unfortunately didn't care for some of the managers as they were very rude and acted like they didn't care about anything. It was overall a good experience though."
good,"I loved working for this company. It has its ups and downs, but if you find the right place to work in the store that work for you it can be very great. Had amazing coworkers and boss. Wished I still work there. Can't wait tell I go back"
good,long work hours but there's a lot of opportunities to improve career-wise. The hardest part of the job was to bag and scan items simultaneously.
good,"I have learned to work hard, keep my comments to my self, and dont worry about what the other employees around me are doing because the employees come and go very quickly"
good,The work culture is exciting and fast paced.  Management is decent.  Salary was competitive for other like establishments.  Company policies are rather extreme.
good,Great learning experience. Would have continued to work for walmart. I loved a few people. The ones that made me feel welcome.
good,unloading truck in a safely  matter. stock the selfs after truck is done. i learned to work as hard as i can and as fast safely. learned to work though issues and work in  a group.  management  pushes us to your breaking point but in a good way that makes you a harder worker. Walmart is a friendly and safe work place.
good,Wal-mart has flexible work schedule. I learned a lot about pharmacy system and computer system at this company. Nice company and good employees to work with.
good,overall working with different types of people was amazing. being able to interact with my customers was something that i really enjoyed. This is something that i definitely would look forward to doing again
good,"I started as a stocker and did well. Promoted to Stationary Department Manager soon after, but lack of necessary equipment required to complete the work led to less than ideal results. So I stepped down, back to being a stocker in frozen food. Then I had the house fire and inured my hand. Due to that I switched over to Asset Protection until relocating to Washington. Due to my situation having a time limit, as I was homeless, I had to move before I could transfer to a store in Washington."
good,I was able to move up quickly in this job. They appreciate it if you can overcome the stressful pace of working there and if you can handle the responsibility they will give you a shot at it.
good,"Great opportunity to learn different skills, they have flexible hours and great benefits. But need to promote better management, people who actually know how to manage."
good,i loved what i did and some of the jobs i work i would go back but not at this time do i miss them yes i do because i learned from them and it was also fun.
good,Employees are overall complacent with the day after day of same job duties.  Management is ensuring their advancement at the expense of the employees.
good,I have worked with this company since 2008 but more and more it get annoying we don't get holiday pay no more nut you have to work the holiday if it falls on your day to work
good,Continually expecting more with less resources. A lot of room to move up and expand your career. Zero work life balance. Expected to always put the company first.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, I just have a passion to work somewhere I can make a difference in someone's life.The company is a great company to work for. They usually work with you if you are in school. I am just ready to be off of a hotline."
good,Management was understanding and helpful. Compensation and benefits were adequate for the workload. The advancement process was a little unclear.
good,"É uma empresa agradável de se trabalhar, mas pouco reconhecimento ao associado"
good,I did a job here. Employees show up and do the assignments given to them so they get paid. Wal-mart was a pretty good place to do such things i guess.
good,"very well organize and manage, I like it there I am really impress by the starting salary as well. overall great experience"
good,interacting with other employees fun workplace felt like one big family the hardest part was really nothing everything was self paced and always able to get your work done
good,"Coming into work with a smile."
good,"As a sales associate in the fabric/ arts and crafts it was interesting, because I was not good with measurements, but now I respect them."
good,Prestaciones  superiores a la ley  crecimiento laboral  buen ambiente laboral
good,"It is a great place to work, with good benefits and awesome people for the most part. Their attendance policy is pretty strict, but I'm emergencies they try to work with people."
good,"I worked as a sales associate helping customers with tvs and other electronic."
good,"I would always get there early. My favorite place to work was smoke shop and self check out. The people I worked with were pretty awesome. To me it felt like there  was some favoritism there,because there was a time I wanted to learn customer service and I got passed over by someone else that they liked better. I don't know if there was really a hard part of my job. The management was pretty cool except wen favoritism came into play."
good,"Ambiente cómodo, buenas compañeras la cual nos tratamos como familia y nos tenemos confianza. Algunos gerenciales te toman en consideración para poder demostrar tus habilidades, destrezas y conocimientos. La parte difícil en el área de trabajo son los clientes que no entienden el concepto del servicio. También he aprendido a detectar con facilidad los fraudes y los movimientos que se hace con el dinero. Lo más que me gusta es el horario que está establecido en mi área de trabajo es cómodo y te facilita para poder hacer otros tipos de tareas en tu vida personal. También la mayor tarea que se realiza, siempre uno está trabajando."
good,"Long days, with great pay, good environment and motivational coworkers and supervisors. Great powered equipment training, moving up is easy as long as your working hard and present for every work day"
good,Managed the meat department. Very fast pace and on your toes. Ckecking meat products and dates. Very cold enviroment. Customer service in a key role. Not very friendly atmosphere.
good,A workday included stocking shelves and providing friendly costumer services. The management was helpful in training and in working with you to balance out personal schedules. Work culture was nice and everyone helped each other out.
good,"I became fast friends with my coworkers but the management seemed to be a little too strict. We got two 15 minute breaks and an hour for lunch, so that was good."
good,Handling cash at the register. Greeting customers in a friendly demeanor and maintain our work area neat and organized. Assist customers in finding product and maintain the sales floor clean. Tidy up the clothing making sure it looks clean and in place.
good,I work 3rd shift so I arrive late and left early....I learn how to work even better with others since most nights you engaged in helping out different departments with stocking freight...the most difficult part of this job is the heavy lifting on some of the merchandise...it relax for the most part and fun at times...management was understanding and would even work right by your side if needed to or sometimes just passing through....
good,"Work in the area of children's photography and develop my potential as a photographer of children as well as create a new catalog of images to train future photographers, assume risks in the service area and create methods for rapid training of new staff and thus increase and empower Who requires knowledge in an easy and friendly way"
good,Cool environment. Nice associates. Management Plays Dirty. I've work here going on 2 years. At first I was making decent hours. Then better hours as I changed positions. Then now I'm lucky if I'm getting 24 hours.  But other than that it's been great!!
good,"a day at work was very fast paced and constant lifting, working with others and making the best out of work to bypass the night, the associates was the best part of the job"
good,"didn't learn much working here because I was so young, only job for 16 yr olds were pushing carts, but great company and plenty of room to move up in corporate world."
good,It was a nice experience. I met a lot of nice people and had an opportunity to learn a great deal and customer service positions.
good,"Good work environment near Home Office, neighborhood market smaller than Super Store. Received raises before Walmart's across the board."
good,Walmart offers good benefits and competitive pay. Coworkers are friendly and supportive. They offer flexible schedules. I would recommend this company to anyone who is a people person.
good,I personally loved talking with people!  Most of the people were very nice.  I would be there to help people if they were looking for something.
good,"Awesome place to work. Very engaged and fun! It is a fast paced environment with advancement opportunity. The coworkers and customers make this a great place to work, think of it as an extended family."
good,4 days on 3 off is nice but the hours are hit or miss right now which is no good. Vacation time is earn as you go which isn't very useful if you're just starting out. Making $20+ after 2.5 years is nice too. Overall not a bad place to work just not for me.
good,falta calidad de vida con respecto al horario e incrementar salario
good,This company was a food one to work for. Management was always there for their employees. They jumped on the registers when we need help and even helped out outside to get carts to. It was also a fun place to at.
good,"You work between 4am and 1pm and basically inventory all products in the back room and the decice you use tells you if you need to stock the shelves with said products scanned. Then you put said products on a cart, fill it, then take it on the floor and stock the shelves."
good,"well run company with great teams of employees. fully enjoyed working there. it takes a bit to know where everything is, but once you get the layout, your fine. all in all, a well oiled machine."
good,"Entry level position, great people but not very much room for advancement without 24 hour availability. Very flexible for my school schedule, and days I needed off."
good,"I work from start to finish with a 110% mentality. My direct supervisors acknowledge my hard work and treat me with respect. They try to help me to the best of their power, if they have a say so it usually gets done. If it gets sent further up in management it usually will get lost in translation or even just lost. Overall it's a great company to work for and the pay is great."
good,Requires extreme dedication to this job because it does not pay; it is ran by volunteers. School and parents are very supportive and will help as much as possible
good,Wish there were more hours available.  Other than that it is a fun environment.  No issues with co workers etc.  Part time during school so that was perfect.
good,"typical work day was always hectic but fun."
good,I love this company very friendly staff and great management team pay was great and I love the customers I enjoyed everyday I worked there
good,Walmart is a great company to work for but I don't have any more room for advancing my career. I love working with my customers on a daily basis as well as my coworkers
good,Great job but the hours just aren't there. Some work is hard but other times is easy as pie. Enjoy the group of people I work with. No one is in a bad mood
good,"A typical day at work at the walmart warehouse for me was performing forklift operator duties, such as but not limited to Package handling. Safely and accurately calculate, build and assemble customer orders to prepare them for delivery,Carefully load materials for delivery onto trucks in cooperation with the the truck drivers, Unload and stock incoming material from vendors. Other responsibilities include: Handling and organizing all materials to minimize damage, operating forklift equipment and performing routine maintenance during down time, safely and neatly maintaining storage areas, entry and exit points, and all high traffic avenues of the facilities to allow for unobstructed safe passage. The most enjoyable part of my day was the fact that we were always busy and while working hard my managers and co workers were also very fun."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart what ever you had planned to for that day will always change. I earned how to drive a business what make it work. At Wal-Mart your Dept is your store, a store with in a store."
good,"Es una empresa que te da crecimiento , te brinda las herramientas que se necesitan ,maneja procesos lineales ,busca retraolimentar a la gente ,"
good,"Management is friendly , Typical day at work is clocking in and going straight to work to handle customers.  I learned customer service on site"
good,Pay rates weren't too bad but sometimes expected too much from employees during their shifts. Most times was short staffed.
good,A typical day of work involved me stocking shelves and helping customers find their desired products. I learned plenty on job including how to use the devices and find what i needed to for the job. It has made me more motivated and gave me valuable experience need for life.
good,Working at Wal-mart was very productive in my opinion and I enjoyed it very much. I was a cashier there. The hardest part of working there at first was having to stand for long hours. Eventually I got used to that. I quite enjoyed the nice staff.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for. For me I simply just came to work did my job and went home basically. on some occasions Myself and other coworkers from different departments had to help in areas of the store that were not within our job description because they were understaffed for whatever reason. But overall, its a good job with a decent pay grade."
good,I worked at Walmart for many years. Working in retail is never cake walk but I met some wonderful people and developed and amazing work ethic and a love for customer service.
good,good place to work good people if you have adequte communication skills it is a great place to work at. also has multiple schedules to fit anyone.
good,"Walmart is a very interesting place to work. Working at a register, I was able to meet and talk with many people whom had different back grounds and opinions. Working in this environment I was able to get to know many different people and be exposed to many different opinions. This gave me a relative idea about how to interact with people on a professional and personal scale."
good,"Walmarte é uma das maiores empresa na rede de mercados,pelo mundo a fora. Proficionais capacitados e muito bem treinados para exercerem suas funções a quais foram destinados.Onde encontramos muitas vezes,o serviço coletivo/trabalho em grupo,sendo feito. É como diz no grito de guerra deles,logo pela manha. (O nosso foco é o cliente,a diferença é a nossa gente). Uma boa empresa."
good,"Great place to work great employees. "
good,The management needs some work. They only care about themselves. I feel as though they let the company suffer with only looking at the money side of things and not their staff.
good,"ambiente de trabajo bueno ,horarios flexibles pero sin comicion por produccion"
good,Overall Walmart is a pretty cool place to work at. You have to have patience and understanding while working here. Without it you may feel uncomfortable or unhappy with your job.
good,"good environment and fun place to work, good management and co-workers willing to help you learn. great for starting out and even heading into retirement."
good,"I really loved the job , the customers and.the environment . They had very bad management though and the other employees weren't welcoming at all . Everything else was okay."
good,Walmart gave me my first chance to work when I did not have any work experience before. I was treated well as a co-worker and given the chance to advance to my first manager experience.
good,Great place to work. Management is very helpful. Employees were all very friendly. Willing to work on your schedule. If your looking for a relaxing job this is the place.
good,"I loved working with the coworkers. They made my day worth going in everyday :)"
good,Centered around customers. Up beat environment. Rotating shift. Not guaranteed 40 hours. But great for college students.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. The opportunities for advancement are wonderful and easy to pursue. There are a variety or people who work for the company and interacting with different people gives you great job skills for future careers.
good,A typical day would be unloading the truck and stocking the product after. It was nice having a hour for lunch and even on a bad day most likely some customer will make you smile
good,cambio continuo de jefe de area y unos de esos jefes son en extremo inutiles
good,"I would go in and start up the printers, wash the kiosks and scanners."
good,Well I've been at Walmart for almost 4 years you must be a people person to work there are else you will have a terrible day customer service skills is a must......must be reliable.....ive learn in a work environment like Walmart customers is always right....every 3rd quarter we get bonuses
good,I liked working in Wal-Mart meeting new people evreyday management wasn't great but working with them was ok I learned new thing every day. Like the experience I gained from working here.
good,Unload trucks with forklifts or by hand and process the freight into the warehouse to be distributed between the districts' stores. Input information into computers and by scanners to register what freight is on the truck.
good,great coworkers and some management is great only downfall was I was always signing temporary contracts and ended up having my contract end and loosing my position to a person who was working there half as long as me
good,Enjoyed the people i worked with but was overnight which made it hard for me to spend time with my daughter and get some things done during the day. I was hired for overnight maintenance but was used for stocking quite often which was fine because i liked it more and made my nights move along faster
good,Loved my job but hated working foto other Walmarts and I hate how the store manager gets away with anything. Well he is gone (at a different Walmart now)
good,"The benefits that I would have gotten if I had been able to stay were great. As it was, my pay was awesome and I was always working at least 30 hours a week."
good,Walmart is full of a bunch of different people. You'll see a new face every day. The only downside is the point system. So show up for work and everything will be just fine.
good,Liked working with other associates and helping the customers with any type of problems they had worked in electronics  and phone department. Also worked up front cashiering.
good,"For the short term I was able to work at Walmart, I enjoyed being a Walmart employee.  There was always something to do to make the shift more enjoyable."
good,it a good job if you are look to get or foot in the door if you wont make 9.00 to 10.00 $ per hour and do more then required to do so like work there .
good,"The coworkers are great to work with, and the customers are easy to get along with, management is not that great as well as the pay, but other than that, it is a fast paced and fun place to work."
good,I enjoy employment with walmart. You can learn a lot and get promotions without any discriminations. The management is ok. If everyone worked together as teamwork.
good,"Kept busy all day always had an assigned task and completed in a timely fashion. Great daily interaction with customers, and always learning new skills"
good,"I enjoyed working there. I is always good to be busy, ; therefore always something to do. I always enjoyed working there, and meeting new people."
good,Not too bad of a place to work for the only major problem was management didn't communicate nearly enough so whenever a problem rose it was always news to every leader but being such a huge company it can be expected
good,"I loved working here except the managers gossiped like high schoolers. I feel if I tell a manager my person business, no other employee should find out. Other than that I loved it."
good,"I was a cashier, every day was pretty similar, and very repetitive. You had to work with people everyday which can be good but also hard. I learned how to bag quickly and make small talk. Management was good, but the company looks at people as expendable. My coworkers were nice. The most enjoyable part of the job was having good conversations with customers but the hardest part was feeling like you were always in a rush."
good,i lasted 6 months because the management was awful and didnt want to help at all. I couldn't have a say in my own schedule even though I was their strongest stocker.
good,"I loved working here.  Very productive work environment. Great people to work with. I learned many things, such as which forms of ID's are accepted and which are not."
good,"Plenty of room for advancement and learning new areas/departments. Salaries based on education and work experience. Overall, a good place for a first job or retirees looking to supplement income."
good,"No complaints,  Like the flexibility of a retail environment, decent people no major problems,  Has the benefit of Walmart's well planned management structure."
good,Start day at 5:00am every morning by unloading the truck and putting pallets in the cooler. Next go the sales floor locate the outs and take all old product off of sales floor. Fill the wall and zero everything that didn't come In on the out. Take all the old product that was taken off the wall and throw it away and make everything look nice for the customer. For the rest of the door help customer and keep wall filled as can be.
good,Customer satisfaction is a must at the busiest walmart in the nation. Be ready to work in a fast paced work environment. Cashiers at Walmart are 1st priority u see them 1st and see them last. We always have to be on our A game.
good,"Easy overall, I was sick always... did to bring in the cold. Departments are nice, if you need change in your life. You can always move to another."
good,Nada a declarar sobre a empresa nem sobre o trabalho exercido.
good,I like working by myself I'm able to get things done faster. Ben on thirds  I had that chance. I got my job done and right. I also didn't have to worry about being in the way.
good,"It was easy job, all i had to do was unload trucks an separate all the merchandise to its dept. The hardest part of the job was heavy lifting ."
good,"This company offers good benefits. They offer Medical, dental, and vision insurance; Short/ long term disability; 401k and profit sharing. There are also opportunities to grow with the company and move up in position."
good,"Challenging, fast-paced workplace. Constantly learning. You will never be bored, and your multi-tasking skills will be perfected. If you're considering a career in retail Pharmacy, this is a good place to road-test the idea."
good,"Stock shelves,racks,cases,bins,and tables with  merchandise and arrange  merchandise display to attract customers. May periodically take physical count of stock or check and mark  merchandise .Occasionally worked on the register.I helped to maintain a certain cleanliness in the store,return garments that have been tried on or  dismissed back  to their original place ,refold and organize any ""folded"" tables of clothing,also picked up garbage throughout the store to help keep the store looking the best to keep  customers happy and safe .I was also in charge of monitoring dressing rooms for  customers and cleaning the room out one of our read bass ."
good,Everyday i can expect to show up on time and prepare to open the shop for business. I clean the shop in preparation for vehicles to come to be serviced. The co-workers are fantastic friendly people. Management needs some serious work there are good managers however the corruption starts at the top. The store manager will act like he is there to help and when you bring attention to an issue he says he will fix it however he does not and will not remedy the situation. I learned to work hard and to keep a clean shop while also building outstanding customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is learning the ins and outs of company policy. The most enjoyable part of the job are your fellow associates. They make coming to work the best.
good,Walmart is a great place to work but it is hard to get them to work with your schedule sometimes and it is hard to move to a higher pay grade within the store.
good,"in a customer service type of environment where learning new techniques is a good asset, management is friendly and interactive and the co-workers are the same, the hardest thing about the job would just be learning the basic. Once you have the basics down you can move on to better opportunities"
good,"They promote within, once you get full time you get befits. As well as they have a profit share program, over all great people you work with and mangers are nice"
good,"All around good place to work. Allowed me the necessary time off, but also gave me some tough hours. Many times I would work until midnight on the Friday and be scheduled to work at 6 or 7am the following Saturday morning."
good,"Cashiers deal with many different people on a daily basis."
good,"I never had a problem with Walmart, however there were a few times where I had to shoulder all the responsibility when no one else stepped up. The managers didn't really know what was going on most of the time either."
good,I worked for Wal-mart for several years. It was a good place to work and I am very thankful for the skills and experience that I received during my time there. I would recommend this company to anyone. Thanks.
good,Company with great benefits. Great People to work with. Enjoyment and educational. Able to learn and cross train in several position. As well as being able to become a back up for those positions.
good,"Enjoyed those I worked with and Veterans were treated well. Policy's are very rigid. Warsaw CAP1 Team were good to work with, because they worked as a team. Teamwork is what it was about after taking care of the Customer."
good,"I worked overnights for about a year and a half. On a typical day we would be required to pick up after previous crews and still expected to complete our stuff on time. The overnight crew at our store was leaned on heavily by the rest of the store and most day-time hourly associates didn't even realize how much pressure was put on the - for the most part - understaffed crew. Management was good to me and whoever was pushing themselves and getting a workout in. For the most part every person the overnight crew besides a select few acted like freshmen in high school and spent their breaks gossiping about others. The thing I love most about the job was just being able to get a work out in while getting paid. Honestly for me the hardest part of the job was trying to stay out of the way of the grown children who spent more time gossiping then working. My advice is, this is a good job to get if you can work hard and ignore others."
good,I would say my favorite part of each work day was getting to greet customers and helping their visit with my Walmart be as satisfactory as possible. I had great co-workers especially the other customer host we worked together not only as co-workers but as a team.
good,"the manager in the deli was kind of rude, they wrote me up because the case that holds all the cooked chicken had broken and they couldn't use it, even though I had only been working the cold case that day."
good,Wal Mart was a nice place to work.  I asked to be transferred to a different department and was denied.  I was not happy where I was.  Supervisors were nice to work with.
good,Walmart is a decent company with great benefits . It's all what you make it there. Lots of miscommunication as well as unhappy employees. Most of them have attitudes
good,"Straight nights is difficult to endure on a long term basis. Benefits and pension plan are nice to have. The night crew have a low morale level, so it became a depressing work environment, especially when working straight nights for a long time.  Benefit of working the night crew is that it is quiet and you can focus on your work."
good,"Developed great multi tasking sklills, while learning to focus on key deliverables and maintaining customer satisfaction in a high paced environment"
good,It's a good place to work and you meet all kinds of people while working.  Co workers will help you if needed. I think it's an all out good job
good,A typical day at work you can expect to leave sore in most positions. Generally management is fair in how they treat employees. The hardest part of the job is repetitively lifting items that weigh nearly as much as me.
good,Good job to work for great company to work my way up into upper management looking to grow with the company wish they would give me more hours only problem
good,Manager was clueless couldn't change oil or tires. Would have us under staffed for hours then complain about the bay times. Manager was on a power trip all the time causing everyone to snap
good,"Like most retail stores, WalMart has a lot to offer.  There is always something different to do if you wish to make a change.   If you don't like the position you are assigned to, you can work hard and get a promotion.   Or switch to a different position.  I have enjoyed the flexibility WalMart has offered me over the years."
good,"In this line of work it never gets boring there is always something that needs to be done. Whether its helping a customer, translating from Spanish to English, it has always been great. What I've learned in this field of work is that one must have patience, always work hard to achieve the best, maintain a positive attitude, and always attempt to strive for the best."
good,"Management should be worked on, some employees are very rude, and management picks and chooses their favorites, I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers an all of my customers"
good,At the beginning of my shift I would restock the shelves and organize the stockroom. The hardest part about my position is not having the products the customers are looking for. I learned that you can not satisfy everyone you work with.
good,"A typical day at work would include the following things:"
good,"The CAP2 team at the Waynesboro, PA Wal~Mart was one of the best crews that I have worked with. As long as you worked hard and used common sense, your team ""had your back"""
good,Working for Fortune 1 company has afforded a lot of opportunities. I learned a LOT during my time at Walmart.com. Plenty of smart people at that company. Although it is not nearly as awesome as it could be.
good,Overall Wal-Mart is a great place to work. As for the management team they have lost focus. They don't have respect for the individual anymore. Respect goes a long way.
good,Enjoyed working Walmart. Counted cash reg. in morning. Made up new reg. money. Made up deposits and ordered more money from Brinks. Most managers were fine; always few that were never happy with my work. Girls I worked with were great. Pleasing some managers was the hardest part; other than making sure money came out right. Hours were the best. Work 5AM - 2PM. Had same schedule every week.
good,"The management is a sloppy combination of experienced and unenthusiastic personnel. However, on the larger scale the company offers great benefits for heath,education, and vacations. Walmart is  also very dedicated to wage equality."
good,"Working here has a lot of hidden pros but for the most part if you are not looking for them they will not find you. The pay is not all that great when I was working there.  However, the coworkers like ups really look out for you even after you have worked there.  Management is always very understanding."
good,Great co-workers and supervisors. I loved working in the photo lab and working with the customers. Working at the service desk I had regulars that even talk to me when I was out in town.
good,I found Walmart to be a great place for family orientated individuals. They try to work around your needs and schedule. They have good training and awesome incentives.
good,Walmart is a very fun place to work at. You really learn how to deal with people each day which is great if you are a people person. Walmart has great opportunities to become manager
good,"It's a very easy job but is very fast paced at the same time.  So you have to constantly be moving and packing those packages.  Everything is computerized, so you just pack and send the package on it's way.  I've never worked in this type of atmosphere before and I actually like it!  "
good,"Walmart was a great job so far they showed me how to become a better , the skills on how to go about life , learning more every time , helped me out with school & also learned how to be a great person."
good,"Work days consist of unloading trucks, moving freight, and stocking the sales floor at the bare minimum. Nothing too hard if you actually work and move with a purpose.  Advancement from a CAP team member was pretty poor in our store, so a member would end up transferring into another department."
good,Honestly Walmart was one of the best jobs I have had. They promote from within and if you show up and do your job there is no reason that you cannnot move up very high in that company if you so wish. Great benefits and they really care about there associates.
good,always in tune with the employees made sure that we needed to perform at out best great co workers and the management gives you your proper respect
good,"Monitor sales, assist customers, accept appropriate coupons, know key codes for fruits and vegetables. Also know key codes for ice and fish, move at a quick pace to get our customers in and out, make customers feel welcomed, clean area, report incidents: missing items, cash terminal, theft, and customer complaints/reports. Handle cash, checks, money orders, debit/credit cards, and electronical payments."
good,working wasn't really hard just stock frozen and dairy items from the freezer. it was a cold job never really got use to it. the co workers were pretty cool
good,A usual day at wal-mart begins with getting the freight out of the truck. This usually takes between 2-3 hours depending on how big the truck. After this there will sometimes be a second truck which takes about the same time. If there is not a second truck then we stock the shelves until about 8pm then we move all the freight we got out of the truck on to the sales floor.
good,It was nice working at Wal-Mart my co-workers was good I made alot of friends working there.the hardest part about my job was tring to keep up wit all the different tasks.the most enjoyable thing was being able to talk and socialize with the costumers I checked out. I learned alot of different things there.
good,"A day was always busy, worked my hardest everyday, enjoyed coworkers. It was great getting to say hi, how are you, and help many customers everyday. Most management was great."
good,"The company is nationwide. It's like hurry and get it done. It should be about getting it done right the first time. Prioritize. Customers should be the focus. By hurrying to place items on the shelves you overlook items that should be rotated. I take pride in what I do every day. I may take a few minutes longer to do the job, but when I leave each day I know that each customer was greeted with a genuine smile and shown personally where the items were located. They leave with a smile. My success is achieved. Happy customers come back to see smiling faces and to be treated with respect. Hurrying causes delays and you feel like a robot. Well, I am glad to say I believe in being honest to yourself. I care about every person walking through those doors. It's someone's Mother, Father, Sister, Brother, Aunt, Uncle, Child, Baby. They all deserve the appreciation of a few minutes of your day for a genuine smile. That may be the only reason they come to your facility. The dollar figure to me is out the window. A smile can outlast that dollar bill in your pocket. Making time to chat and smile makes people want to come back. Happiness comes from within."""
good,"a fast paced environment to work in with new goals to achieve in every new shift, great people to work around in a good environment."
good,I enjoyed working here the most. My coworkers we're amazing. The customers were always so nice. I enjoyed the work environment. The managers were pretty awesome.
good,"At Walmart, I was responsible for checking out pharmacy patients, assisting them with locating over the counter items, stocking and zoning shelves. I learned how to work amongst a team and with patients with various personality types. My direct managers were very knowledgable and great teachers, as were my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was trying to manage situations outside of my control . The most enjoyable part of my job was the gratitude of patients when we met their expectations."
good,"As a cashier at Wal-Mart it can be a rushed environment and constantly walking, due to holiday crowds and ball game crowds. But it is tough, and you always have rude customers."
good,"I worked in the distribution center, four 10 hour shifts. Management was either really nice or extremely upsetting. No holiday pay for warehouse workers, and if you wanted the day odd, you'd have to call it in months in advance. I couldn't stand going to work everyday, but my co-workers got me through the day because some pretty great people work there."
good,"I've worked at two different Walmarts over the past two years, and the experiences were rather different, so your mileage may vary depending on your store's individual management. Overall working at Walmart was a perfectly fine experience; not particularly outstanding but the people working there have generally been friendly and willing to help out with things, and the management tends to not be very hands on, which I appreciate. That said, you get very little respect from the company side of things and somehow even less from most customers, with a few shining gems. Do not go to Walmart to get a rewarding feeling of interacting with and helping people, you will be disappointed. Their firing policies are also incredibly strict; starting out I was given 3 absences total over the course of 6 months, and being late once lead to immediate dismissal even with extenuating circumstances."
good,"Work hard, do your job, volunteer to help others, especially your Supervisors and Managers and you will be fine.  If you have a problem with one of the Managers, just wait six months ... Managers seem to be on a revolving door policy at Walmart ... I was there a little over a year and we changed the Assistant Manager for the Cashiers three times!"
good,"My experience with Walmart was working as an associate on the floor in the Men's and Boys department. My job was primarily zoning  and restocking the floor, shelves and displays with clothing. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping customers. The most difficult was pacing myself to avoid injury."
good,The Secret of Retail pharmacy is to please the customer and not fall behind. By starting early it allows one to stay with the pace and provide the service the customers require.
good,The work was alright. The managers are good. The warehouse environment is much better than working in the store. Sometimes the amount of work was scarce and hours were cut.
good,"It was great working with people and helping capture special memories for them. I loved seeing new people everyday. "
good,Every day is usually stressful but my coworkers make the day better. Our manager is great at working around our schedules. The hardest part is making the customers happy
good,ur dealing with pushing large amounts of carts and dealing with rude management is extremely stressful and overall just tiresome and annoying more of a job for new job starters.
good,its not a good place to work it use to be the first time i worked there now it is not they treat u like a machine like it is your 10 min brake u only get about 7 min and now u get hired it is all temp u work about a mo and they let u go four the reason of the contract is over but there is not rely a contract
good,Only worked seasonally.  Not a whole lot to say - I don't think anyone even knew I existed.  But the job was simple and the pay was decent.
good,i loved putting out the freight and figuring out were it went but some times the store was busy so it was hard putting stuff on the shelf.I love pushing carts it was an easy job to do.
good,It was alright kind of a sloppy work place management was kind of eh and did not really help you much. Hardest part of the job was getting through very long and boring days.
good,many of the employies had bad attitudes and treated others unfairly. also the supervisors wouldnt keep any rules enforced
good,I would show up at work and start putting clothes away and I would interact with my co-workers. I got along with them and my manager. The hardest part of my job was having a lot of tasks assigned to me and having a certain time to get it done but I got all my tasks done before I went home.
good,company is a great place to work. management at some of there stores are not great guess it just depends on what store you work at. company lets management do some shade stuff like letting there employees go for getting hurt off the clock
good,"A very fast paced workplace where accuracy is essential to success. "
good,Me gusto trabajar y aprender cada dia muy buen ambiente de trabajo y sobre todo el crecimiento laboral que obtuve
good,"work day would start early 4 am with a department meeting then we would scan shelves for outs then scan the back room for picks. after words we would take the picks out and stock the shelves. co workers were for the most part great, the hardest part of the job was the early start time."
good,Each job that I have been employed at taught me a lot about myself and others. I have a ton of experience in many different areas.
good,You will love the fun friendly layed back atmosphere so many things to do and very friendly people. You will enjoy meeting people from all different backgrounds.
good,"Typical day at work was hard labor and fast paced, Co workers were great and management was very good and always listened to what you had to say. I recommend walmart for a good starter job to build the skills you need for your future."
good,though it takes a couple of years to obtain them all the benefits at wal mart are wonderful. They include a quarterly bonus profit share buying and paid time off
good,Typical day at work was doing as my department manager asked. I learned how to bake and set out bread for the following day. I also learned how to ice cakes. The management was good as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part was when I finished all my assigned tasks and got to help ice cakes with the cake decorators.
good,"Overall, Walmart was a good place to work. My co-workers were friendly and everyone really got along. The only things i didnt like about working for walmart was the bad scheduling. They finally increased pay, bu they also started cutting hours, so nothing really changed. Overall working for walmart, I would rate them a 6 out of 10."
good,"You get to work you have a meeting of what the day consists of and you get to work. You learn many things such as great communication with Co workers learn to help one another. The management was great never slacked alway met deadlines great individuals,  great responsibility. Hardest part was making sure everything was back in its place before leaving that's why we had plenty of time before we clocked out. Most enjoyable part of the job was just being around Co worker's with great attitude."
good,"everyday i worked there at walmart, it was always a new challenge and obstacle i would overcome. as i already said it was good but challenging and at times overbearing but it gave me chances to succeed."
good,A typical day at work is always the same thing that happens. Management typically likes to blame one person for the other peoples mistake. Co workers actually tried to show that I do my job but they fail. So overall this job is nothing but hard and nothing was really enjoyable.
good,different departments to work in. Can move around. People are willing to help with transitioning to different departments. Loved working in human resources. Great culture. easy going people.
good,J'ai acquis une très bonne experience dans le milieu de l'electronique et des ventes
good,"I was given the opportunity to work for walmart. After being there for about two years, I was able to purchase my first car."
good,Had a great time working with some fun individuals that I got to know and love for a long period of time.  Great managers who want you to succeed not only in the workplace but outside as well.
good,I really enjoyed working at Walmart the job it's self is pretty simple and self explanatory. However I had a few issues while I worked there. I started out working as a sales associate I worked in the shoe department. There were so many different managers and they didn't communicate with each other very well. I was constantly getting all of these different tasks from different managers. It became impossible for 1 person to complete all the tasks in their department and all of the 1s the managers gave on top of it. Then they made me a cashier I really enjoyed being a cashier however I was a minor at the time and by law couldn't work past 10pm the csm would hardly ever let me off the register in enough time for me to clock out by 10pm and I always got in trouble because of it.  No matter how many times I tried to explain what happened they didn't seem to listen. Other than that I really did enjoy working there.
good,Red Oak's Walmart works well with school schedules. They abide by what you request. Garland's Walmart is not the same. They do not abide by what you request. They over work you.
good,"Overall, working at Walmart was good. I made friends, loved to do my job and helped a lot of people. The only thing Walmart needs to work on is who they hire for Management. They're unprofessional in certain ways and don't know how to treat some of their associates. A typical day starts like any other, you wake up and go to work. In my department, it starts with phone inventory, running friehgt and then starting photo. It goes smoothly most days, but others we get busy right from the beginning. I've learned that I liked working, it filled my life with a purpose and it showed me things that I didn't know. I've learned more about technology then I ever could have by myself. As I've said before, the management there in the Walmart I worked, needs sever improvement. My co-workers were the best I've ever had, we had great times. Besides doing our jobs, we've become friends so we've had our goofy times at work. I've never been more happier in my life until I met them. The hardest part of my job was being left alone by myself in the department and then being overwhelmed by so many customers all at once, but however like most things, what has bad will have the good. The most enjoyable part of my job, was the peopole that I worked with. They are what made my time at Walmart, worth while."
good,I worked here all through my college career and I loved it. I learned so many life skills and established wonderful relationships with coworkers and patients alike.
good,"En resumen la empresa Walmart chile, es una buena empresa, pero no me dio la posibilidad de hacer mi practica profesional en ella, lo que me genero un descontento y decepción, ya que pensé que por trabajar 15 años en la Compañia, me otorgarían la posibilidad de hacer mi practica y hacer mi trabajo conjuntamente."
good,I have over 20yrs with Walmart company and i was Very good at my job and could work in Any department. I have a bond with customers so alot of the times they would ask for me to help them even if the questions had nothing to do with Walmart. Most of the managers come from different jobs so its hard for them to adapt and they try and change things around sometimes thats not good and it makes things worse or the associate's gets stressed out. My co workers were awesome and we all got along and they could call me if they had questions or a problem. The things ill miss from Walmart is associates i worked with and the customers cause they all made my job worth it. I still get calls from associates and customers asking questions and to say hi.
good,This job lets you interact with customers and it was a great experience to learn and be taught how to interact with different kind of people. Overall it was a great experience.
good,"Coming in each day is different, depending on the specific on the day and the time of year would entail how the day went. It has definitely taught me a lot of different things, especially with working with the public"
good,"They want you to work fast , the Walmart i worked at in Fort worth just wanted you to work fast . If you're a slower worker you won't like working there."
good,Showing up to work an on time is usually a typical day. Providing customers with great service is my number one priority as well as getting my job done before my shift is over. Working there I've learned you can brighten up a customer day by simply greeting them with a huge smile.
good,A typical day at work for me included checking out customers at the register and making sure they were satisfied with their experience. I also learned how to do purchase returns. I appreciated the management at Walmart because they were always prompt and there when I needed them.
good,Working at Wal-Mart makes you feel like a team member. It is very fast paced and you learn all kinda of new things. Working at Wal-Mart has also helped me develop amazing customer service skilis.
good,I was working here while in high school it was very fun I loved meeting new people the hours are pretty flexible I was in lots of activity's during school so they build around my school and activity hours management was great very helpful and friendly pay was good for a high school kid couldn't survive on the pay as an adult
good,The pay wasn't bad and the job was easy the only thing was not being treated respectfully by other in higher position to you. I got talked down to and like i was stupid on more than one occasion when i asked for help. The co-workers weren't to bad most people kept to themselves. The only hard part of the job was dealing with rude costumers but on the other hand some of the customers are what made me come back everyday.
good,a typical day at work is a routine. I learned the safety at the workplace. Associates had better be full-time  than part-time.
good,I've worked for Walmart in several capacities.  Each day brings new and diverse situations.  I've learned that their is more than one way to achieve a goal and that someone else's way may be better and more efficient than your's.  Management considers me their right hand.  They come to me with many different issues in hopes that I can help them solve them.  The hardest part of my job is getting the management team and the hourly associates on the same page.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping associates find a solution to their problems
good,i started out as cashier was trained to be customer service knew all the in and outs. left only because my pay rate wasn't going up. i would've stayed if i was able to get a wadge that matched my work efforts.
good,"As a Cap 1 associate, you end up doing your role every day. I've learned to count items in the background by using a specific device, pick the ones that need to be placed on the sales floor, and simply place them on the shelves to make sure the counts are correct. "
good,Learned a lot of different things that I was unaware of in a retail business. you were able to move around store in learn new things. Management was usually great and easy to get along with
good,"I am presently employed with Walmart and I feel that I have met somewhat of a dead end in my progression with the company.  I have   had the privilege of attending Walmart Retail Acedemy where I not only learned health and safety of working in the fresh department but also was shown the workings of reports."
good,"My co-workers and most of my customers were great and the work was what you would expect of a retail sales associate and cashier. "
good,Wal mart was a good second job for me. But it never made me feel safe because if you didn't do exactly what management say and how you could be fired on the spot.
good,"Walmart Supercenter was a fast pace job, lots of money handling but being able to keep organized and know all safety procedures. Co-works were very kind but good communication, also management was very skilled and know all safety procedure. The job was very challenging having to be on your feet for hours but grew great customer service. Good dependable employee. Everyone worked together on busy days and good loyalty."
good,I enjoyed my time working with Walmart. This is a great place of work for anyone no matter what age you are. A lot of the people I worked with were friendly and loved their job.
good,"Working at walmart had is ups and downs. The job itself was awesome! Great coworkers and routine work made it a good job to be at. Pay wasn't great, but if you worked hard enough and proved your loyalty and dedication, you moved up pretty quick"
good,"There is a lot of favoritism , you may work in other areas of the store may favorite thing is meeting new people and helping them find what they need, you can check on your pay days before it deposits in your account."
good,"A typical day for me was to perform returns, exchanges, and help with sorting the merchandise. I also would cash checks, answer phones, and transfer calls."
good,Love working there. I just had to leave because there was just no growth in the company. Would recommend the company to anyone.
good,"Great work place, fast paced, friendly staff and co workers. Decent pay and benefits. Was able to learn a lot while there. It's been a good experience"
good,Es buena empresa con buenas prestaciones y buen ambito laboral
good,"Wal mart was a fun place to work with alot of friendly people to work with. Each day I went to work, it was never a I don't want to be here moment for me because the work was fun for me."
good,muy buen programa de trabajo y ascenso con oportunidad de muchos entrenamientos.
good,Fun work place to work in. allows room for growth. Managers are very helpful. They allow you to make your money and they work with your school schedule.
good,Overall Wal-mart is a great company to work for and even enhance with the company. Wal-art has great benefits with 401k plans available for each employee.
good,"I worked in a couple of different areas as different forms of management. It really is not a bad place to work, unless you are a single mother of two kids."
good,"i stocked shelves and helped with inventory when needed"
good,"It's steady work that doesn't change much. Can get dull after awhile, but you'll always come home with a paycheck. Usually fairly easy going without sacrificing production."
good,"em rede de varejo e um bom lugar para desenvolver seu trabalho, porem a salário não e conveniente que seu trabalho."
good,No managers breathing down your back to complete work. Good working together to lift and move heavy things and relevant computer training to keep up to date with knowledge
good,The pay could be a little better for all that we do. Hours could also be better and the company would still benefit. I am a single mom and in college online and am expected to work crazy hours sometimes only being home for 5-8 hours then back to work. I need something that is 7-3 or 8-5 or something every day not 1:30-10:30pm then the next day 7am-4:30pm. No one who has a family can live on these hours. You can only have 3 days off in six months without being fired and this includes if you have to have surgery or be hospitalized.
good,Work days are pretty mundane and repetitive. Shipments come in in the morning and are supposed to be done before close. Pay is good. raises happen every few months or so. Management is...Spotty at best.
good,"A typical day included verifying accuracy of invoices for payment, interacting with vendors and management, and helping department managers when questions arise. I also looked for potential shrink on the sales floor."
good,"The work is exactly what you would expect, often do not have the supplies needed to do our job properly, but the people I work with make up for it."
good,"Todas las prestaciones de ley, horarios flexibles excelente trabajo para estudiantes, paga puntual."
good,Good place to work.  People make the time fly by. Never a dull moment whether it's busy or slow. I would rather it be busy so that the time goes by quicker but I try to make it fun while I'm there.
good,"Overall good balance of work and personal life, considering it is retail, you have to understand what is expected and know there is required working days including holidays and weekends."
good,I spent nights organizing a crew of 12 to 15 people to complete several truck deliveries each day. I ran an entire store for 12 hours alone ensuring the best appearance possible for the customer the next day. I kept in touch with law enforcement all night for help in case of any kind of issues that took place legally where I could use their support. I helped with conflict resolution as well as many other different behaviors with employees.
good,It was fun working money center and customer service.. I learned how to talk to customers like they want to be talked to. I leaned how to send and receive money from the money center.
good,"Great place to work if your willing to do the work. Make sure to come in and do the job to your best ability, then you'll have no problem working there."
good,When I worked here i loved how friendly everyone was and I was being paid well. What I didnt like was that they ended up cutting my hours.
good,The hours are great the supervisors are awesome. I would work there again with no problem just be careful not to get hurt on the job they automatically think you are trying to get a payday so to speak.
good,The Optical lab was a busy but fun place to work. The staff was polite as long as you met your quota. Co-workers seemed to get along well and there was no drama that I can recall.
good,I learned alot and worked with some great people. It was a short period of time because it was temporary but i grew alot from that.
good,being around the produce was awesome. I learned what fruits come from and what their used for. co-worker were fun and helpful.
good,"At the time i was working for walmart it was under different management. I did enjoy working for walmart until a family illness occurred cause my leaving. i enjoyed the people i worked for. The hours were a bit grueling. The structure of business seem to be and up and down scale, but from i see now its very strict. I would love to return to Walmart its what i know and enjoyed"
good,I am a friendly lady that get along with people .I.m a hard worker willing to learn different things.Quickly getting customer check out with a smile
good,this job was a teacher of how to effectively work with a team and without one when time required. also learned how to better multi task during the workday
good,Cant really say much about Walmart because I wasn't with them for a long period of time. I do know that I did like the coworkers the time that I was there.
good,This job is okay. Very stressful because company was low staffed all of the time. Managers were fair. Pay was too low for me. Other employees were nice.
good,I would recommend working here. The pay is really good and the benefits are awesome. The incentives are good with a really good top out pay scale.
good,Great job to start out on. learn new skills as you move around the store. most managers help you learn the skills that you need to get the job done.  Good place to start your work histroy
good,Good people but they need to pay more and management in WA are horrible.attitudes and cussing associates out.. Not cool at all.the only good thing was they gave you hrs of you were a good worker.
good,"I loved my job with Walmart Corp HO.  They have a completely different culture than I have seen in so many other companies. They do a lot for the employees. It isn't the greatest pay, but the benefits of working there are countless."
good,I worked at Walmart for not that long but i do have to say it was a great place to work at and a good environment with great people and co workers
good,"Walmart es una gran empresa, pero desgraciadamente no saben reconocer el esfuerzo de cada asociado o empleado, exigen sin dar por lo menos un gesto de agradecimiento."
good,"spent my days behind customer service where i assisted customers."
good,"Walmart offers many different opertunities to their emplloyees.  Great working enviroment, you always feel comfortable working and accomplishing day to day tasks."
good,"WalMart is ok. Management sucks and advancement is a contest of who you know. Overall it isn't so bad though. As long as you do your job and do it right, you should be fine. The discount is a nice perk"
good,I work hard and sometimes harder then other workers when they never showed up and got nothing out of it. I worked so hard and when other workers got promoted same thing that I was doing I didn't. when other workers got a raise at the time I didn't.
good,"The job was fine, I learned good skills while working there. I just gathered carts in the parking lot and assisted customers load and carry heavy objects to their vehicle as needed."
good,A day at Walmart consisted of breaking down the newly delivered product and restocking shelves making sure they stayed stocked throughout the day while at the same time helping customers. Walmart had a very interactive management team that was always willing to show how things are done or help you out if things where running behind. My co-workers at Walmart were easy to talk to and we worked together like a well oiled machine to get through the day.The hardest part about working at Walmart was the fluctuating schedule while the best part of the job was interacting with the customers.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day was being able to help my customers, and provide a solution for the mechanical issues that they came to Walmart for."
good,"My co-workers were nice, and truly my only problem with the place was that I didn't get along with everyone, but it taught me to move past the negative and continue on my job"
good,Hardest part of the job is dealing with the people who have been at the store since the dawn of time. They're lazy and put off their work on anyone else. Very little recognition of a job well done. Easiest job I was ever paid 9.00 per hour to do.
good,"We spent most of our days in groups, working together to accomplish one goal."
good,it's ok not bad could be better should pay more tho. Managers was cool had no problem with them. the only problem I had is they took all the benefits (holiday pay) away for a little raise
good,They were very understanding on my school schedule and would give me flexible schedules. Also had amazing staff and very nice environment.
good,"Typical days consists of down stacking pallets, organizing merchandise on shelves and promo displays."
good,"Good company that is set to excel in the past, present and future. Management and future planning were always the past part of the job. The worlds largest retailer for a reason."
good,"Walmart was a good fun area to work in.  I loved it . Good employees, customers and location. The managers DID take full advantage of their positions in all aspects but I loved it."
good,Good working environment. Nice management. Provision for growth and advancement through the company. I would recommend to friends and family.
good,"I enjoyed working hear as it was a grate fun productive place to work."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work. Sometimes you may be 1 person covering 5 departments but that's also just an issue with scheduling. It's not a difficult job at all, just can get a little overwhelming if you're alone and not used to multitasking in an already fast paced environment."
good,"good place to work."
good,"Loved working for Walmart, But just needed to better myself.  I know taking The job at PLS I would be going up the ladder and not be at a stand still."
good,"Working at Walmart was fun, some days were busier than others. I learned to have more patience and to help others more. Management was good. I loved my co-workers."
good,The only reason i won't go back is because the eliminated the asset protection department and just recently hired a new team
good,A typical day at work would include helping customers and making sure the work environment is safe and happy. Also joking with co-workers so the day doesn't seem as long
good,I helped move walmarts in hammond i helped pack everything in trucks to be sent to the new store. It was confusing and the shift leaders just expected us to know exactly what we were doing without any questions but the coworkers helped as much as they could.
good,Grate experience with good benefits. It seems like a good retirement company. The company was well organized and the pay was grate.
good,"Love the job and the people , even being new everyone was so willing to help and make sure i knew what i was doing and helped make my days go by with better confidence.. Even though i ended up learning so easily and caught on quick."
good,"The typical day involves making associate task assignments to ensure all required tasks are accomplished. The hardest part of the job is dealing with associates who decide not to come in to work, especially on weekends. This adversely impacts the ability to complete all tasks so that the store is ready for business for the day."
good,"Depending on the customers and the environment, it gets kinda hectic. Contionus interactions with the customers and also stocking merchandise"
good,"Very good position for starting out in Retail Management. Began in this company 3 years ago as a Cart Pusher, and was promoted in a decent amount of time to a Salaried Manager with the company."
good,Loved working there with the people and my coworkers. Great teamwork and great managers who would try to help you excel while you were there. Hardest thing about it was just finding where some things went because the size of the store but easy once I got to know it.
good,was a job like any other job you work for. don't know anymore then that  I went to work and did my job to the best that I could do ok
good,"-Customer flow can be very intense, but also very slow."
good,Es ameno trabajar ahí solo es acostumbrarse a rotar tu horario
good,I would assign co workers tasks for the night I would always strip and wax certain areas of the store. Management had their few favorites if you were not a favorite they would frown upon you my co workers were a great asset to me and also the company hardest part of the job was being rushed not to many people cooperating with you Most enjoyable part of my job was seeing and hearing people compliment on how well the floors looked and I could proudly say I did that
good,"A pleasant place to work, however Managers are paid too much compared to how much work the employee is compensated for. For example of a employee receiving maybe $250 for all of December when everything is very productive versus a manager receiving $40,000."
good,"Bon salaire"
good,"Aprendisaje en, Carrucel ,PBL ,Amador , uso Manual de zorras Electicas , Scaner , Boyse."
good,"I had a typical 4-1 work night. "
good,"A typical day at work would consist of showing up on time, then being assigned a register to work at, then proceeding to check customers out. I learned a lot while working at Wal-mart. I learned how to deal and handle money and how to deal with angry customers and try and make peace before letting them leave my register. My co-workers were not like me. Most were 20yrs old or 50yrs+. The older people were just there to have a job and carry on with life. I felt like most of the younger people there were there and stuck on figuring out the next move. Most didn't go to college or have any want to go to college or better themselves past this entry level job of being a cashier. The job itself was very easy for me, I would consider myself a people person. Last, the best part of the job was being able to talk to new people and also having loyal customers who would come back through my line because they enjoyed my company and my speed."
good,it was a great work experience working with walmart. a very nice organization to be with. good benefits and very coordial management.management was very supportive
good,"Great place to work, advancement, and great benefits. Management is good to work for. Lots of volunteerism available. They participate in a lot of community events"
good,A typical day at work includes unloading trucks and bringing pallets  out to the floor for other employees to stock. I learned how to work in teams and help other customers. The management is at Walmart is mediocre. I enjoy working with employees. The hardest part of the job is unloading trucks. I enjoy working in teams and having a fun time at work.
good,"It is a fast paced place to work, it's always go go go. There's no time to rest and things are always being moved around and put in different spots. It's hard to find anything in the store."
good,"The Customers were sometimes rude, but I would always keep a positive attitude. You learn good customer service and the co-workers were very helpful people."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo con mucho favoritismo en los subgerentes hacia algunos asociados son injustos y no toman en cuenta el trabajo se dejan llevar por voces ajenas a sus área y despiden a sus trabajadores como si llegaran diario a pedir trabajo
good,"most days at work were pleasant "
good,"Nice place to work , needs improved communication between management and associates.safe and very clean work conditions.nice , friendly associates ....."
good,It is a pretty cool place to work. I have met lot of cool hard working people managers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job for me was balancing life at home and getting off at 7am in the morning its really tiring but i loved the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team to get tasks done giving other teams a hand working together.
good,"It was a good experience. And I wish I was still working their, but it's a good place to work if your just being a job and they will help you find something you like to do so that you enjoy your time working."
good,I loved working with all my coworkers and customers. I honestly wish I didn't have to leave. It's the best place I have ever worked at. Great environment and great people.
good,boa empresa de se trabalhar..foi aonde percebi que esse ramo é o que quero pra mim..muito boa..
good,"Aprendi a manejar dinero en efectivo, trabajar con clientes. "
good,"My experience at Walmart overall was very helpful and flexible. They gave me the chance to transferred to different departments and learn different parts of the store. I did a lot of customer service , answering phones ,cashier and also stocking."
good,The sales associate position I held was amazing. However there were some improvements that could have been made. Some improvements could have been made in the management areas. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers and the opportunity to move up in the company.
good,"Nice people to work with out on the floor. Was able to learn a lot in various areas of the store. A typical work day would be clock in find out from management what was needed to be done that day, get what equipment necessary to get job done and go to it,. During time on floor stop and help customers as needed while still getting job done. Working in deli learned food prep and recipes per SOP, Cap ! learned unloading and separating skills, paperwork that went with that area. Cap 1 learned how to use an MC40 ( a handheld scanner/ computer similar to a blackberry) to do reverse picks, straight picks, bin merchandise in back for temporary storage, top stock and its guidelines. Often pulled from daily assignments to perform special tasks. Some of these included setting up filing systems for managers, set up feature displays on floor, organizing areas for sting things like laser printer supplies, labels, and various other supplies. Some other duties included deal with vendors and their wants and inventories. Refer to management if I didn't know answer to a question.(if a department manager was on vacation or leave and I knew the department)  Over all enjoyed working here and the people I worked with. Enjoyed learning new things especially because I feel the more I know the better I can do the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers. No two re the same and some interactions were fun while others informative. Such as helping a blind customer shop.  Hardest part of job was management. I say this because no two managers did things the same way or had the same"
good,A typical day at work consists of stocking shelves and rearranging the store's appearance. The most enjoyable part is the hour lunches.
good,"* Excellent opportunity for growth"
good,It's a wonderful place to begin a job at. You will learn from others around in in many different areas of work. They help you with any problems you may with what you are working on. If you need to have certain days off they will work around your schedule to find a way to work for you.
good,I enjoyed working for this Walmart even with the store manger that is currently there...it wasn't a bad job paid pretty well and had descent benefits..
good,Good first job coworkers are friendly and fun to be around with lernded a lot of things at Walmart managers were friendly too I learn a lot in the year that I worked there
good,"Some times it gets really hard at work but I can handle it with the Lords help, and my co-workers.  Thank you :LORD. Thanksgiving is coming soon and we have alot to be thankful/"
good,"Bom de se trabalhar,tem plano de saúde,horário acessível..."
good,"days are long and arduous"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job would be the customer service aspect because I love helping people find what they need and what makes them happy. I enjoy resolving issues customers or associates may have. No day is ever the same which makes working in retail fun. I spend some time doing administrative work in an office and some time on the sales floor helping my associates with projects, ways to increase sales in their departments, and helping customers find what they are looking for. My co-workers and I strive to work as a team even when we encounter stressful situations. Being a manager in a fast paced retail setting has taught me so many different skills that have proven useful in not just my role as a leader but in my personal life as well. Unfortunately I have chosen to make the move out of a retail setting where the hours and schedule I have to work are unpredictable and inconsistent. I am looking for more consistency and a more ideal schedule in my next career."
good,loved going to work here. they had a list for every position and people weren't expected to do too much. management was always chosen carefully.
good,Walmart is a wonderful company to work for because you meet alot of new people it's also a place you can call home your there so much Walmart keeps you very busy
good,"My day consists of managing approximately 150 people, while also handling the cash flow of all registers. The management team works well for the typical environment they endure."
good,"When I worked walmart I was under 18 so when they upped the amount you make to $9 I cut to 1 day a week didnt make it worth my drive, Other than that I dont know much about the place, I know they didnt work to well with my pregnancy"
good,"A typical day on the job was working in health and beauty and cosmetics although I was a ""floater"" for pharmacy as well."
good,I have 20+years  in retail  and enjoy  what I  do including  working  with  customers  and fellow  coworkers  and walking around  an teaching  coworkers  all that  i can
good,Good for a starting job for younger people looking to learn skills in life. But it's always good to try new things in life.
good,"My night started with unloading truck in receiving. I would load my pallets on to the cart and take them to the department they belonged where the night stockers would put the merchandise on the floor."
good,"It's  was  an  ok place  to work.   At  that  time the  managers  that were  present  were  very  strick,  rude  and  arrogant.  The other employees  were  very  nice  and  helpful.  If offered this employment again I  would  go  for the job."
good,"Altogether great work experience.  There were some things that needed improvement, as far as employee to employee interactions,  however that can be found anywhere . A typical work day went smoothly and quickly, with minimal issues that needed immediate resolving.  Management wasn't the greatest during my time there, but former coworkers have told me that management was completely reset, and that there's a whole new team. The dress code was perfect, with guidelines on a uniform, but personal style was still encouraged. My coworkers were all great, respectful people from all ages. No matter what department you were in, everyone was always willing to help out one another. The hardest part of my job would be backroom stocking. That and pushing/pulling pallet jacks. The part I enjoyed most were my customers.  I love helping people find what they need , as well as taking care of their transaction in a timely manner ."
good,Great place to work. Co workers were friendly and helpful. They need more full time positions.  Nice selection of product.
good,a typical day working at walmart was ok. I would come in to work with lazy people that didnt like to do their job so I would have to pick up their slack. management was ok. some of them didnt know what they were doing.
good,"they do not pay enough, but was enough to buy food and cloths and I made some friends there and then I quit because I did not like it there and was too much work."
good,As long as you understand the job..... it's pretty simple! It's a timed job but as long as you and the other associates work together to get the job done it's easier
good,We have a great team of associates and managers. Our store is clean and we get a lot of compliments from customers. It's not always an easy day..lots of hard work. The best part of the day is happy customers and happy team members.
good,sumtime it was fun working at walmart..i used to be a overnight stocker and all my coworker was good and very helpfull.. but some of the manager sucks..
good,"Set-up schematics according to floor plans provided,, load and unload merchandise,, stock shelves, assist Management in replacing damaged signage and grounds keeping to ensure outdoors was up to par, Use of a forklift and pallet jack to load groceries,,merchandise,,etc.  Learned How to order Merchandise and  all areas of store. It was a fast paced work environment and team effort all around. I enjoyed Supervising the crew when asked and assisting Store management in other chores,"
good,"Worked as a Personal Banker, I dealed with. Creating demand deposit accounts while informing are customers of all functions of selected account. Cash handling and moderate computer skills were required"
good,Working with 280 associates in a fast paced retail environment that consistently exceeds all company goals and expectations. Customer service is paramount and the number one focus of each and every associate day in and out. A true engaging environment has caused a decrease in shrink and increase in sales and profitability. Leadership engagement + associate engagement = customer satisfaction
good,Company is okay to employees and offers variety in schedules. Supervisors are nice and will work with you and are very supportive.
good,"Managers really sucks, as well as the store manager. They lack communication with associates, and will at times make you do outrageous things without your consent"
good,Biggest retail company in the world employing millions of workers worldwide. Equal opportunity employer;  continuously trying to improve customer satisfaction/ service.
good,"Training to be tech and did sales associate. Co-workers were fine. Management was fine. Hadrest part of job- anger customers."
good,"Wal Mart offers great benefits. With Wal Mart,you get a lot  of training and experience with dealing with different types of people and situations. I will recommend Wal Mart."
good,I like the work. It is consistant and repetitive. I enjoyed working with the public and helping make sure that they had everything that they needed.
good,Overall good work environment but management needs to improve on communicating with employees. Management need to make themselves more available and be willing to discuss any concerns employees may have.
good,Working for Walmart gave me the tools to grow in a company that provides great customer service.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours staff have to stand up.
good,"Working in the stores was fast paced and can be very stressful at times, but it can be a great fit if you can keep up. If you take pride in your work an keep focused you can go far. You need to have a manager who believes in you and will mentor you to move into management."
good,The managment staff was not that professional.  Too much favoritism going on.  I was a temp for Christmas and was treated likee an outsider
good,Worked 12 hour days 5am to 5pm. They pay was great and benefits with raises. The work was very demanding with high production numbers.
good,"Fun place to work, never boring or the same day after day.  Attendance policy is strict and there should be leniency when a doctor's note can be provided for serious illnesses"
good,"come in at 5 a.m. get coffee,Say hello to co-workers in passing on your way to your station.Get a quick briefing on the day and on how many orders have to be picked.My time working for Walmart I learned how to work in retail and read a upc number to find a item. Working the pallet jack and loading delivery trucks with pallets the hardest part of the job is afternoon rush. Afternoon rush is when the store picks up its business, makes it very hard to get around the store.Overall its a enjoyable job ."
good,"When I would work at Walmart I would get there at 5:30 p.m. and would stay there until 10:00 p.m. I would run the carts full of picks, or items pulled from our inventory to fill stock outs on the sale floor. I would then look to refill the milk in the display from the cooler. At this point I would go out to the sales floor and make sure the items were presentable and neat. When this would all be done, it would be usually around 8:00 p.m. or 9:00 p.m. and the store would be almost empty. I would then usually clean display windows and then go home at 10:00. I learned to use technology to run pick lists and to work with a to-do list. The management was stretched thin and would often have to be paged when doing takes that had management required portions such as unlocking doors or giving codes. The co-workers there where great and they worked together well. The hardest part of the job was the difficulty of getting key jobs done when managers where hard to be found and the unpredictability of when you can be called away to help others."
good,Liked helping out customers out with things. Love making sure that shelves properly stocked for the next business day. most associates were great to work with.
good,"This was my first job. I was a cashier and later was promoted to customer service associate. It was nothing horrible, but it was not amazing. It paid the bills."
good,Wal-Mart is a good organization but l have my own personal reservations that l may not be comfortable discussing. There is room to grow at Wal-Mart. Associates communicate openly and freely.
good,I like walmart as a company and they keep you busy for sure.i have learned alot about retail and how to make the most of your day
good,Good pay. Fun people. They cut hours. Overall pretty decent job. You get a discount card after 3 months. There's retirement. I'd like to work there again someday for sure
good,"Its an okay job ,I learned how to work customer service desk, and how to manage money and how to give an outstanding customer service ."
good,"Was a nice environment. Very laid back and customers were always pleasant. Fast paced environment. Clean, organized and managers and coworkers were easy to get long with."
good,i learned many things working for Walmart Its veery fast paced and there are many people that come in to the store asking questions about what happens in the background and it takes a full well oiled machine to make it work everyday
good,Had a very exciting time working for this company. Enjoyed my fellow coworkers and my supervisor was pretty fair and reasonable.
good,it was a great experience for networking but as far as permanent i was not challenged nor was i happy in my current position. management was uncooth on occasion.
good,"Truck nights are touch at times especially when you don't have enough workers."
good,"Sams Club is a good company, but their management treat their associates like trash . Like if being late to lunch while doing my job and get in trouble is nit right. They need to fix that or make it helpful for their employers won't be late to lunch."
good,I love moving around so I liked working there. Once you start meeting new people dat makes work better for both cuz you can communicate and get work done on time.
good,"You see smiles and gentle conversations all around while at Walmart, its like the hang out spot for the local residents. Its nice to see people enjoying life with friends and family. You build rapport with people time after time."
good,I helped on the Mod crew. I would take apart shelves and it's products and rearrange them. Sometimes we had to move isles of stuff. It was a Great job to do
good,I love my coworkers! Managers are super nice and comprehensive! Flexible hours and good pay! I learned how to be more patient and comunícateive!
good,good place to work terrible management at the time.. nothing bad to say except about the management. easy and a good place too move up in the job if you wish to.
good,"Hard workers , great managers , awesome team work, great customer service, lovely associates, wonderful managers , friendly and fresh services , friendly environment"
good,"a typical day at walmart starts off with you coming in clocking in get started on your morning responsibilities before the day gets to crazy."
good,hard work but you are paid well with pretty good benefits. good job for someone who wants to make money and start a family. under staffed so long nights at times.
good,I like a early morning job with great benefits and positive people working as a team. The environment is positive and steady. Mangers that are helpful n thankful for their employees.
good,I give my jobs a 110 percent... Walmart is overall a great company to work for..There is opportunity to move up... Once in management position it is easy to move around to different departments to gain more experience. But as a regular sales associate it is vert difficult to get in to management...
good,its nice place to work for if you need a job. the hardest part was paperwork. the enjoyable was meeting people. you will learn a lot of items and will over cross different areas of the dept.
good,the most i enjoy of that job was when they recognize the associates and also every month they bring us food for all associates
good,They have been really patient with my health issues. they work with my availability. sometimes they do have a lot of favoritism there. I've been there too long!
good,I spent five years here. and it was a really good workplace. it kept me busy. and I basically made my own schedule by working through lunches. always something to do.
good,WalMart Is a great company to work for. I work as a CSM and i really enjoy working with the cashiers and with customer service. We work really hard but also like to have fun while we do it.
good,"Worked on all types of stuff like conveyors, electrical systems, forklifts and general building maintenance. My co workers were great. the best part was making sure that everything ran smooth when it did it was great."
good,My responsibilities included the loading and unloading of company products from various vehicles. I would also arrange product in proper placement according to warehouse procedure and inventory listings.
good,"Scheduling is pretty agreeable from what I've experienced."
good,"The people are great, I enjoy my job, it has been flexible for me with a family going from full time to part time back to full time. The difficult part is that in retail the schedule usually fluctuates and you do work weekends and holidays. But the nice part is with each year you work you can paid time off to use as you please."
good,"Walmart is a VERY good place to work. Breaks are always on time. Pay is ok. I enjoy working with others and getting to know my customers. My boss was also very involved with his store, employees and customers."
good,"Good company to work for, just need the right trained management in place, the company need more staffing and a lot of the issues would be resolved"
good,"El personal muy dedicado. las prestaciones son buenas, la distribucion excelente."
good,Wonderful place to work with some of the greatest people you could ever work with. Everyday is a new adventure as customers are different from day today. They're always the difficult customer and sometimes it is extremely hard to calm them butt you don't have to deal with that on an everyday basis.
good,"Alway something to do, really never a slow day. They always gave out 40 hour a week. Pay and benefits were good. Also I never had any problems with management."
good,Profit preservation through apprehension of customers attempting theft. Completed daily log and managed surveillance system
good,gives me a chance to enhance experience in customer service in nation-wide company with wide cultural environment with diversity freedom and professionally
good,"The job is too slow for me. I like a challenge, and this doesn't have one. It's one of the better places to work being in such a small town and the pay is higher as well. Great job, but my skills and ambition lie elsewhere."
good,It was a good company and helped me learn a lot on how to deal with all sorts of people from customers to coworkers. Working to late shift was fun dealing with all the people that come in at night.
good,While working Wal-Mart I suffered a loss in family so I left out for a couple days then they were all and understanding things weren't meeting ends and it was more a hassle. Handed my 2 week notice and then quit.
good,decent hours decent pay decent coworkers could be better. rules are very stingy but somewhat needed. I think the dress code is too serious and the mangers need to loosen up
good,I loved working for Walmart. I learned something new everyday. One thing I learned from working there is that it is a very large successful company. Sam Walton is a pure genius. I loved my co-workers and managers. They made sure my days always ended great. The hardest part about the job was the busy hours. Sometimes I would be in customer service by myself with a long line and no help nowhere around. The enjoyable part about the job is the co-workers.
good,Walmart in Dartmouth Crossing is a good place to work. The shifts are scheduled well and they take into consideration prior appointments/ obligations.
good,"The Co Workers were great, friendly staff.At times do over work you but its understandable seen it is a huge corporation."
good,Productive fun place to work but same time safe and secure when it comes to the safety of a costumer or employee manager there to help when is needed.
good,I liked working here. The drive was just too much. I live in west phoenix and this was all the way in east Scottsdale. I like my coworker and it was a nice place to work.
good,they are okay to work for but there management sucks  there are to many people in charge and not enough people to actually do the work. they do pay okay though
good,Don't ever turn your back on management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working and greeting and being able to talk to the customers especially the ones without the attitudes. A typical day at work was always busy and I like that a lot.
good,While having stayed at the company for an extended amount of time i have seen many pros and cons and depending on the area your walmart is located you may or may not be properly staffed. There is also the fact that depending on workplace location customers might give you a hard time.
good,"Very Nice Employees, the managers were very fair, the customers weren't too snappy, I enjoyed my time there every time I was there. The breaks and the lunches were all very well balanced with the work schedule."
good,it has its ups and downs like any other work place. you can work your way up in the work force. and you can find the right department for you. but for me it just wouldn't be a place I would want to work in forever.
good,A typical day at work when working at Walmart is very upbeat. There's never a dull moment and you introduced to so many different walks of life. Walmart was a good experience
good,I have really enjoyed. Work with this company for the last three year mangement has really showed me alot and helped me learn new thing
good,Great retail school for anyone who wants to pursue a career in retail.  You get to learn the merchandising seasonality.  Management has an old school mentality.  Tight expense control.
good,"It's hard work, so not for those who just want to sit around. Overall I had a good experience. the Managers were nice and fair. Sometimes though you may have too much on your plate."
good,I have fun while I work with my associates. Managers listen to my advice on how to improve the store and customer satisfaction. The store takes pride in keeping the shelves full.
good,It's a great place to work if you just keep your head low and do your job then  management  Is ok with you. The manager I worked with was tough and you needed to stay focused and get the truck finished within the two hour mark.
good,"I really enjoyed this position. I was able to help customers and meet new people. "
good,"Giving good customer service to the best of your ability. We were always told "" customers are always right"" which meant to us that we were not valued most of the time. The ability to learn different departments and working with fun people made the time go by faster. Management was changed too often, not for the best either. Only certain managers stood behind the associates. Many associates were devalued and left the company for that reason."
good,L'expérience varie beaucoup en fonction des gens que l'on côtoie
good,Quick and easy survices for customers on the go or time in the store. Greeting customers with a good attitude and a warm smile allow the customers to want to come back again and again. Making sure they get their food hot and quick make the day goes smooth and keeping the customers satified is the best thing working a mcdonalds love
good,The atmosphere is all about management. Successful management can make the working experience much better ! If you work hard for your managers they will work just as hard for you !
good,"This is a great company to work for, with competitive wages and great benefit packages. With also the opportunity to move up in the company for successful careers."
good,Learned a lot.  Able to do some international travel.  Nice people.  Con - very cheap.  Great access to senior management.  Very smart people.  Compensation is competetive.  I really enjoyed working with the people there.  They are a joy to work with.
good,It was a good work place. The managers was good and they were very fair. I learned to work at a steady paste and be the best i can be.My coworkers was fair and i did not participate with anything but the job. The hardest about the job is knowing your job performance and was it acceptable to the employer.
good,"Working as a shift associate which includes handling of unloading,shifting ,stacking and stocking of general merchendising.Also includes the maintaining of warehouse as well as picking of general marchendise from the warehouse."
good,Great place for benefits but the pay is not good at all I'm disappointed in how poor they keep their bathrooms clean and organized items are I'm disappointed in some of the appearances the employees have not very professional at all. I'm also disappointed in how management does not help or correspond with our pharmacy department. We basically are on our own no team effort from non pharmacy employees. I would working there forever but I can't pay my bills off 2% raises once a year
good,"Would come in check inventory adjustment reports, check video, watch surveillance cameras apprehend subjects of theft, make sure all items being eaten by employees were  purchased before intake."
good,"Great environment. Yes it has its ups and downs and crazy times, but all jobs do. The pay was decent and well the hours could vary but that depends on your position as well."
good,"Good company to work for. I enjoyed it. I would work there again. It's very organized, you stay busy. There is always things to do."
good,I absolutely love my job. But I was never supported in my position. I worked hard and learned as much as I could. And put it to good use. Only to be fired.
good,Walmart has been a great company to work for.  It has always treated me fairly.  I have always been able to support my family with he pay compensation that they offer.  Great company
good,"El trabajo es divertido..."
good,"Even tho I only worked at walmart for 4 months I feel like it's a wonderful place to work, both colleagues and management staff are warm and friendly, they really do care about you as a person, and I love that the company is so diverse, and treats everyone equally."
good,"its not great, dont be a cashier. don't even think about it. front end CSMs hate their workers. "
good,Wage needs to be better for employee retainment I would think or I wouldn't be looking for more work some of the management could be better than is for sure but overall decent place to work for a student
good,A good place to work and get your exercise during your shift. The hardest part is pulling full pallets from one corner of the store to the other but there is always something to do.
good,Excelentes compañeros de trabajo y buen trato por parte d supervisores y jefes a cargo.
good,Walmart was a nice place to work at we would have to unload delivery trucks first thing as a clocking in once the delivery trucks have been emptied we take the items that we have gathered and take him to the sales floor and then stock the items in the appropriate places
good,"I always felt productive working at Walmart in the position I was in, there was never any down time and yet work still felt like I was having fun but getting what I needed to get done as well."
good,It's your normal Walmart the name speaks for itself large convenient store that you might go in for one item an end up with a basket full
good,typical day: work to insure shelves stay fool. what I learned is that good steady work will get you respect and trust among your peers. management needs some improvement Walmart needs to teach people skills and to leave arrogance at the door. co-workers are great they usually have great attitudes and personalities. hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers that don't respect the individual. best part of the job going home at the end of the day.
good,Largest retail company in the US which allows opportunities in today's workplace that does not hinder the ability to promoted based upon one's educational level
good,Wal-Mart is a great store the people who work there are easy to get along with. They are well manner and respectful. I can see myself joining the company again.
good,"The day was constantly restocking and pulling truck and helping customers. The co-workers were great and encouraging and management helped out whenever they were needed. The shifts were long, and if you don't want to work random hours, be very specific about it when going through the hiring process. Good pay, though and a good starter job."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to learn and grow. If you put forth the effort. You have to be willing to work hard and ignore the water cooler talk, and then it's an okay place."
good,"Wal-mart is a decent place to work. If you work a full shift, you get two 15 min. breaks and an hour lunch. The co-workers are okay. I made some friends there. I, also, made some customers my loyal customers who sought me out specifically. That was cool. Management tends to indulge in favoritism. The managers are, either, really cool or they have nasty attitudes. You will be able to tell which managers are cool (fair, honest, good attitudes, actually care about their employees) and which are not cool (favoritism, office politics, nasty attitude towards their workers, doesn't care about their workers). "
good,I really enjoyed working for Wal Mart. I enjoyed the cooperation of the emplyees and the friendly customers that I helped out during my time at Wal Mart.
good,"Working for walmart I have gained experience working with systems to effectively pick and bin items. I have also gained experience in management by being produce, deli and bakery manger, as well as overseeing the overnight operations."
good,This was a great entry level job. They offer plenty of training and opportunity for advancement within the company. They offer very flexible work schedule for full and part time employment.
good,"Have to have a fast speed and get your work done quickly."
good,The most part I enjoyed about this work was the people I worked with and the customers. The worst part of the job is most management showed way to much favorites to some employees and not to them all. I enjoyed all my front end co workers but butt heads a little with management due to the favorites. All in all I learn to just do my job and try to fix and help my front end without the big managers above me.
good,"Todos los días empieza con la apertura de la tienda a las 6 am, antes de empezar a trabajar hay que ver los pendientes y ver cuales son prioritarios y una vez realizado una pequeña supresión a la Tienda, hay que delegar funciones para cumplir con las expectativas de la tienda;todos los días se checa el saldo de caja chica,se dan fondos, re realizan cortes, arqueos etc,también de realiza el cash diario."
good,"ambiente con buen trato al cliente siempre."
good,"In all is was a good job, miss working there, managment is a difficult one to work with, must do everything in the exact way of learning, cannot do it your own way. Money is great, and hours are amazing"
good,When I started at Walmart I was an overnight stocker which got me more in tune with the store surroundings. From there I moved up to overnight support manager which entitled the same duties as an assistant manager I was a key holder. I overlooked the staff all aspect of shipping receiving as well as all stock and zoning that was required. The biggest thing Ive learned from Walmart would be time management.
good,"The team is adapting new technologies and I have learned many new technologies while working here. "
good,It's an okay job to work for pays the bills some of the people that work there are always out to get you in trouble but most of the time everybody is really friendly and they're willing to help you as long as you ask some of the employees don't even pay attention to the customer they're supposed to follow the ten foot rule and they really don't all the new employees to follow it though some of the members of management are two-faced but not all only a small number of management members are like that one of the HR manager is not exactly a friendly person to speak to she's always got a bit of an attitude but other than that it's a good place good environment to work for the customer are friendly
good,"Good workplace to develop necessary job skills and leadership, responsibility. Makes person competitive and develops positive behavior at work"
good,"good place to work, decent hourly wage but not many hours. when they say you will spend some time in the freezer expect that to b about 75% of your time."
good,Working at walmart was fun and i really enjoyed the people I work with. The only problem is that they didnt really work with people who were sick especially new people
good,"Working for Wal-Mart not only was a good company to work for, it also had its bad moments. The Wal-Mart I worked for had terrible managers. They would all just stand around or disappear when other workers need them. If a worker had a complaint about another worker, management would do nothing to solve the problem."
good,"Sell firearms and hunting/fishing licenses. Assist customers if they had any issues, questions, or needs. Walk my department and make sure everything was clean and set correctly."
good,"I like my job, I like the people I work with, the only issue that I can say is that some of the management are very negative people, but if you can look over that it is a great place to work for."
good,Great learning experience and building relationships with co-workers/patients. It can be very mirco managed but really no complaints - regret leaving.
good,I have learned to always work with delight and a typical day at work is full of hard work. Setting the sales floor ready and neat for customers. i have very nice and team working guys who together with me give our best to make shopping at Walmart better.
good,"A lot of improvements must be done, People who works here sometimes don't get enough training. "
good,"I enjoyed going to work in the garden center. The manager out there was fun to work with and also taught me alot about plants and gardening. the job as a whole was stressful and eventful on a daily basis. No one was interested in helping you get further along in the company, even though that is what they promote."
good,"I enjoyed working for WalMart quite a lot. It was a very  fast passed job. Not only did you have to keep the department you are assigned to you also had to help the customers that are looking for help. Helping customers finding the products that they wanted got to be bit difficult if they are not in your department. Most customers didn't mind if it took time for you to find what they are looking for, as long as you find it. Speaking with the customers is great when you see the look of satisfaction when you find what they need."
good,"A typical day at work would be showing up on time, reading your assigned task even though you already know what you are responsible for. greeting management when they come around doing there tour. helping coworkers, making sure customers are taking care of and satisfied. The most enjoyable part is talking to a customer and you two can relate, the conversation and smiles make your day."
good,"I like my job.  My coworkers are good to work with also, my manager is a good to work with also.  I am looking for another part time job.  I'm a very hard worker"
good,"A typical work day was an nine hour shift helping customers in the electronics section. My co workers were great we helped each other out as needed, so I would say they were the most enjoyable part of the job.. What I learned working at Walmart was how to be patient, because the hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult people. Working with management wasn't a very memorable experience because most of my work I did independently."
good,"Was always busy to keep you on your toes, over all a great place to work. Pay wasn't the best but was enough to get by. Customers were a bit harder to deal with but always stayed positive at work. I learned a lot of customer service skills and advanced with the vision center. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the customers at the registers as we were always short staffed."
good,"Good company to work with while in school, very flexible with time. I gained a lot of experience in all kinds of tasks in various departments, helped with inventory as well as recruitment with an organized interview process. Also learned excessive customer service skills."
good,"As soon as I was hired all of my management and employees were welcoming and extremely helpful in making sure I was comfortable with my job. Since  working at the Walmart jewelry counter can be difficult at times due to the amount of information you must learn like how to check in fraught, take and send out jewelry orders, setting up mods all while interacting with costumers and making sales, it was nice having a more experienced trainer at the beginning but once I had learned what I needed to know, it was nice having the task and worked left in my hands and my favorite part was being trusted to train others with the knowledge I had learned. When the jewelry staff became just me and a newer associate it was obvious I had to step up. The responsibilities management trust to give you makes you truly feel like you are apart of the team."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with new people everyday. I wish they didn't end the contract at labor finders i still would have been an employee
good,"Coworkers were a blast to work with, always someone with a joke, or story. Managers were always concerned with everyone being safe, and all items being on the shelves for customers."
good,"Lugar para aprender día a día, formándose como un profesional"
good,Walmart is a good place to work especially if you are a people person management was at times hard to deal with but overall decent good hours good benefits very productive
good,"Everybody had a job and they did them promptly and correctly, the leadership was a little crude but nothing extremely wrong to say about them."
good,"Good Hours, Good Pay Rate. The People you work with are friendly and welling to help out. If your a big talker then this is job for because everyone that comes in your line wants to talk no mater what it is."
good,"overall, it was good working there. They often gave us free food on our breaks. They also had an employee discount card that was very helpful. Hours were flexible"
good,If you've done well you get a raise every year on your hiring anniversary but unfortunately because there are so many managers they don't always have the same idea in mind of what needs to be done.
good,•	Assessed the customer needs and responded to questions they had for me. Cleaned and straightened work area. Worked overtime shifts during busy periods.
good,"Working at Wal Mart was very enjoyable. All of my fellow employees were very kind and helpful. I worked during the overnight shift, so putting groceries in their specified locations was not difficult at all."
good,The most enjoyable part working at Walmart is that I can bright a customer day even though they having a bad and need a smile on their faces.
good,"Fast pace environment, excellent benefits, a lot of cultural and diversity, Walmart gives back to its community they do a lot of fundraising for CHKD. this company is easy to move up in, you will definitely work with others. the hardest part is dealing with all different types of personality and not being able to be train on how to deal with other strong personalities. The most I enjoyed was meeting a lot of people and friends. I loved working as a sales associate you handle all types of products and all different types of claims and inventory."
good,"Walmart has good management and pay, although they give people full time hours but don't give full time benefits. Being a store standard means working outside walking around whether its freezing or burning out, but in the winter you are offered free hand warmers which is nice."
good,"Trabajo rutinario y con personal externo a las empresas,y el equipo de trabajo muy ordenado y trabajadores."
good,"my seasonal position was nice, co-workers were ok, mainly kept to myself off work floor, management was alright, supervisors were nice people."
good,I have grown old with the corp. But I must say that it is a good first job I would recommend to all try wal-mart at least one time in your life. It's work place
good,"Grato ambiente laboral."
good,I helped cashiers and customers with their needs. Management would be there to help when you needed them. And the work overall was very easy and you could always keep busy.
good,Walmart is a good place to work  it just the Manger you get will good or will he /she be mean to you but I like Walmart it needs more Security Like in a car outside were I live the Walmart there don't have them well some don't .
good,"I think I work at one of the most laid back and wonderful Walmarts in my area. I don't want to leave it, but I need to work somewhere closer to where I live. That's how much I enjoy it. The people there are pleasant."
good,"Everyday started out the same, come in, prepare the bread and donuts, then bake them off. Get everything onto the sales floor in a timely manner and make sure you clean as you go. It was tough adapting to a fast paced environment although I have grown to prefer it. My co-workers were a blast to work with and I enjoyed the flexible schedules the most about this job."
good,I like the way that they have to work and show other the rules and they way to work. The ways that the employees have to grow. And the different options to be better.
good,Overall a good company to work for. They offer a lot of resources to help employees grow and develop careers. Computer based learning is available and very helpful.
good,Awesome work place to work in. If you know about cell phones this would be a good place to start out in. Awesome work place.
good,"I learned new job duties as each day went and I kept to my work. Management was good, co-workers were just as good. Hardest part about the job would be if you're feeling sick you still have to throw your weight along with the product you put on the shelfs. The best part of the job was being independent and working on my own and given the chance to work as much as I could."
good,"um ambiente agradável de trabalhar , tive uma experiencia incrível"
good,It was a ok job for the most part except the pay was $300 every two weeks. I learned how to manage my money better and communicate better.
good,Walt wouldn't be to happy with the way its being ran by his family. Personnel office in walmart don't respect their employees either
good,Working at this company gives you many experiences all in one they have multiple positions that everyone would love to do I've done 3 there and plan on going futher with my career.
good,"The store here has gone done in moral in the last 4 yrs. "
good,A typical day at Walmart would require interacting the customers and filling prescriptions. I would sometimes stock shelves and organize things within the Pharmacy.
good,The typical day at Walmart is busy. I have worked there for almost 7 years now and feel like it is time for a chance in environment. My co-workers are great teammates and am proud to work with them. I typically am proud to help anyone I can.
good,"I personal liked it. I worked overnight and everyone was friendly, it is very fast paced. I would have to go to work at 10pm and get out at 7am, i personal liked it."
good,"I am currently working in Walmart (Capilano Mall) ."
good,"I only disliked the job because of the management habit of changed schedule sometimes on a daily basis, other than that it was a good job."
good,"A typical day at work was busy. I learned how to change tires the safest and quickest ways. There was nothing hard about the job. I had pretty good coworkers who were team players. The most enjoyable part of the  job was knowing that the work I did helped someone, even maybe saved their lives or at least their vehicles."
good,My favorite part about working at Walmart was my co-workers but I was often understaffed and it made things difficult. A few of the managers weren't very good at helping those under them.
good,The staff is always friendly and so are most of the customers. There is always something to do which helps your day go by swiftly.
good,"There are many different department opportunities to grow within the company, from a cashier, automotive, sales floor associate to a store director. Depending on the individuals preference"
good,"Trabajé muy cómodo, en un ambiente cordial, tenía el almuerzo gratis. "
good,"Walmart as a whole is a great company. A typical day is both boring and stressful. I have learned to make sure i'm courteous to everyone, customers and co-workers. Management seems lost most of the time like there isn't any communication. The hardest part of the job is honestly setting a modular. The activity of doing isn't the actual hard part. It gets hard when the people that send them to you work have made it very difficult to fit the product they want in the allotted area."
good,Learned a lot about retail and how to work well with others. Got a good flow with the inventory system and how to keep track of stock p. Making sure the customer is happy
good,Great company to work for. Enjoyed all of the 5 years that I worked for. Would recommend everyone to get a feel of customer you will need great customer skills foe every job you apply.

good,my work day consisted of many things for example stocking milk also yogurt and anything else that had to do with dairy always keeping a good work area and always checking expiration  dates
good,a great place to meet people and create great customer and co-worker relations. Lots of learning opportunities for anyone who is willing to learn and take responsibility of actions.
good,I did have a good experience at Walmart. I wish they had been more flexible with my school schedule. I would probably still be at Walmart were I not asked to choose between work and school.
good,good for college students .part time job only. Good experience for multiple fields in the work force. Great resume builder for first timers
good,Management has improved the work environment over the last year and a half.   Typical day at work is stocking the new product in its home and rearranging the older product to look presentable to the customers
good,I work in a small store. we are always busy but overall it is not a bad place to work. There is always good people to work with.
good,"co-workers can be difficult to work with. "
good,Working for walmart is great.. the staff i work with are an amazing group of people that have helped me learn and grow and to become the employee i am today. The hardest part of the job i find when working in any pharmacy is getting close to patients that later pass on but the best part of my job is coming to work everyday with people i enjoy working with and helping all the patients that we do help! Its a rewarding feeling.
good,"Working for Walmart is ok, you can always tell when people don't want to be there though. The managers will treat you bad just because they know they can. They don't care at all about safety."
good,Great place to work. Great advancement opportunities. Management is good about working with your family/life needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
good,Wal-mart customers are great to provide customer service too. The environment is family like and friendly. The management team was understanding and helpful in providing a safe and productive environment and the co-workers were eager to share many different skills.
good,"It started off pretty dern well, to be completely honest. But they change so much that it seems almost useless to rely on trainin', mostly because as an unloader you don't GET training. They stick ya back there, tell you to ask questions, and leave ya to it, pretty much. That's it."
good,I had a good 2 1/2 years working for the company. The people were great to work with and I would recommend if you want to grow in a company. Great benefits.
good,I learned a lot while working here. I acquired many skills during my three years of working for the company. I have made many advancements in a short amount of time.
good,My experience with Walmart was pretty good its sad I had to leave due to an family emergency but I would definitely work in retail again. It was a very good experience I have had.
good,"Great place to start your career. You will work hard for your pay, but its a good stepping stone to bigger and better things."
good,"Working at Walmart was a great experience where I learned to deal with a variety of customers which will help me in the future. It also opened doors for me for any future jobs, because the work experience at Walmart will help me get jobs at other retail places."
good,"Pulled pallets a lot, stocked shelves, binned overstock merchandise. There were a lot of other associates, some of which were harder workers than others."
good,"Always fast paced coming into work, I learned how to operate different machinery and devices. Hardest part is keeping up and making sure you stay productive and meet the production goals. Co-workers are helpful and are willing to help you if needed. Overall good place to work but you have to be determined and hardworking to succeed at this job."
good,"no problems it was a ok place to work we got breaks, we got understanding, and a it was friendly, there are some thingsa that could have made it better but overall ok"
good,"They could make their places  cleaner, more sanitary,and the employees higher pay, and make it more welcoming environment to work in."
good,I have loved my job at Wal-Mart for over 20 years now.  They are changing company with today world and have eliminated my job. So I feel now will be the perfect time for me to try something new.
good,I Android working for Walmart and try pink eye and strep throat I had to resign from my job because I was continuously getting sick
good,Great for floating pharmacists who has a flexible schedule and can pick up shifts that are beneficial for both parties.
good,"Hay ocaciones en las que el trabajo por si solo es suficientemente estresante, pero me da mucha gratificacion cuando una persona me sonrie y me da los buenos dias, buenas tardes o bunas noches, de vez en cuando por la presion a veces los supervisores exigen algo, pero es por el mismo trabajo"
good,"Walmart is overall a great place to work.  They promote from within, but seem to have certain clicks that choose people based on friendships/relationships instead of most qualified for the positions.  The benefits are above average.  They match 6% of your 401k."
good,"Walmart was a decent place to work. I met a lot of good people, both coworkers and customers. That is what I miss the most. I learned a lot from my tiime there, especially how to supervise others. The hardest part of the job was when it wasn't busy as I like to stay busy. The easiest part of the job was helping others with great customer service."
good,Having the freedom to lead eight workers on my crew gave me a chance each night to see all sides of customer service.  From scheduling to making sure the equipment was working.  This is one  job I learned to respect
good,"The heavy workload teaches employees the value of working together to achieve immediate and long term goals. Joining the management team greatly improved my communication, problem solving and motivational skills. The most satisfying part of the job was building productive relationships. The orderly environment we created consistently met the needs of customers."
good,"Daily routines were ever changing due to the fact that I was working in a new facility. The work can be physically draining at times, but also rewarding."
good,"typical day at work was stocking merchandise and helping customers find what they needed. Overal an amazing place to work but due to short hours and bills to pay I was unable to stay here! I would for sure reccomd this place to anyone looking for a job, just wasn't a good fit for me."
good,"Four years at Walmart were enjoyable. I learned so much from the management staff. After only a few months I was able to move up from an ICS team member into a Department Manager position all thanks to the management team. A typical day at work always started with an associate meeting  keeping us informed of what was going on with the store and any special things going on with other associates. My day would then go to customer service and making sure all outs were filled. If needed I would jump on a register to help shorten lines and then get right back to handling freight and counting outs for order. Whatever special projects that needed to be done in my department or helping others was always next. Always keeping our customers needs taken care of first and for most, My co workers were generally as helpful when it came to stocking and taking care of customers. I do believe the hardest part of my job was having to have a co worker written up. I would handle it as needed and keep my composure but never really liked having to perform that task. The most enjoyable aspect of my time with Walmart had to be looking at a task I had completed and not only seeing but hearing the job was well done,"
good,"WaMart has been a good employer but I am looking for a position that will utilize my training in electrical technology. Staff is pleasant.  and I like the physical aspects of my work since I like to stay in shape."
good,it is a very good place to begin but however it is not the best place to go forward in your life. Temporary place to work for anyone trying to go to school and work.
good,I enjoyed the people i worked directly with on my shift but third shift supervisors would come in and boss us around when we are trying to get 2nd shift work done. When i agreed to work i was told my schedule would be from 2-11 and maybe some overtime. I took that as maybe 1-2 hrs over every once in a while. I worked for the company for 1 month and went home early once. Most nights it was almost one in the morning.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work. Starting pay is 9 dollars an hour, and within the first six months can move up to 10 dollars an hour. Everyone works together to get the job done. The management team is willing to help you any way they can."
good,"A typical day involved pushing carts and helping customers with their groceries. I learned how to interact with customers and lift heavy objects safely, plus working as a team with my co-workers. The management was fair and efficient. My co-workers were usually a good help. The hardest part of the job was working in the heat or cold. The most enjoyable part was the simplicity of cart pushing."
good,Overnight work is much smoother than day work due to the lack of customers in the store. Task are not hard to accomplish and management does a good job at providing help if needed. Not recommended for a person with family. Progression is very dependent on availability.
good,You will learn to adapt to your surroundings quickly. It is a fast pace environment.  Your co-workers are your best teachers. Your hours do vary but it's nice to have a hour lunch.
good,Walmart is a great place to work. Meeting new people everyday and I enjoyed working retail. Friendly staff and customer service.
good,I had fun there the co-workers make it a fun environment to work in and the customers are wonderful people . I learned to work harder and be more efficient. Management is horrible and unfair.
good,"working in menswear I put out new stock, assisted in price changes, customer service. I also helped answer the stores switchboard and paged for phone calls. I ensure my area was clean and there was nothing on the floor, and took part in the stores safety sweep for loss prevention and checking for hazards in my area."
good,"It's customers that make jobs at Walmart suck, they destroy everything, they're disrespectful, but the company itself isn't so bad."
good,"Your Typical retail job my position was cashier and that's all I did. They expect your cash drawer to never be short, they will discipline you for mistakes and compliment you when your doing well. I don't know much else because as I said I was only a cashier so my job never left the registers."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for with a lot of opportunities to grow . They are real flexible with your schedule and try to work with you. A typical day at work includes stocking, folding, and helping customers. I learned how to work with people from different backgrounds, how to deal with difficult customers, and how to be helpful in every aspect. "
good,management needs improvement they never have or take out time for their trouble employee's even thought they claim they do.
good,"Working at Wal-mart was the best decision I made for just starting out in life. It pays well, friendly workplace, and is flexible with college schedules. On a typical day at work, Wal-mart is never the same. Everyday is always different. What I have learned working at Wal-mart is time-management, being organized, multitasking, how to treat customers and employees professionally. The Management at Wal-mart is a pretty steady team. The associates are very hard workers and most are very kind and helpful. The hardest part about my job is the scheduling and flexibility they have with associates have kids. The most enjoyable part of my job is the associates."
good,Safety is evaluated and emphasized consistently. Very competitive benefits package and retirement. Employee oriented and co-workers are great.
good,"As long as one knows the company handbook and is willing to follow those rules, Walmart as a company is not bad to work for."
good,A great place to work and the people are easy to get along with.Everyday a challenge and everyday a different  outcome.Working with all types of customers and meeting their individual needs is very satisfying.
good,"Working as an unloader and mechandise sorter at Walmart has shown me how to work hard and get the job done in not only efforts of myself, but also as a team with co-workers in an efficient manner."
good,"very fast-pace, right from the get go in the morning. after the morning stretch people will take off to their equipment to be the first one orderfilling."
good,my typical day at work was very repetitive. i learned  how to adapt to the customers needs. the management was alright a little unfair. my co-workers were fun to be around. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upset costumers. the enjoyable part of my job was when i got to see all my favorite co-workers and costumers.
good,"busy and stressful at times, but learned a lot form shoppers and being help to help those in need and unknowingly how to shop for their household, I learned that Wal-Mart honored comp shopping from other competitive. Hard nothing and most enjoyable was working at self check out."
good,"•	Processed and verified checks and cash for deposits, pay bills, and wiring money. "
good,"Working at Walmart was a productive and clean job, my co-workers were very friendly and kind to others. Management kept a good pace going and made sure all work was done on time. A typical day at work was quite and fast paced."
good,My experience at walmart was good. i loved my job i learned everything there is to know. the only reason i left was because i got a better career opportunity
good,"It's a very nice place to work at. I enjoy serving our customers. I learned a lot so far such as how to slice meat and cheese, and what I enjoy most about working in the deli is cooking."
good,Until February 2016 I was really not liking my job very well. Then I started at the neighborhood market and the moral went through the ceiling. Management actually gave a hoot about its employees and let them know every day. Included every part of the store in store meetings not just out ling areas of the store. Then my daughter fell ill and the FMLA sucks! Even though the doctor put dates she was seen that wasn't good enough. I had to file many times before it was approved then it wasn't approved for everything I had to take her to so I was let go.
good,"Coworkers were pleasant to work with and very helpful. Long breaks were nice so I did not feel rushed to get through a break. I found it interesting to get along with customers, and to meet new people. There are codes to remember for help but luckily they keep everything a cashier would need at the register to help."
good,"Given opportunities to continue to move up in the company.  Relocation for advancement available.  Long hours, but compensation was fair."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for, you get more than enough training. The only thing I did not enjoy was not having a set schedule."
good,Everyone is friendly and cares for one another.  Busiest are holidays and the summer.  Lots of changes occur in the stock setup daily
good,An excellent opportunity for future growth and learning experience. A good company for career. Very supportive staff and helpful attitude.
good,"Come in at 2 pm, work by myself till 11 pm. "
good,The store I worked in was not of high quality like most superstores. I was the every-man. The guy that ran around fixing what years of neglect had ruined and within my first two months i managed to fix the problem at its source.
good,walmart is an okay place to work great benefits with your 401k the environment is very warm. there are some bad apples but that is life by its self for real would not reccomend this job to anyone
good,"Show up for the beginning brief, clock in. Go to your station get your work started take lunch on time.  Clean up your area when its time to go, clock out and go home."
good,"A typical day at work has a lot of laughs and fun, co-workers are great; most of the managers are great and a pretty easy job."
good,Responsible for sorting and loading to weight specifics. Also loading securely so freight stays securely until it has reached its destination.
good,"This job is nice to work at, its not a hard job to do but the bad thing about it is when its summer, it gets super hot. The management is good and people are fun to work with."
good,I actually liked my job actually like my job.  The timing to get off was perfect.  It started to get stressful when I ended up with high blood pressure.  I now have medicine to keep me in tact of working my schedule.  I learned a lot about how to read labels and put them in the correct location.  The hardest part was capping the bins and pulling freight down to make room.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was learning where Items was and I was able to direct a customer to an item without having to look down each aisle.
good,"Nice customer happiness focused philosophy, some times hard to be followed by the whole crew. If you are a very nice person and want a place were you can meet and greet people everyday, this is your place. The store is beautiful and full of great challenges daily."
good,Getting to know about Canadian work culture.Interacting with different people.Work with integrity.Co-operative and concerned colleagues and supervisors help work more efficiently and at pace.
good,The managment is bad. The csm's are very disorganized. They play a racial view and are hateful to employees. The store owner gets in the employees face.
good,"I believe this is a starter job for somebody right out of school or somebody still in school. "
good,"Walmart Stock Associate Job Description & Interview. An entry-level job title, the position of Walmart stock associate involves moderate-to-heavy labor. Primary job duties may include loading and unloading shipments, organizing backroom spaces, constructing displays, and stocking shelves."

good,Walmart was a good place to work and allowed you to move up the company or different departments. With a different variety of people to work with each shift.
good,A day as an employee at walmart can make you laugh and cry all in the same day. the most enjoyable thing of working at walmart is that you get a chance to meet tons of new people everyday.

good,"I have chance to meet a lot of different people"
good,"it was an ok place to work, did not always communicate well with employees, high turn over.  co-workers where friendly. required a lot of standing. Customers where very rewarding."
good,"It was always fun getting to see numerous people throughout the day. Management could be better. Days are usually fast paced, when we stay busy."

good,it was ok. I didn't like the hours so I quit. I did not talk to any of my co workers. The hardest part of my job was working nights.
good,"Je faisais l'emploi de gérante de rayon sans faire les horaires des employés, je faisais le marchandisage des tablettes, les changements de prix, la cuisson de différents produits (poulet, frites, doigts de poulet,,,,) Je remplissais les registres de contrôle de la qualité et de la salubrité. Je contrôlais les températures des réfrigérateurs à toutes les deux heures au départ et ensuite deux fois par jour. Je m'occupais de l'hygiène et de la salubrité de mon département (lavage des tablettes, lavage de la vaisselle, des comptoirs,,,,) J'avais quand même une base dans la compagnie, car au départ j'étais caissière dans le même magasin. J'avais également fais mon cours d'hygiène et de salubrité à l'école, ce qui m'a aider à remplir les registres et voir au bon fonctionnement de la propreté et de la cuisson des aliments. Mon gérant adjoint était mon collaborateur. Si j'avais quelque difficulté que ce soit je pouvais m'y référer en tout temps. L'aspect le plus difficile était le manque de travail en équipe. L'aspect le plus positif était que j'étais fière de ce que j'accomplissais au cours de ma journée de travail."
good,"My overall experience at Shell was pretty good.  Despite some things that were going on there it was an overall great place to work.  Customers were great, great manager, good flexibility, easy tasks."
good,I LOVE THIS JOB. The day was mostly steady while on the weekends were a bit more busy but nothing i couldn't handle. Ive learned to be very multitasking during hectic circumstances and giving Great customer service. i love helping people and having the satisfactory of happy customer.
good,"Cash Office:I posted cash and checks for the day's sales, reset register bags for next shift, balanced register reset wall, transferred funds and finalized the day's sales. Stocker: assisted with customer inquires about merchandise, stocked shelves in various departments and maintained inventory control. I learned how to stock shelves and learned how to work in cash office. The hardest part of the job was lifting merchandise of 50 pounds. The enjoyable part was making new friends."
good,Walmart was a great first job! I learned so much and my team leaders helped instill into me a healthy work ethic and a sense of what it truly means to be apart of a team.
good,"Desarrollo en interacción con el cliente, cortes de caja, ayuda a los compañeros de trabajo de otras áreas."
good,"Honestly Walmart is a decent place with decent people. I enjoyed working there for the most part. Management in my store was very intelligent and helpful, my co-workers were great people that were easy to get along with. The worst part in my opinion is the micromanagement from the Walmart home office, to the point of not giving the store management any form of say in attendance, that is all decided by the computer. With that being said overall it is a great place to work, with good benefits if you choose after your first year."
good,"I am always on my feet, there was never a moment I was bored. I worked with an awesome team of co-workers which made my day goes faster."
good,Walmart is energetic and fun while always keeping things interesting to learn more. You are put in a position to always challenge yourself while at the same time improving on your character and well being.
good,"Walmart was a good first work experience for me. My co-workers were great, and i learned a lot about customer service. The only major issue I had was that my chest collapsed when I was on cash, and i asked the manager to call me a taxi to the hospital. and I was told that i looked fine and i was exaggerating. but as it happens, when i got to the hospital, my lung was 20% collapsed. I had to take a lot of time off work and it sucked. but otherwise Walmart was a great job and i had a lot of fun and made some great friends."
good,"It's really depending on the store you at. I was working on Wallisville Rd and my supervisor was not understanding but was constantly asking to sleep with me. I transferred to Wilson Rd and I enjoyed their store better than the first one. The managers are understanding but the only thing they want is for you to communicate with them. 10percent discount is really not good enough but my salary, I was satisfied with."
good,"Learned a lot while I was their, grew professionally. Management could've trained employees better from the start. Communication could have used some work but overall it was ok."
good,"Let me start off by pointing out the obvious. Walmart is a giant corporation. As such, experiences vary extremely and almost exclusively depend on your individual store environment and culture. I've been pretty lucky in that regard. I had some great salaried managers (and a few not so great ones). I moved up and got several raises (in addition to the yearly performance raises). They always worked with my school schedule, which allowed me to work full time and go to school full time."
good,Enjoyed the experience. Really enjoyed some of the people I worked with. Didn't work there very long though. You get to see a ton of different people daily. The shifts were kind of all over the place though. Sometimes you would work nights until 1am and then have to be back the next day at 6 am
good,productive workplace to start a career at managers sometime let power go to their heads co workers are nice but their also lazy ones
good,was a good job good pay decent hours and benefits. went in clocked in knew what I had to do went to sporting goods. helped customers find what they needed to find and rang them up.

good,"A typical day at work, consists of being understaffed...as usual....management is difficult for any manager due to the many policies, procedures, ....on going and ever changing...."

good,"A typical day at work is unloading the freight truck, stocking the shelves, and helping customers."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty normal. I learned how to help customers with different concerns that they had, returns, money grams, etc. The hardest part of the job was definitely on holidays when the store was constantly busy."
good,"Assist customers in their shopping experience, take care of returns, make sure the aisles in my department were neat and organized, bin overstock items."
good,"The hardest part about this job was the management. Very unorganized, didn't hire enough help which made doing our job harder because of being under staffed. Did not know their boundaries as a professional."
good,typical day-stocking shelves any which way possible with a lot of customer service. Great co-workers to work with. I would fix on hands and order fill the empty spots on the shelf. If any items were in the backroom I would pick them out of the back and fill the shelves with the correct items
good,"trabaja en  esta empres a e ha dado muchas ventajas y a la vez aprendí mas cosas de lo que podía aprender en lo de mercadeo y administrativo."
good,working in retail is always fun. you get to meet all kinds of people. some better than others. Walmart is a good company to work for. good people to work with.
good,"Typical day is all day on your feet, nonstop speed walking! I worked on the IMS team.. I am a tiny female so they had me lifting heavy boxes and carrying them up ladders. I asked for 4 months to be transferred to a different department but they told me know because I was good at what I did."
good,A typical day at work included tons of hard work from cleaning to stocking shelves. I will say I had some fun times during my shift with my fellow co-workers.
good,"No creces fácilmente en la empresa, y aveces es mucha carga de trabajo  ya que aveces solo se queda una persona por departamento y el salario es muy bajo"
good,"Fun and enjoyable place to work  It is always busy and it is nice to speak and communicate with customers as they come through the check-out lines.  Most of my co-workers were very nice and worked together as a team. The management team are micro-managers which demonstrates that they do not have any confidence in the cashiers and their abilities to act independently while working. Sometimes this makes your job a little challenging, especially when you are a leader and you demonstrate and act as a leader as you are productive while doing your job throughout the day."
good,"> Pela experiencia que tive no walmart, tive grandes oportunidades de crescimento profissional. A escolha por ter uma experiencia na indústria se deu para adquirir mais conhecimentos dos ""dois lados da mesa""."
good,"A typical day for me was never the same as the day before. As a cashier, I'd go to my assigned register and check out all the customers that come through my lane. As a Grocery Associate, I'd do what my managers wanted me to do for that current day."
good,"working as a Walmart night stocker was a pretty cool job , I got my work done and locked up the place , had a couple of people I enjoyed working with too., there wasn't no hard part of the jo all you have to do is stay dedicated"
good,In my short time with this company I was able to grow my career.  However since I did not go to school for this I choose to go to leave.
good,"Good Management, Awesome workplace, Good hourly wages, respectful scheduling, respectful employees, great customer hospitality,"
good,This is a nice place to work. Fast passed and a good routine with the occasional new task to do. Friendly management and nice coworkers.
good,Work was really fun and enjoyable.I learned a lot about working as a team and by myself. My coworkers gossiped all the time. That was the only con. The hardest part of the job was being away from home. The most enjoyable part was learning!!!
good,Wal-mart has a very understanding attendance policy and provide employees with a store discount on nearly all merchandise.
good,"If you like repetitiveness in the workplace this is the job for you. Respectful employees and long service within the company. A lot of older employees and set in their ways, but most are easy to get along with."
good,"En este empleo me brindaron la oportunidad de continuar con mis estudios."
good,"Customers and Coworkers are strange but it is Walmart.Pay is minimal, you are expected to cross train in other departments"
good,"Wal-Mart is a good company to work for if interested in customer service.  There are opportunities to develop social skills, customer service skills, and they even offer tuition programs for college students."
good,"It was a very productive place to work and it always kept you busy, but the work environment wasn't always the best and there was some racial issues."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. I was cashier at the Cleveland Walmart a while back. I also worked in Athens as a grocery stocker and maintenance. I loved who I worked with, and the customers as well. I learned that customers always come first. The hardest part was working in the makeup area because I wasn't familiar with it.  the most enjoyable part was helping out customers."
good,I loved working at walmart.. I would still be there if it wasn't for personal reasons.. The people and management there was amazing.
good,"It's a nice place but needs improvement with management. "
good,I learned how helpful you can be to others.. I learned how hard it is to put things in the wrong spot when I go to Walmart I see I need to keep things I'm place.
good,I thought this was a good place to work. I learnd how to work well with others. I stared out as just a stocker and quicly moved up.
good,"- Great opportunity to gain customer service skills"
good,There are associates who don't know how to mind their own business and who start fights and tell management lies to try and get me into trouble. The manager I have isn't doing anything about it and all i'm being told is to deal with it. I want a different job because of it.
good,Working at Walmart is something I never saw myself doing but I'am glad I did. It's a great experience for young adults because you get to adapt new skills and learn new things everyday.
good,"My night job at Wal-Mart was overall decent.Not too fun yet not too hard. Grew more experience with my customer service and began to learn how to be a cashier for the first time. Nice times with coworkers although not everyone was a strong team member all the time, making teamwork one of the hardest parts of the job .I do  not really have an opinion on the management. The most enjoyable part of the nights were usually the slower nights, allowing for more of an easier night, because most nights could be rough, so the low freight nights were good."
good,consistent activity helping customers with all needs but walmart is a very organized company who hass very good benefits for employees.
good,Good business to build many skills. A friendly environment that makes you want to come to work everyday. Good company that is all about making the customers happy.
good,"You have to work a lot considering the pay is minimum. Also booking off days is never guaranteed and must be done 4 weeks in advance. The breaks are nice even tho you cant decide when you take them. Some customers are nice and some aren't. It's a job, you just have to give it you 100% not matter what."
good,"Performs cleaning maintenance in all rooms  restrooms,locker rooms, windows, mop wax floors,  provides assistance to staff and visitors as necessary"
good,"I really enjoyed this position. I loved that there was always something to do when business slowed down. The customers were interesting. The regular ones were very engaging. Environment was productive and it was a great experience. The hardest part of the job was when customers would come to your counter and lie and say that they gave you more money than what you put in the drawer. They would curse you out trying to pull a fast one. A typical day was coming to work, greeting the customers, and listening to their stories. I learned how to ignore silly people. Management took care of the register when the customers changed their minds. The co-workers  were good. we got along well. I learned to continue to look on the good side of every situation."
good,"If you work overnight, they will pay you 1 dollar extra.  However, it will create a lot of trouble if you are also a full-time student."
good,If you are looking for a fast pace environment while meeting new people this will be a great place. Advancement is up to you but fairly easy to accomplish.
good,working here was a fast paced job. management did there best to help customers and employees. the co-workers did there jobs. the best part was helping customers in need.
good,Management needs more training on working with employees and customers. There should be a work standard set in place with Walmart.
good,Worked there three years was an great experience friendly workers. Management could have more respectful an reasonable. Over all great experience.
good,I feel as if I was not moving anywhere with this career so I felt that it was best for me to move on and find a better career.  Although working for this company was a new experience than when I last worked for Wal-Mart.
good,working with customers to provide what they wanted and needed was enjoyable most of the time. management was pretty good most of the time. at times it was stressful because when projects due by a certain date not met because they needed you to work in other areas of the store.
good,"Walmart believes in all Cultural. Great company for advancements. My fellow employees and co-workers became  part of my family. "
good,"Salarios baixos. pouca valorização dos colaboradores, muito treinamento e pouca pratica dos mesmos."
good,"Walmart Disribution was a great workplace in my opinion. As my 1st job, they were very welcoming and family oriented. There aren't many times in a day where there isn't ant work to be done, you stay busy at all times which makes you day fly by."
good,"Nothing really to review. The pay is good, the benefits are great and the people are good, however expectations have been set rather high."
good,I enjoyed the principled work environment. The corporate culture lent itself to a fun yet structured environment that was easy to work within and keep a fun atmosphere.
good,"The job is fairly easy just stocking shelves in departments, working nights can be hard but I handle it really well and still have a good work/life balance.Co-workers and managers are easy to get along with and make the job easier to handle. There is quite a bit of physical labour and that is the hardest part of the job."
good,I was working here for only 5 months and they were talking about advancing me up to management in the near future. They acknowledged my hard work and dedication.
good,"I enjoyed my job in produce. I got to work with friendly people, had a manager that worked with me when I needed time off for school, but still got around 40 hours a week."
good,"I like the management , and the like me and love my work but the problem is if your too good at your job they will not let you transfer to another department to learn new skills and possible advancement."
good,Grew with the company while I was there. I started as a parking lot attendant and was promoted to produce clerk inside of the store.
good,"Working for Walmart I definitely learned alot. I learned how to really in depth keep track of inventory and how to place orders for more merchandise. I worked with alot of people and most of them were great, like with most jobs. What I did not care for from this job was when I got switched to overnight stocking. The stocking and pulling freight was not the issue but working overnights was most definitely."
good,Its an ok place to work. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and had a great manager to work with. I would recommend this job if you are just needing a job. They will hire you.
good,easy going managers and flexibility with scheduling/ I personally worked at the customer service desk and the managers really had your back and showed support when needed
good,I worked at WalMart for 3 years. I personally feel as though Wal-Mart is more of a stepping stone job instead of career. A typical day is dealing with different types of personalities. Front end supervisors (CSM)hovering over you.
good,i like working anywhere it was good there just not what i would want to do the rest of my life mangers are ok. coworkers are funny and nice.
good,"Hard, laborious work. pay was great and management was pretty good. a lot could be improved upon but it was a good summer job."
good,"Constantly changing management and sometime stressful but overall a great place to be."
good,"Typical work day was hectic, But having a strong management team and exceptional worker's made it all worth while, As a Manager(supervisor) My team and I got along great and production and sales increased,My greatest accomplisment was learning to be a Manager"
good,Enjoyed coming to work when Mr Walton ran the company. Enjoyed working with most of my co-workers. Worked long hours over the holidays and during inventory.
good,A typical day at work consisted of loads of phone calls and a lot of communicating. I was well managed by people who were always on top of things and made sure the job always got done. My co-workers and I got along very well and became very close over time. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with new people.
good,"A typical day at work for Wal-Mart is very fast paced and very productive. I learn how to work in a professional environment. Management have consideration for employees and the work place. Additionally, co-workers are always energetic and driven in the workplace. Wal-Mart does not have a routine schedule and is very fast paced for some people this can be the hardest part when working for Wal-Mart. However, Wal-Mart is always energetic and enjoyable to work."
good,"My typical day of Walmart consisted of working in dry grocery, however scheduling and daily itineraries were consistently containing errors. Management at this specific Walmart were not organized at all, however co workers were very helpful in terms of assisting and helping new employees."
good,A typical day at work was actually fairly busy. It was a lot of work at times but I did learn more about photography and cameras and I really enjoyed that part of it. I learned that the customers needs always come first but to stand up for yourself in the most professional way possible so that you don't loose your job over an unhappy customer. The hardest part was keeping my emotions in check when I felt attacked by a customer and also when it got really busy sometimes I found that overwhelming. The management was not overly great. At first things were okay but I had personal experience with the manager at my store and it was not pleasant to be around her at times. She referred to herself as my elementary school bully so that says enough on its own. My other co workers were fantastic. I loved working with a few of them and I do miss being around them since I do not work there anymore.
good,"Wal-mart was a really good company to work for although every company has it up and downs. i felt disrespected by the assistant manager, so i currently don't work their"
good,The position I held at Walmart (cashier) was fine. Besides the ridiculous expectations of SPH (scans per hour) and the constant angry customers.
good,"I actually enjoyed working at walmart and had little problems with catching on so quick and If it was a better time in my life then id probably still be working there today. I learned how to stock and unload merchandise replenish stock, safety rules, to be attentive to your work area and acquired good customer service skills. For the most part the managers were very friendly and fair. The hardest part of the job was the machine we used to clock in because it didnt work properly but thats the only thing that gave me a problem. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and keeping up with my work."
good,It is a great stable job. You learn how to really deal with the public. Things in the company dont always make sense but it teaches you how to learn on the fly and deal with problems as they come.
good,Working with numerous customers on a daily basis allows one to generate diverse ideas in company opportunities.  Large format stores allow for many different challenges to be presented daily.
good,"They have a good chance for promotions, fast paced environment. overall good place to work. The managers can be understanding when I problem arises."
good,The work can be hard at times but you have great co-workers to lend you a hand. But Management could use some working on. Very much like high school a lot of gossip
good,"Walmart is a good place to work at, but also difficult. Because it has many workers, this leads to dealing with different types of personalities."
good,"meet a lot of good people learned new things, management was nice ,good pay good hours, good company to work for, theres always room for advancement."
good,"Overall a very beneficial experience. Good balance of daily duties and customer service to keep things busy. Workers are generally kind and friendly which can be inviting for new hires. There was a lot of autonomy which was nice, but at times it felt like we were lacking direction."
good,great benefits with Walmart.  they promote from within.  I went from part time to management with a 2 year period.  Great team oriented atmosphere
good,Working at Wal-Mart is what you make of it.  It can be the worst place or the best place to work.  Your advancements and pay is only limited by how you work and what you put into it.
good,"Each day was busy and pretty easy going. I learned how to answer the phones professionally and how to use the system pretty quickly. Management was good for the most part. They worked with me to help me do my best and were flexible with our schedules. Co-workers were pretty friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part was covering phones, jewelry counter and the fitting rooms all at once to cover someones lunch on a low staffed day. The most enjoyable part was how easy going it was and some co-workers made the work day better and somewhat entertaining. Everyone was smiling and willing to help each other with customers."
good,"In my time working at Walmart I learned many strategies in memorization skills, and how to move at a fast pace when the job requires it. My co-workers were wonderful to be around and brought such an enjoyable atmosphere to work. "
good,Worked here during school and very acceptable when it come to giving time off for school projects and other school related items
good,I feel like walmart did not really care and realize I was a person and more just cared about the work I did. I feel like if the managers and higher ups were more involved with the workers the environment would be great.
good,Brandsmart was pretty much a roller coster. There were days where I loved being there. Then there were days where I didn't. I probably depends on the manager that was there and how they treated you.
good,hours are not stable and have you doing more than just the job they describe you with but overall you receive great experience.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was a great experience I learned alot there. My co-workers were very down to earth and management was also.
good,"Management is wonderful; always willing to help you be successful in your daily endeavors, whether it is to advance in the company of Walmart or balance school and full-time hours."
good,"Every day is a surprise - was it busy or slow that day, would I get waxed into my office for most of the night or not, could I get everything done that I wanted to get done. Some nights I could do more than was expected of the overnight associate. Some nights were tough."
good,"A typical day at work started with checking in our higher end phones and checking that they were all there, also helping customers with the issues they have. I learned how to set up phone contracts with different companies. Management was helpful and nice. My co-workers were very nice and were very helpful."
good,"Walmart got me introduced to retail. Your typical day at work will be learning the level of the food chain you're on, doing returns, and learning company policy. I liked it, as there's a lot of opportunities to make someone's day and help them find the perfect product. It's hard to do monotonous tasks, but overall rewarding. Great open-door policies and sometimes donuts!"
good,"Family oriented place of employment, Co-workers, managers very awesome people. All around GREAT place of employment"
good,Staff and management and friendly and easy to work with provided you do your job. Hours were very decent for students as they were quite flexible
good,"Walmart challenges an employee to be productive and develop useful interpersonal skills needed not only on the job, but in all aspects of life. There is seldom a dull moment working for this company."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at Walmart. On a typical shift I would be in charge of restocking the department or departments I was assigned to for that day. My co-workers at Walmart were all very hard working and were very easy to get along and work with.
good,Ce travail m'a permis de perfectionner mon service à la clientèle et d'avoir plus confiance en moi pour prendre certaines décisions.
good,"Fast paced, hard work. Got sick from a broken pallet giving me a splinter, and with the strain it put on my back and wrists, I decided it wasnt for me."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of routine procedures that had to be carried out daily. As a department manager, I had ensure that price changes were done on time, trailer listings were checked for shortages, the department had to be stocked with merchandise, and my customer service skills were put to the test everyday. I acquired a vast amount of knowledge working for this company. Over the past 10+ years, I grew as a person gaining patience, understanding, and exemplary customer service skills that have helped me in all aspects of my life. The management was approachable and helpful, yet close-minded. The coworkers understood each other, and made the atmosphere comfortable. By far, the hardest part of the job was standing for 7+ hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the everyday customers, and being appreciated by them for all the hard work I did."
good,If you are needing a job this place is not too bad of a place to start working for. Some people even make a career out of it. They work well with you if you need to have a fluctuating schedule.
good,"Greeting every customer with a smile and positive attitude. customers is always right no matter the situation. Management always does what is right for customers and associates. Always treat others the way you want to be treated, always give help when needed. Nothing about me job is hard. Meeting new people."
good,Working behind the customer service desk at Walmart has given me a great deal of experience in management. I have been able to pick up a variety of skills to handle customer complaints in many ways. The management team was a great team to work with every shift.
good,"Inventoried, stored, priced and restocked merchandise displays in retail store."
good,Sales driven company that strives to stay on the cutting edge of development. Great opportunity for advancement. Family oriented company.
good,I am a part time cashier at Walmart. I was not able to travel due to my circumstances so i joined Walmart in 2015 so i could stay close to home.
good,"Unloaded products from trucks and built pallet at the same time. Pull pallets to designated area. Then pull pallets to the sales floor, open pallets and stock shelves."
good,"Working at the courtesy desk i have learn the ins and outs of the wal-mart corp."
good,"It was an enjoyable experience working at Walmart. Great staff and environment, dealing with customers can be difficult but working here has helped me learn how to deal with customers in certain situations. It's a fast paced environment so multi-tasking is a must as well as being able to remember codes and deals going on."
good,"A empresa em questão é muito boa de se trabalhar, desde que você tenha superiores competentes, pois na questão de conforto, assistência, auxilio, benefícios a empresa ajuda e muito seus associados.."
good,surcharge de temps et de travaille très négatiffe au près des employer .
good,The most thing i enjoyed about this job was the fact it was quiet and spaced out. I enjoyed the supervisors and the customers. We would always have a good time or conversations
good,"As this was my first ""factory"" type job it gave me an insight on how fast pasted production lines work. Once the products were sorted it was my job to package them away for shipping. This allowed me to see how freight worked from behind the scenes."
good,Walmart has a lot of job options from sales to different levels of management. I enjoyed meeting new people and helping customers.
good,It was fun but there wasnt very much room for advancement. Which is something that I look for in a company. The lack on management presence and involvement was also very aparent.
good,"Most days are fast paced with many duties to complete on a daily bases. l have learned paitence with my job as well as my people skills. Management has worked with me on one to one bases with hours and days to work. I believe that I am well liked and respected among those that l work with and those that l take orders from.  Trying to meet my deadlines, meeting my deadlines."
good,very detailed job. i knew what was expected from me and what my role was. gain a lot of experience working with this company

good,"great pay, busy work environment need great customer service skills. you have the opportunity to get 30+ hours per work."
good,"Productive and fun place to work with great employees."
good,Walmart is a big company who looks after its employees. Walmart worked around my schedule as a student. Management was also great and worked well together.
good,I learned that it is important to listen to others and communicate. I thoroughly enjoyed working with most of the people there. They are like family at times. It can be great.
good,"Walmart was an enjoyable place to work. The night hours stretched much longer than clock would suggest. Without a good crew it would have been very difficult to make it through those more difficult nights. "
good,Not everything about Walmart is bad.  There are good associates and good management.  Some are better than others.  Overall pretty good place to work.  Just depends on the attitude you take on.
good,"I learned alot from this job that has helped me become a better employee. From how to talk to customer, help me provide with a better customer service and improve my listening skills as well my attention to detail."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work, you learn team work or the lack there of, which ever you choose, The management is bios as you would find anywhere. The best part of the job is at the end of the day when you can look back and see what you have accomplished."
good,I learned how to run a pallet stacker and electric jack. the people that weren't that productive got help. The people that excelled at work got rewarded with more work.
good,Walmart is a great company but your pay doesn't matches your skills and work duties. If it pays more then not only would the customers would be satisfied but the employers as well.
good,"A typical day at work for walmart is very busy . My co workers were wonderful. and the hardest part of the job is dealing with heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part is working with all different kinds of cultures and age groups and dealing with many different types of customers, getting to know people on a personal level as it has taught me more how to deal with people."
good,The one thing I've learned is that the people do make the difference. It's more of a family setting where you work together and get to know co-workers and keep them as part of your extended family. Sometimes works gets tough but you learn to work together and pull together and most of the time you get surprised in how much you can accomplish as a team.
good,"Typical day at work was like a regular cashier's day.  Tend to customers, do amazing customer service.  The only downside to Walmart is I got discriminated against while I was working there while pregnant."
good,I learned a lot of departments and learned management skills. I mat a lot of new friends. Gained a lot of experience for other jobs.
good,"In a typical day at work was very eventful, pleasant and well rounded... I had a great super and the employee's were wonderful to work with."
good,"There is a lot of work to be done in any and all departments at Walmart. "
good,"Accounting, looked up invoices and made sure we got paid was the amount of inventory received at stores and if not then I would have to file claims."
good,"Found this job to be intensely stressful, poor management, pretty much not a care in the world for their employees. If you can handle it and do the job, then make the money."
good,"A typical day involved Stocking Shelves and ensuring the area was cleaned afterwards. After we were done with the job, we sent the boxes to the garbage compactor to be crushed. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, the management could be worked on."
good,you work hard with little or no leadership and the rules change constantly lots of mandatory overtime and lots of benefit changes.
good,Walmart is a good place to work for if you have a great management team or else it will be very stressful. The pay raise was well needed & deserved but not worth it if you are going through stress everyday bc of lack of good managment
good,Large work loads on a nightly basis. Multiple large pallets of products to be restocked every night. Management is usually overwhelmed with work details and mistreat their harder working employees.
good,For this to be my first job as a cashier it was a good experience to learn about the cash register and how to work it. this is a job that requires a lot of patience working with different personalities everyday.
good,"Biggest responsibilities are cleaning bathrooms, sweeping the floors, taking out the garbage, picking up cardboard, shining things, cleaning spills, waxing floors. Things basically that just make the place look better."
good,"Great Company to thrive in and build on your skills. I have been with Walmart almost 9 years, and every day is a new challenge, a new experience."
good,This was an interesting job. I got the opportunity to look at things through other peoples view. It was not a stressful job but always challenging us to improve the photos for the customers.
good,"There have been days where one manager would unload the trucks during the day, but if the dairy cooler or freezer were too full, the manager sometimes would fail to tell the manager coming on duty that there were pallets in other places.Some of our co-workers were lazy or try to get out of doing work just simpy because they didn't want to and sometimes the management would let them get out of work because they were one of their favorites."
good,"Typical day at work consist of clocking in which is fairly simple."
good,"I was stocking merchandise, and older lady asking me where was the dog food. So I showed her were the dog food was.She then ask me could someone help her put the big dog food in car .So then I walk out with her and I put her big bag of dog food in her car. I learned help others makes me feel great. The management and co-workers are just wonderful people to work with in for. The hardest part working at walmart is trying to finished your job and then go do 3 or 4 departments to do other people jobs. I love working at walmart, sometimes they give out free ice cream in that is the best,"
good,Great job all around there is always gonna be good days and bad days at any job but as long as i'm working hard to make money i'm content.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of, returns, exchanges, money orders, money gram, bill payments, separating returned merchandise according to departments, and register resetting. I learned the importance of patients, organizing, and planning to decrease the stress of the workload. Customer Service Managers were diligent with assisting employees with over crowded lanes, and relieving employees for breaks and lunches. My co-workers worked well together. We assisted each other with customer concerns and educated each other on policy and procedures of the customer service department. The hardest part of the job is when co-workers became unreliable, causing the work load to increase. However, I really enjoyed working with the customer service team to close the department. It gave us some time to unwind, talk about our day and share some laughs."
good,era muy lindo llegar al trabajo y que tus compañeros te saluden y reciban muy alegremente aunque a veces lidiar con algunos clientes era difícil pero sabia sobrellevarlo. Lo que mas me gustaba era que mis compañeros y encargado me animaran cuando tenia un día difícil.
good,I loved to help different people and learn about new things. The hardest part of the job is trying to learn everything at one time. but its also a good thing because you get to learn about things yo never learned about before.
good,"El clima laboral d etrabajao es bueno, hay trabajo en equipo"
good,Walmart was a good work place and everybody got along real good. I did not agree with their schedules and work hours. They also had terrible benefits.
good,"I would come in for my shift and count my draw till into my drawer in order to get started for the day. I would check out groceries, clothers, ect..  I reeived payment by cash, check, debit or credit card. At the end of my shift, I would make sure my cash register was cleaned and in order."
good,"Provides flexible schedules and work well with people who also go to school or have other jobs."
good,"fast paced (it was new store); always engaging."
good,a average work day at Walmart involves a lot of merchendice stoking and high demand pace. at the end of the day u must put overstock in the bins in backroom and make sure it accounted for.
good,i found working for Walmart always had a family friendly feel. only thing i did not like was havce to always work weekends
good,Management seems to always be at odds between different shifts and lacks communication with employees on important issues. Also there is not equitable distribution of assigned hours to the part time employees.
good,Great place to start when looking for a job. Gain different skills. Constantly in touch with customers so you learn how to handle different types of situations.
good,"Walmart is built on a classic retail design. Through out my years i was able to acquire numerous skills that made me a desired manager for my store. I consider a great building block to an excellent career. I learned and mastered customer service, money handling, digital inventory systems and working under stressful situations."
good,"I had a good time, meeting new people regularly, helping customers any way I was able. My primary job had me behind a cash register, most days, but I also worked a few other jobs (i.e. gathering shopping carts in the parking lot)."
good,"Working for OSL or walmart wireless has been an absolute blast. That being said the company is constantly telling its employees that they keep breaking records when it comes to project margins, then 3 months later they cut commissions in half so they could break the newest goals. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were the people. The hardest part would have to be the difficult customers. Most days were good days, I learned something new every day that helped me to better assess shoplifters, or those suspected shoplifters. I got along with all my co-workers except for one because of the things he would say to and about female customers. Very unprofessional."
good,I find this to be a good temporary job. Most of the associates have been very helpful and kind. I would work here again if i was in need of a job.
good,The hardest part of the job is keeping calm and patience.  while the customer vents on you about their problems or disappointment in the products.

good,"was at this job for almost two years, started before the store even opened. was crushed when i was let go they have a problem with their management team, but still wish i was there."
good,"Activities included sales management, cashier, consumer complaints, and area clean-up. The hardest part of the job was to address consumer complaints in a reasonable time limit. However, the best part of the job was co-worker adhesiveness."
good,"checking in inventory, help customers with their purchases, clean the department , dispatch out of date product or unusable product"
good,"A typical day of work consisted of unloading freight from the trucks, pulling the freight to the sales floor during the evenings. The remainder of the shift consisted of picking and binning merchandise."
good,"Walmart has a fun work environment with friendly co-workers. Learning the ins and outs of a retail chain, such as how products are organized and displayed for consumers, as well as how product is stored and received, were interesting insights. Renovating and moving the store to a new location was fun as well, finding out how all the shelves and fixtures are assembled and building them myself was a great experience."
good,Good way to build your resume and gain experience in different capacity of being a  customer service position. Depending upon the store you are assigned to will determine how the store manager would like the store to  operate.

good,"Its a O.K "
good,"A normal day is very busy, fast-paced, a lot of co-workers. I've learned a lot just in one year, numerous amounts of medications, insurance issues, customer communication, communication throughout the employees and managers. Management isn't the best, never gave words of encouragement. Hardest part of the job would have had to be when a customers medication wasn't called in correctly by the doctor OR their insurance wasn't paying the full price for their medications. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the different kinds of people you come into contact with everyday, the coworkers you get to know and create a friendship with."
good,"Worked as a Customer Service Manager my day to day work was turning the key for overrides. Sending associates to their lunch/break"
good,"Great management experience, supervising 40+ associates on a nightly basis. Good group of management (individuals) but does not work well as a team. Every has a ""survival"" type of mindset, and is only concerned with their own specific responsibilities"
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-mart when there was enough employees to work the jobs needed to be done. If we were short I would get everyone going faster to complete tasks, but accurately this was on me if things went wrong. Tasks were assigned to different employees."
good,I work the evening shift as a unloader department go in @ 2pm till finish with unloading Walmart truck. I learned how to Stack stock on pallets and pull them to the sales floor to be worked. The co workers and managers were great and friendly. It was a fun and easy learning job.
good,It was a lot of fun and meet a lot of nice people.  Christmas season is extremely busy which makes the shift go by faster.  I would work at another Walmart if there was one closer to where I now live.
good,"I supervise about 30 to 40 employees time ranges from 12 pm to 11 pm. I make sure freight from our daily truck is being executed and stocked correctly. I watch our front end to make sure customers are being handled in a timely manner. I also clean, zone, take calls, answer customer and employee questions."
good,"They offer benefits and a wide arrange of jobs for those that are seeking. They also offer many benefits when other employers don't,"
good,four 10 hour day tuesday thru friday or 3 12 hour days sat thru monday good place for first learning logistics but bad place for advancement good co-workers but not very strong mgmt. more of a popularity contest to get advancement not on how hard you work.
good,"Wal-Mart was a good company to work for, they provided me with the ability to learn new skills and knowledge. Also gave me an opportunity to promote"
good,"É uma empresa sem expectativa de crescimento, não dar valor os trabalhadores tem uma baixa política de qualidade."
good,"Lots of fun energy "
good,"the work schedule is extremely hectic it can change at a minuets notice without any warning and the work can sometimes be extremely difficult but overall the job was reasonable, the managers where great, and when I worked there the people where amazing"
good,"This is a fast paced environment, you work extra long days or nights and it is laborious work with lots of heavy lifting. I truly loved my job."
good,"se trabaja en un ámbito bueno y tranquilo , por eso las ganas de si hay posibilidad es seguir trabajando en ambitos iguales a ese"
good,it has its up and downs. dont trust anyone ever. you will get thrown under the bus just so someone gets ahead. benefits are great. full eye and dental.
good,Its a pleasant job meeting with customers and to satisfy with their requirements. Strive to give best services and make them happy.
good,A typical day at work consists of customer assistance regardless of position held. The hardest part of the job was too much to do with not enough time.
good,"Walmart Supercenter needs to learn how to be more friendly when dealing with customers. Employees were good to employees, but did not have that same attention towards customers. Some employees found a way to cheat on their scans per minute and management did not care. Management needs to be fixed as you have about 4 you report to. I had to go to a different person ever time I needed a day off or a change in schedule."
good,"very fast paced and high volume place to work. great people to work with. minus the few that could ruin anything. but if your looking to have a fast passed job, walmart is your place"
good,"Walmart is an okay place if you are starting out, but now I am looking for something better suited to my lifelong career choice in working with animals. A typical day was always busy and definitely kept you on your toes. Throughout working with Walmart I improved many skills such as communication, math and working in a fast paced environment efficiently. Management was great and a lot of the managers were super nice and extremely understanding. My co-workers were great people and I ended up making a few long-lasting friendships while working there. I would have to say the hardest part of working there was dealing with customers who were angry or upset, sometimes we just can't help them or it may take a little time. The most enjoyable part of the time was also with customers, I love talking to people and creating new bonds. It was an overall fun place to work but more for starting out in my opinion."
good,"you get paid for every minute you work always get lunch and coffee breaks, always treated with respect would work for them again"
good,"Walmart Canada, provided a good working environment to all of its staff and associates. it provided the ability for growth both in and out of the work place. it is a fast pace environment and the most important thing i learned from working here to the ability to adapt efficiently in changing working environments. The hardest part of the job was making sure every customer was happy with the product and services provided. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with people from different works of life daily."
good,Worked in various locations of wal-mart from the backroom to the front cash. Worked very hard to be multi-trained throughout the store to be more of an asset to the wal-mart team.
good,Working for Wal-Mart was very productive. There wasn't a day where work wasn't being done. Everyday was just as productive as the day before.
good,The average day consists of multiple tasks that must be completed while still maintaining the perfect environment for your customers.
good,I was a cashier so keeping my area clean and well stocked. no customers helped others bag items. Working as a well organized team makes the day go by faster and less confusion. Not being able to help a customer find what their looking for. Most enjoyable part was talking to the patrons that came into my line.
good,Working here was really great. You definitely acquire amazing personable skills and learn how to work at a steady pace.
good,"Every day can be different, with new challenges and goals to "
good,"run register, stock shelves with merchandise, remove merchandise from shelves, load and un load trucks. Co workers were very nice and friendly"

good,"picking and bending all backstock merchandise and organization for products coming in and leaving the store. clean warehouse build pallets and organized shipments, documented damaged goods"
good,Training was thorough and learned well. I would arrive about 15 minutes early to be prepared for my shift. I would sign in on the computer and it would let me know where I would be placed out. My co workers were great to work with.
good,"Un buen lugar para trabajar, aunque no hay mucha oportunidad de crecimiento."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo respetuoso y apoyo entre compañeros, trabajo bajo presion y logro de objetivos."
good,"-A typical day would include ringing up customers and answering their questions. Handling returns and cashing checks as well as the transfer of money to different states."
good,During my time at Walmart it was a delight. I would return. They were flexible with my needs. Provided me all the assistance that I needed.
good,A normal day of work was getting what ever forklift you needed required for the job and unloading that trailer onto the warehouse floor . I learned that Walmart is the kind of growing company that offers people opportunity to grow within a company . the hardest part of the job was getting the customers out of the docks on time . The best part of the job was the employs that I worked with because we all had the same goal of getting the job done as a team ..
good,"Walmart has wonderful people and great opportunities to grow, learn and develop a long-term career. Working in the IT division proved to be both interesting and complicated. I felt continually challenged to learn, but the people were very helpful and more than willing to share their knowledge."
good,"Dinâmico."
good,very fast paced and am able to say that i enjoyed my time here starting from the re-model to working at the electronics counter to doing odds and ends around there
good,"A typical work day was running a register, answering questions the customers had and answering the phone, returning merchandise, selling money orders, western union, bill paying."
good,I worked very hard to get to the management position I was in. I supervised about 120 associates on the front end and really enjoyed the associates I worked with. I would say the most difficult part of the job would have been being short staffed due to call-outs.
good,It was a good starting job. I learned much about working in the service industry. The hardest parts were how there wasn't enough time to a lot of daily tasks needed to be done each day.
good,"I worked at this location on two different occasions, both for 8 months. I first worked in the backroom taking inventory on overstock and making it easier to locate items needed on the sales floor. My second time working here I worked on the sales floor as a sales associate. I stocked shelves with new freight brought in every night. I liked the teamwork it taught me and the people that i met."
good,"Worked overnight, very peacful, quiet, worked well in small groups during the renovation process of the company expanding its locations across canada."
good,It was nice at time sometimes the customer can be a handfull it was all about the customers and their well been and you always on your feet always getting pull to a different department to help out and never enough help

A typical day included dead-heading flowers, regular customer service, restocking shelves, cleaning the floor, transporting flowers and plants inside and outside in the parking lot, labeling and putting price tags on products, sending cardboard to the back for the compacter, and checking out customers on occasion. I learned how to work well with a team and accomplish tasks quickly. I would have to say that the management department of the store worked poorly. My co-workers were amazing and always able to give help when needed. The hardest part of my job was having to stand around for hours on end. The most enjoyable part of my job was making friends and feeling accomplished every time I was able to successfully help a customer with what they needed."
good,pretty good entry level job but i did not feel there was alot of room for advancement.as well as management really just covering there own backside.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work in only a few departments like the Garden Center, Electronics, and super easy Apparel. I work in TLE which is a good spot too. It can be tough, but with the team I have we always survive. We work so hard, but management will always be breathing down your neck. They will not train you. It is a sink or swim job. If you have common sense  and willing to learn by asking questions then you can do this job."
good,"A typical day at work would be putting away stalk, cleaning my department and making sure it looks presentable. Learning to work with other and collaborating with them on bigger projects like setting up an entire department for a seasonal occasion was a great learning experience. Also, having the support of the entire team and management helps with developing my skills and getting the tasks done right and on time."
good,"Empresa com excelentes benefícios. Horários compatíveis, estacionamento, refeitório. Empresa proporciona cursos para aperfeiçoamento profissional."
good,"At management level the work days can become long, but the rewards of your accomplishments make all the time and effort worth it."
good,"I work well with people and i am a good team player. i also pride myself to be productive and fun workplace with soccer."
good,This was a good job to start at when I was a teen. I learned multiple departments. The worst part was the communication between co-workers. The best part was getting a discount in the store.
good,"Very systematic work. still you will never be bored. Meet new people everyday. I learned how to deal with different kind of people, with wide range of complaints and concerns. It is easy to reach management when needed. Co workers are very helpful all the time. The hardest part is at the end of the day you are totally exhausted, it takes 100% of your energy everyday. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people."
good,"I loved being a stocker and a cashier. I got different views from both areas of the store. When I was a cashier, I worked in the front and dealt with a lot of customers; good and bad. When I was stocking, I was in the back I learned how to deal with supplies and products and where things went."
good,"The company has recently made a number of process and compensation changes that have made the manager's daily routine easier to execute.   These include:"
good,"A busy Walmart located by the Cowboys Stadium. With more than 5 years of experience of working with this Walmart; this company had me stocking, maintaining and working efficiently for each department of the store."
good,I was a cashier at Wal-Mart and so I had a lot of interaction with customers. Everyone I worked with was really nice. I wasn't there extremely long because I was going to start school but while I was there everyone was pleasant to work with and the job was easy.
good,"Started as a toy sales associate and within 3 months got promoted to inventory team management. Sales associate put returns back in proper place, scanned for outs or spaces where product is missing and request a pick from backroom, zoned or faced all toys forward and organized, got product from backroom that was ready to stock, or run/ work threw all department pallets that came off truck the previous day. Binned Items/ placed and scanned into system the location of boxed products in their specific section. Assisted with getting bikes off the rack and constant questioning by customers. offered my help to surrounding departments to help them catch up and finish duties by the end oif shift."
good,A typical day at work in the deli was very fast-paced. I learned about food safety and gained customer service skills. Management often had conflicting views on policy and procedure. My co-workers were friendly but became noticeably stressed under pressure. The hardest part of the job was completing every task assigned before I had to clock out. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I helped so many people at the end of the day.
good,"Great leadership team overall.  But, as with any large company, some inefficient managers manage to stick around because they can hide among the masses."
good,"Meu horário era de 12h as 20h20m com 1h de almoço, chegava e ia direto para o meu setor, par render minha colega para almoçar. As 14h eu ia almoçar, quando voltava minha colega estava se preparando para ir embora.Eu continuava com o andamento do serviço, as 16h entrava outra colega que ia ate as 00h que ficava ate o fechamento. "
good,"I really enjoy working in customer service, the only thing with Walmart is the fact that it is really hard to get full time."
good,"Pharmacists and the entire pharmacy staff are an integral part of the entire Walmart atmosphere, business, and culture overall."
good,"en la empresa el cliente siempre tiene la razón, ser servicial con nuestros clientes y ofrecer calidad en los productos asi como calidad en el servicio excediendo con las expectativas de los clientes objetivo es que el cliente siempre lleve mas de lo que tenia pensado comprar y no tener faltantes de lo que el cliente mas consume"
good,Enjoy the atmosphere and interacting with people. Helping people find what they need. management in other hand was not meeting and helping to work with me what so ever
good,"I enjoy work nights for a long all time. From this job i learn to work as teammates to get a job done, I mate a lot of good people there."
good,"Different shifts"
good,I got to interact with the customers and cross-train. I learned how to be a cashier. I was also a phone operator and i enjoyed that as well.
good,On a typical day at work I would stop at least one shoplifter. The most enjoyable part about working for Walmart was stopping shoplifters and calling the cops.
good,Most customers were happy when leaving. I was treated fairly and was able to work freely. They were very understanding and the pay was fair enough.
good,"Flexible scheduling when followed, low pay, unfriendly co workers, easy work with long breaks and lunches. Dont always follow proper procedures for work performed"
good,I have received good experience working at  Walmart. Its a great company to get into for the younger teenagers. I would reccommend to those in need of a job.
good,"Very long shifts but i loved every second of the job. "
good,Wal-Mart has been I good place to work if your looking for a place to work but overnight can be hard if you haven't done it before. Sometimes management seems not to all be on the same page at the same time and don't share information from day shift to night shift management as well as they should be. Wal-Mart also dose not allow for overtime but will make you work over your scheduled time to get off.
good,Worked in the deli dept at Walmart learned a lot about various meats and cheeses. More customer service expierence to go on with
good,quite busy and fast-paced work environment. People are nice but work can be challenging at times due to the busy schedule and the amount of work.
good,"place to shop for different needs, well organized, low prices for food, clothes, etc."
good,Wal-mart is a good company to work for. They pay good and good working environment. They work with you on everything. You cant move up in the company without an education. They will take care of you.
good,"There was a lot of lack of communication in this company and lack of employees."
good,Walmart is a place for advancement. Very nice company to work for.  The discount card is the best.  I learned alot from my team captain about the fresh meat dept.
good,A typical work day at wal mart for me was always exciting. Most of the employees were very friendly but everyone had their days. The customer service managers tried their best to make your day go by smooth.
good,I enjoyed working at walmart. I did learn a lot.mgmt could listen to employees a lot better. I enjoyed my hours that iworked.
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart overnight, mostly because the hours are nice and they weork with my schedule needs. The only thing that I believe makes it a negative work place would be the amount of drama between associates."
good,"préparer les dépôts"
good,the hardest part of the job was changing the store displays. The most enjoyable part was that i always did something different everyday.
good,taking portraits of children and families and try to sell package.  worked alone so didn't have to deal with co workers.  Hardest part of job was trying to make upset children happy.  Enjoyable part was taking great pictures of families and seeing how happy it made them.  Dealt with management through weekly phone calls.
good,"A great environment to work at, easy to learn and positive management and constant helpful training, although hardest part was the final push during seasonal sales. I loved the customers in my department, and how helpful the assistant managers were."
good,"I was brought on for the holiday season, so we were always super busy. It was good pay. I was only there for a little over a month."
good,I was a cashier and I would greet the customers as they come to my register and complete their purchases. I learned how to be patient during tough situations. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for if you like the retail business.  The hardest part of retail is it is 24/7, therefore you may have to work nights, holidays, weekends, it is hard to raise a family like that.  I enjoyed working with people and I enjoyed my coworkers for the most part.  I feel that the company as a whole has changed so much in the years I was there, not necessarily for the better.  I learned a lot with the company and for someone that is driven and wants to further themselves in the retail business, this is the place to be."
good,"90% of my associates were great, but communication lacked. I would work there again. They have jobs for all ages and job skills."
good,Es una empresa donde se aprende demaciado y se obtiene una vision muy amplia del negocio.
good,The hardest part of this job was dealing with co workers with different personalities. I have learn to become a better worker/co worker. I usually work at the customer service desk.
good,"Decent work environment, not so good management in this store. Good work hours, Good workers. Not a stressful work place, will work with you if there comes a problem."
good,"Walmart benefits has been a amazing learning experience and growth opportunity. Walmart's benefits call center has given me more knowledge, and opportunity than I could possibly have asked for."
good,"Very decent company to work for. Good pay, decent coworkers, and good equipment. I would recomend this job. The hardest part of the job was to catch people stealing."
good,"I enjoyed the work when they had more stability many days they didn't know what they where doing but being that i have management experience I took the lead to get things done such like made sure register paper,bags,clean registers, clean the front end so that the customers have a good time at our store."
good,I learned a great deal from working at walmart. The most important tool I've gained is how to deal with stress and what it is to provide great customer service.
good,"Wal-Mart home office is one of the best place to work at. The working environment is excellent - team members, supports from the management etc. are unparallel."
good,My days was pretty much the same job everyday so I sort of new what to expect.  I basically sat in my cab and press buttons letting the machine do all the work cutting logs from 8to20 ft long as straight as possible.  Performed maintaince once a week on our machines.
good,walmart is a great company to stick with from years and to move uo and advance in as an empolyee start as overnight stocker or cashier work your way up to backroom or floor management.
good,I had to scan all items for the customers.  Got to talk to many customers from other cultures and enjoyed having conversations with them.
good,"My day starts off pretty early but I still keep a smile on my face when greeting the customers that enter and exit the store. I learned how to multi task in a busy environment. The management team is awesome and so are my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with an irate customer. But the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help, satisfy and please the customers that come in and out of the store."
good,i like to work with people that work with a good mood and that are never down and sad or mad at work and that are very hard workers and never let you down on anything
good,"Overall not a very difficult job, can just be tedious and tiring depending on the day and the amount of trucks and items received on said given day."
good,good benefits especially on the business side because you can also earn on their profit sharing and big discount on the in store purchases.
good,my experiance working for them was good it was a seasonal job i would work for them again they have good benefit and oppurtunities working for them
good,"love the open door policy, very job specific training, low pay but great benefits. very structured in its disciplinary procedures so everyone is held to the same standards"
good,"It's a retail store, what else can I say. Pay isn't great. Hours are sometimes cut. Management is management and as long as your doing your job you won't have a problem."
good,working at Wal-mart was a great experience. it helped me get a lot of experience in different parts of the store I started as a cashier and went up from there I worked there almost two years it was a fun and nice work experience. It is like a family when you work there.
good,i'll admit i loved working for Walmart and i will most likely return for employment. circumstances motivated me to seek employment else ware; while i was the current employee of the month
good,"With my skills, a typical day at Wal-Mart consists of me checking out customers on register, handling refunds at the customer service desk, operating self check out, cleaning my work area, answering phone calls at the service desk, and handing our online order pick-ups."
good,"A good place to grow as individual,I have learn a lot as a Customer service associate,I know how to handle a problematic customer, i help them in everything I can."
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em grupo, e que uma empresa não funciona se todos os funcionários não trabalharem em prol do mesmo objetivo"
good,"When needed help I'd ask an associate and they'd help me as soon as they could."
good,Very stressful in the way that management worked so out of order with each other. My coworkers were great but my management lacked basic communication skills.
good,Walmart was an okay place to work. I was there to be able to get by for a little while and I must say they treat people well. Management is awesome but of course you have some that aren't that awesome.
good,"Fast and busy work environment. large company. They didn't work with my school schedule.. that's why I left. "
good,"As we all know walmart is one of the giant when it comes to groceries and just any think in general, I been working in walmart since march of 2015 and up to present I am  still working there, I am looking for another job to better me and family."
good,je peux faire n importe quoi dans le magasin apres 15 ans de travail j aime travailler en équipe le plus desagréable c est que l on travaille tres fort et peux recompenser
good,Never a dull moment at Walmart being a Customer Service Manager. We run the entire front end of the store. The front end is the first and last place the customer encounters on their trip so we work to make it the best experience possible.
good,"Horaire de 8 h à 5 h, parfois de 12 h à 9 h."
good,"Walmart's Management skill need work. Always understaffed, and constantly being moved to areas that aren't our own but its still easy. You never get your own area done though this way. The customers can make it the worth while but there is the ones who think were just out to get their money which is not a good experience. The hardest part is the most frustrating and all it is that management wants one person to do 3 to 4 departments including their own completely zoned, completely stocked, and completely clean. Which is not possible when as soon as you fix one thing someone messes it up, But that is all in a perfect world."
good,They pay fair and hours are good but the management is not good. The only complaint is that they seem to value customers more than employees.
good,I started off as a cashier which was a lot of fun for me since I am from a small town where everyone knew each other.  My management was amazing and always helped people out with anything.
good,got to meet some nice people and the other employees were fun to work with. the work wasnt to slow or to fast and the time always seemed to go by pretty fast. i would love to work there again.
good,"I really liked working here. Night shift was fun, everyone was friendly. As long as you show up for work and don't start trouble its a pretty stable job."
good,"typical day is to roam department around specialty sales, answer questions from initial inquiry to Check out and even carry out, to give the customer the best possible experience every time to where they will come back for repeat experiences repeatedly. Zone sales areas, finalize checkout process for customers wishing to conclude their purchasing for the present shopping experience. Up-Sale for peripheries and accessories.  Restock of outs to keep sales in the positive."
good,"the experience depends on you, and how you react to what happens, during you time working there. also depends on what you experience, in between the lines before and after work periods."
good,"Walmart is a good employer to work for generally. It is a fast-paced environment, but you are set up to succeed there. Walmart will go above and beyond to help you, and try to meet your needs, which is great. With that though, you have a lot of co-workers, and that can cause problems. With so many people to keep track of things can get hectic easy, and you never know when that is going to happen. You also do much of the same all the time, and after a couple months, the enjoyment of work begins to fade. There aren't many people who absolutely love working for Walmart, but not many people hate it either. It is just an overall good place to work."
good,"Walmart was a fun and laid back place to work because I was on the third shift. Most things I learned were mainly about maintenance, for example cleaning, buffing, along with using cleaning chemicals."
good,la empresa es muy buena estable y demás pero yo necesitaba mas ingresos
good,just really didnt feel like ive learned anythin there it was a do it yourself thing i didnt like it so much nor did i like the pay
good,muy buen trabajo salvo las encargadas que eran de mal caracter
good,A typical work day was okay depending on the shift you had. I learned that I had much more patience than I initially thought. The management there is very nice and understanding. Co-workers were always great! The hardest part of the job is dealing with the rude and ignorant customers. The best part of the job was always the free food in the break room.
good,Although a great pay and great co-workers the managers did not have a big understanding with all the staff. Did not take the time to train employees and refused to give over time when deserved.
good,"Working as a cashier at Walmart has been an experience! I really enjoy meeting new people and helping them in any way I can to make them happy. "
good,Fun  place to work  good environment  to work  people place for a people person  . Fast place for hard working people . Team work is what it is all about . Customer service very important cleanliness and safety and making sure out of stock items are being order to have available for customers . communication with co workers and management is very important . Being a peoples person make my job easy and fun going it also helps motivate co workers . At the end of the day it is all about getting extra sales .
good,"This is a great place to work, the staff is all very friendly and helpful. The management team are fantastic, and always around when you need to talk to them."
good,"a typical day at work,  is simple go in get our task for the day go to our assigned areas and start our task and then if we have time to help others be sure to let the manager know so they can assign us else where."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart, would have liked to stay but was let go because of being seasonal. The management was nice. Good place to work for."
good,"At first, job was not too bad, just unloading trucks and separating into departments. Then the policies had changed so we also were tasked to stock the grocery department."
good,"My most enjoyable part of my day is talking with patients.  I love hearing about how they are doing and how their family is doing.  Not all customers are sweet but it evens out good over bad. "
good,I enjoyed being an employee at Wal-Mart. I was the go to worker if they were short and I always wanted to learn something so I would always volunteer the helping hand
good,"Muy buen ambiente, muy buena comunicación y trato con mis jefes. Linda empresa para poder desarrollarse."
good,"Really enjoyed working here,great people,and  the managers were willing to listen to any input you had about the job.But mostly the people I worked with were great ,we all helped each other and all got along and got our job done.The hardest part was around the holidays trying to get all the pallets unloaded and all the stock put out but found out you just laugh with your coworkers and work at the same time and get it done.The main thing is you have to be willing to work along side and help each other,that makes the job go faster and not so hard on just one person."
good,"It was a great place to work. The management staff was impressive and worked with schedules. My coworkers were really great to work with. I enjoyed working there,"
good,"great associates willing to help each other out when needed.  Wish they were more flexible on schedules, vacations, and lunches"
good,Nice and fair place to work at. There are some job advancement but not open for everybody. Trains worker but not everybody gets training on other machines.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. I will admit that it was definitely rough from time to time because it was a lot that you were blamed for by customers, that typically had nothing to do with you. As a cashier I had to always remember that we are the first and last faces that customers see when they come in and when they leave out of the store. I learned that I just have to be patient, be kind, wait and have understanding. Even if the customer is upset and may be yelling, they are not upset at me and that I always had to remain calm. Our management team there always came to our defense and respected both the customers and us as the cashiers. I loved working with my co-workers. We helped each other out in every way possible, working together as a team. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is being able to move on after having a really, really hard transaction because I work hard and I take my work seriously and I never liked to mess up and I still don't so my managers always helped me out and they understood because they knew how much of a perfectionist I was. I just really love to do my work well. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping out customers who really needed help finding something that they could not find or helping a cashier who was stuck on a transaction. I love helping others."
good,"loading and unloading freight.putting pallets on the still,and down stacking pallets all day.scanning and doing reverse pics"
good,"fun place to work ,,wish they would offer 40 hours a week...management could use improving.. co workers  are the greatest. customer service given bye management needs in proving"

good,"I am been working at walmart photo lab providing customer service such as taking, printing and developing photos. As well as, doing online delivery."
good,"A typical day would be filling prescriptions, working pick up  window, working drop off window where you also completed inputing prescription, restocking medications."
good,"Typical day was clearing shopping carts from parking lot, and communicating with managers while doing inside work, such as clearing pallets from the sales floor or collecting trash for disposal in the back.  I liked not being under constant supervision. I disliked the sometimes long day that comes with being on your feet all the time"
good,"Managing cashiers, their breaks and lunches, reviewing and auditing cash register in addition to opening and closing them, and taking care of customers to insure a friendly and fast customer service are only some of what goes on, on a typical day of a customer service supervisor at Walmart."

good,overall i would rate this as average. great place to work the culture is great and the customer always comes first. good management
good,Walmart is a busy place always moving. meet different people everyday. Every customer have there own expectation on a sale.
good,"-Typical work days are routine, pull out pallets, put goods on the shelves, and arrange the goods on the shelf so they are presentable to consumers."
good,"They didn't mind working you way past your shift ended, but wold cut you short at the end of the week to avoid paying you overtime. I got decent raises, but still never broke $8.00. I liked the job, again because of my co-workers. I was a staple throughout the store. The company just didn't match my work efforts and my pay."
good,"Empresa com boa sinergia com os funcionários, mas os beneficios são poucos e o salário não é atrativo."
good,"A typical day of work at Walmart is a headache! But you learn something new everyday. Working at customer service is a lot of work and you have to be effective. We do just about everything. We deal with the customers problems, we help them as much as we can until it goes out of our hands. We deal with their pick up today, sight to stores, and layaway. Any other need as well. Working as a department manager is just as much work. You not only deal with your daily assignments but your also interacting with customers and giving them any helpful advice. As a sales associate you are to stock things as they are needed and in the right place you also interact with customers, taking them to any item they are looking for or any location in the store they are looking for. The co workers are just as great. They are willing to help you in anyway needed. Management is also a lot of help. If your stuck on an assignment they will further explain it to you so you will understand it clearly. Even after that if you still do not understand and or are stuck they will stop what they are doing to show you and help you. The hardest part of the whole job is trying to work around problems you run into. The best part is working with all the wonderful people you meet."
good,"co-workers were great, management however not so much. very friendly environment. Pay was good for the job description. hours were good."
good,Learned a lot. Great experience for customer service. Very nice benefit package. But extreme work load. They need to hire more cashier.

I loved having high volumes of items from each customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers, the hardest part of the job was contacting supervisors."
good,The neighborhood Wal-Mart location had a slow yet steady work pace.  There are goals to meet every week to ensure the pharmacy is running well.
good,"My time at walmart was both ends of the spectrum, I encountered considerate management, awesome customers and great co workers. On the other side of the coin, these can be times where management seems against you, the customers can annoy you and your co workers can leave you to pick up the slack. All in all, Smile your way through and work hard, and walmart can be a great place for anyone."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart mostly due to customer interaction. My co-workers were pretty much on the whole enjoyable to work with. The only thing is, they are not family oriented."
good,typical day included unloading freight from trailers and placing on pallets to be stored and sent to store at a later time
good,We come in to work in the afternoon to unload trucks using roller racks. Each person has a certain area of the store to handle. We put materials on pallets and bring them to the sales floor.
good,I have learned many different skills working at Walmart. The best part of my day currently is working with customers and being able to help them in anyway possible.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart pharmacy consisted of non-stop customer service. The pharmacy would fill around 600 prescriptions a day, and then all needed to be done by closing time."
good,"Had fun."
good,Good open door management practices with management.  Excellent amount of personal/professional challenge involved in professional responsibilites with supportive management.  Extraordinarily competitive compensation packages for corporate level staff.  Limited growth potential for nursing professional.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart."
good,"Overall not a terrible place to work, however most of the managers tend to gossip about their employees or would flat out lie to get others in trouble or to avoid getting themselves in trouble. Some managers had a issue with micro managing while playing favorites, letting some employees get away with slacking off and not working while coming down on others, giving contradicting ""advice"" (telling them to do one thing then punishing them for doing it). Yelling at employees on the floor and threatening their jobs in front of customers or even going as far as to badmouth a employee to customers, other staff, or managers. "
good,My supervisor was willing to teach me all about what it takes to be able to move up within our company and how to cope with difficult situations.
good,"Good place to work with management that is willing to listen to your concerns.  Management is usually willing to work with you schedule wise.  They are fair with raises and how many hours you get a week. The co-workers are usually fun and friendly, very easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is having to work holidays, but they do try to make up for it with special benefits for working.  I've learned many skills from customers service to managing."
good,I really enjoyed working here and interacting with the customers and helping them with their questions. My only issue with it was that the repetitive motion of my arm that hurt my shoulder leading to my unemployment.
good,"I liked the job, they give their employees rewards for reaching goals. The management team kept you uplifted everyday, It was a nice environment to work in."
good,"lo que mas me gusto es trabajar en equipo, aveces llegamos y competiamos por ver quien era el mas rapido en acomodar sus pasillos"
good,Worked directly under the store manager. My routines were the same day to day. Always looked over sales from the days before to to see what area I'm hurting in my swas and kept up with customer satisfaction and safety.
good,It was very clean and very one did what they needed when it was needed to be done. every one was nice and kind and very good at working together.

good,"Provided, customer service, Worked effectively as a team by answering colleagues calls and helping other departments, to achieve customer satisfaction"
good,I wasn't there long enough to fully be able to critique the work experience.  Only there for one month for seasonal work.  Cashier was the position and time went by very fast
good,walmart is a good place to work as long as you get the right store to work at i enjoyed getting to know people and had a steady work schedule sometimes hours got cut
good,"I met a lot of great hard working people, that showed me that the store is more than the jokes people make online. They are hard working families trying to survive. I wish I had stayed longer to have gotten more experience."
good,Flexible hours allow more family time.  Store manager and personnel very accommodating and helpful.  Great work culture and open door policy.
good,"Job is not too labor intensive, It is not good company when it comes to working overtime. There is little to no room for advancement. Management usually doesn't know what is going on."
good,"Led a team of 50 QA contractors, delivering new software features and enhancements for transportation management system.  Created process improvement to speed delivery to customers.  Reviewed test strategy and plans for all projects delivered to customer.  Analyzed metrics and performed root cause analysis to improve quality."
good,fun helping customers.. Co-workers some had bad attitudes. the mamagers had their picks..  Hard about his jobs was co- workers. I've learned that you have to really ignore the negative
good,Being in IMS is a good way to make some cash but you learn to hate it fast and then the managers will not switch you to a new department like every one else. You get stuck and hate it even more.
good,"I believe Walmart is a great place to work, but honestly I feel like I need a change. Its been great though the co-worker you meet and the customers you see is definitely the brighter side to your days."
good,had lots of fun with my co workers and at work. was able to gain lots of experience in different departments and work with many different people. i was able to make friends and learn new things about the inventory.
good,"i worked with my managers and coworkers to offer the best customer service possible making suggestions, and helping customers with questions. I also utilized many different sales techniques and worked the register much of the time. Thus i am very familiar and comfortable handling cash and balancing the cash register. Very quick learner."
good,"Wal-Mart was a good place to work. There were many positives, but also a few negatives to working there. The company does a good job at trying to to give back to their employees."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers.  Being able to joke around can make even the worst day tolerable.  Managers all have their own way of doing things and if you do what the manager on duty requires, it will make the day go better."
good,i enjoyed working there a lot the management was great it was a fun experience but the labor was not worth the pay and i was getting no hours
good,I injoyed being able to work with the public and control profits within the departments I supervised. The team work was great and being able to control the scheduling of the assosiates realy allowed me to create a very good team. The only problems I ran into was alot of assistant managers and the pay was not very good.
good,"Wal-mart was a fun work place to work, good attendance and work efforts are recognized so that if willing you could move up in your position. During the holidays WalMart made their associates feel at home and welcomed if having to work during the holidays. Overall I would recommend Walmart as a company for anyone trying to get their foot in the door for a job in retail."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. It was something new to me and enjoyed working with a team to get the job done.  This was only a part time position and it was just moving merchandise from one place to another.  It was not hard work and I enjoyed it, but was looking for more hours."
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart. I enjoyed my co workers and customers. I had good and bad days but overall it is a good company to work for.
good,A typical day at work is full of multi-task and constructive duties. I learned how to stock and be more hands on in a retail service. I wasn't around management much but they were very patient. My co-workers taught me most of my duties. The hardest part of my job was knowing where all the merchandise was located. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help my customers and be a part of a big respected corporation.
good,assisted customers I was well-known to the customers. I received associate of the month. I also learned produce and stocking and facing the store. Exciting working at a brand new store and meeting new people  Could be more organized and everyone be on the same page as fas as rules.
good,worked 10 yrs first time 7 months now worked two different stores and each are in their own way ok they each have their problems but it is being addressed
good,Great place to work. I enjoyed the staff as well as the customers.  I worked only part time and I was there for over two years and would encourage anyone to apply.
good,Sanitary place with great hours and pretty cool managers I learned a lot there morally due to the fact that I had a lot of responsibilities to juggle with school as well so it was either sink or swim.
good,There are many different job positions to choose from and changing departments is relatively easy to learn new skills. The management are supportive of the workers and help us do well.
good,I started off as a cashier for day shift then switched to overnight while working over night I was able to learn the duties of many departments and utilize them to the best of my abilities.
good,I loved working with Pro-Advantages because there was always something to do so the work went by pretty quick. Did not really like working an overnight shift because I have a daughter.  Which also put traveling out of the question and their a traveling company. However it was a great learning experience and was very good at what I did there.
good,"I started out as cashier but within six months, I had trained for service desk, layaway and then took the exam to become a customer service manager. it was such a fast paced environment that I constantly had something to do, if not on the floor, in the back doing paperwork or scheduling."
good,Fantastic staff to work with and good pay for previous experience. Good opportunities for advancement and raises. Managers are nice people and understanding.
good,Working stocking the shelves and rotating stock was an enjoyable experience. The cleaning of the floors proved to be a breeze with the buffer.  Even stripping and re-waxing was an easy task.
good,very Good company to start your first job and gain work experience I have worked there for 2 years now and have excellent progress in expanding my current work skills
good,"Working at Wal-Mart, well overall its a fun place to work, especially if you love working with the public. One can meet so many different types of people and get to know them like family. Your co-workers become like family to you. One could grow with this company if you only take the time to seek the opportunity"
good,"its okay for work  but not to get a career. i like it at first but then it became repetitive and then i started noticing the small things, like how people who were so nice int he beginning just started getting in your business and then there was a gossiping problem in the store. everyone is good but at the same time you ALWAYS have to watch your back"
good,"Comfortable place to work, fellow associates were friendly and helpful. Enjoyed meeting the public and helping them in their requests"
good,"Loved working with my colleagues, very fast paced ever changing job. Lots of fun dedicated employees. Large super center with gm side and consumable side ."
good,At this Walmart you can expect to learn most aspects of working in each position from slicing deli meat to working freight. As a manager this is perfect as I won't ask an associate to do something I won't do myself. The hardest part of the job is gaining as many skills and as much knowledge as fast as possible. This is also an enjoyable part of the job as it will never become boring.
good,"Boa empresa, tem vários benefícios, uma cultura enorme, mas acho que falta um pouco mais de supervisão das ações das pessoas que possuem autoridades e responsabilidades."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of Clean restrooms at the beginning and end of my shift, Constantly checking and emptying if full all the trash cans, Do regular safety sweeps throughout the store. Take all trash to the trash compactor, and work Bale compactor. Management was ok, they were fair but they had their moments of fault. My co-workers were great, they were all nice, they all pulled their own weight in their jobs. The hardest part of the job was trying to work the bale compactor, it takes a lot of muscle in order to do it and the most enjoyable part of the job was how laid-back everything and all the co-workers were, as long as you got all your duties done and you were still doing something somewhat productive they didn't care what you did."
good,Walmart is an environment in which you can be productive and have fun at the same time. The store that I work in has an awesome management team that makes the associates feel appreciated thus providing the associates with a positive work attitude. I enjoy going to work and performing my duties due to the warm and positive work environment.
good,i loved working here you were always on the go and had something to do. breaks were giving when desired and needed and they understood if you had family problems and needed to be absent.
good,My day would start by meeting in the office with other employees and managers. The managers would give out assignments for each of us. Then I would go to my station and work on recreating all sorts of documents for all sorts of companies that would ask for help. I loved this kind of office work. I really would love to do something similar to this.
good,"The hours are long and hard overnight, but the treatment of night workers was very good.  Free meals were often given as rewards for safety.  Job is easy, you only have to follow a task sheet every night."
good,"It is a fun environment, and a good place to start your career the staff is friendly and there is always something new to learn."
good,I would come in and have to manage my time so that I would be able to have the meals out hot and ready in a small window of time. I had to follow strict dietary guidelines and prep for the next shift meal. I had to make snacks from scratch on a large scale. Then I had to clean up the kitchen after myself and then the dishes the residents used.
good,When asking how to improve my numbers at work they said to speed up when checking out customers but were unwilling to give me a chance and put me in the few item check out and not on a belt were I could improve. Also weren't real understanding about injuries or illness that affected my performance or attendance.
good,Great place to work! Everyone in management and personnel was very helpful and friendly. My direct support managers were always there in a hurry to assist me in any issues I had!
good,Fun workplace with supportive management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues. I enjoyed every minute I was there but it just was not the job for me.
good,Exciting place to work. All about customer service and putting the customer first. Co-workers are very helpful and believe in team work.  What i enjoy most about my job is the smile on the customers face when they leave.
good,"Shelving returns, processing transactions, customer service, stocking products, creating layaway accounts, retrieving layaway items, and cutting fabric."
good,"variety of different things to do in a day, no day is ever the same, get to interact with lots of different people, and help out in different departments"
good,"I worked a year for the company. They don't have the compassion they say they do for their employees. I have the power of attorney over someone who is really sick and I missed days because of it. I told the manager this and was told ""We will help you."" However I got terminated on my anniversary. Got denied unemployment. I came to work on my days off because no one else was willing to."
good,Management needs to be on the same page. It seems the only ones that get along are the employees. Other then that its great.
good,"A usual day a WalMart cashier goes by fast most of the time.  Always making sure to serve the customers with upmost courtesy, and at the same time in a fast time matter in order to keep the lines from getting to long; which equals angry customers.  This fast pace environment definitely made most of my days faster."
good,"A typical day I welcomed customers, operated cash register and assisted customers with any questions or concerns that they may have"
good,everything was so slow pace. the management was very snoody and mean. The people were nice to work with but it was such a  weird enviornment.
good,Good start off  job not nothing to make a career out of in less they give you the opportunity to move up in the company cause as a base associate your are screwed doing maximum work for minimum pay

good,it is a productive job and very easy. supervisors were nice and helped whenever i needed it. everyone was nice to each other

good,I really loved my position at Walmart.  There were incentives for numbers which inspired to succeed.  We were appreciated in many ways.
good,Wal- Mart is a place where you come in with the mindset knowing your day is going to be very time consuming. As well as having a positive attitude to keep your day going.
good,"I was classified as a wireless sales associate, but I worked many departments including: jewelry, TLE, customer services."
good,"Some of the managers were a bit rude, not keeping up with the evolving company policies. Crew was amazing, job itself pretty easy. Working with customers was tiring, especially on Friday and Sunday nights. Also the people that come in at midnight for new releases on Monday night/Tuesday morning, they always assume that the person handling new releases has seen every single one, that gets old."
good,"While the cashier position can get boring because of the fact that you're doing the same thing all day, there are times where you're engaging with all of your coworkers and meeting really great people."
good,"This company allowed you to be creative your own areas as long as it was within company guidelines and store manager approval.  They like to advance associates who took the antiative to do their own work and even though it may be wrong, took the advice and made it better."
good,"on a typical day I would help customers, ring up items, and operate a cash register, zone aisles, and put away carts."
good,"enjoyed this job very much, just didn't like working the 3rd shift, it did give me more experience with stocking shelves and setting up shelves using plan-a-grams"
good,"Walmart is usually reasonably consistent, store to store, with your daily life. Stocking, fixing mods, pulling stuff out of the back, and putting stuff back. All while helping customers. "
good,Usually everyday was a good day with great vibes and smiling faces there was the occasional unhappy customer but I kept a smile on my face and tried to make their experience better by the time they left my line or the store. The management at both sites where all in all good people professional yet could make light of situations as well. I have to say the most enjoyable part of the job is to interact with all kinds of different people and make sure they have a good experience with Walmart and myself. Everyone should have the opportunity to smile and if they are having a bad day you should do your best to at least get a smile from them before they leave and a little more happy with their day. I learned how to operate a register multitask with the customer register and bagging.
good,with Wal-Mart you're always on feet except breaks. you're always moving items around the sales floor if not across the store to some where else. half the time management does not listen to any decent ideas that might help them out to some extent.
good,"Typical day at work involves stocking the shelves, Interaction with customers and individual needs. Gun sales and training. Leadership with coworkers and management."
good,"aprendí a manejar elevadores, electricidad, reparar maquinas, etc"
good,It's a very fast paced place to work. You learn a lot and develop to be a better worker. Definitely teaches you how to deal with angry customers. Co-workers give you the chance to make mistakes and help you learn from them. Managers are very understanding and fun.
good,"A great workplace to work , we had the number #1 Tire n Lube automotive , I was the go to guy and knew how to get the job done, a very great work enivronment"
good,I enjoyed the workload and also being able to assist others with their workloads.I also developed a sense of responsibility towards helping the others that were indeed in need of help by some of the faster stock crew workers.The job also gave me an individual sense of responsibility for the well being of others that I was in a position to help them with their problems at hand.
good,"Comme première emplois je n'aurais pas pu demander mieux, malgré le fait que nous ne sommes pas syndiquer, de bonne conditions de travail y sont instaurer."
good,Walmart is a great place to work weather you are looking for part time work or a permanent full time job. the opportunities are endless. just be familiar with your supervisors and let them know you eager to learn more!
good,"My interaction working with fellow Associates at Walmart has been very positive. Everyone seems at least moderately friendly, and willing to pull their weight in completing tasks. The store overall is well organized, and this is rooted from strong tenured leadership and young talent throughout the store"
good,"Everyone I worked with was really great. We all worked together to finish our responsibilities. i assisted customers pick out jewel pieces for special occasions, and find what they were looking for. I also learned how to fix all types of different watches."
good,"I enjoy the customers and relationships I built but not the whole time was enjoyable. I had a cart run into my car, causing damage, and that left a bad taste in mouth after no compensation."
good,At Wal-Mart there is always something to do to keep yourself busy. If you did not have anyone in your line then you could go around and pick up items that have been misplaced and put them in the correct place. Or you could stock the shelves or bags. Most of the people you would come into contact with were nice and easy to deal with but then you have some that are having a bad day and decide to take it out on you .
good,"Great starter job. Always something to do, and times goes by quickly."
good,"The organization has many excellent, dedicated professionals. That said, this team is very dysfunctional and the ones doing the majority of the work are not recognized and if you let them, they will bury you alive in work."
good,I enjoyed the fast-paced environment. I worked with god people. The reason for leaving unfortunately was because I could not get a transfer to an earlier shift when I continued education.
good,"I enjoy getting to meet new people and talking to people.  There stories can be interesting.  And sometimes they are in a bind and I get to help them by saving them some money when they really needed that, or helping them figure out a car problem and sometimes it is not as bad as it seems but some times it is."
good,I had learn alot from working with Walmart. I learn alot from working with them. I enjoy being able to help customers. It wasn't a easy job.
good,Although I've come to noticed it is not a fair company as it advertised to be.  Its very difficult to try and move up and/or transfer to another location.
good,Enjoyed working at my position. Became a harsh working environment. But was hard to be given a different shift or promotion.
good,Room for personal growth and several opportunities within.  Take care of their employees with many programs to further education and move up in leadership.
good,Summer labor job where the really work you. some days i would be sweating like a mule from lifting 50 lbs+ boxes for hours at end. Pay wasn't worth the back pains though.
good,"a typical day was folding clothes and helping  customers and letting customers in fitting room."
good,"A good place to work. At times, many managers don't really seem like they love their jobs so it makes it harder for employees at times to do their job correctly. There are many opportunities for advancement at Walmart as well."
good,I helped customers find what they needed. Unloaded trucks with the forklift. Customers were satisfied with my help. The company has everything that people need.
good,"Circuit board assembly, hard work staking layers with steel; however solid work and dependable job. New owners laid off  workers making the most money."
good,"High level of customer interaction. "
good,"A typical day at work depending if you work mornings or afternoons is fairly consistent. Morning associates are required to stock merchandise, maintain sales floor, maintain backroom inventory, cover fitting rooms or jewelry associates for lunches and breaks, and assisting customers with specific needs. Afternoon associates are responsible for zoning the specific department they are assigned, completing all returns before leaving for the day, and assisting customers with specific needs. For myself, my experience consisted of covering for departments out of my job description such as Toys, Hardware, Cashier, Jewelry, Housewares and Fitting Room departments."
good,"Challenging both mentally and physically - in a good way. Always busy always something to do. You could get pulled in a few different directions, but management was always very supportive"
good,"The associates at WalMart were great to work with. The managers were very helpful when I had questions, and they made the work environment a very healthy one by keeping the rules as a priority."
good,his job was  really great. i love working with the customers. getting them in and out so they can be happy. im very fast n very organized.
good,i work as  a cashier and Customer Service at the end for the day i was at back socking item and making sure evrything was ok for the next day
good,a Big company with a lot of good hard workers.. many different areas of work and job advancement... personal staff was great and listen to all advice and complaints...learned many different skills...
good,New things happened everyday! Not one day was ever boring. I learned how to change oil on soooo many vehicles. Management is always there with a helping hand. and seniority coworkers are always looking out for the new comers. Hardest part of this job is to keep warm during winter seasons. Everything about this job is great!
good,"Its a fun, and friendly work environment. Easy job as long as you come on time and focus on your assigned task. Management is very flexible and understanding. The hardest part about the job would be lifting, and bending continuosly if I had to say but it's fairly easy work."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart Port Perry would consist of, getting reprimanded for a job well done but not done well enough it seemed. "
good,I love being an overnight employee. I have most definitely felt that i have accomplish the needs for this job by being the employee of the month twice and being promoted to an overnight  support manger. I also gain the ability to train other associates. I learned how to operate forklifts and other qualified heavy machinery. Ultimately gain the ability the demonstration of great leadership!!!
good,"Fair place to work. I am here to re-evaluate myself and also remind myself how it is starting at the bottom."
good,"Ambiente lleno de retos, cada día aprendías algo nuevo. Trabajo contra reloj, emocionante."
good,"Sell, show, and inventory management are the most important parts. Customers come first, easy and enjoyable work experience."
good,"Tasks are straight forward and easy to complete."
good,"journée agréable et bien remplis "
good,Sometimes I will have a morning shift on this shift Walmart Is not that busy so I can take my time and clean the bathrooms and make sure there are nice and clean for customers when I get done with I walk around the store with a dust mop and check If trash need to be taken out. But It get busy around noon that's when the hard work comes In. I learn to work with people and I also lean to take my job seriously. I had some okay co workers some were lazy and there were some that was willing to work. There were some hard days when the bathrooms get really really really dirty and I hate dealing with some clog toilets but I do because that's my job. There were days work is enjoyable I love coming to work and hearing people calling me hard worker and giving me compliments for my work. Management are always willing to help with any problem you having and willing to work with you.
good,I enjoyed working here. However the hours really took away from my home life. I enjoyed being able to brighten customers days even though it was just for a minute. it really makes a difference.
good,"My job here was to change tires, fix flat repairs, and change the oils on the cars. Also I had to change the oil filters, check fluids, check air filters, rotate tires, do fuel injection cleaning, and also work the register when was needed."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart includes assigning tasks to associates and following up with them to make sure all is getting done. I learned how to manage a large number of employees at once. I had excellent managers who were very involved. I had great coworkers who really knew how to work as a team. The hardest part of the job would have to be disciplining employees. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the associates.
good,A typical day can be very productive not to mention physically and mentally demanding. With communication you can get a lot of things accomplished and also have fun at the same time.
good,"Everything is routine and process driven. You know what is next."
good,"I liked Walmart I learned alot there. I learned how to Imput, and work on Insurance problems. My most enjoyable part is working with coworkers"
good,I had fun at this job. It got busy from time to time but it was always fun. Only problem there was the upper levels of management. Other than that my co-workers were great and the job was very satisfying.
good,"The job wasn't too bad. The people were decent, but it was very very boring. But my problem was that I couldn't get enough hours to live on. So I had to find another job."
good,"Keeping busy and maintaining composure during peak business hours. Fast paced, fun and friendly. No one is hired as full time, just part time. Get to meet all sorts of people every day."
good,those 10% others can ruin your day and make u want to quit. typical day was doing returns and telling cashiers when to go to break.  i learned how to deal with all types of people.  Management is kind of a joke i worked there for 4 years it took them 1 year to give me the pay for the job i was already working and they hired a manager that had no management exp or walmart exp when i had worked there for 4 years and applied for the same job they hire and promote based off of friends not job preformance.  coworkers were the greratest easily made friends. most enjoyable part of job was engaging with customers to provide quick excellent service.
good,"There was always something that needed to be done.  The day usually went by pretty fast because of this.  I learned a good deal about inventory; not only the structure but the tools utilized.  Their was always a store manager or department manager available to assist with issues that might crop up and willing to teach me the skills I needed to better my performance."
good,a lot of fun while on the job but we managed to get the freight thrown up  When we did excellent work management  would treat us to dinner in the form of cook-outs hot dogs hambugers and chips  Those type of incentives helped
good,Fun work place at times and also a place that stays busy. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and working with other employers to get the job done.
good,"El acomodo de mercancía era lo principal, no dejar espacios en blanco y resurtir los estantes"
good,when switching departments was fun but also tiring. i was alot younger when i worked for walmart the first time. so it was easier on my back which had not gone out yet
good,"Inventory Management System Supervisor as a whole is a rewarding job, not because you have the hard labor, but because you have a crew that you have to work with and they're all generally great guys. The only really difficult part comes around the holidays and back to school, though. That's when you have to handle 6,400 units of freight distributed between two trucks. Hopefully, you won't just have two other people to help on those days due to proper scheduling"
good,"Walmart was an excellent experience to add to my background. The people were very helpful and influential, very sad to leave but due to medical conditions I had to leave due to the job requirement of constant standing which due to my knee condition I require more time sitting. Overall great place to work!"
good,I am manager there. The job is what I applied for and accepted. I work the third shift there. I lead my associates in order to get the job completed.
good,Fun place to work with nice co-workers. Management too worried about numbers and not associate moral. Seem to make up rules as they go to satisfy the customer and sometimes make associates feel degraded.
good,fun place to work if you don't have any other commitments its hard to get them to work with your schedule but other than that its a good job
good,this job was not the best to have but it was something it showed me the way of all walmarts will be and now i know what i have to do in a job place
good,Not a terrible place to work. Overall they treat you fairly well and there are some perks like quarterly bonus' if the store does well and free food if safety goals are reached. Sometimes management can be pretty bad but managers get juggled around so much its hard to make a hard judgement on that.
good,"I think it is a productive and fun place to work. I have made a lot of friends. I enjoy working here despite the hardships. We get short breaks, we have strict managers, the customers are okay, and the employees are kind."
good,Satisfactory work place and clean working environment. Appropriate work load for current position held. Desirable hours. Friendly co-workers and reliable aid when needed.
good,Stock products as fast as possible. Zone shelves after being stocked. Co Workers were fine at times. We had a couple problems but never nothing major.
good,Employees are well taken care of and two 15 minutes paid breaks is welcomed by all. Free lunches every now and then and cakes for all occasions.
good,Working for Walmart I did feel like I was constantly thinking about what I was going have to do the next day and it seemed really hard to let go when I left work. I liked helping people and providing good customer service  .
good,A lot of favoritism as long as you don't make yourself stand out in a bad light it'll be alright place to work. A lot to do through out the say to make time go by fast
good,"Co-works were easy to get along with, job was easy, hours were steady, CSMS didn't care to help you, you need to figure it out on your own"
good,"This is an Overall Decent place to work.  I would not say it's somewhere to have a Career but to start out or as a Supplemental Income its great.  "
good,"First cashier, check people out with groceries and household goods, keep area clean then I moved to floor had to stock shelves look over orders coming in, help customers maintain area clean."
good,The job is great. The only difficult problem is that the company is not always able to give you all of the tools that you need in order to do your job.
good,I love work for the simple work that it keeps me busy. our number one focus is customer satisfaction so i make that my daily goal the customer is always right.
good,very easy comfortable environment  for employees they convenient and they work with any schedule you may have the mangers where understanding  and helpful the only hard part is the customers
good,I would clock in and we would be assigned to what we will be doing for the day. I was working during the holidays so we had a lot to do in a day. We would package up shelves with merchandise and we would wrap it up and load it on to the truck.
good,we get there clock in see what register I'm assigned to .I have learded customers are always right. the management is always busy .my co-workers weren't very talkative cause we had to stay at out register or zone our area.the hardest part of my job was just sit there when customers yell at you all I could do was say sorry I will try and correct it. the most time that was enjoyable was when the management would prepare a whole meal for the employees on holidays when working and meeting new people...
good,"Protect property and lives by patrolling the area."
good,"working for Walmart is like,adventure each day you never know what type of customers your going to have that day. Working here you have to have patience,and be willing to sometimes BITE your tongue  from saying things,you DON'T want to say,but for the most,it can be enjoying especially when you have a good crew to work with that can,make your day seem alright. for the most part we have good management."
good,"Managers are very difficult to work for/ with. They do not allow personal touch. They do not get others opinions. they do not have good manager skills or personal relation skills. This is both embarrassing for the Manager, associate and WalMart company."
good,My work day always begin with a smile for my customers and my co-workers. I like to ensure the customers that they can trust me to provide the best options and the fastest service I can. In all my experiences I have learned that you get out of a work day want you put into. For instance if I put out positive energy I know that is what I will receive from my customers.
good,great management. fun work place. good hours. fun people to be around. great place to work. customer service is great. can always get what you are looking for and if not then someone is always willing to help you look.
good,I learned how to slice meats and cheese. I learned how to make subs and 6in subs. I learned how to work a Rotisserie. I was also learning how to make cakes from the bakery. Management was something else. I worked well when she was not around. I got along with co-workers for the most part. The hardest part of the job was when I had to do everything while my helper was on her phone. The most enjoyable part is when I was scheduled to work with four people that actually work. The challenging thing for me is when I was an employee doing what the manager was suppose to do but I and some other had to do it for her because she couldn't do it.
good,"Management plays favorites and hired someone incompetent, from outside the company, for a department manager position when a coworker had years of experience and I ended up training him for several days, and still got a talking too for not getting all the days work done."
good,I did not like the way that they ran the establishment. Management was unprofessional and it wasn't very organized there.
good,"This company had great benefits, and even though they only allowed up to 30-35 hours per week, they still treated you as a full time employee with benefits. Many different kinds of people in this company, and most don't mind sharing their personal needs, but it showed me that everyone just needs a smile, and stay positive, so they can be more positive."
good,I was pleased to gain employment with Wal-Mart but was dealing with a lot of personal issues.  After having been in the hospital over night I was told by my Dr. not to work for the next two days.  When I took the note to my manager I was told that I needed to work the next two days and take my scheduled days off as rest days per the Dr.  Shorty after this I quit.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"This job was more busy than it was relaxed. Co-workers were nice and I enjoyed my time there. For the most part, my interactions with people were friendly, but of course there was always a few angry customers."
good,"Very nice place to work ! "
good,"When I would get to work I would punch in and immediately i would start up in doing what I needed to do. it was a fast paced environment with a quota of how many picks we were supposed to get individually within the span of our first four hours of work. So i personally rushed around and tried to make at least 50 over my quota every single day. Walmart was not one that very well rewarded such effort, instead often ignoring their employees and slacking off in the office talking about events from the weekend, While if we were caught doing such a thing it might cause for us to be reprimanded. When asking managers for help they often put it off, and sometimes you would be waiting days to hear back from them. Then they would wonder why employees were angry because they could not get approved of time off or otherwise, due to the managers having not followed up as they should have. I would say the hardest part of the job was sometimes staying motivated to keep working because of lack of incentive, and the nearly 0 tolerance policy for missing work. You were allowed three days that you could miss work, and after that if you missed you began what they called the coaching process. I had many medical issues including and not limited to trying to take care of my teeth. Many know that trying to do anything with a horrible tooth ache is close to impossible, but Walmart did not care about that and instead would not work with me when work had to be missed, whether for emergency room visits or planned appointments. I presented documentation from the emergency room doctors and still they refused"
good,"Too many customers not enough cashiers."
good,Everyone gets along with one another there and the time goes by fast. There is always something to do there and always an opportunity for advancement.
good,Walmart was a nice place to work and great for you to interact with people on a daily basis if you were a people person. Nothing was hard about the work and the people there were friendly.
good,The customers were mostly happy and friendly. The managers were nice and helpful and they gave your schedule out in advance which was good but sometimes hard to make plans with.
good,"I started this job as a overnight stocker as i grew more in the company i became more faster ,Knowledgeable and efficient. I was moved around alot to help in other areas help recieving ,co workers and customers. i learned how to use a forklift ,time management skills ,organizational skills and management skills . I had a great overnight manager not so much store manager at that time. Cant really say anything hard about the job its hard work had really great benefits . I enjoyed alot of the people i used to work with there we all worked hard and had great work ethics ."
good,"Challenging place to work where I learned many different techniques on how to deal with customers and other employes. Learned many procedures and policies. A great place to start off, and it is relatively easy to grow in the company. Very understanding co-workers. I enjoyed the experience."
good,Is a job that you have to have a god set of people you work around to help make the stressful night become smoother and to know you do have help if needed.
good,"Sales, customer service with the customers every helpful and learning to handle orders from managers. very nice place to work"
good,Productive and always get the work done. Good place to start learning about retail stores.Alot of red tape but still great place to start
good,Management needs to work on communication skills. Associates work well together to complete tasks in a timely manner.
good,"It was a great place to work at, I always enjoyed myself being there. I love making people smile and to help them feel better about themselves and working as a cashier, I did just that."
good,O dia dia de trabalho era calmo tinha problemas como qualquer lugar mas era um ambiente limpo e agradavel e a gerencia ajudava e valorizava nossos serviços .
good,Great company to join if you want flexible hours for a school schedule. Offers great health care benefits. Now hard to advance.
good,"The company has given me a stepping stone back to the work environment after a death in my family. I enjoy the daily work I do everyday, my co-workers and customers have ben enjoyable."
good,"I was able to learn useful new skills and interact with a great crew. I only left due to moving."
good,Been with the company for 14 years and they have helped mold me to a great leader. Supportive management and always room for growth.
good,"The management let you do your work on your own time, and didn't breathe down your neck. It was nice to have that in a workplace. They also came to you for your breaks."
good,"Typical day would be running the front end I was over about 20 cashiers, I learned customer service skills, how to be a manager, I interacted with my co-workers and let them know if they needed anything to come to me. "
good,Quick turn-over with my co-workers. Which made me more flexible with my surroundings. Only hard part is having to cramp all I know to the new associate in a short period of time. But it was enjoyable to know them as they told me of their experiences.
good,"The typical overnight shift was from 10:00pm-7:00am, so it was usually a long night. I learned about the freight that I was stocking and how to stock them properly, how to use the compactor machines, and how to zone the assigned area. The co-workers and management were helpful. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep up in such a short amount of time, but the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers find what they need."
good,As a cashier I was part time. Around the holidays they would just hire a bunch of temps instead of giving us more hours. The chances to move up were good and I have seen people go far with them.
good,"This is a good foundation to gain experience, but it is not somewhere to plan a future. The biggest complaint i have is job security. The turn around of management is excessive and long term employees always end up transferring to another location. Your always on pins and needles not knowing if your coming in to a smooth night or reprimanding for something that was out of your control"
good,"the hardest part of the job was in the first week, in which was hard for me to stand on my feet continuously for 8 hours."
good,overall i loved the fast pace environment and i loved working with customers. it was friendly there. i worked with money and handling transactions. my co workers were friendly and managers always willing to help. i learned how to be more patient.
good,"I liked it personally, I had fun and worked hard. We worked as a team, and learned from each. All in all i can't complain.I learned a lot here with hand on work."
good,"I grew up in the company and for 10 years I learned most everything I know about retail and merchandise from this company. I also learned how to hone my people skills around hiring, retaining and leading the team to profitable outcomes. I was a company that spent a lot of training in their management teams."
good,"well established company, company  you know will be around for a long time, good retirement, company discount card, easy to move up in position"
good,this is a job that can be very fun but also very demanding and stressful. however they do pay more than most people think. I worked here for 7 years and I made a bunch of friends and moved up rather quick
good,This job was a great learning experience. Being able to learn how medications work and do not work. I got to better understand how things were done. I also get to meet a lot of different people on a day to day basis.
good,"A typical day at work consists of providing excellent customer service, working the picks or restocking items, zoning the departments, making sure go-backs are done, being a cashier, and making sure hazardous material is taken care of before my shift is over. I learned many of the skills necessary to start making my way up in the company. Management and coworkers were very friendly, but of course there is always going to be some kind of drama in every work place. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was interacting and helping the customers."
good,My daily activities consisted of making sure merchandise is fully and displayed properly. Maintain a positive upbeat attitude in a fast paced environment. Train new employees. Worked often with other co-workers to achieve a common goal.
good,Lots of hours with the ability to do overtime. Also they were willing to work with your schedule as much as they could. They were very understanding as well. Over all a great place to work.
good,Learned to work well with others in a team capacity. Management was a good group of people to work for. Co-workers for the most part were also pretty good. I wouldn't say that any part of the job was all that hard.
good,"So far one of the best places I worked at. I had a set schedule and got time off when asked. My job was in the back and I was always lifting heavy things, but I loved every minute of it."
good,Es un lindo lugar de trabajo en donde se pueden aprender un montón de cuestiones pero que queda chica para desarrollarse profesionalmente.
good,"Typical retail stocking job."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for as long as you're prepared to work very hard. The hard work is worth the benefits. Long work days but you get multiple days off, in a row, which is rare for a retail position."
good,"Very fast paced work place, good managers. Not so focused in making money, but very focused on customer service. Also got the chance to work with other college students"
good,I took a job at Walmart because I needed the money.  I really dont like working retail.  What I like about this current job is that I am treated more fairly here then when I worked in the bindery.  I enjoyed my previous job.  I liked working with Machines and  emplyees at that time
good,"a typical day at work was making sure the store was ready for the customers to come in and shop. working at Wal-Mart was my first job it taught me people skills, how to handle anything that comes my way. I learned how to stock shelves and how to handle groceries. my co-workers were very friendly even though some of them gave orders like they were the boss and walked around doing nothing or pushing a shopping cart. management was fair to a certain point. my most important I enjoyed working with a select few people that  got to work with and I enjoyed the job to a certain instinct."
good,"great environment"
good,the management and all the co workers get a long good. it was a good place to work at.. the hardest part about the job is getting everything done before your shift was over.. the most enjoyable part was meeting new people. I learned how to help people out.
good,"A typical day at work involves typing and filling anywhere from 200 to 400 prescriptions. All of my co-workers get along great which makes the job flow very smoothly. Also, it makes the job enjoyable. I wouldn't say that  there is one task I consider harder than another. Once you've done it for a while everything becomes second nature."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, bom ambiente de trabalho, onde pude desenvolver profissionalmente, além disso fiz muitos amigos."
good,Ask for so many favors and expect you to be done at a specific time to help someone else always on you wont let you breath for a second and the do have there favors.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people. They are very big on numbers because they are one of three labs in the states that provide glasses to all Walmarts. Management says they want you to personally develop but hardly ever follows up with you. The twelve hour shifts are also kind of hard, although it does give a three day weekend."
good,"Very fast paced, focus is key. I learned to work as a team and you accomplish a lot more. When you have a strong leader your day goes very smooth.my co-workers are like my extended family we all have each others back and work in sync. The hardest part of my job is when is when someone calls off and even then once I get my grips its fine. Working with people that make your work day enjoyable"
good,When working in inventory management I enjoyed working with a small team and always know what exactly needed to be done each day. Helped management as well with their merchandise when needed as well.
good,My overall thought of Wal-Mart was that it was an alright work place. It definitely was not the worst place to work but was also not the best place to work.
good,all ideals are heard and team work is strong. always something new to learn ways to improve. always someone willing to help as well as teach..
good,Started this job in high school. I got into the work force with this job. It was ok to start out in but not if you have family.
good,Unload Trucks. stalk shelves and organize stalk i learned how to work well with others. hardest part of job was working overnights
good,I did not like the way they did some things but my overall experience was great and would do it again. it was a very good experience for me.
good,"Wal-Mart has great opportunities, however the way that their schedules are set up is concerning, especially for the CSM. Sometimes their isn't any coverage and if your the closing CSM you have to open 5 sometimes 6:30 in the morning, I'm concerned because I'm only getting four hours of sleep. I love my position and what I do, but the hours running together like it does is wearing me down and when you talk to management about it the say well, you have to do what you have to do. I feel as though it should be handled better than that."
good,"the most enjoyable part of this job is that all get along and we all work togeter and making customers happy."
good,"My job is 8 hour's  of non stop running,I have 2 department's plus battery's and as seen on TV,I love my job,but I don't feel like I'm getting the pay or respect I deserve,I really want to move up in the management world,I know I'm ready and can do any job I put my mind too.I have learned a lot about upper management in my 10 year's with Wal-Mart,both good and bad,but have learned the basic's of being a good supervisor.I do very well with responsibility and I am a strong leader. I think the worst part of my job is hearing the word TEAM,because those are the people who never seem to help or have the time to listen to you,where I work it's all about who your buddy is,I run my department's on my own,do the job I am suppose to do,and go home,I take a lot of pride in my job performance and the way my dept.'s look to our customer's and to my supervisor's.The company is a wonderful place to work with lot's of advancement available,I just feel like ive went as far in the company as I want to go.Im ready to tackle the world and let my abilitiy's shine!"
good,"My job was to collect the carts from the parking lot and make sure the cart rack in the store always had a sufficient supply of carts available. My management team was great and very supportive. We spent a lot of time laughing as we worked. Occasionally when someone would call out or the store was short staffed, I had the opportunity to be trained and practice on register. The most difficult part of the job was the heat. I spent about 95% of my time outside on the asphalt in the parking lot throughout the summer months. Some days would get to 100 degrees and staying hydrated while trying to get work done was not always very easy. My favorite part of the job was the people that I worked with. They never failed to keep you entertained the entire shift, making time go by very quickly."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work for someone who can't sit still. It requires quick thinking and the ability to adjust at a moments notice. "
good,"The working day at Wal-Mart consisted of opening and closing the oil and tire shop stoking and rotating shelves, pushing sales , changing oil and tires, and installing batteries."
good,Buena ya que tenias muchas oportunidades. y esto nos da a entender que la empresa es buena y asi si te gusta trabajar.
good,"A typical day on the job consisted of filling prescriptions, answering questions from patients, settling unpaid claims with insurance companies, and dancing with the ladies in the pharmacy."
good,"It is a good company to work for , mut attached to procedures and regglas , good working environment , a lot of teamwork ."
good,I honestly liked working with the public and being in customer service. I wouldn't mind going back to this job in the future. It really makes you appreciate what people on the other side of the counter are doing when you go in other facilities.
good,Its a great place to start and move up the chain and gain valuable experience.i started out as part time and got moved up quickly. I am thankful for the learning experience.
good,I learned to manage 2 Departments. And enhanced my customer service.I learn how train employees in customer service and retail.
good,"Job Description and Duties:"
good,The management is terrible. All the managers give you tasks that go in different directions instead of collaborating with each other to get things complete. But with all that said you will still get blamed for attempting to complete them all
good,Clock in at 430 a.m. have a start up w/ mgr then log onto my computer and open my assigned doors. load pallets as they came. Or pull orders when short handed just to ensure that the job was completed in a timely manner.
good,"every day was different-- co workers were friendly-- management kept changing and each assist manager would have a different idea of what they wanted for the dept..( ie. expectations, etc)"
good,"- Um dia típico de trabalho  "
good,Working at that retail business for 5 years was a growing experience. From learning everything working with their handheld to using operating machines in the backroom to help move freight as fast as possible. I've managed a whole department for quite some time and experienced the daily life of a service area. The problems and issues with cars can be a stressful thing but that's where the management skills come into play.
good,"a loja a qual trabalhei, tinha dificuldade em fixar funcionários. Sobre meu cargo era posto toda a responsabilidade de encarregada Adm, sem remuneração em cima."
good,"Walmart was a good company to work for, when it comes to learning how to handle money, and how to handle the public in a friendly manner. Typical day at work you would great several hundred customers a day, you sometimes started developing bonds with customers that were regulars. Management was good, sometimes a little stricter than normal."
good,"Typical day at Wal-Mart is helping and serving customers in a friendly fast paced manner, and being efficient. When not helping customers due to low volume of customers in store, I will be stocking shelves and even doing restock when possible. I also do customer service/courtesy desk and help customers there and refund and return things. I try and make the customers happy as customers always come first. I have learned a lot while working here and I plan on using what I have learned in my future employment and everyday life when possible. My co-workers are absolutely fantastic and we are like one big family."
good,the people that work there was fun to work with we kept each other laughing and having fun. the management team was cool u just had to call on them a lot of time for help.
good,Very enjoyable work. . The co-workers are very friendly and helpful. I learned a lot working at the jewelry counter. Very fun place to work.
good,"Management is great, but that depends on location. Requires heavy lifting at times. You don't just have one boss, you have several who may ask you to do 3 other tasks while youre already working on 2 already."
good,My day consisted of stocking the merchandise in a timely manner...your assignment would need to be completed before leaving...i liked the fact that i didnt have anyone standing over me while working
good,A day at Walmart consisted of working as a team to keep the shelves full of food at all times. The worst part of the job was having to deal with difficult costumers.
good,"Fast, Clean and Friendly for customers. Not bad for a paycheck and the job is always looking for ways to improve performance and accuracy."
good,I learned to always say have a nice day to customers rather they are rude. Management was pretty fair. Co-workers at Wal-Mart was like one big family. The hardest part was dealing with rude and disrespectable customers.The most enjoyable part was we treated each other like family.
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers, but at the same time some of the customers were the hardest part of the job. My co-workers were easy to get along with."
good,Benefits were ok for part time workers.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers.  I divided my time between the sales floor and the check out.  Also restocked inventory.
good,"Solid summer job if you're in the business of lawn care. Fun, flexible hours. Kind owner. A large yard and driveway. Lots of dogs, lots of sunshine, lots of fun."
good,"Walmart is a great place to learn costumer service, management, and product information. All kinds of customers are attracted to this establishment ."
good,"A day at Walmart.I clock in on time,check in with my manager.I had good helping coworkers.I learned how to deal/dispose hazardous materials."
good,"Worked with sales, cashier, customer service, stocking and receiving."
good,"A typical work day, for me being a Cashier was somewhat lid back when there was a slow pace. But other days it was busy and U would be moving various items nonstop  for two hours straight. It's a decent place to work because the employees are treated very well and I get along well with a lot of my co-workers. The overall experience working there is pretty good."
good,"A lot to offer, but had troubles time to time with management. Pay could've been better for the work we were expected to produce."
good,"different managers made it difficult but there's lots of great coworkers that all stick together and make the job fun. the customers for the area are all interesting and fun. no day is alike, there's ALWAYS something fun or surprising happening. Some days drag on but that's for any job/career. enjoyed working there"
good,My typical day at work consist of making sure that the customers leave happy and satisfied.  I love meeting new people and learn just a little about them so I would listen and learn from them.
good,"A typical days at work would be starting the day filling prescriptions that were called in over night before we open. Answering phone calls from patients and calling physicians was a big part of the job. You may also need to call an insurance company to see why the medication was not covered. I would say that almost half of a typical day at work is spent on the phone. Another big part of the job is helping the customers. Whether it be to find something over the counter or helping them with their prescriptions, customers always came first. I would say that I learned more than I thought I would. I learned how to make customers happy when they were furious about an issue they had. I also learned that working as a team is crucial in many circumstances. I enjoyed most of my co-workers. When i started there, they were all very helpful and very hard working. I knew i could count on them for just about anything. The hardest part of the job would be controlling frustration. Every day there would be a customer who wasn't happy, whether it was because of us or their insurance. They would occasionally yell and call names that were uncalled for. Learning to just get over it was difficult at first, but now it's simply an every day thing. You cant please everyone, but I certainly try. Sometimes you need to kill them with kindness. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and my co-workers. It ended up being a home away from home. The regular customers we had that would come in and tell us about their weekend or their family made all those frustrating moments go away. Between the"
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in, and doing whatever your manager tells you what to do. The majority of management here has not been very helpful, which is why a typical day is just being told what to do. They don't do much, at least not on the sales floor. Customers can be friendly, but they can also be extremely rude. If you are just looking for a job to make some money, Walmart is tolerable. If you're actually looking for a job to enjoy, I wouldn't suggest it. The hardest part of the job is trying to help customers find items they want, but they don't know what they're called. When a customer wants something that doesn't even exist, and then gets angry when you can't find this imaginary project, things can get frustrating. The most enjoyable part of the job is enjoying who you work with. Walmart is a big store, so of course, there are a lot of employees. With all of those employees there is a wide range of different people. You would find at least one person that you enjoy working with."
good,"Unloading trucks, scanning over product in bins and racks. Stocking on the floor with product from the back, setting of the floor for the overnight associate to come in."
good,I UNLOADED RECEIVING TRUCKS PULLED MERCHANDISE IN OUR INVENTORY FOR DEPT MANAGERS AND THEN STOCKED THEM the people i worked for where awsome
good,"It was pretty nice working for the remodeling service. It was a friendly environment, it was a hard working job and I liked putting in effort into it."
good,"A typical day would consist of clocking in, going to designated work area (such as craft dpt.) and stocking and organizing shelves. The work was fairly simple, but the management staff wasn't as supportive as they should have been."
good,Enjoyed working there and the majority of people working there. Hard work but enjoyable. Learned how to use equipment I never had worked with before. Great hours and upward mobility.
good,The was a great place to work because of the manager of the pharmacy Mark Marak. He was easy to work with and good at helping me work on my weaknesses.
good,Good place to work with chances to move to management. Fast pace environment with a great place to gain customer service skills.
good,"I Loved working at Walmart as a cashier , Great Benefits , Nice Lunch Breaks , Good pay , Easy Job and I had the opportunity too meet new people every day."
good,"They had a favorite system, and for the most part management was very rude. They would constantly yell at their employees, and had a problem with power trips, they really thought the world revolved around them. Once, a lady had to leave because her son had a car accident and was injured badly.. the manager told her that it could wait, that she should finish her shift."
good,"Dia-a-dia bem corrido e dinâmico como muita coisa à aprender, como, lidar com clientes, organização, responsabilidade e administração e sistema da empresa, além de crescimento proficional."
good,"Working for Walmart was a lot of fun. My coworkers loved me, and after my promotion I felt like they respected me as well. The largest issue at our store is with management. Management has a do as I say not as I do attitude. They do not lead by example, and refuse to take suggestions on topics they are not experts in. This causes the entire store to be in disarray and many employees to begin feeling negatively about their jobs."
good,"One perk was Christmas or seasonal party, summer picnic, cook out for betting sales for a month from the month last year, safety incentives, all of these went away when she started within a month.  She started harassing long term associates and coaching them. People started to transfer stores, quit, or just disappear.  Before that the moral was higher with more help and people were always helping others. Even after, we still continued to help each other because that was the best way for all of to get our work done. We had to help each other to kept our moral up.  The customers do suffer but we did our best to kept them satisfied."
good,Easy when you first get there and the day goes on it gets harder and more stressful.But the people that work there and the customers there is what makes the job a good job
good,they do not give you good enough pay for the labor you have to do and they also work you long hours. you'll be in a hot truck for hours with minimum water. its just not worth it.
good,treats workers good. they notice hard workers and promote based on work not on seniority. good work environment. managers do show a bit of favoritism so treat them right.
good,"I really enjoyed my job at wal mart and I loved all the co workers I worked with, There was plenty of training and room for improvement and chances of advancement and they were very patient and worked with me around my personal issues"
good,"A day at Walmart is interesting since you deal with a multitude of different personalities. Our management made sure we followed guidelines when handling customers or food. Our co-workers were very friendly and informative when something was taught. The hardest part about this job was making sure that we met prep time on all items since the inventory was so vast. I enjoyed dealing with all the customers that came, it brought a different dynamic to what we called work, so much so, to the point it didn't really feel like work."
good,"learned the telzon"
good,I enjoyed working with customers. I actively took part in my employees lives and careers. I enjoyed the opportunity to travel with the company.
good,"Wal-Mart was where I learned the true meaning of teamwork.  We were always taught to support one another; even amongst different departments.  I had wonderful co-workers who treated me with respect and would always find time to help me when needed.  I learned very quickly that customer satisfaction affects everyone; positive or negative.  Having partook in customer service on a daily basis, I learned to problem solve and utilize co-workers for support when needed."
good,"I unloaded Pallets and restore to shelf's, cashier and customer service. ability to handle all customer questions and great learner and problem solver;"
good,Okay place to work. I like tire and auto and I didn't do much else with the rest of the store. I was never able to learn other job roles
good,It is a great environment to work in if you have people skills. The pay is very low in my opinion for such a large chain of stores.
good,always busy but its always something to  do and stay productive always new encounters everybody didn't always get along but I prided myself on just doing my job
good,"Each day is a learning process.. There's always an opportunity and room for growth, working for Wal-Mart is an overall great experience from management to associates to the customers."
good,"It is a nice place to work to develop inventory, retail and interpersonal skills. Many of the positions open up fairly often and are relatively easy to learn so it has a nice learning curve."
good,Walmart is an lovely workplace with very nice people for co workers. I only left because I needed a job that offered a better salary and more benefits than Walmart could have offered me.
good,"I liked this place to work, a typical day would include interacting with customers, clean registers, operate registers"
good,Worked cashier an outdoors majority of times. I learned how to be more efficient an time oriented . Managers were great. Co-workers were great. Most enjoyable part was environment .
good,Walmart is a great company to work for.  I enjoy working on cars therefore i enjoyed what i did.  I brought alot of experience with me being that i had worked at Jiffy Lube.
good,"Create a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for customers, and fellow associates."
good,"Management expects a lot and it gets hard when you don't have the help you need or the tools to be successful. ""Daily Tasks"" seem to change on a regular basis. Not very consistent."
good,Muy buen ambiente laboral muy buenos compañeros mas porque a mi me apoyaron mas los de nadro que sabian mas y por eso aprendi tantas cosas en ese ramo con todos me llevaba muy bien con la promotoria tambien
good,"Seeing repeat customers come looking for you to check them out."
good,"If your fresh out of high school or just looking for something extra on the side this company maybe right for you. Decent pay, benefits, and environment. My stay was short so I don't have much to say."
good,It was a good place to work. It is a good company. Employees are nice. I think it depends on which store you work at. Store is clean. Restrooms are dirty. Depends on who you work under.
good,I have been with this company for a long time. I believe no matter the job you provide an honest days work for an honest days pay
good,"This job has given me exposure to an array of responsibilities, as well as colleague personalities. Management and supervisors have consistently commented on my exceptional ability to show leadership skills. I have a strong work ethic, and have been told on many occasions that ""I'll get the job done"". Furthermore, Walmart provided flexible work shifts, enabling me to address my family's needs. However, this has changed, and I am now able to work flexible hours."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart and all my co-workers really ended up being like family. Everyone was supportive of one another and we really relied on each other on those rough days especially during the holidays. I learned so much about being a customer service supervisor and I like that each day was different. The obstacles that I went through such as problems throughout the day whether it was with a coworker, customer, or technical such as register crashing on helped me have more confidence in myself and learning to adapt to those situations and solve them in a timely, calm fashion."
good,"I worked a 12 hour shift on Saturday-Monday which allowed me to get a B.S. in geology through the week. I enjoyed the physical labor required of the job at the distribution center. The majority of my co-workers were easy to associate with, and the management team was very interested in associate input."
good,Clocking in on time learned to stay busy hardest part is dealing with people when there is not enough resources to do job.
good,"While working at walmart I had a good time. The people that I worked with were very hard workers and had great attitudes. However I didnt like mopping the floor at the end of the night, cause I always went home with wet pants."
good,"My typical day at work involves a lot of associate interaction. With this, associates have to be up to date on all compliance training and I have to ensure there is a proper plan in place to achieve the goal. I interact with the candidate from the very start; from looking at applications, to calling them in for an interview, to the job offer, orientation and the onboarding process, etc."
good,"great place to work at, they are some what flexible with your work/school schedule. management is great when they know what they are doing and making sure that the customers are satisfied with their outcome."
good,I learned so much about how a company is ran and all about customer service and proper business behavior  at work. My co-workers were great and very friendly. Management had a hard time having one on one time with each employee just because it is such a large company with so much going on everyday. The hardest part of the Job was moving up with in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers and pleasing them.
good,I usually come in to work and I see what register I'm going to and I learned a lot about cash handling and running a cash register. I loved my managers. I thought they were friendly and informative. I think the hardest part of my job was remembering all the functions of every key. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with people everyday.
good,"Great ups and downs but overall great. Great management, great people, and overall a good experience on how to treat others. If youo havent leaned to be in a high pace job this will help"
good,"It was ok but the people there where kinda rude to new employees and wanted the newbies to do everything instead of them. i liked the hours, but did not like the department mamagers that were working there."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"I worked there almost seven years. It was the best job I've had so far. It was challenging but rewarding. I had days I absolutely hated it, but at the end of the day I felt accomplished. Management could be better but it's probably better than other companies."
good,"You clock in and get your register assignment, make sure your register is stocked. When we are slow we zone our areas.I work with really nice people and enjoy my job. I like helping people and some times just taking the time to be nice to someone goes a very long. I don't like the shift hours that I work. My schedule is never the same.My family life is very hard due to my husband always having the weekends off. Other than vacation I have never had a weekend off, in 2 plus years."
good,I loved my experience at Walmart i actually looked forward to going to work everyday. The customers and also management was very friendly and nice i kept them smiling and they did the same to me. the only reason i left Walmart was because i had a higher paying job offer with aramark transporting patients in Baylor in garland.
good,it was hard work but i enjoyed the people i worked with and the new things that i learned from working there. i got payed alright money and i had a schedule that changed a lot but overall it was a pretty good place to work.
good,each day was a new challenge but working along side my coworkers made work so much better ive learned alot working along side management but some just was there for the money which was the hardest thing to deal with but overall a great place to work
good,walmart was a good place to work at got along with the people and the other associates. learned new skills along with the job as well to build my job skills
good,"I stocked whatever department was given to me at the start of my shift, which could include up to 10 pallets stacked 6ft high with boxes. I mainly stocked bath and body supplies. There was a lot of management, and I did like a few of them. My coworkers where enjoyable, and helpful. The hardest part of the job was learning how to bail the cardboard. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the job itself."
good,"The overall summary of the job is that the job is easy. The management really doesn't know what they are doing, poor management there but the co workers are what makes the job worth it. The most enjoyable part of the day is waking up knowing its going to be rough but your co workers and associates are there to make your day much better."
good,"Working at the vision center I have learned to work with all types of personalities and as a team in a busy environment.  During a busy work day we can see up to thirty patients of all ages."
good,A day a Walmart starts by making sure freight from the night before is worked and binned in it's proper place. The managers communicate with the Department managers to let them know what needs to be completed. Each Department assist others when need to complete task. The most difficult part of the job is keeping up with customer demands or request. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you can make a customer happy after they have searched for a product but was unable to find it on the shelf and you go to the stockroom and locate it.
good,I had trepidations about working for Walmart but they were one of the better employers I have had. I was treated well and the managers always had my back when customers decided to tear into me. I did enjoy working there though. I was sad to leave when and how I did but I would work there again.
good,The pace at Wal-Mart is fast. People are friendly and they provide a lot of computer safety training. Upward mobility is encouraged.
good,A typical day at work was interacting and helping customers find they needs they are looking for. Folding clothes and organizing while maintaining cleanliness.
good,It was nice working at that location. Store was always clean. Customers were most of the time friendly. Staffs were friendly as well.
good,Management was very time oriented. Hardest part of the job was getting all the inventory on the shelves. Most enjoyable was completing my days work early.
good,a typical work day was long but at times was fun and very productive. I learned how to interact with people and how to multi task easily. Management was usually pretty laid back and would allow you to do other things throughout the store if you didn't want to be a on register. My coworkers ranged from very nice to not wanting to have any dealing with anyone customers and employees both. the hardest part of my job was dealing with associate managers who did not want to be bothered with you. the most enjoyable part was zoning the aisles and taking back returns.
good,Wal-Mart was a good job because I had a lot of room to grow and learn new trades such as cake decorating and placing inventory orders. It was a very fast place work environment which I really enjoyed I love to stay busy.
good,Great place to work to provide for yourself. Offers benefits and 401K to full time associates. Work environment is fair.
good,My time and the knowledge i gained from Co workers was priceless.Longer employed employees generally knew how things where ran better than upper management.
good,I have been working at Walmart for six years now. I started out as a cashier now I'm a overnight stocker. I enjoy the customers and my coworkers. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I have completed all my work and able to help others finish their job. I have learned to have a lot of patience dealing with people and my job.
good,I gained a lot of work experience during my time at Wal-Mart. I had a chance to work in various positions and made many friends while I was employed there.
good,"Generally, I'd come in and work the office. Sometimes all day, sometimes only in the mornings. Aside from that, I'd help around other departments in the store. I learned everything from accounting and records maintenance to merchandising and markdowns. The associates I worked with made my experience there great. We could laugh and wax philosophical together, all while maintaining a professional standard. My biggest challenges were learning new tasks often and quickly, but that's part of what made the experience so rewarding. Having worked at three different stores, I've found that the atmosphere largely varies from one to the other. My best experiences were in Swansea, MA and Lawrenceville, GA. Overall, though, I'd say Walmart is a good company to work for."
good,"Typically I assisted customers with merchandise in the electronic dept. "
good,"My typical day is counting my draw , making sure my front end is clean and stocked up, maintaining a positive attitude and being very professional with every customer."
good,"A day at Walmart is usually a good fast paste day and I have learned more people skills and better ways to deal with money. My co-workers are great and I have no problems with any of them, they are all very supportive and are great at helping me anytime I have a question. The hardest part of my job would be when a customer asks me to do something with money that I haven't done before or when they ask where an item is in the store and I don't know where it is. Seeing happy customers and knowing that I was one of the last people in the store to help them and give them a reason to come back to the store is the best part of the job."
good,"I assigned specific tasks to specific associates for the day, express my expectations to reach successful goals, assist associates in reaching my goals, interact with customers expressing complaints or good feedback."
good,"Prior to working here, I had never worked on vehicles. During my first few months here I had a lot of on the job training which was very beneficial. Over time I knew the system very well and was eventually training new employees."
good,"Wal-Mart was my first job. Great for someone just starting out. Daily tasks werent too hard. I was overnight cashier so my job was not only being a cashier and ""zoning"" my area, I also did stocking if needed. Management had some flaws, but over all a great team. Hardest part of the job is the first couple days, after that its cake."
good,I was the go to girl. I was able to efficiently and effectively work in any department of the store. I enjoyed working here and helping others.
good,Typical day at Walmart was a little stressful but I held it together a lot of complaining customers because of the lack of cashiers. What I learned at Walmart was patience. I had patience but this job really showed me that you really got to have a lot of patience when it comes to these types of jobs. Management was ok could have been better but ok. Some of my co workers was rude but for the most part I got along with everyone. The hardest part was having to hear the customers complain about there being no cashiers. The most enjoyable part was the customers that had patience and like to see us happy and don't give us a hard time about it not being enough of us.
good,I have to work hard and learned that Wal-Mart Canada have employ more than 60000 people in their stores. My co-workers is okay.
good,"A typical night of work would be have a huge load of work put on you, even as a new employee not knowing where anything goes. Management expects you to complete large loads of freight, however, once you get used to your supervisors and the workplace, it can be a fun place to work at, depending on your management. Co-workers are from a variety of backgrounds and you can end up learning about other cultures. The hardest part of the job is having to complete the heaviest workload of the store, and management keeps asking or telling you to go perform other duties while you still need to complete all of yours. The most fun part of the job is that when you are noticed as a high performance individual by management and they take an interest in you for better opportunities."
good,"i enjoy working for the company just need better compensation for the job that i do on a typical day i generally set up for general merchandise trucks to be unloaded im supervisor or a crew of six unloaders whom have to unload the trucks in a timely manner the freight has to the be put on pallets and pulled to the proper departments within the store.On other days i do inventory control such as picking merchandise out of bins useing a gemini as well as binning any overstock merchandise that will not go out to the sales floor,stock any picks that need to go to the sales floor,scan for lows and outs on the sales floor to keep it stock from the back room.the hardes part of my job is when i am short staffed and i dont have enough people to unload the trucks the most enjoyable part is when we are all in unison and on a small truck the workflow goes so smoothly i get along well with all of my co-workers within walmart"
good,Productive and a fun place to work and grow.Great associates with much knowledge and abilities.many job opportunities exist.
good,Working here had its ups and downs. Interacting with customers and doing our everyday essentials wasnt the hard part; dealing with the managers were.
good,"I loved working for walmart.  They knew what you were good at and utilized your strengths.  If they paid a little more, I'd go back in a heart beat.  Pay rate is the reason I left."
good,What i like most about walmart is that it provides you a alt way to learn different things in the company and to enjoy the luxury of being able to lean new things
good,One stop shopping under one roof. You can find all you need from pharmacy items to grocery needs and automotive to gardening.
good,"Overseeing all employees."
good,Typical day at work was going in and starting shift at 10. Go in and sit and wait to know where and how much your going to be stocking that night. Management was already and stressful sometime. My co-workers were great to get along with. The hardest part of the job was that you had a set time to stock your items. The most enjoyable part of the job was the working with your co-workers and working by yourself most of the time.
good,"Usually there is a lot of stocking and ordering that needs to be done, In the processes of stocking and order I have learn what sales good and what does not. Management is welling to teach, and train. Co workers they and welling do get the job done. The job can be very demanding and dealing with schedule changes around the holiday. Love helping the customers."
good,I spent the majority of time in apparel in the fitting room. I answered the phones and stocked the shelves. I wrote markdowns and located items in the back of the store. Cashier duty was rough since it was such a fast paced environment.
good,It is usually always busy. I love being busy because time goes by faster and it is juts my thing. The management is nice and very fair about things. I love making people smile and being reliable with customers.
good,I was always busy I like working retail. This was a good place to work for me I got to do a variety of tasks. I enjoyed the environment as well as helping customers
good,i pushed a cleaning cart around the store looking for and making sure there where no spills or anything that can be hazardous for the customer. cleaned the bathrooms. the best thing about working here was the 3 breaks and some of the people.the worst thing was a 15-20 min drive and most of the time boring. i would rather be working and doing something than just sitting around waiting for something to happen the time goes by faster.
good,"Freight and sales daily"
good,Working at Walmart I have learned so many different things form so many different people from the guests coming in the door to the employees even the managers take time out of there busy routine to help you out no matter what your issue may be.
good,Making sure the register is clean.  Ringing up customers purchases.  Helping my co-workers if I do not have a customer.  I enjoy meeting new people and seeing the ones that come in daily.
good,"Taught fundamental job skills such as responsibility, customer service, handling money. Pretty laid back. Great for people like me who love to organize things and watch and discuss movies."
good,Its a great place to work. I loved working overnight shifts there. The pay was average but it was good enough for me to get by.
good,"Abria la tienda la lavaba con el equipo , hacia juntas de integración, capacitaba al personal, pagos, incidencias y nómina."
good,"Learned a lot of important skills for filling/filing prescriptions, placing orders for pharmacy and customers, good co-workers"
good,There was a lack of structure and communication among managers. One manager would have me work on a project then another would override that manager and have me do something entirely different without conferring with the first manager on a constant basis.The hardest thing  about my job was completing a task without conflict. The main thing I learned there has to be constant communication.
good,WALMART is a fun job to have the work environment is great dealing with different customers the helping with different types of services customers needed to be meant.
good,I like how fast-paced Wal-Mart was. I am not sure if we were always busy because of the location or the lack of employees there were but I always enjoyed the challenge. I was only considered part time so I didn't get to receive any benefits but I did get a merchandise discount after working there for 90 days.
good,This job was good for a beginner right out of high school. The hours are not great. And the managers are never concerned about how you are doing as an employee.
good,Typical cashier position.  Dealing with nice and not no nice customers can be challenging but the coworkers were very nice and helpful.
good,"Working at Walmart is a fun and life changing expeirment. You learn new and everyday life values while also meeting and interacting with customers, and other associates."
good,"Walmart was very great job to work at. But, I feel that I did not get enough opportunities to expand my selection of career opportunities."
good,"As a manager, I learned a lot of the working efficently and always getting the work done. I loved building a nice work relationship with my co-workers."
good,"Upon Arrival, I would have pallets in which I would have to stock for the day.  My duty for the whole day was to stock merchandise. Stock products on shelves and receive merchandise from incoming trucks."
good,"- Ensuring customer service was at an efficient and optimum speed"
good,"Walked  into a friendly work environment, smiles from each employee and greetings. Typically clock in on time and began to work, I've learned how to communicate well with others. Also gained the efficient amount of knowledge about the company and how to use their software. Management was sometimes off with timing and scheduling, my co workers were likable people, I even pushed some co worker relations outside of work. They were helpful to me when I first began because I didn't know much. The most difficult part about my job was costumers coming into my line with a product without a label. My enjoyable moments about working for WalMart was being able to help people and assist them to products that they inquired."
good,"A typical evening at work revolved around stocking shelves of various pallets of inventory, and then cleaning the area by a certain time, while also assisting customers."
good,"A typical day started with cleaning all the areas of the store as a team, then do returns and organize your own designated area. Check in the new shipments of jewelry and stock both jewelry and shoes and take care of customers between each task. The management were more like mentors helping each step of the way. The hardest part was tedious organizing every five minutes because of rude customers. The most enjoyable was fixing watches, organizing jewelry, networking with coworkers, and seeing customers smile."
good,"Nothing special, good for entry level but being a cashier was brutal, dealing with angry customer after angry customer drains you by the end of the day. If you're working in the UPC/Invoicing office it is a lot better but sometimes it can be really slow. Management is ok but nothing special."
good,"Great job with good benefits, but as everyone knows, Walmart employees are treated poorly and paid less than deserved. Customers were also rude most of the time."
good,I did customer service and also stock different departments. I started off as a stocker then did a little cashier work. Then promoted up to department manager in between day shift and night shift. Operated forklift and pallet jacks.
good,You can get a good grasp of basic knowledge on cars and maintenance here and help you on your way to becoming a mechanic.You get a good variety of experience while working here.
good,I love working there and most of all I like make cake so the customer can have the extra special feeling. taking ordering is fun to that's how I really see and learn how and what the customer is wanting the cake.
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work, great coworkers and managers"
good,"Cashier duties, stocking shelves, answering inquiries in regards to lawn care maintenance in the Garden Center.Also loaded merchandise into customer's vehicles."

good,Fun and innovative company to work for. Typical day is going above and beyond for customers and making we are instock of valuable merchandise.
good,most of the days since of the time I started was really hot but I was ok since they provided cold water so we don't get dehydrated. I enjoyed my job and the customers I had to move back to Chicago though.
good,Good learning workplace. Very valuable experience gained. Customer service skills as well as safety practices a must. Very demanding as well.
good,"Store environment doesn't quite match with Home Office/Bentonville expectations. "
good,"Awesome work environment for building customer service experience, managers are respectful for the most part, there are a lot of people there to help with anything and personnel are respectful"
good,"As a pharmacy cashier, I had little to do with the medications themselves and actually was given more face-to-face experience with the customers. I enjoyed my time here and my co-workers were very patient during my training process, as well as any time I needed help. The pharmacist was always eager to stop what she was doing if a customer needed a counsel, and a pharmacy technician would step in as a second cashier during the busier times."
good,"was always busy, learned exceptional customer relations skills, management was always helpful, enjoyed helping the customers"
good,"asset protection is a very interesting area of the operations of the company."
good,"learned team work and good documentation related to drug records as well as inventory management."
good,There aren't any typical days at Walmart. Everyday brings unknown challenges that may interfere with daily business goals. This can be the most difficult yet rewarding parts of the job. The management staff has high expectation and will push the associates to try and achieve these goals.
good,"Walmart is full of great people too work with, most willing to help with anything. smiling faces is all I see when I enter."
good,fast pace but cool place too work if new too retail and customer service. co-workers are pretty cool you'll never have a problem.
good,"The Management was very poor becasue they seemed to pick favorites and the managers were nto all on the same page, the hardest part of tyhe job was when they only scheduled a couple people to one section such as food or toys. The coworkers were wonderful."
good,"entraba alas 7am iba por mi herramienta de trabajo checaba concluir lo que la herramienta me indicaba antes de las 10 am a esa ora llegaba trailer iba por la mercancia nueva a bodega para exibirla aprendi a manejar plano rama telxon e impresora "
good,I use to brag about working for Walmart Now Im very disapointed with the way Walmart is treating thier employees. I have been with them on and off for 17 years. This is not the Walmart Sam built
good,"LLegabas y te daban fondo para tu caja, habrias caja e invitabas a los clientes a que pasaran contigo, aprendi a tener mayor pasiencia con las personas y mas con las personas mayores. A veces nos presionaban mucho porque habia demaciada gente y no nos dabamos abasto. Mis compañeros eran los mejores, todos nos apoyabamos y habia un muy buen ambiente de trabajo. Lo mas dificil fue decidir ya no ir a trabajar por cuestiones de salud. Lo que mas me gusto fue haber conocido personas tan amables."
good,Easy job that allowed me to see all the new releases.  Relaxed atmosphere but the staff really care about each other.  Flexible schedule.
good,"Great co-workers to help move your day along. From the nice door greeter, to the store manager, they are all great people to work with."
good,I have learned over the 18 years I have worked with Walmart that hard work pays off. It is a great when you are allowed to make decisions that impact the business on a daily basis.
good,"This job for me was a job to have while attending college. I was given steady hours and was able to make the money i needed. The managers overall worked with me on my work schedule so that I could focus on school. "
good,"A Constantly changing, challenging environment. If you like customer interaction you will find it rewarding and draining."
good,"its a nice place to work and they give opportunities to start a career."
good,This is a good job for a high school student. I recommend this for someone who is still in school and looking for a little money.
good,"This is a good place to start working or to continue building experience, skills, and basic customer service as you communicate with customers everyday."
good,"A typical day at Walmart would usually be very slow in the mornings but pick up quickly around 11:00 a.m. I have learned patience while I was working there. Management was awesome because whenever you needed them they was right there. The hardest part of working maintenance was when we had to clean the floors and walls because.....well, that's all I am going to say. My co-workers were AWESOME. The most enjoyable part was I had met such wonderful people and they treated me with so much respect especially by me being the only lady in the maintenance department."
good,A simple work day has always been for me regular but for others around me always seemed a bit more difficult. Our store in spring lake was always filled with joyous customers and our employees where just as eager to help. Each day I went into work it was always a positive environment. Any day I would come in they could put me anywhere they needed me so once I was assigned a task whether I was scheduled to come in or I was called in there was always something from the day I would learn so I must say that was the most enjoyable part of my day.
good,had to be fast paced and have ability to multi task work on a time  crunch  make sure all expirations were in date stocking shelves
good,Management was very supportive as well as friendly. Co workers were very patient and nice. The hardest part of the job had to be being short staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving donations.
good,"I would get to work and start helping customers until the end of the day. Each day was the same. Didn't work well with school, because I was unable to get school work done while I was at work."
good,"I like working for walmart because it has lots of benefits. I like working on black Friday when it is really crazy. but thwy just don't really care about their employees. they pretend the do to the public but when you work there you find out all the ""secrets of walmart"""
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart for the majority of the time that I worked there.  For the most part, I was valued as an associate and my hard work was appreciated.  I was involved in a severe car accident which took me away from work for 3 months.  Due to the severety of the injuries I endured, I was not able to go back to being a cashier.  When i was able to return to work, I was given a hard time and they did not want to put me in a position that I was capable of performing.  At that point they put me back to work but was the worst hours available and the minimum I could work and keep my benefits.  I really didn't feel that it was a very family oriented business and that the bottom line was what I could do for them at any cost.  I would not go back to work there."
good,my typical day started in the automotive shop area where we had to turn compressors and everything on to run the shop for the day on. After customers started coming in to have there vehicles serviced it could get busy  but some days more than others  the mgt was nice at time  but some just acted as if they were better than everyone they were around
good,"This is a place where you are always making sure others are take care of. The best part as I met a lot of different people and had so many wonderful conversations with customers. The hardest part as the split days off, but management worked with you."
good,"I truly enjoyed my time with Wal~Mart.  The Super Center I worked at #1606 was outstanding among the region.  It was family oriented, to me, with my customers and my co-workers.  Very friendly and helpful!"
good,Wal-Mart is the job to be in if you like working with the public. I had a great time and had really good Management. The only downside is working weekends and holidays.
good,I would clock in and immediately went to my assigned register.  My duties were to ring up customers and to occasionally cash checks.
good,We treated each other like a big family. The work was stressful but I was able to surpass all expectations on a daily basis.
good,"Busy outpatient setting which required good patient skills and team cooperation. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with patients, staff and other outside healthcare providers."
good,I liked working at walmart. you got to work with the  cash register and also learn good customer service. it can be stressful when it gets busy but overall its a good place to be
good,"Respeito ao indivíduo, seja funcionário, cliente, fornecedor ou membro da comunidade em geral, independentemente de etnia, gênero ou opção sexual."
good,My typical day at work was repetitive. we had certain things to do at certain times and they had to be done within a certain time limit. I learned the positives and consequences of all the different types of jobs in the store. There was a wide variety of people that I worked for and with. The hardest part of my job was working with people who did not want to work with me and always had a bad attitude. The most rewarding part of my job was finishing what needed to be done and being appreciated for it.
good,I was a very good job. I was happy there and I learn a lot of my managers and co-workers. I found my self being more open to people and helping more when I was need.  My co-workers where always there to help me in my time of need.  The hardest part of the job was trying to work on a flex schedule. You never knew when u had to go in but once you got there you go with it and work hard. The best part about the job was just being able to see the smile of the customers when I help them find what they are looking for.  Also the way everybody works its fast and its really good because i'm a fast worker but I always make sure my work is how it suppose to be.
good,Retrieved carts from the parking lot. Assisted to the needs of customers when requested. Replaced trash bins around the parking lot. Positive environment.
good,"Empresa lider con buen ambiente de trabajo, pago puntual, tienen cultura en la empresa, solo algunos directivos no cumplen con los principios basicos ni cuentan con el valor a los asociados"
good,Always busy there is always something to do. customer service is the best part of the job I love to help but of course there are some tough days. co workers are always willing to lend a hand.
good,"Wal mart is an okay place to work at, although customers can get aggravating. I learned a lot of people skills as well as how to work under pressure. My co-workers all assisted me when I was first coming into the job. The hardest part of the job was meeting customer needs."
good,"I liked working here. They will give anyone a chance to work there. Management is good and they are on top of things there. If I had to work there again, I would."
good,"My typical day consisted of performing assigned tasks such as cleaning bathrooms, safety sweeping, recycling and cleaning spills."
good,"fast working enviroment, friendly staff. base salary.opportunities for growth and learning. management was ok. not impressed . store kind of dirty"
good,"Good Company, good benefit pay better than other company. bad thing a lot of crazy people here but it is ok because they pay better than others."
good,On a daily basis I would walk the store for about 9 hours looking for shop lifters. each month I would do compliance walks and safety walks. I learned a lot about retail and how to stop shrink from taking place or at least lower the numbers some. My Direct supervisor is great she has been in my field for a year and I had to train her to be who she is as far as policies and rules of the job. The hardest part about my job is honestly the pay. I do although enjoy catching people stealing I think it takes a lot of skills to catch a person stealing while following them from behind.
good,After working there for over 6 years I was able to move up to a Zone manager. Because I was able to work in many different areas of the store over the years it was great experience and I learned a lot over the years including management skills.
good,"Working at Walmart gave me great new experiences of helping and understanding customers, following orders from managers while compromising and working out reasonable solutions, and learning to co-operate and function appropriately with my many different co-workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the busy and fast pace of customers during weekends by collecting carts as quickly and efficiently as possible as well as working out an issue with any angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job had to have been getting along so well with my co-workers and this positive energy helped us to do our job as best as we could."
good,Wal-Mart was great. Its one of the few places where you worked your shift and didn't have to leave to go pick up groceries from another store. It was literally a one-stop-shop. You work and then shop. Loved it. The only downfall was that I couldn't take care of a family of five on a Wal-Mart salary even when being a Manager.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was something interesting and something I chose to do because I was able to work with others. I did not truthfully care for the management and the way many people would call off of work and the lack of help. I would arrive to work and go clock in after I placed my belongings in the locker. I would make sure my badge and other items were correctly in place and proceed to my destination. I would always greet my customers with a smile and allow myself the ability to make small talk with them to ensure they found everything okay. I learned that working with others is important and being positive is important as well. I had a few managers that were extremely rude and disrespectful. Coworkers are a major part of your day to day actions. I had many that made the day easy and we were able to work together. I did not like being the cashier that had to always depend on my managers to give me change and or override a customers transaction. I loved when customers would allow me to help them find certain items.
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part. The hours were crazy and often limited but I liked it overall. I believe if I didn't move I would of been manager one day.
good,"got to put up new toy displays."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with new people. It was almost always busy which made the shift go by faster.
good,"I enjoyed working there, if it wasn't for my injury I still would be there. The customers were great and the environment was outgoing and fun."
good,"My day started off by cleaning the bathrooms. I took care of various jobs as mentioned in my resume (clean bathrooms, painting, took out trash, wax and buff floors etc. The management treated me kind and had a pleasant attitude. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy trash to be placed in the trash compactor. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see I made a difference in the upkeep of the store."
good,"The reason why I enjoyed working at  Wal-Mart because I'm a people person. Interacting with people everyday day is something that I love to do, it teaches you to have people skills and to be kind to others when their mean to you."
good,"this company was okay to work for was not the best but it was a income , you learn new things and its a fast paste environment you have to be fast on your feet and help the customers with orders and any other thing they need ."
good,During this time i was only a intern but I was still inspired to be the best. By the end of my training I was training many of the new interns. I also enjoyed my Pharmacist he was an amazing teacher.
good,"Accommodating schedules, flexible management."
good,"What really stood out to me while working at Walmart was how strong the teamwork was between the employees. There was a lot of communication and efficiency, and the environment was comfortable and safe. We were able to do the best work we had to offer because of the good conditions"
good,"Was the beginning of my pharmacy career and embraced the experience. My learning experience and exposure to pharmacy workings and the learning of prescription rules, reading and insurance management including billing, pre-authorization and tier management.Management (first 2) were supportive in employees expanding their education and furthering knowledge base. Working for a large corporation as this goes through many changes.Management and co workers continuously changes making this the hardest part of the job. The job was quite enjoyable as I learned and worked at the same time."
good,"fast pace and constance customer contact, patience, a listener and meeting,talking and learning new things from everyone you come in contact with."
good,"I mostly focused on customer service at Wal-Mart."
good,"As a pharmacy technician at Walmart central fill, you are daily, with close supervision of pharmacists, filling pharmaceutical medications in a high paste atmosphere with help from automatic dispensing systems and high volume conveyor belts.  You soon learn that filling scripts accurately, safely and swiftly is highly appreciated by your peers.  As well as working closely with pharmacists there are also always supervisors and managers on the production floor working with you so if there is an interest in further learning they are always willing to assist.  The help and teamwork among co-worker is a ongoing matter which help productivity and also keep workers happy."
good,Good job to have while going to school because they always worked with my school schedule. Pay is low but it was a good starter job. Dealing with customers wasn't the best part of the job but if you get a postion in the stockroom it will be better.
good,"Though the pay is not commensurate with Pharmacy Technicians in clinical or military systems, the management at 5236 makes an otherwise unrewarding job into something far better."
good,Every day was busy. Managing the whole studio alone with too many responsibilities was not that easy. The management was awesome. I learned how to be multi-task. Taking picture of kids was fun and enjoyable.
good,A typical day at Walmart is enjoyable. I work with people that makes the day fun and makes me laugh.  Most of the customers know me because I work there for 9 years so they are very polite and I enjoy serving them.  There is no hard parts of my job at Walmart because I've excelled at everything there is to learn as a cashier.  The most enjoyable part of my job is participating in events that raise money for the Children Miracle Network.
good,When I get to work I have assignments that are timed. I start right away and get finish on time. My co-workers are pretty helpful but most comes to me for help with their assignments.
good,"I was given the same days off as my husband so Walmart was willing to work with me on that aspect."
good,"Although I have heard negative reviews from many employees of this corporation at other locations, I feel that those do not apply to my store. It is generally busy during the day, but the majority of tasks are simple. Some departments were understaffed from time to time. Overall flexible schedule and it is an easy company to advance within considering they believe in internal promotions."
good,Working at Walmart is a great stepping stool to learn the basics you need for becoming a great merchandiser. The workforce is difficult to talk about due to so many changes with in the organization all the time. The hardest part of the job is the demands that are asked of everyone all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers that you get to assist. They make the job worth doing.
good,"Walmart was a nice place to work. Just ask my mom, she has been there ten years. I loved how fast paced it was. That was really its only appeal to me. I love being in a place where i can help people, and a lot of people at Walmart need help (not in a rude way), But think about it. I hate being bored, so being a cashier at walmart was perfect. Always going. And I got to talk alot"
good,Professional work environment where everyone is treated as a competent professional regardless of the tenure at the organization.
good,Great people to work with on the night shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see friends at work and have fun working with them.
good,"I didn't know much about some of the task involved in my daily job,but thanks to other friendly team members and mangement I learned what I needed to know"
good,It was a nice place to work for until they wouldn't work with my school schedule. It definitely is a place that keeps you on your toes.
good,"Te colocan de acuerdo a tu perfil, siempre estan en contacto con el cliente y el empleado colocado, te resuelven las dudas que puedas tener antes y despues"
good,"Walmart was a good summer job for me.  I was able to work with interesting individuals and it taught me to be grateful for the opportunities I have been afforded in life.  In a typical day I unloaded trucks for about 5 hours and then stocked shelves until the end of my shift.  Management was alright, but a bit disorganized at times."
good,I think that Wal-Mart is a great company to work for. They may have something that they could work on but overall they are really looking out for their employees and customers
good,Gained a great deal of knowledge in the electronics world. I was able to spend time explaining products to customers and was able to identify the item that fits their needs best.
good,"Unload freight off trucks, stock shelves, face out the shelves, and make sure the aisles are clean and presentable."
good,"Walmart Canada enables its teams to constantly reinvent and push the status quo.  This enables future leaders to grow their creative & strategic management skills, by working with cross functional teams. From product development to streamlining operational execution, out of the box thinking was always rewarded with the opportunity to grow and succeed."
good,"Overall working for Wal-mart is a good experience.  I learned many new skills and the benefits and open door policy is exceptional for a company.  However, depending on the store depends on how you are treated, particularly because of Management.  The management in my last store was very accommodating and understanding, and they worked well with their associates.  The management at my new store are inconsistent and condescending when working with you."
good,"i learned to work as a team. my co-workers were great. being that Walmart is a big company, their were thousands of different people everday. it was important to work well under pressure, smile, and provide great customer service."
good,"day for work would be clocking in, going to photo-lab  depending on shift to open or help get other person get caught up  sometimes go to toys to help making photos and other in-store products what I learned was fast paced but boring when you are slow management was good coworkers were fun to work with hardest part was keeping up with orders as soon as you start your shift and when closing to get orders to stop printing I really enjoyed when we switched from a wet lab to dry lab because we could make more products than before"
good,"I enjoy having the ability to work with people of different cultures and backgrounds. Everyday helping give good customer service to the all different kinds of customers.  I enjoy the opportunity to meet different people, and learning about them.  Some days can be hard, because there may not be enough help for that day."
good,"Ok company to work for, but didn't feel like they appreciated their employees.  work hours always changed without notification and you were responsible for checking online to check for schedule changes."
good,Walmart is a great retail place to work at and offers flexable hours  for many different types of shifts and offers room to grow and expand.
good,"I learned how to do customer service, I also learned how to send and receive money grams, I learned to do returns, and working there made me learn a lot of things that I can take to other companies as well."
good,"Was a good place to work at. Everyone was around to help if I needed it, and it was a very fast paisa to work and I loved that. I loved working with others and as a team."
good,"I have been able to learn so much from this job experience. It built my communication skills, customer service skills, and gained retail experience."
good,While working at Wal-Mart I learned how to work the cash register really well. I learned how to work with freight and how to work with so many different people from so many different backgrounds
good,"My overall experience with this employer is positive. However, it is difficult to ""start over"" once you have something negative against you. Never transfer from one store to another if an old boss is working at the other store. They tend to spread rumors about their employees and even have unprofessional relationships with them. NOT ALL are like this, however the ones who are pretty much ruin those who aren't."
good,A typical day at work would be stocking shelves and putting out stock throughout the shift. Checking out customers with their groceries and other products. Throughout the shift you would maintain your til and lane. Co-workers were super friendly and were always there to help out whenever someone needed help. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with customers.
good,"A typical day at work includes heavy lifting, stocking shelves, and meeting time requirements. I learned how to best manage my time and a good routine complete my work in a proficient and timely manner. Management was helpful and understanding but also very professional and expected the very best from employees. Co-workers are very friendly and value their relationship with customers as well as other co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co-workers and customers but also knowing that I am appreciated by those around me for the work I do."
good,I  enjoyed working with patients to get glasses and help them to select the appropriate frame . I worked with the Dr. and learned some amazing things about our eyes. My manager was easy to work with and listened to me if I had any concerns . The hardest part of my job was dealing with insurance and being frustrated with the patient's lack of coverage. The most joy I felt when a child would get his glasses for the first time and be able to see well.
good,"When i worked at Walmart:"
good,"The whole operation could be run better and the management teams could be better trained. This company is a good company, but does not like to give their employees raises, insurance or 40 hours a week. The managing members are not around enough to have questions answered and do not seem to want to handle things brought to their attention."
good,"A typical day at work is productive, Wal-Mart tire lube express always stays busy. I have learned how to operate a balance machine, inventory hand held/computer skills, basic oil changes. Management is great, they always treat every employee with as much respect as possible. Co-workers will always help to get the job done. The hardest part of the day is not making customers satisfied to the fullest. The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing the customers smile while leaving the store."
good,"Attend to customers needs, co-workers are great to work with, check-out customers at the register, meet new people everyday and fast paced."
good,"check on arriving merchandice, receive , unload , "
good,"this Job was pretty good, they were flexible with my schedule for the most part but depending on your avaialbilty, it was hard to get the certain number of hours I wanted. management was ok as well as the co- workers. if you go to work and do your job then you will be just fine and have a great work experience here."
good,"A typical day at work could begin very slow, no customers and than turn into craziness with certain rushes at certain times. After school or church on Sundays could be extremely busy and sometimes stressful if we didn't have enough CSMs or cashiers to work. But I did meet a lot of fun people with great outlooks and optimism that helped the day pass by quickly."
good,"A typical day at Walmart would look like someone cleaning their register, getting ready for the day, or someone taking over someone else's register so they could either go home or go on break. You'd finish helping the customer, and if you took someone else's register and they forgot to clean up after them, you would then clean up for them and bring things back if they were surrounding the register. Walmart was my first job so I learned almost everything I know about working from working for this company. The management I had previously, before she had to move to a different apartment due to scheduling issues, was very understanding and was very helpful when I had problems with certain things. The co-workers are wonderful and helping and bring a family feel when it comes to work or to things that don't help with your overall attitude."
good,"A typical day would be to come in, work, & take your breaks. Nothing out of the ordinary, really. The busiest it would get would always be on the weekends and on/around holidays. The co-workers were really great people. Drama free for the most part. The job tasks weren't really hard at all. Just simply stock shelves & occasionally placing overstocked items back into the storage bins with a handheld device. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different people on the regular. You weren't forced to look at the same exact people throughout the entire shift."
good,"Great place to work with fun and happy people. There is always something to be done, and most associate are ready to help provide customer service."
good,"A very beneficial learning environment, long hours,temporary position for the holiday rush. Demanding hours for customer satisfaction, rewarding benefits from management."
good,"room for growth"
good,"Competitive industry pay. Good benefits and great people to work with. Benefits include Health, Dental, Life, 401(k) and more."
good,"After our meetings that we have every night before we begin the shift, I go to the freezer, break down the pilot and place all items where they belong."
good,"Good experience both summers that I worked here."
good,I was a department manger for Wal-Mart. I had to maintained a good work environment. Supervise employees and order product
good,Cashier for grocery store.  I learned how to deal with people in a fast-paced environment. Since this was a new store just opening there was other work such as stocking shelves and pricing when we were not busy at the register
good,I started out as a cashier and moved up to Customer Service Manager in 2 years time. My only issue is it is a lot of work with very little pay or recognition for your efforts.
good,I was a sales person in the electronics section. day to day i would have to clean up and make sure the customers are buying what they needed. The management there was also okay but there was always different managers in your section so your not sure who to talk to. The hardest part about the job was going to the back to try to find inventory as it as very big
good,"- typical day consists of working with employees and customers"
good,Work hard with a productive team. Learned how to use equipment such as Walkie Stacker and Electric pallet jack. The hardest part of the job is to reach goals of the managers with not enough people to get it done. Some managers don't treat you with the respect that you deserve
good,"Walmart is a very demanding, but very rewarding company. You get out what you put in, put in the effort and you will get rewarded. Day to day was challenging, as a store manager it is a high work load. The hardest part of the job was the continuing change. People were definitely the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"i don't remember working at walmart. i guess if its your first job,its a good place to start in the work force. my experience was good working there."
good,"Go work sweep the floors ,buff the floors , wash & wax the floors . The work environment was ok i got along with all the employees ."
good,some tasks they asked you to do were unrealistic in the time frame they gave you but other than that it was a great place to work with great people ho were extremely professional and respectful
good,What I enjoyed most was helping customers get items they needed to make the store run quick and easy. I love to see smiles on people face.
good,Working was always fun and well equipped. Always professional. Co workers were all friendly and welcoming. Provided discounts for the store which was beneficial.
good,"buen ambiente laboral, oportunidad de crecimiento y desarrollo aun sin tener experiencia"
good,"Overlooking cashiers making sure they get their lunches/breaks, distributing tasks given by upper management. Everyone at walmart is very friendly and pleasant to work with, management included. The hardest part of the job would be handling the constant complaints and nearly imposable demands due to under-staffing, Nearly imposable but very doable. What I loved most about my job was being able to solve every problem and have that customer leave with a smile on their face to come back and greet me the next shopping visit."
good,It was a good learning experience working in the back and a lot of hands on duties which I enjoyed. The management wasn't the best overall but the co-workers were amazing and helpful. The hardest part was the hours since our store closed at 12. The best part was just always having something to do at all times.
good,"Its fun to talk to different people everyday, its fast paced, co-workers are friendly, so I do enjoy my job. A typical day at work is very busy. I've been in customer service for a long time."
good,"However, the job was great. good pay, decent hours. But I found that the management was inconsistent with company policy. I found that certain managers would come and harass me and make it hard to give 100% of my best efforts. the most enjoyable part of that experience was that I was able to learn new things that I didn't know before."
good,"I learned a lot from my immediate management. Plus I really liked my co- workers, they were the best. I would have a lot of paper work to do. Ordering, freight to put away, customer service, making sandwiches. I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart."
good,A typical day is the flexible shifts and the ability to have some of the same task daily. The upper management is very hands on.
good,"My typical day at work would include multiple customers. I have learned that every customer has different needs The most enjoyable part about working at Walmart is the people who come in on a daily basis, with out those people we would not have a job, so we must be thankful for them."
good,I liked working here it was a great place to work and the pay was decent. i would recommend anyone that wants a career to try working here
good,The typical day at work is a lot of interruption - hard to finish the project you start - there are routines to follow but when the shift before doesn't finish what they are doing we must complete that before we can start our tasks for the day.
good,This job is not for the faint at heart. This was a beef processing plant and very physically intensive. You need to have a completely different mind set to work there. Overall great people to work with.
good,"I loved working with people at this particular store.  The only real problem I had was the management taking advantage of my desire to make sure things are done.  When they scheduled me for 5 months of Saturdays (after repeated requests to have at least 1 off a month and reassurances I would get the next few Saturdays) while others in the section did not get scheduled at all, I was frustrated.  Overall, I found the daily challenges interesting for the most part.  If the scheduling thing could be worked out, I would not mind working for these people again."
good,"aprendí mucho, pues tuve la fortuna de colaborar en diferentes áreas, siempre teniendo el apoyo de los compañeros, jefes de área."
good,Walmart is a good job for temporary income I wouldn't consider it long term. I reached solid performer on all evaluations and the promotional process is difficult. If they don't see you as a favorite then they won't consider you for advancement.
good,The Walmart Neighborhood Market on Ustick and Cole has been gifted with one of the best store managers I have encountered. The store is kept very clean and tidy and the employees there are all generally very friendly and courteous.
good,"Walmart is a high paced workplace, that requires all workers to keep busy from the time they come in to the minute they clock out.  I liked all of my coworkers."
good,will I liked my job there I worked with some great people. some were nice and some not so much. I believe that if you are a people person you will do grate.
good,this company was good at first but then started to not work with you when you had problems in your family. My co-workers were great always willing to help. did work a lot and benefits were good. the hardest part of this was still working when you are pregnant and doing all the heavy lifting.

good,"The job itself was fine, some of the management on the other hand, not so much. We would be short-handed as is, and a manager would come up to the front and take one of the cashiers to go and help them. On more than one occasion, I was the only cashier up front."

Ive learned how to properly use a basic register, more about customer service, how to do money orders, etc. Management was horrible towards me. i was being bullied a few months before i quit. by a mean jealous customer service supervisor, when i told the manager of walmart, he laughed along with her in my face. The hardest part of the job was when there were spills in the store and maintenance took forever to get to the spill so i would quickly clean up the spill before a customer or employee falls and gets injured. My most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my customers leave my store happy with a smile and everything they came to shop for, AND MORE!"

good,I wanted to gain some experience within my company on the retail side of the business. To see how the end product was handled once it reached its destination. It's been a memorable and valuable experience.

good,The work place was good to working in. the only down side is that the management sucked. the turn over rate was bad. real easy job.
good,A typical day at my job is people yelling at me because is priced wrong or they want to bring something back to the store and they can't because they don't have everything they need to return something to the store. I learned to be patient and kind and try not to wear how you feel on your face because that can turn into something else. My management team didn't really communicate like I would have hoped but they still expected a job to be done so I had to make sure it was done even if they didn't really step outside the office. My co-workers were friendly and very helpful in the training process of my job.

good,"A typical day at walmart was usually fast paced. You had customer service, cleaning, stocking ect. to stay busy. I learned how to stay on schedule, complete tasks to a high standard, and how to deal with issues pertaining to other associates. Management was a little complicated. It was hard to stay on their ""good side"". If a task was done well, it went unacknowledged. But if a job wasn't completed to their liking then you would either be written up or at the very least warned. But I did have a fantastic relationship with my co-workers. I liked all of them. We always found ways to have fun and still keep the day going. The hardest part of the job was the schedule. It was different every day. If i wasn't working late at night then it was right in the middle of the day. I have a toddler so it was complicated to have sitters lined up to accommodate my insane schedule. All in all, I liked what I did on a daily basis, and the people I got to meet and create new friendships."

While working there I learned that if things are not executed the proper way it throws all you time frames for your objectives. it can also throw off the objectives for employees through out the day. Management communicates on a constant basis so that all employees are aware and on the same page. the hardest part of the job was ensuring all pallets and trash were off the floor before store opening. one of the more enjoyable things to do on shift is attending the 3 a.m. meetings after lunch.

I was able to make changes that actually mattered. My fellow associates sought me out with safety concerns from all departments because they knew I would get the situation taken care of. I would not say that there was a very hard part of the job. 12 hours is a lot on your body in a very physical job and by the end of the day you are completely exhausted."
good,A day in Walmart consists of constant activity. I learned to prioritize and manage time wisely while maintaining quality and customer satisfaction. Management was understanding and worked with my hectic school schedule. The job itself was not difficult. The challenge was in adapting to ever changing daily activities.

good,"Walmart is very high traffic, good variety of customers and lower prices then other retail comparatives. You can climb the ladder, depending on your willingness to learn new jobs and adjust to doing it all yourself. Depending on which department you will work in, is how busy you will be dealing with either customers or management. I personally enjoyed building features and making sure my department was clean and fully stocked."
good,I actually liked working with Walmart very much. It was the pay and lack of respect I was getting. My job was fairly easy. Walmart management was very poor. Never was I told by the store manager that I or we were doing a good job. When we as in us a team led our district in tire sales for the past months.

good,this job was okay job for me I wasn't working there long but the my co-workers are really nice people to work with and llike working nights
good,I have learned that you can make the most unhappiest customers day just by listening to them make them feel like they are important and not just another customer. After all everyone has feelings. The hardest part is the lack of back up you get from the upper management.

Communication among co-workers is important.  I get along very well with my co-workers. We work as a team to fill the customer's needs. I am very fast paced at ringing up items on a cash register. I am also a very fast and efficient bagger.  The most important part of my job is seeing a customer leave pleased. This gives me a sense of knowing I did my job well of taking care of the customer."

I thoughorly enjoyed my co-workers, but my managers left something to be desired.

The best part of my job was the greatful people who would say thank you after i was able to fix a problem for them."

good,"This employment opportunity afforded me the opportunity to not only expand on my customer service experience but also my limited knowledge in the automotive field. I enjoyed being part of a team that was focused on accomplishing a single goal. The most difficult part of the job, other than the dramatic weather changes, was also the most enjoyable."
good,Attend the morning meeting. Get notes from management. Delegate priority jobs. Review deliveries and paper work. Meet with vendors for setups and take downs.
good,"It was an awesome job and team, I was trained very well and if i had any questions or concerns about anything it was taken care of as soon as possible."
good,"In the deli we were always more around food than we were around customers. We always got to try all the new food that was cooked and give the person that made it, our personal opinion.That was probably the best part. The management was very easy to get along with and your boss always worked around your schedule. You and your coworkers probably don't usually have anything in common so you always learn something new about someone everyday. It was always a learning experience."
good,"Walmart can be a very difficult to work, but the benefits are great."
good,Went in at about 15 min's ahead of time to start and did the meeting. After the meeting we would go to work.
good,I had to stock OTC in the morning until Pharmacy opened.  Then stock pharmacy shelves.  Help Pharmacist with duties and register.
good,I have gained a lot of knowledge working at Walmart. The associates are like family and very easy to get along with. The main things I have learned is the structure of retail and the system that Walmart goes by. Management is great to work for. When needed for any situation they are right there for the associates to help make decisions. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and knowing that they leave Walmart satisfied with the service we provide. The hardest part of the job is watching shoplifters and not able to do anything.
good,"Wal-Mart is a very busy company, but when your at work the time goes by very fast. I meet all different kinds of people ."
good,Good setting to work. Unfair with client when issues arise. No opportunity to refute charges
good,"Great workplace but not enough hours a week. It's a good part-time job. Management was okay,some have bad attitudes. Co-workers are great trainers. First of the month was super busy. The hardest part was keeping your smile when you have a rude person that calls you out your name for no reason. The most enjoyable was being able to converse with other people."
good,"working with coworkers in such a healthy environment was so beneficial for me, I gained lot of experience from my colleagues."
good,"Good teammates, management okay, constantly changing, hard work, loyal customers were fun to be around but there were times when customers were very uneasy and upset, management was always changing....from wonderful to not so much, my department manager was awesome, being knowledgeable in electronics is a plus, constantly learning new techniques"
good,Always a busy day at work. Worked with a lot of great people. The hardest part of the job was always having to work alone in a department due to being short staffed.
good,hay mucha comunicacion hay dias con mucha precion pero es parte del trabajo aprendi muchas cosas
good,"I worked as a cashier and it was a very good experience until my last month. I was moving out of state and was trying to get transferred. Out of state moves are supposed to be easy for transfers, but the poor management made is so hard. It was a horrible process. I finally got transferred, but it was a way harder process than it needed to be. Walmart is a pretty good place to work temporarily, but if your looking to transfer, it would actually be easier just to find another job. And it's pretty hard to move up in this store to. I know someone who worked there for 2 or 3 years full time, tried to become a department manager and was denied for no reason. Then was begged not to leave. Very poor management, but a fun job to work overall."
good,"Fun place to work. The customers not g are great, but the pay is not good, and the hours isn't either. The hours are good  around the holidays, but after December, you will not be able to function off the pay."
good,"I did mostly customer service and cashier work,customers made it enjoyable"
good,"Fast paced and often stressful.  Salaried management works at a minimum 50 hours a week, often times more.  The most enjoyable part of retail for me is merchandising.  I enjoy merchandising products and getting to use my creative side."
good,I felt like the work was easy and very understanding. The employees were always helpful. It was also vey busy.
good,touring your area to create a list of notes that need to be accomplished. Binning and picking the freight to assure the product is on the shelf for the customer. checking Modulars and price changes. working live freight making sure all correct season code clothing is out riced and signed.
good,I was very easy and I like going to work. the only bad thing was the hours.  Sometimes it was my whole day just to put in 8 hours.  Not very good benefits either.
good,I enjoyed the people. I knew alot of carrying people while working there. I enjoyed working there most of the time.
good,"uma empresa muito exigente onde existem processos e padroes que nao sao negociaveis tem que ser seguidos diariamente , uma empresa formadora de profissionais a experiencia adquerida e para sempre , a direção da empresa e boa porem existem alguns pontos ainda falhos ,nunca tive problemas com colegas de trabalho sempre tive um bom relacionamento com colegas de trabalho e meus subordinados , a parte mais dificil era a caraga horaria onde era muito extensa , a parte agradavel era o ambiente onde voce podia dar sua opniao voce tinha autonomia com suas resposabilidades."
good,Well no two days are a like always on the go. Lots of pull on employees to do more then they can do with very little resources.
good,"Most days I was rather busy, but management constantly treated me like I was not doing anything. I enjoyed nights when I was able to put up stock and help customers without being questioned every five minutes. Most of the co-workers are still good friends of mine."
good,"Stocked shelves, checked in incoming product. Backup casher when needed."
good,"Working for the customers can be very rewarding."
good,"Walmart was a unique experience.  I was not in my position long, but I appreciated Walmart for their confidence in my abilities."
good,My title was a sales associate. I had a variety of duties that required me to learn all kinds of skills and techniques.
good,Daily interaction with customers and a friendly environment to work and meet new people. Managenment does a good job of taking care of employees.Friendships with customers are developed and days brightened by certain individuals you meet.
good,Would of been  a lot better job if they treated there employess like people and not like robots.
good,"I made 7.70 at first then went to 8.70 before I left for hastings. Some of the people who worked there were negative, but the negative ones never stayed long."
good,"Provides customer service, scans and bags groceries and non-groceries. Handles cash, debit, check and credit transactions.  The hardest part of the job is to keep a smile on my face when feeling stressed."
good,"I loved my management and co-workers. It is corporate that needs to get their heads in their stores and see what really needs to be done. I was let go simply because corporate could not allow me to stay, even though all of my managers, including my store manager, wanted me to stay."
good,My job at Wal-Mart was to stock and help guest with produce products.  it was a fairly easy job with a lot of heavy lifting.
good,"Typical day consists of walking the store to make notes for day, to pass them out to the assistants and then to follow up to ensure that they were done. Follow up with any emails from market office with action points that need to be taken care of, and tour areas of the store and make sure they meet store and company expectations. I learned that to earn respect you have to give respect and treat those that work for you in a genuine manner The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing those that work hard get the promotion they deserve."
good,had good management i had great co-workers learned more about customer service. Also liked helping customers come in the store and find right away what they were looking for. And learned a little of lay away about returning items
good,A typical day for me was to check on recalls and pull them immediately off the shelves. I would take a look to see how much merchandise came in over night and delegate to my employees on what to stock first. Next I would check to see that my features looked perfect and I would order anything outta stock.
good,"Everyone I worked with were friendly and helpful. I was hired as a temporary employee so I was let go when they were not able to keep any of the temporary people. The hardest part of being a cashier was dealing with irritable customers, but I just gave them a smile and kept on going."
good,"A typical day is dealing with money and people."
good,"Fun, ocupado  and very demanding."
good,The management was always helpful in getting the job done. Fun fast paced environment. Great place for advancement.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a different experience. I had fun learning the different departments. Yet there were too many managers telling the employees to do so many things, sometimes this would interrupt the work you were already doing for the first manager that asked you to do something. I got along well with all of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to do customer service to shoppers. I would have information about products in my department that they weren't expecting me to know. I enjoyed helping others with projects and resetting the mods was interesting for me to learn all that department managers were going through."
good,"If you don't have a life, go for it! Otherwise, you will never have weekends off and management normally never gives you the days off you ask for."
good,"The hardest part of being a long term Wal-Mart associate is the changes that have been made that have gone against what Mr. Sam would have liked.  Most store do not have enough associates to have the store run smoothly with costumer service, and getting tasks done at the same time.  The store manager I am under right now gives out tasks that take most of the day and doesn't leave time for the Department Managers to get their regular work done, and he doesn't understand why price changes or mods go late.  The hourly associates that stay in their jobs are the best in the business.  We work together as a team and support each other.  The hardest part of the job is getting 12 hours worth of work done in 8 hours, by yourself.  When left to do the work I know needs to get done, and being able to help others accomplish what they need to get done makes me feel like I have accomplished something that day, even if I didn't get everything I wanted to done."
good,I really enjoy customer interaction and strive to meet the customers needs while still be able to meet my own goals for my position.
good,"The typical day at work was stocking early morning inventory from incoming trucks, performing routine maintenence  in and outside the store. I learned a great deal on how to approach and deal with customers accordingly, also learned how to price inventory. The management was always fun to work for, everyone had great attitudes and were always willing to help if needed. I loved my co-workers as they made each and every day worth working. Hardest part of the job was unloading the morning trucks but even that wasn't too difficult. I most enjoyed just being part of the team and helping out customers whenever i could."
good,"Being in management is kind of ruff there, but as a employee it was a very relaxed and easy going job. Always offered good hours, and always worked with my needs. When I took over a store that was failing before I can I realized how harsh things can be from the upper level."
good,"•Assist customers in retrieving merchandise in correct size,  color, and brand"
good,Picture me was a fun place to work for. Taking picture of kids was the most exciting part to capture memories. Coworkers were always there when you needed them. The only hard thing about the job is not being able to make the babies smile when they are in a bad mood
good,Typical work day would consist of going out on the floor checking your shelves depending on what isle you are in or if it is a back stock night of truck night. Check your shelves and see what you have and don't have. Go retrieve your items or pallet whatever needs to be done. Stock your shelves then when done go help others.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of developing and processing film, taking orders from customers for their photos, maintaining the 1 hour promise, assisting customers with editing, finishing, and copying their personal photographs. I adored my manager. She was always willing to help and resolve any issues. The hardest part of the job was earning customers trust to appropriately sell photography merchandise according to their needs and demands. I think everything about this job was enjoyable."
good,"I managed both operations and the high compliance areas of the store. "
good,I only worked here for a couple months but I enjoyed it. It was fast paced especially around Christmas which I liked.
good,"A typical day at walmart is like any other job you dont want to come but you got to make money. I learned how to improve my communication skills and count money quick to get costumers on their way. The management was friendly , always making sure everything is well, but dont come quick enough when needed. The co-workers are very friendly and helpful. The hardest part is dealing with costumers and certain situations but i can handle any situation. I do enjoy just meeting new people having great conversations to make someone shopping experience well."
good,Walmart teaches its employees to be both time oriented and keep production  in mind all day every day.It also makes sure employees have a safe workplace and feel responsible to keep that workplace safe for each other .Employees must be team players.
good,"A typical day of work for me consists of making a list of all out of stock items and then quickly locating, preparing, and stocking these items. During this process, I greeted customers and remained approachable in order to assist anyone who needed my help. Through this job, I learned how to work quickly and how to provide excellent customer service. My manager is a very understanding person who offered me many hours when I desperately needed them, as well as allowing me time off for emergencies. My supervisor and my coworkers did a thorough and efficient job at teaching me how to do my job in such a short period of time. The hardest part of the job is the sheer demand of products when I'm working shifts alone, but the most enjoyable part is satisfying all of the customers when I stock the shelves quickly and correctly."
good,Just as the summary states this is a great place to begin and learn some skills.
good,"Good company to work for while in college. Didn't like the hours, l learned how to deal with all different types of people, some of my co-worker were great to work with they made the days go by fast."
good,"Benefits beyond your competitor employer. Benefits are provided to all levels of employees, such as education, career advancement training, health, and financial benefits."

good,"Walmart was a cool experience for me i have learned alot made alot of friends and some co-workers and customer even grew to become something like family. yes Walmart has its down falls but they weren't bad enough to call it a bad company, it was just some of the managers that needed a little more training but i made the experience work for me."
good,productive and challenging working with the touch screen registers.
good,"I worked in apparel zoning, putting away go backs, and helping customers. I had a flexible schedule and enjoyed working with my coworkers."
good,Walmart was a nice place to work and I enjoyed the family atmosphere.
good,"Fast Paced and Fun coworkers"
good,"I mainly enjoyed my time at Walmart. They were always pretty good with me about needing time off for my kids and usually willing to work with me if I needed shift changes. I'd say about half of the management was enjoyable to work with. The other half was your typical power hungry personnel who don't know how to properly manage without putting people down. Pay was ok for my first job, but the benefits were seriously lacking."
good,"um dia tipico de trabalho sempre vendas acima do dia anterior.aprendizagem diária com coisas novas por exemplo mechendising no pdv ponto de venda,as gerencia fazia sua parte cobrava os resultados extipulados,parte mais difícil era regra por do sol nunca deixe pra amanhã  que pode fazer hoje,o mais agradável era o ambiente família um ajudando ao outros"
good,"Fun environment, great co workers, understanding managers"
good,I learned a lot from working here. I learned to be more organized and to have more patience. I started out working nights and soon made the transition to daytime. Fellow employees were helpful and fun to be around. I really enjoyed my time here.
good,A typical day at work is just ringing people out with their purchases as fast as you can and help them find things if needed. It can be a fun place to work especially when you see the regular customers come in and you chat with them.
good,Very fast-paced environment.  Customer service driven.  Lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"I have been a part of the WalMart company for nearly two years and have found nothing but a reliable and very flexible work place. I started off in the company working full time nearly 40 hours a week while I was out of school  semester and now that I am back in school, the company has been very accommodating and flexible with my changing school schedule every semester. Enjoyable and easy place to work at."
good,This isn't a job you want to have forever but it paid my bills every week and for that I cannot complain.
good,"a very nice job, my only problem was that the company could not work with my school schedule even after i let them know upfront."
good,It is a good company to work for as long as it is not long term. Your pay stops at $17 an hour. Alot of the management team are excellent to work with. Some need to not work with people. They do have good benefits for the younger person.
good,It is a good place to see what you want to do in life. There was a lot of room to advance to the next stage. The job can be demanding at times.
good,"Fast paced and fun. Enjoyed working there. I was encouraged to learn everything I could. Anything I wanted to know how to do, the management team saw to it that I was able to learn. The most enjoyable part of the job was the working with the associates that I managed."
good,show up get your task for the day and get it done before the end of the day. I learned the value of other people such as co-workers and customers. Management was always there if you needed them to help with further instructions. The hardest part of the job was not enough hours to have a better pay check. What I liked most about the job was the pace was never boring
good,Days moved very quickly because I always had a lot of work to do. I was able to achieve fast speeds of ringing up and bagging groceries while also conversing with each customers about upcoming events and promotions to help them save money on every-day commodities. I learned how to handle many different tasks at once due to the fast paced working environment.

good,"My experience working for walmart all depended on the store i worked for, and who i worked with. I worked for Walmart twice. The first time i worked as a cashier and CSM had a grudge against me. She didn't know me, since i had not lived there long, but i was engaged to someone who had lived there all his life, and she didn't like him, and made sure to tell me that every chance she got. In front of co workers and customers. The second time i worked for walmart, i had a good experience since i was on the floor, and not a cashier. I was being prepaired for department manager, but due to family issues i had to transfer to another store, and that store was a nightmare. The managers, did't care and would even lie about openings. I was told I would be able to choose where i went to in the store when i got there, and i didn't. I was paid less than i should have for the position, and when i inquired about a floor position that the computer showed as open, i was told it was an error, but all employee's in that department told me that it was still open."
good,It was overall productive because of all the walking and excersize by pushing all those carts with my teammates!

good,A typical day at Walmart was very busy. I learn how to communicate with the costumers more and I also learned the system very quickly.

good,I learned to work as part of a team with management and associates. The hardest part of the job was not always being able to satisfy the customer. The most enjoyable  part of the job was when the associates called me to their departments to see their accomplishments and the smiles on their faces.
good,I learned about working as a team.  If they team was not productive less got done.

good,"The typical day at Walmart was alright,i only say alright because it was not the hands on job i was looking for im more of a stay busy person.Its a good job but i was looking for something better."
good,"I liked working with my co-workers. I enjoyed providing customer service. I learned a lot from the company at first.Things changed too much after Sam Walton died. The company is no longer family friendly, but company driven. Loyalty to the worker no longer exists, therefore loyalty to the company has dropped. The goal does not seem to be customer service, but it is on profits now. Customer service has fallen as has courtesy at the checkouts. Long lines and not enough workers. It has stretched the worker to the point of exhaustion."
good,"It was unorganized but yet easy to work with. I never knew what to do each work day, I just had to find something to do. Very unsatisfied."
good,"The typical day every day I was at work was checking groceries out for customers. I learned that the customer is always right even though they're not, especially when it comes to coupons that have expired, and alcohol being sold at certain times of the day. My coworkers were amazing. They were older, mature, and loved to talk to me. They were really nice people. The hardest part of the day during that job was during the evening when there is a rush of people grocery shopping. The enjoyable part of the job is I met a bunch of really nice people."

good,we processed car loans and collected on late accounts. sometimes the customers were hard to handle when their car was picked up but I was able to workout the issues with them.
good,"A typical day as an IMS (Inventory Management System) associate for me is coming to work, clocking in, and going to the back area of the store, where the loading docks are. All of the associates that are working there for the day unload the trucks of merchandise and before we are able to do our job, the IMS associates help set up the back area and give us as much space as we can use to setup properly. We unload the trucks by sorting out the merchandise on pallets for the departments that they belong too. This usually takes about a few hours to do, depending on how many associates are scheduled, how many trucks we receive, and how much merchandise are on the trucks. I work very well with my co-workers and we get the job done quickly, as well as joking around, laughing and having a fun time. One of the hardest parts about the job is sometimes when we receive a truck, the truck delivers merchandise already on pallets so all we have to do, is take them off the truck and put them somewhere in the back area until we are able to bring them out later to the sales floor. It is even more difficult when there is no more room in the backroom and management can direct us on where we can bring the pallets."
good,"Antes de ingresar al sistema para poder empezar a cobrar, buscaba el cambio y luego hacia lo demás, a las 3hs teniamos un descanso de 20min y volvía a ingresar hasta completar las 6hs, finalmente hacia el arqueo de caja."

good,"Working in the electronics department teaches a lot about organization and the importance of details. There are a lot of things that need to be done, and certain items that come in aren't allowed to be displayed before a certain date. I enjoy assisting the customers with their purchases, and giving advice about what products will best fit their needs."
good,This venture at Wal-Mart was unique because it was a new store. I assisted in the set-up and opening of a new store. Management was great and noticed my strengths as well took some of my ideas into consideration. The interaction with the customers was something to look forward to.
good,"I liked working at Wal-Mart, I left to pursue options with the Air Force.  I have family members still working for Wal-Mart and they enjoy what they do.   Great benefits and discounts almost everywhere."

good,"I would stock and bin freight. Conduct bin audits, check in vendors and direct associates on that days tasks."
good,"Really enjoyed working for WM, left to be closer to my family."
good,A typical day at work is moving around throughout the store. Interacting with a variety of people. I have learned how to control my attitude when dealing with angry customers. The management was a bit unorganized but was nice. The most enjoyable part was talking to the customers from different areas and cultures. I didn't find anything about the job hard.
good,"i learned a lot goes on inside Walmart long after the doors close. I learned to work under pressured times, like Christmas. I also learned how to appease things to merchendising, and customer satisfaction"
good,Everyday wus a good day helping others with there shopping working together with good co-workers i grew to love n help ive learned alot from working with the walmart crew how to greet customers etc.. Management wasnt too much good to talk about they had there favortism toward other workers.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, if you are interested in working in a dynamic environment with plenty of challenges."
good,I enjoyed the diverse workplace The job kept me on my toes and improved my speed and skills when it came to taking care of customers.
good,"-A typical day of work consisted of helping customers when needed with great customer service. Checking in new freight and putting it out where it needed to go. Making sure the workplace was clean and looked presentable. Cashiering/Layaway. "
good,I really enjoyed my time at Wal Mart. It was fast pace and always interesting.
good,"Great place to work, loved the people that I worked with. The hours that I had were not a lot at all so that was one thing that I didn't like about working there"
good,"checking out customers purchases providing good customer service. working service desk, cashing checks, processing returns and exchanges etc"
good,"Always a busy place, always something new to learn. Great co workers"
good,"I get to work at 2:00 AM. I usually have four or five drivers waiting for me in the hallway. I process those drivers as quickly as possible because I realize they could be waiting for two hours between shifts change."
good,Every day I would usually close the garden center so i would have to sort the mulch piles and all displays and clean up. during the day i would also sort displays as well as handle the register. The best part of the job was sealing with all the customers all day. The worst part was the fact that there was seven different managers to answer to on a daily bases.
good,"great management, hardest part is pulling crates but you will get used to it after awhile."
good,"Generally, at the beginning of the shift we'd have a team meeting to discuss what everyone was doing that day. After that, we'd break off and begin our tasks. At the end of the shift, we'd have one more team meeting, where the managers usually thank'd us and briefed us of what we had in store the next day. "
good,My favorite retail job. Worked independently which was preferred.
good,You learn something new everyday. Always busy and something for you to do.
good,"A typical day at work ranges from a piece of cake to almost overwhelming. I learned a lot about being in a team and making a team effort. I can't really put my finger down on management because they change it so much. But the first two years I worked there, the management was top-notch. Many of my coworkers came and went, but the ones who stayed were the best kind of courtesy associates that I've known. The hardest part of the job would be the weather and/or the possibility of ineffective equipment, thus making the job more difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job are some of the experiences that take place, with both associates and customers. Some days can really make the job worthwhile."
good,"A typical day is busy, no time to breath some days. A job working with the public is always stressful."
good,"Despite the various rumors that the corporate superstore is evil incarnate, I was not thinking about the company itself as I worked my shifts.  The people I worked with, for, or around were all pretty good people from what I got to know of them, and the environment was pretty friendly."
good,"Like my job, able to work independently most of the time. Enjoy working with department associates. Overall rating; 4 stars"
good,"My typical day consisted of me getting the register ready for sales, move stock to the proper placement, check to make sure all guns and ammo was properly locked and ready for sales. I learned what people needed to purchase guns and ammo, the proper way to show guns, and in general that most people liked someone to explain all the details about the gun they wanted to purchase. My co-workers often came to me for information on guns. The hardest part of the job was the constant shifting of management and job duties. The most enjoyable part was working with the public and selling things that I had a lot of interest in."
good,Okay company to work for.  Very busy and not a lot of work life balance.
good,"The days are long and very stressful at times. The co-workers look out for each other. Management need more classes on people skills and customer service. The hardest part of the job is too many directions in a days work.(Store manager,Market Manager,Regional Manger, and any visiting manager that has an idea) Consistency is needed for all shifts and stores.  I enjoyed working with a diverse group of associates,customers, and vendors."
good,Loves Wal-Mart loved helping all the customers. It was a great environment working with the right people.
good,"My experience working at Wal Mart was ok a typical night at work basically was quiet laid back, but had it's times I enjoyed it but I know it's better offers didn't really social with co-workers, management wasn't really at it's top performance but the job got done some how. Duties of mine weren't hard honestly."
good,A very fast pace and high intensity work place.  The job/work balance is something to be desired.  The largest company in the world and the freight volume to match it.  Depending on the area that you have an opportunity to manage will dictate the amount of staff and managers that you are in charge of.
good,I really enjoyed working with my co-workers. I also got to work in all area's of the store to learn why things are done the way they are which helps in inventory control and customer satisfaction.
good,Busy Work Place but very exciting and good people. Co workers are amazing and I have learned many customer service skills and people handling skills.
good,had a good experience with Wal mart helped set up the new store in devine tx
good,The hours at walmart are very long for an assistant manager. I have learned many roles while in my position such as patients when dealing with so many associates and being incharge of a large group at a time.
good,"every night was stocking but i learned the store real fast and if someone had a question, i could help."
good,"zoned and re-shop merchandise "
good,"You all have seen the pictures and websites dedicated to the trashy people you can see at walmart. And i hate to say it but most of the is true. I started as a cashier and was a hard worker doing whatever came my way/was asked of me. i moved up to management withing a couple months, and one of the top picks to move up again in a year, once the position i wanted became available. It could have just been the store i worked at because i have been to other store and seem the typical ""Horrible walmart customer service"" but at my store we actually tried to provide good service to an extent. higher management was lousy at times leaving us to deal with issues when they didnt want to handle it, and handing out coaching and terminations to people they had vendettas against. but as long as you actaully worked and did your job it was noticed, stay away from the cliches and brown nosing that everyone loves to do and your good. Customers were the worst though when they wouldnt be able to understand the rules of certain policies and then taking in out on the workers when its not their fault. Verbal harassment was and expected day to day thing form customers. Plus Customers knew that if they threw a temper tantrum  (like a toddler) an Assistant manager would get involved and give them there way so the manager doesnt have to deal with it."
good,"Fun productive place to work. Working hands on with the patients was a great experience. The only down side was building a close relationship with a retirement home patient, and then they pass away."
good,"fear treatment regardless of any colors.productive in every section of work, i am working in this company for four years continuously with a good records."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,It was nice to know that there was work to be done.  Co-workers were fun to be around.
good,"My typical day at work will start with clocking in and hopping on any cars that need service. I work hard to get customers out in a timely fashion but I also have fun with co-workers while I work. I do not waste time or let myself be distracted by them but interact while I work. I can't think of a time where this job is hard. I'd say it can be frustrating at times with the amount of vehicles that need service at once but my co-workers make it a fun environment, and keep my spirits up while I work. My most enjoyable part of the job would be when me and my co-workers are all in a great mood and all working hard making the shop seem like a quick service shop while having fun conversations."
good,"Good benefits package"
good,"I worked really hard there, I learned how to stock and take care of customers"
good,"My typical day at work was fast paced and customer service oriented. I learned how to be better at face to face customer service. Management was great at the time! I'm not sure how it is now. Co-workers were always changing, so you really had to be able to learn to adapt to new people on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job was getting used to my schedule always never being the same and the most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying customers."
good,I would have to say that walmart is a great company to work for if there is a issue they are quick to fix it and make all the staff and customers feel as welcome as possible
good,Help customers produce their photos.  Enjoyed working with customers.
good,A typical day a work was long but also fun cause of the co-workers you work with. I learn how to interact with customers and attitudes of co-workers and customers. I learned alot from management & the roles of being in management. But they were also great to work with because they make you a better person toward the job you do & also towards your future if planning on being in management.But the most enjoyable part was it made me a better person & worker. Because I have been in alot of roles an was blessed to complete them all.
good,loved cashiering loved the customers and employees and made friends great place to work

good,i learned a lot about rules and patience and its a good company to work for and the employees are great management is gud hardestb part is dealing with rude customers enjoyable is when i clocked out
good,The management staff is excellent. The hardest part of this job has been learning how a deli operates. This was my first time to work in the food industry.
good,cleaning stuff up cleaning the bathrooms the floors make sure everything did right the first time get the job done  the hardest part was when they keep calling you back to back.
good,I like my jb but I want to grow and find something that will help me to grow in the work filled
good,This is a great place to work if you are in school because they have a flexible schedule. There is very little room for advancement because most management positions are held by long term employees.
good,"Walmart was very good to me. Numbers and locations was all to natural for me. I learned that i have a vast amount of knowledge and was looked up to for my problem solving skills. All of my managers could depend on me to deliver, co- workers knew i had the answer or knew where to get it.The most hardest part of my job was the space in our backroom. More freight than space but i'm a problem solver so getting it done even when it looked impossible was the best feeling."
good,It was always busy. People will always need medication. Hard part is standing on your feet for 8 or more hours
good,"I enjoye working at Walmart. I learned a lot but mostly from working with different people everyday. Management was cool some didn't speak at times though so never really spoke with all management. The hardest part of the job was working at the customer service desk, and the most enjoyable part was being recognized for my great service."

good,I enjoyed working at walmart. The customers were always interesting.
good,Really good place to work at. The pay is good and you gain a lot of experience. Co-workers are alright just show up everyday on time and do your job.
good,"I had a good time there with meeting new friends and being able to be around some family, but the managers lied and I could see they did not care much about the employees. Getting lied to is my least favorite thing in the world so maybe that's why I don't have the best of memories. For example they told me they would get me out of the rain and into the electronics position, but after a month of that not happening I talked to some co-workers and they said the same thing happened to them."
good,"Wal-Mart was a pretty great place to work. For me, coming right out of high school and getting to make $9.45 an hour was FANTASTIC!!!"
good,i liked this job until they tried to force overtime for people who were already getting off a 1 am. That did not work well when you have 8am classes the next day.
good,"I knew when to work when off,i knew I'd have breaks,s day off"
good,"Typical day would be working with customer's   and starting the day."
good,Overall good working environment. Worked well with fellow employees and staff.
good,i love working with people. i have never met a stranger. i have great communication skills.
good,This was my first job after high school so it was exciting to have a job regardless of pay. I loved my job as a cashier!
good,I tried to get along with every body that I worked with hardest part was waiting on mean and nasty customers with bad attitudes when I got off work
good,Learned new experiences everyday. Helped customers. sliced meat and cheese. Clean deli area.
good,"• Bien accueillir les clients"
good,"llagar al trabajo y es muy rápido el tiempo en el, ya que mantienes contacto con el cliente en todo momento"
good,"Most days, the days I like best that seem to go by faster and keep me busy are the ones that make it seem metaphorically speaking I feel I'm running around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Those crazy insane busy days are the best and it gets better when the people you're working with have a good attitude about their work and the customers aren't all snooty."
good,A typical day at work would be some people being unorganized and lack in communication between managers. I have learned to stay to myself at work. Management needs HELP!!!! they need to learn how to treat there workers and keep everyone's business confidential. My coworkers most are amazing and fun to work with we all work together to get one big job done. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with the managers and the most enjoyable part of my job is PAYDAY!!!!!!
good,unload trucks in a timely manner in order to get the new freight out on the sales for to be worked.
good,Typical day at work: beginning of the week and the end are ALWAYS the busiest! I've learned that you must manage and prioritize your time properly for efficient workflow.  Hardest part of the job can be the rush times of the day.  Things can become overwhelming when everyone seems to arrive at once. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing at the end of a productive day you've done well.
good,"On a typical day I would open the department, sale cell phones, and wireless devices, run the cash drawer, and customer service. I learned was many things in the wireless sales industry. Overall the management was good about helping you solve problems. My co-workers were great! I enjoyed everyone I worked with and I enjoyed that the most. The hardest part of the job was not having enough hours to live on."
good,"When ever I would get into work I would already know what I had to do that day. My manager and co-workers could have cared more about their work, but the job got done.  The hardest part of this job was climbing the seven foot ladder in the cooler to get the 25-50 lb. crates of produce down.  The best part was getting to inform and help customers with their produce choices."
good,Very postive work environment. The work has been very easy because of the well done Walmart formation.
good,"being a cashier at Walmart was all bad. They barely trained me for the job, so i had to learn on my own. management is way wrong. my co-workers wasn't so helpful, seem as if they all where rude. The hardest part of the job was trying to type on the keypad, letters ans number were faded. It wasn't enjoyable."
good,I enjoymed my job here. They would only work me 3 days a week and I would only get 15 hours a week. The pay is not very good at all it's just a starter job.
good,"Fill and take orders for customers"
good,The people are friendly. The work is enjoyable. Not enough hours or pay.
good,I checked customer's out. I learned to move quickly and effectively. Nice co-workers. Dealing  with rude customers was not so enjoyable. I got to meet alot of nice people.

good,"	Involved in the migration of Teradata to DB2 conversion. I was responsible for the Data for their existing Teradata system."
good,What can I say...Unload trucks and stock the store. Fun times on Night shift.
good,I learned many things working at Walmart. I experienced different kinds of attitudes and learned how to deal with it.
good,"As a department manager I would come in and walk my department first thing. Checking all that had been done overnight, what wasn't done, and what needed to be done. Then we would have our manager meeting where we would get told what they needed done from me today. I would then relay all this to my associates and get them on task before starting my own. Throughout the day i would finish my tasks and check on the progress of the other tasks given to my associates. While doing all this i would also assist customers with finding merchandise, and any questions they had. I learned about proper inventory procedures, also I got experience as a supervisor. Management had poor communication between themselves and the associates. They all would want the same thing done but tell the associate multiple ways they wanted it done leading to confusion and double work. The co-workers I worked with were very hard working and very helpful in all aspects of the job.  Hardest part of the job is multitasking. You have to be able to finish all the tasks assigned to you while helping customers during your shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all kinds of different people."
good,this job was ok but I didn't feel right there for one there was no proper training what so ever and the manager was never around to ask questions. I didn't like that I had to wing a lot of it.
good,"A typical work day at Wal-Mart consist of me clocking in and heading back to my workstation. I then, check to make sure the area is clean and if not then I would clean the area. Once customers arrive i would greet them with a smile and begin to take their information. Next, I would start working on their vehicle and when I'm finished, I would come in to inform the customer that their vehicle is ready and thank them. My manager was a great help and if their was any question i needed answered they would provide it. My co-workers also was very helpful, we would all pull together and make sure we provide the most excellent customer service ever. The hardest part of my job was trying to satisfy every customer. The most enjoyable was being able to put a smile on a customer's face."

Management on the front end was great and was always there to help when needed. my co workers were amazing i loved everyone also gained a strong bond with everyone. the hardest part of the job was sometimes i had to do it alone for at least 4-7 hours a day. the most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to meet new people everyday, i also had regulars that would come by just to say hello."
good,Ok place to work and learn about basic vehicle maintenance.
good,Wal-Mart provides a good work experience for its employees.
good,Cart pushing was everything it is made out to be. I pushed carts to their assigned place in the front end of the store.
good,"Good benefit package, had fun interacting with consumers."
good,A good company to work for. Managers are fair. Could be a bit more competitive with their wages. In today's day and age it is hard to survive on being paid just above minimum wage.

good,It was nice working there and I enjoyed meeting new people and speaking to them
good,I loved my job it just got too stressful when I was the supervisor and had no help and worked a 10 hr days with no lunch breaks ... dont want to say much more over all I gained alot of experience with this company
good,"Stressful at times but manageable, but very fast paced and organization and time management are key."
good,"Working at Walmart everyday was always a new experience. New people and new faces. I learned a lot about interaction with customers and how to treat the customers well so that they would want to return. We had only a few managers, but the ones we did have were amazing. They helped as much as they could and provided proper guidance. My co-workers were the best part of my job! They were very team oriented and they made you feel like family. The only hard part about my job was leaving it!"

The hardest part of the job was maintaining a clean work area and keeping things organized during busy times. I loved seeing the customer's satisfaction after helping them find an item or solve a problem."
good,I was a cashier when I worked at Wal-Mart. I had to deal with all sorts of people through out the day. I learned patience because the management was great with understanding how I felt as the cashier when there was a hostile customer. All of my co-workers were nice and the hardest part of the job was learning how to smile through the hate of others. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to meet new people everyday.
good,They work was not that complicated all the time. Some things just required you to have an eye for detail. The overall work environment was pretty easy going.

good,"Very hard work, high turnover, but if you work hard it wont be a problem."
good,"Being a cashier was actually fun and easy. The more customer you have the faster your day goes by. Making conversation with your customers will also pass time especially if they have three baskets. Customers like their groceries bagged a certain way and I know this because I do too. Cold foods with cold foods, cans with cans, boxes with boxes, etc. Do not smash the bread or eggs so I bagges those together. The co-workers were nice and always helped it they had no one in line. The hardest part about being a cashier was just putting things back when cuastomers didn't want them. We had at least ten basket left every night. I enjoyed checking out customers because you meet all types of people."
good,Walmart is a huge company that has much to be desired with communication. Basic new information is supplied on a sort of homepage at the store but if you actually try to search the database for information pertaining to a specific topic you will likely be sorely disappointed. Also promotions after a certain point are a mystery to me. There are higher managers that know less about everything than I do. If you get stuck with one of them your work life is miserable. If you get one that knows the ropes then its a pretty decent experience.
good,"Every day seems to hold a new twist. May it be new or familiar faces, a more complex tempo at which I am to work, or learning how to do new things that could help me further my Wal-Mart career. Constant time-management is necessary and expected. And I find it exciting that I never know what to expect. My managers are very friendly and will even jump in to help if things get into a bind, and my coworkers are always willing to do what it takes for our company to succeed. I enjoy the customers immensely, because one person can make your day. If nothing else, you can make theirs' with simply a smile and a nice attitude. While disgruntled customers are probably the most difficult to deal with, it's incredible when you can change their entire mood just by listening to their comments and concerns. My job keeps me on my toes, and I truly enjoy it."

good,"Days begin at 6:30 and end at 6:00 or after. It was very intense, but very rewarding."
good,This is a clean place. Friendly people always willing to help each other.
good,I have to get my task done on time. Stock shelves. I learned it is hard work. Management  pushes you to work harder. Some co-workers stay and some leave. Some co-workers you like and some you don't  Trying to get it out on time.Knowing customers buying what I stock.
good,"No conflicting personalities and helpful caring staff and management. A typical day at work was, I clocked in then went over my daily checklist for the day. then assigned people there stations and counted the drawers for employees.

good,A day as a dock worker included sorting multiple loads of product and merchandise in a fast pace environment. It kept me busy and the day went by fast.
good,"I love working for this company. I usually worked evenings closing the store. learned just about every area in the store except for bakery. I have even unloaded the truck, did some IMS work, as well as stocking; along with my regular work on the register and then promoted to customer service supervisor. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make the shopping experience easy and enjoyable for the customers. The hardest part of the job would probably be trying to help some customers and not being able to come to a compromise sometimes."
good,"I was responsible for day to day operations of all departments, except grocery."
good,its a decent job. it will get you through school. will work around when you need off. wouldn't make a career out of it.

good,always moving taking care of the cashiers and customers and sometimes both at the same time. weather it be taking money to them or doing price checks.
good,"A day at work is flowing with the day based on production level.  Loading cases on to a truck for travel to store.

good,"Worked in electronics,put up stock set up new mods and helped customers. If you had a good team it was actually fun."
good,took more time out of your week for minimal benefits management was relatively okay but could have been better with scheduling and to help minor situations with customer service hardest part was keeping customers happy .The best part was meeting new people
good,"I love the fresh areas, as no two days are the same. Every day has its own set of challenges and the key is to work through those challenges. Every day brings an opportunity to market your department and show your skills."
good,"Crimped metal doors all day. Had to meet production orders, always met the goals required of the company. Worked with a great team. Enjoyed doing routine work."

good,I liked my job. It was fun. Great summer job because I got to be outside all day
good,"Typical retail environment"
good,"The shop at Walmart isn't a bad place to work.  My coworkers are great people and they make me laugh.  They teach me new things about cars every day, and the job itself will teach you how to be dedicated and hardworking.  The only downsides to the job are broken and/or worn out tools and machinery, and Walmart can't seem to get them fixed or replaced without taking at least three months to do so.  It's also hard to hire new technicians to help out in the shop, because every time a new person is hired, someone else leaves."
good,"I would change the rate of pay per hour because they part-time employees work just as hard as the full-time employees and get different pay."
good,"Learn a lot from this job.Learn stocking,inventory control."
good,"Work directly with the pharmacist to provide concise and accurate proposals to customer while assisting with any questions regarding the  process.

good,"Learned about:"

Management was awesome, they always had my back when things went wrong. My co-workers were friendly and was about teamwork. the hardest part of the day was dealing with big trucks when only have a small amount of workers. the best part of the day was helping the customers and also getting to know my co-workers better."
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work, with decent hours, and decent pay, but It has poor managerial problems."
good,A typical day of work would be coming into four customer service supervisors and they are all leaving right when you come in and your the only one for an hour or so until another customer service supervisor comes in and its the two of you for the rest of the day.

good,Very fun place to work the managers are really nice. There was nothing to challenging about the job.
good,Had fun working with a stimulating crew of stockers and unloaders. A great first job for somebody looking at building a foundation for a career.

good,Overall Walmart is a very busy company that is fast-paced and its a good company to work for..
good,"A typical day at work consists of being swamped with customers but it makes the job fun. You get the opportunity to meet and work with some really nice people. My co-workers and I get along great, they make work fun and full of laughter."
good,"Once you hit the groove and learn your job its pretty predictable. I would recomend this as a first job."
good,too many people on the shift at once pay is to low for unloaders for what you have to do and no job security
good,"It was my first company to work for. If I ever had problems they fixed it right away, the co-workers I have are also very helpful for new people who are just starting off there. the motto was always help your neighbor and they did so as well. which I was shocked by I didnt think no one would help out unless they knew me."
good,Great business to learn everything you need to know to grow in the retail and business world.
good,"As one of the top grossing and steadily growing retail chains in the world, Walmart is one of the most dynamic places to work because of the management, the benefits, it's wonderful customers, coworkers, and day to day operations."
good,Hardest part of the job is trying to keep the shelves full. Most enjoyable part would be having McDonalds for a meal in the store.
good,"para mi un dia de trabajo era como un pasatiempo,agradable con mis compañeros,aprendi a valorar lo q´ tengo como comunicarme con mas facilidad,manejar altas sumas de dinero sin problemas,entender como evitar lavado de dinero o tarjetas falsas,efectivo falso y reglas q´ hoy en dia me sirven de mucho,y una pesima gerencia no toda la gerencia era pesima pero,se supone q´ ellos son los q´ deben poner el ejemplo,la parte mas dificil del trabajo era tener q´ aguantar clientes con mal humor o q´ se desquitaban sus problemas con uno y lo q´ mas me gusto era el orario flexible y fijo q´ tenia dia de descanso y el aumento de sueldo anual,el compañerismo y q´ ya sabia todo de mi area asi q´ no se me dificultaba mi empleo por mas clientas q´ ubieran"
good,"Answer Customer Inquiries, resolve customer complaints and provide quality customer service"

Supervising the Asset Protection Associate (APA) program by analyzing current store theft trends and external crime trends to create plans to control the unexplained loss of merchandise and working with APAs, managers, and store associates to ensure programs are in place to deter internal and external theft."
good,Great place to learn the ins and outs of retail. Managers are helpful and easy to work for. The employees are fun to work with.
good,Pays not as high as it should be but its livable. Able to live off wages.
good,"Good hours, decent management, unreliable advancement  options."
good,Small neighbor hood market in the perfect area. Nice lovely customers come to our store just to visit the store and friendly staff.
good,all employees work together very well. management does a good job of being fair to all employees.  training needs to be a bigger part of the employee experience.
good,"I enjoyed being a walmart team member, everyone was friendly and very welcomed, management was very flexible with schedule."
good,"Working at Wal-mart is a great experience. They have flexible hours for school, also they offer scholarships for college. Overall there's different tasks, luckily the supervisor for our division had me throughout the whole store working different jobs learning about all the divisions."
good,A Typical work day would be assisting Customers with anything they may need. I learned a lot about money grams. Our management team is very supportive and helpful. The co-workers are friendly and nice to work with. The Hardest part of the job is when i have a very rude customer bu I do not let them ruin my day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I am busy and constantly have something to do.
good,"um dia tipico é muita correria pra realizar as ativadades mais os colegas estao sempre prontos pra ajudar, a parte mais desagradável e ter que trabalhar nos domingos,eu aprendi a ser mais organizado e ter agilidade e eficiencia ."
good,"A typical day working as a cashier involves customers screaming at you for any problem that happens as well as people trying to steal merchandise. I learned a lot while I was working there. My social skill improved majorly over the course of my time there. Management was kind of shaky at best. Most of the managers were young people straight out of college with no managemental skill. The hardest part of working at Wal-Mart was definitely the customers. The most enjoyable part of working there was the fact that they had a subway built in, and the co-workers that I had. I made some really good and close friends while working there."
good,It was pretty good. A little unorganized at times. But you got to meet lots of knew people
good,A typical day involves pulling items from the back stock that is low or out on the shelf. I have to make sure overstock is properly binned in the appropriate places and the correct count is put in the system. There are audits that have to be completed through out the day to assure that all items that are placed in a bin are scanned in. Cleaning the back room and organizing any left over items on pallets for the next shift to pick up where first shift left off. I have a few co-workers that contribute to the same roles I have and two supervisors and a manager that are over my department. The hardest part is pulling heavy items from the top shelves. I enjoy my whole job and I learn something new almost everyday. I have learned to use the handheld equipment to keep track of the amount of each item that is in the store. I have also learned to correct on hands and the shelf cap of items that are incorrect.
good,"I work as a pharmacy technician. answering phones, filling prescriptions, ordering and applying drug orders. I learned how to be more comfortable and compassionate with the public. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help customers afford the cost of their medications. Some have to decide weather to eat or take the medications. I wanted to be able to pay it for them.  The store management is not very impressive."
good,A typical work day actually go by very quickly. It's not an unenjoyable per se but it is very stressful in many ways. But Wal-Mart is very fast paced which is my favorite part because I am constantly busy. I learned that my people skills weren't so well before  I started working there now they are outstanding! But the management is sortof unorganized but they mean well. I would say the hardest part about my job is being on my feet all day. But over all I love the job.
good,"Enjoyed working with my co-workers, very friendly, out going, and helpful. I learned how to take different type of payments for different kind of companies. Learned how to handle returns and exchanges. The most enjoyable part of my job was being there to lend a helping hand, serving and making the customers happy."
good,"Liked the position, not alaways the hours put in. Each store was run differently and each management team followed their own set of rules, not always company rules."
good,I enjoyed helping customers recieve the items they needed to improve their quality of life.
good,"I process all defective general merchandise.  I send out vendor claims through different carriers such as UPS, FEDEX, and other carriers.  Some other work duties include:"
good,I had this job a couple of years ago just to have money for college. Nothing real special. I worked with funny people.
good,I typical day for me is helping the customers in my area or in other areas inside the store. Zone my are and make sure its nice and clean. If i have an assignment I will tackle them.
good,Checking out customers. I made a lot of friends during my time there. Management was flexible with the schedule.
good,Working as a cashier was not really a hard job. The hardest part of this job was the customers that would treat you with great disrespect. When this occurred I would stay calm and try to do the best of my ability to help them with whatever they needed if I could. If I was unable to help them with what they needed I would find someone who could.
good,A typical work day at Wal- Mart would be overall fun seeing a lot of known faces. I learned to operate a cash register and switch board operating machine. The hardest part of the job was keeping each area neat. The most enjoyable was making people day.
good,Great place to work. Opportunity for Advancement.  Work for the company for 10 yrs. Started as a Cashier work my way up to Store Assistant Manager. Management team are there to support you and teach you all the  requirement to get promoted.
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work.  They have great pay, good benefits and I enjoy working with my fellow employees."
good,I learned that greeting customers with a smiling face is the best way to earn respect and do any job properly. Management can sometimes determine whether or not one can enjoy a job or how far one can go in a job. Coworkers can become part of your family in a sense. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and being able to help customers.
good,I worked there for a little bit and I didn't really like the management there and they don't really treat their employees very well
good,"It was never a dull day at work and there was always something to do."
good,"A typical day consisted of ringing up customers, keeping my area clean , taking back merchandise that was unclaimed and helping custoers that needed assistance finding merchandise they wanted to purchase. My co-workers wee very nice i really liked allthe people i worked with. The hardest part oif the job would hava to be dealiing with customers who were rude or disrrespectful but as an employee i had to reamin calm, professional and polite at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around such a diverse group of people."
good,"good customers, poor management some employees are ok.. most act like high school kids. loved my job not my co-workers"
good,This a well structured job following Walmart's policies and guidlines. A typical day includes receiving all daily direct shipments coming in to the company and processing them. There is also interaction with customers on the sales floor dealing with requests and concerns. The job is well structured and easy to learn and perform.
good,Good place to work great benefits good working environment.Hardest part of the job was hiring employees who wanted to work for their money .I had great co workers who stayed busy and stayed with me for long periods of time.The mgnt team I had in Hard lines were great and wuld take suggestions fron their dept mgmt.typical day was hectic unloading plant trucks price changes stocking . I larned how to deal with customers and make a sale time mgmt
good,"Wasn't walmart i was working for"
good,"I worked 12 hour shift on the weekends, I learned to be more efficient in an office setting. I learned to be productive with the work that was expected to be completed with few associates in the office to complete the tasks."
good,Jobs at times was difficult because lack of sufficient employees overall atmosphere at work was o.K.
good,"Je fais plusieurs choses dans ma journée de travail, je dois déterminer mes priorités selon l'ouvrage et les effectuer les tâches. Il y a beaucoup d'opportunités de travail, faire plusieurs choses / travail différents mais pas beaucoup d'opportunité de poste. Nous avons un bon contact avec nos gérants, facile de communiquer. L'aspect le plus difficile est d'essayer de bien gérer son temps pour réussir a faire tout ce qu'il y a a faire! L'aspect le plus agréable est probablement la diversité des tâches."
good,"Wat-Mart, as a whole, is a well-oiled machine in regards to maintaining productive expectations."
good,"A typical day at work would have me stocking shelves of all sporting good supplies, answering phone lines, submitting for a background check before a gun sale and typing up then printing out fishing licenses. I've learned how to use multiple phone lines in a quick and productive way, while always meeting the needs of the person on the phone, How to use a cash register and how to communicate effectively. Management was amazing and so careful of me. I was quite a few months pregnant and was having complications with my pregnancy and I was regularly checked on, my co-workers would bring me water when they were on their breaks until I was able to take my break, they offered me chairs to sit on to do my job so I didnt have to stress anything further (I had a bad problem with a ligament in my pelvic region) The hardest part of the job was juggling hunting licenses, gun sales, phone lines and phone lines when hunting season started. We got swamped in certain parts of the month, sometimes I would be scheduled to work alone, and the store manager would come help me until it slowed down. I loved my co-workers. I learned a lot about effective communication to all types of people."
good,"I stocked shelves, unloaded trucks, cleaned my workspace, assisted customers with finding things, rang register and set store shelves and mods."
good,Will miss working here. I had such a good crew and decent management.
good,I worked with a lot of great people. Most days were the same minus the different conversations I would have with customers and co-workers. I appreciate the experience I learned.
good,"It is very rough to work a 3rd shift position, having to switch my sleeping schedule to that of which is opposite of majority of the rest of the world, but for this job I would have totally done it over and over. I was required to maintain the front door flow and make sure people left ONLY with what they came in with and with what they purchased from our store.This position was seasonal and I  got laid off over a short period of time with the offer to re apply again at a later date. I did just that and worked there again later in 2005"
good,Great pay. Knowledgeable management. Flexible schedules.
good,I was hired when i was 8 Mnths Pregnant So I really Cant Say How It Was. But For The most Park I Was Excited The Whole time to meet all the new people.
good,Unloading the trucks was fun. I got along with most of Walmart's staff
good,"WalMart as a company is a good place, however the specific location in Jacksonville, NC was very biast and made one feel it was just a job, not a possible career goal."
good,I enjoyed working as a TLE tech. It was a hands on job that I got to enjoy and perform every duty there.
good,"Time went by fast and all you had to do was ring up peoples groceries and put them in a bag. Piece of cake. Every now and then you had a customer with an nasty attitude but you just talk to them calmly and everything will be okay. This job is great, you get benefits, discounts, free merchandise, and meals. Treated just like a family. Love."
good,"I am a full time college student and Walmart goes above and beyond to make sure I can work around school. Management has lack of communication, but overall a great place to work while in college, needing some extra money."
good,Lots of opportunity if you're willing to put in the hard work!
good,"A typical day at work is walking into work and evaluating your department.  First item of business is to print out who will be working that day to make a plan of action.  Also we check how much our sells were for the day before to see if one of our departments didn't perform as it should of, so we can make any changes needed to increase sales.  We then get any freight that came in the night before so we can work it to the floor.  During this time management will come by and walk our department to create a list of items needing attention for the day.  Some days our lists are longer than others, so my co-workers or myself, will move to another department to help.  Team work is the only way to go."
good,"My time here allowed me to learn more than my day to day duties of a cashier, I learned alot about the company itself. Good management, staff not so much."
good,Management was willing to work with me and let me learn more about the different departments. I had the chance to work in many of the departments and got great training.
good,Great place to work for students due to flexible hours and friendly staff.
good,"I had a great time working at Wal-Mart but I think it was mostly due to the people I worked with. The people in my department made it a really fun place to work but If they weren't there, it wouldn't have been as worth while. The management definitely has some problems because one manager would tell us one thing and another would tell us a completely other thing. But benefits and pay were OK. Altogether an OK place to work if you are looking for a part-time job - not a career."
good,"A typical day at work would be a good day being that I enjoy working with people and seeing new faces. I did have my regular customers or elderly couple come in my line or that i assisted. Not everyone worked as a team and took part in doing our job responsibilities when it came to cleaning or keeping our work areas clean but I always stayed on top of things which sometimes could be the hardest part besides dealing with some rude customers that may have had a bad day at work and just ran in to get a few things but the customers are always right so no matter what we're supposed to great them and smile. Most management was fairly respectful but, I understand that some pressure may have come with their position so no personal feelings taken."
good,I pushed carts and helped people with whatever they needed. I learned to work independently when needed but also how to deal with a lot of different types of people. The managers were ok when they let people do their assigned jobs but often they had people do jobs they weren't qualified for and productivity was hindered because of it. The hardest part of the job was working with people who didn't want to work and let other people do the majority of the work. The most enjoyable part of my job was working outside and being able to work independently for the most part.
good,good hours some good people and love the fact they make the schedule 3 weeks in advance
good,"dia de trabalho intenso, aprendi a ser determinado pontual ,a gerencia boa convivecia, com os colegas sem restriçoes, a parte desagradavel era a renumeraçao salarial, e a agradavel era onibus da empresa."
good,"Fast paced working environment. Always busy, always active. I learned a lot more about customer service and what needs to be done as a team and a business. Management wasn't as great. There were constant switches for manager, department manager and store manager. Coworkers were fair. Very good people and always fun, but not well trained. Matter fact none of us were trained we just worked. Hardest part of the job was the non-steady schedule. Most enjoyable part was working and getting a check."
good,Co-workers are very close friends of mine to this day.  Manager's were great.  Best part of the job : working with the public.  Worst part of the job : working with the public.
good,the co-workers were great to work with and I loved it but the overnight  shift I couldn't handle it
good,"Is a daily new experience with all customers, challenging but a the same time always learning from them and myself."
good,My  shift may vary from 4 to 9 hours. We have really busy moments and a few slow moments. Everyone seems to be entergetic. The hardest part of my day is the commute home.
good,Gostei muito de trabalhar com os colegas aprendi muitas coisas mas falta desenvolver melhores seus diretores e gerentes
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers and got along with my managers very well. I liked the work and never really had a bad day while working there. The hardest part of the job was that I was pregnant so it was very exhausting being on my feet for multiple hours at a time. I enjoy cashiering so that was the nicest part of my job.
good,this environment is a steady pace and good humor place. I learned more about how to use computers. Management had several different levels and facets.  the camaraderie of co-workers was up beat and fun. the hardest part of the job for me was the standing for 8 hours at a time. the most enjoyable part for me was spending time in an environment where every employee had the same goal.
good,"Customer service, Rang up items, Had to deal with money and cash register"
good,It was a little overwhelming at first but my fellow employees as well as my supervisor were really helpful and friendly. excellent employee training.
good,"overnight"
good,This was a seasonal job that I worked at through high school.
good,"Uma das empresas que mais cresce no mundo. Muito determinada e engajada com seus funcionários, estabelece metas e fornece as ferramentas para ambos crescerem."
good,"IT was a good job, but it's not a place where you want to make a career."
good,A typical work day would include loading and unloading trucks. We would then unbox the merchandise to hang on the racks.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with other workers and consumers. The hardest part of the job was staying 3 hours after scheduled to be released and having to attend college very early the next morning.
good,"Awesome, energetic people to work with. Physically demanding on the body but loved every minute of it. Great way to show my organization skills."
good,The first part of my day includes clocking in and finding my register assignment. I go to my register and invite customers to my line. I then ring up their items while engaging in short conversations. There are a few regular customers that I have a bond with. I bag their items in an orderly fashion as I go. Some days I work in the Self Checkout area. Here I greet and assist customers when they need help. I keep supplies stocked and make sure the area is clean and accident free. I learned responsibility and time management. My co-workers are very helpful and friendly. I would say the hardest part of the job is learning how to remove security tags. The most enjoyable part of this job are the people I work with and the customers.
good,Not to demanding. Flexible environment. Wonderful people to work with.
good,"Working with customers, decorating cakes, baking set-up, pricing merchandise to be put the floor, checking inventory."
good,Really liked this job. Co-workers were a delight to work with and I enjoyed my work.
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart during the holidays. The pay was low (7.80) and the managers were very disrespectful. It was a good first job and I say become a cashier. I hated working in the cluttered backroom with careless employees. I never did any training and was put on the cash register on my first day. The 30 to 40 year old employees are the worst probably because they still working at Wal-Mart. The lunch hour is great because you get a full hour, And two 15 minute breaks."
good,the typical day at this job was challenging. I've learned to value the customers because they're always right. Some management was great while others needs anger management classes. The hardest part of the job was getting an unsatisfied customer. the most enjoyable part was getting to help so many different peoples.
good,I always dealt with new customers who were both in a good or bad mood because of their experience at the store. The management were really nice and fun to work with. I think using WIC was the hardest but I got the handle of it soon enough.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with the company. If you wanted to make it a career there, the opportunity was available.."
good,"A typical day, I would go around the parking lot, collecting carts into stalls, then pushing long stacks of carts into bays for use by the customers, using a cart mule. The hardest part of the job is not the labor, but the low number of staff, both overseeing and carrying out the job. Often, they send only one cart pusher out there for an entire shift, with no assistance until the carts fall severely behind, which, due to the low number of staff members, happens often. Coworkers, if there ever are any, leave you to your own devices and theirs. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sun."
good,Working at Black's gave me a full insight to the functional side of photography while still allowing me to show my creative side. This was a great knowledgeable opportunity.
good,I enjoyed the constant change of guest and work interaction
good,A easy day at work is when no one calls in and we are staffed. I learned alot from working at Walmart. Management are all different. Some are strict and go by the book while some are easy going and likes the rules followed but they aren't on you all the time. You just have to learn to adjust to the different management we get. The hardest part of the job is when your coworker on your team doesn't ever show up to work so it makes us short staffed. I like to get the job done not partial. The most enjoyable part about my job is I learn a lot of new information that I never did before. I'm always learning something new every now and then which is a good thing.
good,It was good customer service experience. I enjoyed working with people.
good,I was able to become very people oriented through the customer service that you are to give.
good,"maintain the proper function of the sporting goods dept, was gun saled certified, enjoyed the customer service"
good,I loved working at this Walmart alot. I am a people person so i enjoy having a job in customer service. I love my job and I do it well.
good,solid job in the past although the policies are increasingly pro company rather than pro employee.
good,A typical day at work for me includes processing the returns and all claims from the evening prior as well as the current day. Working here has taught me a lot about how the cycle goes in running a business and how things need to go to make it successful. If everyone works the layout as the system states then business will run properly. Management plays a big role in carrying out the daily tasks of dealing with customer issues as well as employee issues. As long as the customer is happy and the employee has a good environment to work in all is well. I feel my co-workers play one of the biggest roles in the success of Wal-mart.Customer service is key and is mandatory. The hardest part of my job would be making sure that all of the claims for the day have been processed correctly so that the store gets all the credit it deserves and the most enjoyable part of my job would be reviewing the monthly journal and seeing that my store received the less possible charge backs and therefore the most possible credit for the month. That makes it all worth it.
good,Walmart was a overall good place to work with friendly people. A typical day was always programmed and organized in a timely manner. Managers were pretty fair for the most part and the co-workers were a joy to be around. There wasn't really a hard part because you always had help and the most enjoyable part was having a family at your job.
good,"My job at Wal-Mart is pretty good the job is pretty good there are some problems but any job you have your going to run into problems, most the managers aren't bad most of them are really great and the co-workers are really good and its a fast paced job and your usually always moving around and doing something. The most thing about working at Wal-Mart that I enjoy is the co-workers and also the fact that I work on the frontend and I know all the areas that involve the frontend such as customer service and money center. I have also learned that working in retail isn't always that easy there are times that you have to bite your tongue about some things and you have to put up with a lot."
good,"usually I would bring in carts, carry heavy objects and change garbages."
good,I liked working there but they don't hire any one full time any more. They don't give out benefits any more either. I had to lift 75+ while i was nine months pregnant .
good,Loved to be a team player & work safely! Stay busy to help time fly bye!
good,Hard work and fast pace to assist customers with their day to day needs.
good,i had an okay time. i feel like there is too much responsibility and enough pay. also very unorganized.
good,"Lo que más me ha gustado de la Empresa es que fomenta las relaciones cordiales entre los compañeros de trabajo. Hay una gran camaradería entre todos nosotros."
good,There room to grow always something new to learn every almost the same routine everyday but with different merchandise.
good,I unloaded trucks in a very hostile work environment. My co- workers were usually very hostile and it was usually a very rough day.
good,"The company its self is a good company, the store however needs management improval and better compensation for the amount of expectations they have for an hourly associate."
good,my friends work there with me nice break time whent out to eat and hung out on days off
good,"Overall, a good company but payed to low.  Not enough hours.  I did learn how to stock produce.  Hard work for the low pay though."
good,"I learned good customer service experince, receptionist quality's, how to log info into the computer , info about cars and much more."
good,"People who talk about other people seem to advance quickly. Schedules at the end of my employment where random, no set days off, one or two week advance schedule to plan your life with family."
good,"I come in put returns in soft line area. I work in ladies dept. Cleaning up the area place clothes in right spot. Fold , cleaning and giving great customer services. Sometime I work where I needed. I am multitask jewelry , shoes, cashier front line."
good,"I would restock anything that we had that was getting low, change signing, help customers, check out customers, help the front when they got really busy, straighten the area you are in; constantly and just be available and help the customer any way you can."
good,Fun place to work. Always open with staff and offered numerous opportunities for advancement if proven.

We had to handle several upset patients on a daily basis and I was very successful at that.  My co-workers were often rude to the manager, the patients, other customers and each other.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of team work and that I often felt as if no one had my back. The best part was having such wonderful patients.  They were happy to see us and even made us brownies for our birthday."

The rest of the time I would bin back whatever back stock was brought back to me. I learned how to manage my time well and work alongside the stockers and other ICS workers. Management was alright most of the time but they would often have communication issues with each other and the other workers. The hardest part of the job would be when we have an overflow of stock that needed to be picked or binned and everyone would fall behind. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to and befriend most of the other workers."

Providing excellent customer service and direction for most of departments in store.  While I was there I was able to improve on my customer service experience.

good,Very nice work place. Unload trucks and put products in back for stocking. Some heavy lifting. Good people
good,I worked in the toy department at Walmart.  I left and went to Olive Garden due to change in management.
good,"Go in wait for daily meeting then check on tasks some would have realistic hours for estimated completion time others would have outrageous completion times such as 16 hours for an 8 hour shift. Management would usually have no communication and would conflict with what they would tell us to do and in the end sometimes would get coached for what another management said to do. However if we were in a strain management would help. Good co workers however there is a lot of gossip. Good breaks, and sometimes they would do little cook outs for us. Good job overall."
good,"After a every day warm up meeting with my supervisor, then i follow through with the tasks needed to be done that day.  As well as anything else that comes up. At the end of the day i make a what to do list for the next day. I clean up my working area, so it can be ready for the next shift to come in and start working. In my department all my co-workers are very friendly. I think the most hardest part of the job is, to make sure you get the right freight so you can get your numbers at the end of the day. I enjoy working for Wal mart because they look out for there workers."

good,I loved working at Wal-Mart at the time.  I had great co-workers and management. The hardest part about my job was rude people.
good,"A maneira de liderança desta empresa é ótima,o dia a dia entre os colegas também."
good,"Typically, my job as a sales associate at Wal-Mart is a great way of learning how to work with the public.Working at Wal-Mart, I've learned how to work with the public in a professional manner, how to do inventory, customer service, stock items, sales floor remodeling. At times, I have to combine my work load along with a co-workers because their shift has ended already and that is a hard part of my job. My part in helping customers is it's own reward."
good,I spent nearly 3 years working overnight at Walmart. The people were friendly and the work wasn't too hard.
good,"I am very happy with Walmart, I am just looking for relief work"
good,"Walmart is the world's largest leading retailer and after working here, it is very easy to tell why. The people that are hired in are one of a kind. They are some of the nicest people to work with and it doesn't take much to get along with them and feel like you are welcomed to the store. Each individual strides to make the customer come first in any situation. Every associate is willing to stop immediately with what they are doing to make sure the customer finds what they want or gets the help they need on getting items out of reach or far to heavy for one person to grab. Management is some of the best around. Every manager is there to help you succeed and to help you every step of the way. No manager just sits around and does nothing. Every manager is either on the sales floor, working with customers and doing some of the dirty work themselves with keeping the shelves neat or setting up new displays, or they are in the backroom, helping with trucks, keeping track of inventory, making sure all of the backroom associates are doing well. The only hard part about your day will just be getting everything that is handed to you done on time. Most of the time, you are given many tasks to complete in one day and sometimes, there just isn't enough time in the day to do so. If you love customer service though, this is definitely the job to go for."

good,I had an amazing time working in retail at Walmart Canada Co. I feel as though my skills have improved greatly and look forward to continue my growth in retail.
good,Stocking is done through the time a shift is worked and having team members around helps with the daily tasks. Hardest part is moving new stock from truck to your area. The weight to push and pull it tiring yet helps to build a persons strength.

good,"Every day at Walmart involved rushing from one point of the store to the other to assist customers with product information, gathering products from the back room, and assisting them with shopping in the store.

good,Not there long enough to really have an opinion on anything other than the people I worked with. They were all good to me.
good,"Ive learned so much about the retail business by working at walmart. I have become friends with alot of people, and continue to make friends everyday. Management works with you on schedules if there is an issues."

In this smaller McDonalds food corporation the employees were responsible for almost all tasks to keep the business running. The tasks includes working in the grill, learning how to use a cash register, dealing with costumers, calculating inventory, and cleaning sites of the restaurant.

good,working at Walmart was very interesting to me.i learn a lot about team work and how to think about the customer .there were times where i would ask to stop working and help elders to shop for their needs.
good,"Okay, so I worked overnight and we told the new-hires their first night clocking on that if they can make it to day 90 then they will make it to year 20 since it will all start to blend together. The work WAS fun, but then they came up with the torture called the timing system where I would start stocking something in grocery with an impossible time limit and end up bounced to 4 departments by the end of the night. My reviews consistently were high except I was standard everywhere by not excellent anywhere. After my second month working there I noticed that employees were becoming more and more expendable to management and devoted myself to becoming very difficult to replace by being there and ready to learn every part of every department and never complaining about anything. I was successful, and often referred to as the ping-pong ball of the shift since I always would start one place, but worked cashier breaks, electronics and would end up in the backroom by shift end. My health started to decline due lack of time in the sun, excessive time under the fluorescent lights and high amount of cardboard dust so I finally decided to leave for the sake of my health. "
good,"The company is a great place to work with alright benefits. The work is very hard and 8 years weigh on the body. Even with my experience and Bachelors degree in Management, I was not able to move up the latter."
good,My typical day at work would be me going in down stacking freight cleaning area and putting away buggies as well as claiming out damaged goods I didn't work with management because they only came around if your assignment was  going wrong I always worked alone the hardest part of the job was when we had trucks come in late because you would think you were almost done the they bring you a hour of freight that has to be done by the end of the night for me the most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers
good,"Would go to work on time clocked in checked to see where I would be working went there set my register up made sure I had plenty supplies to do my job effectively. Management was helpful would take time to listen to our needs and would generally get what was needed to make our job go smoothly. I made New friends with most co workers ,worked well with them usually had opportunity to use team work to accomplish our job done...."

I had to show everything I knew to my direct DM. It was a great place to work, but I felt I should have been treated better seeing as I was the ""go to Girl"".

good,The management is horrible and at times very slow. The co-workers are often very nice and fun to be around. the hardest part of the job is being on your feet in one spot all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on the register and having the day go by faster.
good,"Checking out customers"
good,Two days was never the same. There was always something to do.
good,"Tive oportunidades de adquirir novos conhecimentos em vários setores, exemplo: administrativo, capital humano, padaria entre outros."
good,WalMart is a good place to work. Stress free and room for growth.
good,This a a good company to work for if you need part time work or seasonal.  They work around your schedule as much as possible and  offer opportunities for advancement.

good,"I never had a set schedule. So my day started different every day. I would clock in and immediately start my duties. I would go to the parking lot and start collecting carts for customers to use. I than would sweep and clean up the front of the store so it looked nice for the customers. I also helped the customers load and unload there groceries, electronics, furniture, or to help the people who were disabled get there things to and from there cars. The people that worked there were great. I was glad to help where ever I could. The hardest part of my job was working outside in all types of weather, especially when I had to push the shopping carts by hand in the winter. But I got it done. The best part of working there was being able to meet and talk to new people."
good,First thing we do is to walk receiving and see if there is any unworked freight then we go to put out freight.  Order and pick from the bins. Then we zone and find out notes of where and what we will be doing .  I have learned to be very adaptable in change of plans for the day. We all pull together to help each other. The hardest part of the job is that we are hardly ever in our on department.  The enjoyable part or job is to be able to help someone.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience working at Walmart. Your tasks are laid out very clearly, with little deviation. However, some expectations of employees are unrealistic."
good,Come into work and check customers out in a very speedy rate and gained very good relationships with customers.
good,Very busy and demanding. I enjoyed my job and my department until a new store manager took over and it was no longer enjoyable. I was fired after 3 years and covering for 2 other managers that quit for clocking out 5 minutes over 5 hours. The rule was you have to take a break or lunch within 5 hours. I was helping a customer and there was no one else to do that.
good,"Un dia normal de trabajo se basaba en la revisión de reportes del dia anterior, para proceder a cotejar contra sistema todos los movimientos que habían ocurrido, además de llevar un control de la mercancía en existencia, darle seguimiento, trabajar con los demás jefes de departamento en el trabajo de reportes."
good,"Working retail, sometimes it can be slow depending on your department and the day. Whether it's cleaning, organizing, or going about your daily duties, there's always something to do"
good,My favorite part about this job was the customers. I love working with people. There were no hard parts. The management was really friendly. My co-workers were cool as well.
good,"The job was a fast paced, hectic, retail business. There was a lot of paperwork and very little instruction for new management employees."
good,I loved my job. I enjoyed most people that I worked with which made it a  plesant environment to work in.
good,"The nights where long but it was worth it."
good,"Working for WalMart, I was able to move up in the company quicking. Management was very supportive."
good,Help customers find what they are looking for.  Help customers sign up for phone contracts through Verizon and ATT.  I sell mostly electronics to customers and other stuff but its okay cause i work my butt off and man does it kill like everyday its rude customer after rude customer.
good,Was a good place to work. I learned alot from my doctor and coworkers.I continue to stay in Optical for 15 years.
good,"My last position in the company I stocked shelves wherever I was needed and zone the area as well.  I learned a great many things with my 8 years in the company, I worked in almost every department.  Management varied depending on the store but overall they were friendly and willing to assist when needed.  Hardest part of the job was trying to meet my goals while maintaining excellent customer service.  Most enjoyable part of my job was all the learning opportunities my job afforded me."
good,"On your feet all day."
good,its a good place to start for your first job. Management isnt exactly too friendly or helpful
good,I enjoyed doing my job. It wasn't difficult to do my job and very big on teamwork.
good,it was a good place to work at in night I had a lot of fun there. I had the best time having some fun co workers and the hours was great there
good,"I was a cart pusher, so my job was horrible. But the pay was good."
good,"Fast paced, new people, good co-workers and management, learned how to work as a team, fairly easy job, was alot of fun"
good,"Wal-Mart is a great company to work with for a season and learn the foundation of a successful retail business.  I perfected my customer service skills here, learned the importance of inventory management and turnover, and I grew in my administrative skills.  A typical work day really depends on how the day and night before went.  If there was a lot of freight left over, the goal would be to work through that.  If there are price changes in the system, that is not to be neglected.  My departments must be toured daily and if not up to par, addressed with diligence and timeliness which include zoning, out-of-stocks, missing labels, and modular integrity.  Management often had a communication lag and each one gave their own tasks assignments which meant there were more things to be done than possible to complete in a given work day most of the time.  I had the store manager, co-manager, and two assistant managers to answer to almost everyday.  There were some who were more informative who helped decipher priority of assignments for the store in that day when we are taken out of our normal routines for the day.  Some co-workers cared, most did not but I believe a great management team makes a difference in that area.  The hardest part of the job was being able to complete ALL the assignments each day in excellence with outrageous and machine-like deadlines.  What I did enjoy was impacting other associates lives and even the customers in positive ways and seeing smiles returned back to me when it was done."
good,come in at 10:00 pm.then attend the overnight crew meeting to  listen for your work station. then u report to workstation with others and break down  the new and old freight by aisles on different pallets. then move the pallets to the aisles for each worker in your area. then each individual stocks their own freight on each aisle. then after all the freight is stocked the individual removes the plastic and cardboard to the back room for compacting in the baler. the the individual zones( pull all the freight forward to look nice for the customers) their own aisle and help others finish their freight if needed.then you leave to go home at 7:00 am.
good,I have learned many management skills and how to deal effectively with many different types of people in many different situations to include both customers and associates.
good,"Typical work day was initial meeting, work assignment, New Stock, Old Stock. Very Routine. If you are not in shape, overnight floor jobs may work as a big workout routine."
good,The management team was bipolar. One manager was crazy while the other two were pretty easy going. The environment was okay. The work was okay. Could be kind of hard on the body. It wasn't a bad experience.
good,"while working at walmart i learned to understand and be patient. i learned to be come a leader and get my work done right the first time. the hardest part of my job was to not be a to calm an angry customer down, but the most enjoyable to meet many different people."
good,"Certain positions, of course, are more difficult than others. Overall I would say that although my certain location had a lot of areas they could improve in; I'm glad I had the opportunity to work at Wal-Mart"
good,"Everybody helps each other out if they need help."
good,Short meetings before start of shift then crunch time to meet deadlines.  Very fast paced environment where every warm body was needed to get the job done quickly and efficiently.
good,I think the people are great but they need to plan ahead better
good,My day would star with me clocking in and heading to the front of the store to make sure we had carts for customers getting some if needed. The most important thing that I learned is that we are in the business to serve our customers. When it comes to the management they are there to make sure that the store is customer friendly. The one the thing that I can say about my co workers is that we considered each other like family. The Hardest part of the job was when I was let go. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I saw my coworkers and the customers.
good,very strong culture that demands adherence to company policies and procedures.
good,"Set up for truck"
good,"Clock in, go to the back and get boxes, stock front of store, cashier, customer service."

good,"A typical day consist of helping customers, stocking shelves, and cashing customers out. Sometimes helping them carry merchandise out the store to their car."
good,"Walmart sales associates perform several job duties during a typical shift. Sales associates with Walmart often stock shelves, check expiration dates, and organize displays. Walmart sales associates also assist customers with a variety of requests. Sales associates at Walmart may direct customers to the placement of goods, check backstock for products not on the shelf, or assist customers with a sales decision."
good,Great company to work for. You will not get many hours but they are flexible. The co workers were great in every department I worked in.
good,"I started my day at 10pm 4-5 nights a week.  After the shift meeting everyone went to their respective departments to begin working through the new freight.  We were given one hour lunches and 2 15 minutes breaks each shift."
good,"A typical day at work is coming to work on time going to the front of the store, asking your supervisor for a register and taking customers and providing the best customer service possible. I have learned how to run an electronic cash register, excellent cash handling, use a Tellermate audit machine, help all the customers and cashiers with their needs and problems. Management is great when you tell them about a problem you have they fix it as soon as they can. My co-workers are great, they are fun and really helpful when need be. The hardest part of the job is when a problem occurs with the registers and we are not sure how to fix it. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with customers I am very sociable and love dealing with people on an ever day basis."
good,"Your overall experience working for the company all depends on which store you work at. The first Wal Mart I worked in was horrible. The second one I worked for was just okay, management wasn't very supportive or productive. The last one I worked for was great. Granted it had barely opened, but non-the-less everyone was extremely nice."
good,Over all walmart was a good job I enjoyed working there and the environment was a good one.
good,You check your department see what needs to be filled you check if you have product and always rotate and fill it. Sometimes its hard to prove to management you are a hard worker. I enjoy helping out customers that is the best part of the day.
good,I liked working for WalMart because each day I met new people. Working for WalMart helped me open up and not be as shy around new people. It allowed me to achieve better communication skills and most certainly customer service skills.

Returning unwanted items to there proper place. Stocking and organizing merchandise in different departments. What I learned while working at Walmart is things get done better, fasters and easier when everyone works together including management. My co workers made the job fun and sometimes easier. The hardest part of the job is if you get in trouble as a team when you do your part and others didn't do theirs. The most enjoyable part of the job is when all your work is completed on time and done the right way."
good,"A typical day at work consists of stocking shelfs in an accurately and timely fashion until you are finished with your assigned isle then helping your co-workers finish their isles when you are finshed. After that you are to straighten every single item in your isle and make sure it is in the correct spot, when completely finished you are to help with any extra tasks assigned to you by your manager. My co-workers where very friendly and excepting. This job was not to difficult to handle, the most enjoyable part was speaking to customers."

I learned and used skills that are valuable to everyday life. My co-workers were the hardest part of the job, they were most of the time negative and unwilling to teach, but on days when they were in good moods usually made up for the other days. The best part of the job was I liked to go to work everyday for the most part, I like helping customers, and learning something new everyday."
good,"I love the public and this job allowed me to directly converse with people from all walk of life! I love to be able to interact with people, after all we make the world go round!"
good,"I learned and advanced all my basics with this company. Management was highly unorthodox, lacking in organization, department opportunities often declined, and the culture irrelevant to the company label. Benefits, Steady employment, are great! I handled lot attending, freezer and dairy stocking, and most of all on going friendly guest, business skills."
good,"They like to promise positions, and make you perform them, but do not pay you for them. I have been promised advancement, even to the slightest for 3 years, but it hasn't happened. There are also too many managers that do not communicate. They are all telling you to do things the way they want them done, but take it out on you if you do not do what they say versus the other one. Other than that, the employees are great, and they make Walmart fun."
good,I have past last 3.5 month in Walmart as a customer service representative I have learn lots of thing as a new immigrant in canada
good,"Days where their wasn't nobody at work at the time and its only you and you have a line full of people and theirs nobody to help but management, so you try your best in getting customers out the way and helping management as well."

good,"o Wallmart Brasil é uma empresa boa mais que por alguns motivos deixa a desejar em alguns pontos."
good,its cool sometimes but its a good place to grow in but some of  the managers don't care about your well  being but it could be a good job if the management where excellent to the workers like there customers and the work is good I like working so that doesn't bother me I just do my assignments and help in other departments when I'm done doing my work and go over everything before my shift is over but the hard part is we be short on associates so we have to work twice as hard and get other associates from other departments.
good,"Typical day at work for me at Wal-Mart is meet and greet new and current customers. Scanning merchandise and taking cash, credit, and debit. Management was okay for this company. Co-Workers were great, very helpful. The hardest part about this job was dealing with difficult customers face to face.

good,"A typical day involves speaking with customers, completing assigned tasks, and making sure the customer leaves satisfied. I learned how to effectively work in a busy environment and to remain calm while doing so. The hardest part of the job would be experiencing customers who were not happy with the service that they received. I enjoyed being able to work at my own pace and to make decisions regarding how the toy department would be set up."
good,"Je m'assure que les clients sont satisfait de leur achat ainsi que du service reçu. "
good,"The people I work with make the work experience enjoyable. Its a fast paced environment where you meet new people every day.

Foi muito bom ter conhecido todos do meu serviço e da empresa também os chefes."
good,"I have learned quite a bit working for Walmart as a company. Customer Service is very important for the consumers which brings them back time after time. I've learned various skills in assisting the customers and provide all information and details as possible to assure the customer all of their concerns will be addressed and resolved. The hardest part about my job is not being able to resolve and take care of the customers right away in most cases being that in the escalation center, so much can be done with the limited tools provided to the team. I feel that management can be more involved with the associates and build relationships to make the environment more family like. However, I love talking and taking care of the customers and being a part of the Wal-mart team."
good,I enjoyed my time at Wal-mart because I developed great relationships with regular customers and my coworkers. I learnd from Wal-mart my capacity to be a manager. I learned that I can handle a variety of situations and do very well under both pressure and proper employee tasking. The hardest part of this job was the third shift schedule and some of my dealings with my direct supervisors as I was not treated that well. However the most enjoyable part of my time at Wal-mart was my face to face interaction with customers and the employees that I had the pleasure of supervising.

During my daily work i also learned to keep up with current stock on hand, future planning and customer service."
good,"Gained the most experience at this job, although I am not happy about the way they let me go, it was most productive.  I learned how to deal with difficult customers, and learned to advertise and the aspects of business.  I enjoyed helping the customers with their photos and finding products in the store.  I performed opening and closing procedures in the photo lab, maintenance on the photo machines and the printers.  Printing and putting photo products together (Canvas, calenders, photo books, etc.)  I learned how to run the whole photo lab, the only thing I didn't have the option for was ordering supplies.  Some of the managers were nice, and were willing to work with my schedule.  Most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and listening to their stories."
good,not much to say about them. Great team of hard-working individuals.
good,It was a enjoyable time when i worked with the some of the coworkers and some times it was ruff because some employees would not respect others and would make it difficult.

good,"Customer service based role in the clothing department. dealing with customers enquires and serving them at till points and also answering telephone enquires. I learned a great deal about customer service with this being my first job. I learned how to approach difficult situations but also learned that you have back up from the members of management. I had a few different members of management through out my time at ASDA and I have to say all were very good and fair in their approach towards their staff. They were there if needed and showed that everyone was part of team but more so you were apart of their team on their department. My co-workers were really nice, friendly and helpful towards all members of staff but more so to new members to make sure they were feeling good in their new job. The hardest part of the job was working until 10pm as I was a full time student with long university hours then hard to continue to work till at least 10pm.

good,"A day was I'd come in at 6:45 even though I didn't have to be there till 7, because I wanted to be ready when the customers came through the doors. The customer service desk was the busiest place in the morning."
good,"I work in a fast paced environment were my top priority is to provide excellent customer service in a leadership manner.Since I've worked at Walmart my interpersonal skills have strengthen and I have learned to strategize so that i can complete my daily tasks in a timely manner. Although I am a fair person,the most difficult part of my job is making decisions that people do not always agree with.The most enjoyable part of my job is being a great problem solver. I enjoy helping people!"

I have loved both my managers and how much they did to make sure their employees were taken care of, weather it was time off or needing a schedule change. I've met some amazing people at both locations who have worked to help me learn as much as I could. Hardest part of the job is trying to help irate customers when you don't have something in stock or explaining why their insurance won't cover it. I really enjoyed the job as a whole"

There is no job security, you could be promoted one week and fired the next no matter how long you have been there.

good,The work days fly by because each day there is a lot to do.  Great co workers.
good,"typical work day consisted of unloading the GM truck at the begging of our shift, followed by a short break then the crew unloads the grocery truck, and pulled the pallets to the sales floor. We go to lunch everyday around 8 or 9 at night for an hour, then pulled the GM pallets to the sales floor and cleared the back room. Our day shift managers were always willing to help us with our work loads but at night the managers were no where to be found most of the time and when you asked them for help with something they made up an excuse and walked away from you. My co-worker were enjoyable to be around and to work with they made the job fun. Most enjoyable part of my job was stacking pallets in the back lot with forklift."
good,"I worked at Walmart twice, I think it's great they rehire you if you leave on good terms but you might not necessarily get the same position.

There was no hard part of the job to me, I enjoyed being able to be social on the job and demonstrate with customers."
good,I was mentored for management but limited by availability. Received exceeds expectations on all evaluations.I worked well with other associates and was a team player as well as a role model for others.

I done considerably better than the other cashiers however after continuously being told I'd be getting the new job as department manager they hired two completely new individuals from out of the store to fill the position. Withen one week of this happening i found a job going from 7.65 to 23.33 an hour with twice the benifits, No regreats here lol"
good,Wal-Mart quickly placed me in an environment and recognized my skills and abilities to conduct day to day activities.
good,"I worked with this company for almost seven years. I never hated my JOB. I disliked very strongly the conflicting policies and statements made by management.

I worked  at Lem Turner Walmart and I despised most managers, due to the fact that they thing they are higher than you and have stubborn, conceited attitudes and always find something to send you home for. Some are cool, but most of them are annoying,"
good,"Have had a wonderful experience with Wal-Mart Pharmacy. Time to expand my horizon's after 13 years. We are a very fast paced pharmacy. Including many insurance resolutions, filling, inputing, maintaining patient files, inventory control, stocking medications, cashiering and over the counter managing experience. I have learned so much more past schooling from my Pharmacist Manager. We have worked together for 10 years and even when times were tough he always made it to be easy with good humor all day, and  having a great team of techs that I'm very proud to work with.

Everyone that i worked with were fun and friendly. The hardest part of the job was staying focused and the most enjoyable part was learning how to do new things."

Management were easy to work with and they tried to be flexible. The co-workers were a fun bunch to work with and were good about team work. The hardest part of the job was the unstable hours.

good,The company starts you out better than most do and they give you different opportunities.
good,A typical day at work for me started at 10 Pm. Had a between a 10-30 minute meeting with managers and other co-workers. Since i worked the overnight shift we usually picked up where second shift left off from stocking. All night we moved merchandise and stocked. I learned a lot from working there in the short time that i was there. They teach you a lot so you are a well rounded person and can work in any section of the store. At Walmart when you work overnight you get two fifteen minute breaks and an hour for lunch which was awesome. The most enjoyable part of my job was all my co-workers who worked with me. Management needs help. They give you to much and expect you to do all of it before you leave which rarely happened.
good,"My overall experience at Walmart has been pretty good. Even though I had to get adjusted to how things work, the ins and outs, and long periods of standing on your feet, things are good."

good,This is an OK place to work. It is quite cold in the freezer; the freezer frost tastes awful! I have learned tons about time management and effective enunciation at this employee. The hardest part of the 'job' is dealing with the cold.  Working only three days a week and supporting a family of 4 is amazing!

It really doesn't matter what Department you work for, or what  job title you have if you know how the do the task or are physical able to do the task, management will pull you for the task.  Cross-training in your department and the whole store. As of right now everyone is to have a open availability or your hours will be cut. "
good,Wal-Mart is an exciting place to work and I get along with all of my co-workers. I make the best of my day every time that I go to work. You have to have patience when it comes to dealing with people and that I have a lot of.

good,I have appreciated the opportunity to work here. it is a great place to practice good work ethics
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart would be exhaustingoI am a cashier but I do all types of jobs. I learned a lot while working here because I can basically do just about everything in the store. When I first started the management was terrible but it has gotten better except for the CSMs. I love all of my coworkers to the max we all get along really good. The hardest part of the job is having to go in the freezing cold to bring in baskets. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I meet new people.
good,Basic cashier skills and multi-tasking. Enjoyable because the same customers come in every day and become close with the employees.
good,"Expectations can be unrealistic, but it is an okay place to work."
good,"Walmart is a worldwide company, that has many different possibilities of career positions and areas for advancement depending   on what you may be looking for.

good,"On the overnight shift, we would have a meeting so we can talk about what we may did wrong and how we can progress. Through the night, we were required to bring all shopping carts back into the store, stock the shelves, take all trash to the bailer, and zone the store so it can be neat for the next day. I learned that hard work will always speak for itself and that is why they loved me. Me and other employees would always have a good time and converse on our 15 min breaks and our lunch breaks. It was very difficult lifting all of the heavy boxes in my department because I stocked the furniture. On the upside, I had help sometimes so I wouldn't hurt my back and the managers were always motivating me."
good,A typical day at Walmart for me was assisting staff and customers with their needs.

good,"Ótima empresa, mas com um cultura muito diferente das empresas brasileiras."
good,"maintaining department, learned how to maintain department and all the aspects associated with it."
good,I enjoyed learning new things when I was at work there.  Management was unfair at time and sometimes they were fair.
good,"While my time at Wal-Mart was brief, it was a great first experience in the work place. I learned customer service skills, how to communicate with management, and how to be a responsible worker. The relationships that I built with my co-workers was the most enjoyable part about my time spent at Wal-Mart."
good,Walmart is a good first job but if you need money for college or rent. go somewhere else

The days could be anywhere from quiet or overwhelming:depending on the season we were in.I had good managers.I got along well with all of my co-workers,The most enjoyable part of my work day is when I helped someone who really needed help,such as a handicap person or someone who seemed illiterate."
good,Un buen lugar para aprender. Se llevan a cabo actividades tanto comerciales e industriales que permiten aprender y dominar todas las areas.
good,Make sure work area is kept clean. Provide excellent and quick customer service. Answer any questions or regards the customer my have. Check price matches.
good,Managagement would try to listen to you but refused to help/
good,"Busy all the time, How to conduct yourself under a lot of pressure. Management was ok need to be more professional and organized. Need to be more professional. the hardest part dealing with upset customers that threatens you.  Enjoyable part is getting the customers in and out."
good,Walmart is a good company to work with. You have to have patience sometimes dealing with rude customers. Managers are well organized. Coworkers are determind to help customers to the best of their abilty
good,Not very good management and I wanted to become full time and they wouldn't make that possible. Loved the people but just needed to move on.
good,I worked overnights which had an amazing crew and very good culture. Awesome coworkers. Management was good. Loved counting and doing the accounting part. Being very fast at job led to having to do more harder physical work..
good,"A typical day at work was busy with loads of people coming in you have to be quick on your feet. I like keeping busy so that part of the job was definitely good. I learned to stay in control of myself with angry customers and definitely know how to handle things like that now. The management was a little unorganized, but for the most part was on top of their game.Well the coworkers you meet all types of people their were alot of college students like me so that was good."
good,"Just a regular cashier work everyday, boss are really nice, co-workers are willing to teach and talk to you, they are really nice to be around, the hardest part is too many items, try not to miss one."
good,It is a good company but the work days can be very hectic. Most days however are not too bad it just depends on the day of the week.

good,"clock in, get register assignment. run register. get a break every two hours. as far as management, people are very stressed and it shows. co-workers are like me, looking to augment full-time salaries or school. hardest part of the job are ornery customers. best part is the customers that are good-natured"
good,"Each day seemed like the job was using me for a mere tool and trained me in less area than i had expected in orientation. the hardest part of the job was the overflow of the customers during rush hours. even though i exceed at these, the air was crazy around this time, considering the fact of it was the three main holiday seasons in a row."
good,Great company. Pay could have been better but the work culture is good. Wal-mart continues to grow so the stability was there.
good,"Busy days."
good,"Working for Walmart was very educational on many levels.  They teach you what good team-work looks like, how to associate with internal and external customers, and what not to do where the general public is concerned.  They also teach you proper safety methods and protocol and how to exhibit them in all you do."
good,"Working the 3rd shift for a major corporation such as Walmart, had its benefits and down sides. One benefit was any employee who worked through the black friday sales events, was given a 25% off voucher to use on any purchase. One down side might be the strictness or how hard they tend to push the employees. This could be considered a managerial decision, not company policy however"
good,"El trabajo se realiza de manera rutinaria el desarrollo laboral se ve mermado por la actitud de algunos sistemas internos, el trato es amable y alegre"
good,Management was kind of rude they didn't care about person issues which is the down side for working for a huge company with so many employees. low pay rate at one year you get a .40 raise. Loved all my coworkers lots of different people to meet. I loved interacting with customers except the occasional crazies. NO OVERTIME or they will lecture you. Two 15 minute breaks and one hour lunch. It was a good first job but if you have kids I don't recommend it because they are 24/7 and I somehow always hit the 4pm-12a shift. Older more valued employees get morning shift.
good,A typical day at work consisted of me stocking shelves and helping customers with their shopping needs.
good,"Unloaded boxes off of a freight truck and learned responsibility "
good,"This was just not the job for me, I didn't value my job mostly because I felt like they would just hire anybody."
good,go from start to end--plenty--good and bad--great--payroll--associates and customers
good,go from start to end--plenty--good--great--traveling to and from--associates and customers
good,We started by unloading the trucks then we would pull all the freight to the area it needs to be in. We would then either scan merchandise in or out of bins. After all that is complete we would finish the day by stocking shelves.
good,"Walmart pharmacy is a very busy pharmacy. I fill prescriptions, do customer service, process insurance, input prescriptions, among many other things."
good,My typical day at work consists of assisting customers in the electronics department.
good,"Walmart, is a fun place to work, associates are always friendly."
good,"Pessoas motivadas, quem busca conhecimento só tende a aprender e muito. A direção e gerência, em alguns momentos precisam se orientar mais aos funcionários."
good,"When I started, I thoroughly enjoyed working there, but as time went on, I learned that the management team doesn't communicate well with each other or lower level management or associates. However, my job is relatively easy, and I enjoy serving the customers that come in, some who are considered my ""regulars""."
good,Wal-mart gave me the oppurtnity to move up in the ranks because of production which i liked.Being an employee their i was a maker of my own sucess. W
good,"A typical day is clocking in and getting to your scheduled register for the day. You start by counting your till and turning on your light to begin serving customers however they need. I learned procedures and took tests on procedures every other month or so to make sure my skills and knowledge was up-to-date. The hardest part of the job was when codes changed on different products rapidly. It was also difficult when things were unorganized management wise. I enjoyed the co-workers, the quiet times spent zoning, working in other departments that needed assistance, learning new material, and when the store had a steady flow of consumers to keep the registers and time flowing."
good,"Most days you stay busy, which is good. I like to be active , not just standing around. The hardest part of this job is dealing with angry customers. The best part is helping customers have a good shopping experience."

good,I traveled all over the US. I was the crew leader. I enjoyed working for this company.
good,"I walk in to my department and decided where I'm placing my associates to make to most out of the day. I then straighten up my department and then I start stocking my area while I wait for my notes for the day from upper management. The hardest part of my job are the days of bad weather, when there are games on tv or the holidays. Our sandwiches are very popular. The best part of my day are when I can make the call of bending the rules to help a customer in the time of need. I need a 24 hour notice to make the sandwiches or platters but when a customer calls and tell me that there was a death in the family I'm more than happy to bend the rules just to help take some burden off their shoulders."
good,Dar y generar reportes de inventario en general de toda la tienda
good,"I was trusted to work independently to stock and organize store product onto the shelves for customer viewing.  I enjoyed the management style, they had an open door policy.  I felt like the other stockers worked together as a team to get the company projects done efficiently."
good,Good Pay and benefits were pretty good too.  Very well organized and structured.  Typical retail warehouse that gets busy around the holidays
good,"This job is what you make of it. The managers will only do what you stay on them to do. No one is going to look out for you, you have to look out for yourself. Starting from the very bottom there are not many opportunities available unless you are there for 4+ years. Even then it is hard to get into another area or on the floor. Being a cashier is very boring, the only excitement out of the day is police and customer thief drama. It is all about the customers and sometimes they converse with you, however you are required to keep doing your job so it is hard to have a conversation at any part of the day other than lunch. The hardest part of the job is staying busy. When things are slow you have to show that you are the best at what you do. Redlining to some managers can still look like you are doing nothing so I suggest to walk around the store picking up trash etc. The most enjoyable part of this job is the relationships that you hold with your team. I have a great team of cashiers and cashier managers that I know will do the right thing, the best part is that they can count on me to do my job."
good,"Area Manager – Dot.com/Shipping"
good,"it a very stressful job, it not the customers as much as upper management.."
good,"Unless your a full time employee, it seems to be difficult to get in the hours you need."
good,the job was not only about security but about problem solving and customer service
good,"This was a great job, I learned many things everyday. I was taught a lot about customer service and delegating tasks."
good,had some long busy days but thats work had so great co-workers all older than me so it was fun learning how to do the job from them and for management they was to busy them self to oversee the deli but it was all good the hardest part was weekends cause it was the most busyest time and when we was short handed
good,A great Place to work. Always learning something new weather it be a skill or product information. Great people to work with and fun getting to know and serve customers.
good,"my co workers were great friendly people, many task are done so you have to be very multi task"
good,"There was no typical day at the Walmart Foundation.  Everyday brought new opportunities to grow professionally because of the constant need for critical thinking and effective communication.  It was a tough job but I enjoyed almost every moment."
good,awesome job.  meet at lot of awsome people but better job came along and went for it.
good,"I was turned down for one of internal jobs I applied to by my mentor/supervisor, which was followed by a thorough insight on the job requirements and my deficiencies as a candidate. This allowed me to enhance those skills and emerge as a better professional."
good,Walmart has given me the opportunity to work with all different types of people which has driven me to want to go back to school and  work in health care. I love working with and helping people. A typical day at work consisted of 100% customer/patient service and it was always exciting and always something new.
good,Working at walmart was fun and I really enjoyed it for the first few months. But as time went on I was doing other jobs besides wath im paid to do. I was a day time maintances associate which is a 7.80 per hour job. then sometimes I would have to unload a truck or stock which are all higher paying jobs and I never saw one penny of that
good,Walmart had good benefits and a friendly work environment. It was easy for employees to invest in the company.
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers out. I learn something new everyday, either from a customer or from a manager. The management is good, even though I don't know all the management members but I assure you that they do their job. My co-workers are easy to get along with, and can be good friends. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a very upset customer that doesn't want to listen to you and accuses you of being wrong. I enjoy be there at Wal-Mart, I enjoy helping the customers and making new friends and getting along with all my co-workers and managers."
good,I most;y did returns as well as customer service. I also answered the phones and did returns and money gram.
good,always know you sch. time nothing changes. always keep you on your ioes
good,an ever changing retail body that keeps up with the needs of its customers over the years. I worked in many areas of the store and learned that the easiest lesson was that of servant leadership and being willing to serve both customers and associates alike with any and all areas of help.
good,"There are a lot of people that enjoy working for this company. I personally couldn't get past the idea that it was a requirement to kiss butt to get ahead. No matter what the job, the final outcome was that it had to be approved by whoever the assistant manager was that particular night and what mood the manager was in the next morning. I've always been the type to find out what the job is and get it done, never mind the personalities."
good,"Very fast paced"
good,"coworkers were awesome, sometimes it felt long, a lot of lack with managers and how they communicate hardest part was being able to maintain after customers put things on the  floor as well as opening packages... loved working with my coworkers"

good,"Packaging bread and cleaning."
good,"Walmart was a good place to start, I did enjoy being there but I wanted to explore my jobs options so I started looking for a new job."
good,Great place to work with benefits at every corner. Working third shift allows me to free p my days as well as receive a two (2) dollar pay increase.
good,Retail pharmacy very busy with customers.  Did about 500 to 600 Scripts a day.
good,"Work at the cash register and check people out"
good,"Great place to start out, while there, you have the opportunity to learn how to manage departments of the store and you learn how to do customer service. It is a great experience all in all."
good,overall a nice place to work very easy to work for only drawback is not very good pay
good,"Made me an expert on face to face customer service. It was all about satisfying the customer and that's the type of environment I love, whether it's on the phone or face to face."
good,"Everyday is different at this job, if youre looking for something that wint becomr a routine this is the job for you. The managers are friendly for the most part and so are the co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers, which happens quite often but onve they get what they want its fine. The most enjoyable part of the day is like i mentioned before everyday is different so its never boring."
good,"great beginning place to work, fast advancement, great experience in customer service"
good,Got me through college.  Customer service experience in may different departments.
good,I would come in and grab my vest and get to work immediately. I learned that it isn't as easy as it looked. I struggled to push 5 carts my first day. The next day I was pushing 10-15. Then I got the hang of it quickly. Pretty soon I was pushing 20-25 by the end of the week. Management was nice to me and they enjoyed having me there as an employee. Never got in trouble with them so that was a plus. My co-worker help teach me about life during my tenure. They were a bunch of different people on and off the work grounds. We worked SO well immediately. Production increased fast and breaks were longer because we got the work done early. The hardest part was the consistent grind everyday. The most enjoyable part was one day we all got a chance to see who could push the most carts at once. I pushed 58 of them. It was so fun though because we were cheering each other on motivating one another. I officially became a part of their group after that.
good,My friends and I did some volunteer work in conjunction with Walmart. They were helpful and lent us a spot where we can volunteer for the flood victims in Pakistan.
good,Walmart was a nice place to work. Co-workers were like family.
good,loved the people were friendly and outgoing learned many different jobs
good,Walmart was great because you were almost never bored since there was always customers. I learned hoe to comfortably use a cash register and take care of customer orders. There were always other workers around that were very willing to help. The hardest part was probably dealing with customers who get very angry.
good,"On a typical day at Walmart i would go and clock in, then go up front to see the manager on shift to see what register i was on. then start checking out customers that were done shopping. Then depending how long i was working i would get a break every two hours and an hour lunch four hours into my shift. then i would go back to running register. "
good,"I would clock in and find a customer service manager. I would than be told what register to go to. I would help out customers. In the down time, I would clean my area, restock the shelves around with more or new merchandise, organize my area, and once all that was done and still had no customers, I would help my co-workers or ask customers if they needed help with anything. I learned about my customers and what they like. Most of my managers were rude about helping out their employees. There were a few that are amazing people. The hardest thing about this job was getting help from most managers with having time off for personal reasons. I was hard to get them to understand things because money was their main worry. The most enjoyable thing was the wonderful co-workers and customers. They were mostly all smiles and laughs. I was a great experience."
good,Wrote up customers services oil changes tire change etc face pace working environment
good,A typical day included unloading trucks and pulling freight to sales floor.

The most enjoyable part of the was working with nice co-workers.
good,Great place just need another job that better fits my new schedule and more pay if possible.
good,i was a cashier i love meeting and speaking to new people i also enjoyed just seeing a smile on others face.
good,"Worked as a cashier."
good,Got to remodle Walmart. I worked with a great crew and leader. We worked hard and had some fun doing it.
good,"Meeting and helping people, I keep very busy, and I help other people get their work done when I can. Most of all, I liked how the management worked with me while I was attending school"
good,Best part of the job is having a customer come back to you repeatedly and most of my co-workers and management.
good,"Though I loved working at walmart being laid off encouraged me to look for higher work opportunities."
good,A typical day at work would be zoning areas of the store and assisting customers.
good,"Currently, a typical work day for me would be taking returns and dealing with any issues a customer has with products or service. I also help customers with money orders, Money Gram orders and Express Bill Pay with Money Gram. I have also worked in the pharmacy for five years and a typical day there would be making sure patients get all of their medications. I would also make sure the pharmacist talks to each patient about new medications or answer any questions they may have. I would also manage the cash registers and make sure all products or prescriptions are paid for. I have learned quite a bit over the seven years I have been with Walmart. I have learned a lot about different types of medications and insurance companies. I have also learned how to handle frustrated customers and making sure they leave happy. Most of the management I have worked with over the years have been very helpful in teaching me everything I needed to learn. Most have been very supportive in my decision making to help others as well. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting all different types of people and personalities. I enjoy working with the public and love to help others."
good,I scanned & bagged items. I learned that dairy products have to get thrown away after being left out for more than 30 minutes. My co-workers kept me entertained at work. Hardest part of work was getting out of work at mid-night. The most enjoyable part of my job was having a discount.
good,hours were steady and i worked mornings which i loved to do.paychecks were decent and were always given to me on time
good,"Fue mi primer empleo y agradezco la oportunidad pero el sueldo no era bueno, si requeria algun permiso, habia muchas escusas de parte de los jefes y no les importaba mucho tu estabilidad mental o sfamiliar solamente les preocupa lo que les dabas a ellos y requerian siempre tu tiempo en dias festivos"
good,Printing and cashing winning tickets was nice. The customers were great especially when you were exchanging their ticket for cash.
good,If you are looking for a job that has you working 100% of the time and with no down time at all this is a great place for this. There is some co-worker that are friendly but majority don't even want to  have conversation with you.
good,I enjoyed my time there met a lot of good people and was able to enlighten some people day. good staff and friendly environment to make it easier to work with?
good,"Prosessed two year contracts daily for customers, also checked the phone to see if they  were working properley. inventoryed productes daily . answered questions cutomers had and fixed problems with phones."
good,This would be a great first job for anyone trying to get the hang of employment for the first time.
good,Always busy but fast-paced and keeps you on your toes.Teaches you to think quickly and act.Management wasn't always friendly but neither were the customers. Gotta have thick skin and a great personality!s
good,Happy to say i worked for this company liked the work fast-paced
good,Pretty good place to work. Everyone was nice and easy to get along with and work with.
good,Walmart has a very good foundation for an entry level career however upon advancing in the chain the level of management appears to be chaotic at best. However they still manage to perform daily functions. The people are wonderful to work with and are friendly. however the amount of hours worked and the low amount of compensation is what drags everyone down and that part of the environment is what slowly spreads to everyone.
good,Working at Walmart was fun!! I enjoyed my co-workers and management team.
good,"fun overall, good co-worker, good managers"
good,"One word I would use to describe a typical day working for Walmart would be average. Aside from the occasional customer that would brighten my day, there wasn't too much to smile about! It was nearly impossible to communicate with management, let alone get them to listen to you. I would work at Walmart again as a last resort."
good,"a typical day at work; i clock in and meet at the dressing room to see where i am (men's, women's, infant etc.), i go to my station and i work with the shelves i fold and refold clothes and then move on to hangers i place sizes from small to large take lunch then i will go around with a shopping cart to collect misplaced items and placed them in the right area and went back to the shelves and refold the clothes."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was greeting customers and informing them on new deals we were offering as well as giving them details about our merchandise. "

good,The most enjoyable part of the job was visiting with the customers and fellow employees.
good,"I don`t have any experience but im a fast learner, my work experience is a cashier at Walmart. I really learned a lot working at Walmart i love talking with the customers and helping them and answering there questions i feel good helping."
good,"easy going job nad easy to work with coworkers. the hardest part of the job was cleaning the pouring lines , but it always smelled good cause of the candles."
good,"when  item came on the line I was to put them on the shelves in the right order and the most I learned was how to work together as a team, and the managers was very easy to get alone with, the co-worker became my friends and was willing to land a hand when I needed help and I was happy to come to work every day."
good,"In my typical work day I review stories (requirements), write test cases, decide to implement the test cases in JMeter or Selenium or even just run manually, select data or create them to run the tests and do daily meeting since I work in a agile project."

While the pay and benefits could have been better, it was an excellent place to gain valuable experience. I enjoyed working with great people and made lasting friendships while working there. However, over time, the communication between managment started to take a downward turn to the point where associates were being blamed by one manager for not doing a task because they had to work on another task that a different manager had given them. This unfortunatly has become fairly normal at this store and a number of associates have left for this same reason, including myself"

good,"As a cashier and electronics sales associate at Walmart, you never knew what to expect or who you were going to meet. Roles changed daily as required by management which may have seemed undecisive in how they wanted things in the store yet remained organized in getting upper management requests done on time. I learned that I have a lot of patience and regardless of how people may treat me, I do my best to remain professional and give each customer a great experience every time.

Management was difficult to work with because many of them don't constantly interact face to face with customers and were quick to over rule decisions associates made.

I learned you have to do a lot of research, on your own, in order to get your job accomplished. I feel the store I work in doesn't have a support system. If you go to your manager for help, they should be able to give you advice or lead you in the right direction. At the store I work in, they don't care!!

good,I liked when I would see the same people and we started building relationships.  I also built a close relationship with the other cashiers and CSM's I worked with.  I wish there were more opportunity for advancement.
good,"Get all the work done that I possibly could."
good,Not a bad company just don't pay that great and difficult to get a full-time position
good,I learned a lot a lot about how to deal with various customer in this role.
good,I hate to have down time at work even though I can find something to do but for me the busier I am the better and this job kept me busy. The benefits were great even though you have to almost fist fight with management to get them lol.
good,"I loved working for Walmart, it was a fun job, filled with nothing but cutting boxes and putting items on the shelves! The hardest part was having to reorganize an entire shelf so the overstock items I had would fit. My co-workers where really neat people, most of them where around my age so we had as much fun as one could have being an overnight stocker. The best part of the job was finding out which department you would be placed in for the night. Sometimes I had 2-3 difference departments, which made my night go by much faster than usual. I had quite a few managers, and they where all fun to work with, some where strict, while others where laid back."
good,"stock product, check for damaged and out of date product, check in truck, and maintain sales floor"
good,"A great place to work to gain experience in the catering industry."
good,"A retail environment."
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in heading up to the register and open the lane up to help customers. The one thing I learned at this job is it don't matter how rude the customer can be it can always be turned around by a simple smile, and ask them how their day was going. My co-workers were amazing there always put a smile on my face. They were like family to me. There wasn't a hard part about this job. It was a fun filled day when I would walk through the front doors."
good,"I enjoyed Walmart because I was always busy, but that was also a downfall. They would let my work time go over what I was supposed to and at the time I was underage."
good,"After only having experience behind a desk answering phone, enjoyed working face to face with customers. No matter how good or bad my day is, I still look at the situation as a whole as learning."
good,It was a decent place to work until the end of my employment. Nice people and coworkers. has 401k and profit sharing plus insurance which was nice.
good,Fue una buena experiencia lastima que fue por temporadas pero se aprende y te suman a sus ideas siempre con respeto y buen trato tanto de compañeros como de superiores.
good,Did get short staffed and manager did not push the workers as much as they should have so people came in late and shifts got shorted.
good,"Customers"
good,I would check out over 100 customer's per day. I learned that not just being a cashier you have to make sure your money is correct and that nobody leaves there items behind but you also have help keep the registers cleaned and go out in the store if your slow to help stock the shelf's. The management team and my co-workers were great. I loved working for them and with loved working with my co-workers. The hardest part about the job was making sure that every dollar that you touched was accounted for so that your register wasn't messed up at the end of the night. I enjoyed working with the public and getting to do many different things as a cashier.
good,"Go directly to work station; handle cash, pack merchandise, greet customer before and after transaction; say thank you; given work experience; management no problem, co-workers no problem."
good,The customers were always friendly and always made my night a little more entertaining!
good,my day at work was like this did was took cahs and stock and clean.
good,"Get to work, clock in, clean jewelry counter at the beginning and end of my shift. Also, I unpacked and put up freight that came in, ordered jewelry and helped customers."
good,I loved my customers. I worked the 3rd shift but our store was not a super center so I did not get to work with the customers often. I had fun at this job and had great co workers. My boss was awsome as well.
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers and some managers and feel they worked with me on any scheduling issues I may have had.  Dealing with angry or upset customers can be somewhat challenging.
good,Walmart is exciting and its employees get a chance to meet many individuals daily.
good,A typical day would be coming in stocking milk and eggs and zoning things. To do your best at your job even if you don't really think you're playing a big part. Management was pretty relaxed but could be strict when needed and didn't play around. Some co-workers were there to get their work done and leave others enjoyed their job and had a good time and made the most out of being there. The hardest part of my job was stocking yogurt because its so tedious. I enjoyed the people that I helped the most I liked working with people.
good,"Working at Walmart wasn't rewarding, it felt like what it was, just a job. I would clock in, do as I was told; and then some, then clock off. Same thing day in and day out. Managers smoked all the time, the wait for a CSM would be 10 minutes or more, and whenever someone went above and beyond, they weren't rewarded for their efforts. I wasn't said to leave the company, just the other hardworking cashiers."
good,I reinforced my skills interacting with customers. The company offered a flexible schedule however from week to week the hours given were unreliable and their is the constant worry of hours/pay being cut for the week.
good,"I work 8 years at Walmart, i learned how to handle problems at customer service. I started as a cashier where i learned how to handle money, checks and money services. I enjoyed getting along with my co-workers they help me a lot, very good people."
good,"Every day was a different challenge.  Fast paced retail.  Although my primary job was accounting and report analysis, on occasion I also stocked shelves, pushed carts, helped customers or whatever was needed to  keep our customers happy.  The best part of my job was being chosen from hundreds to train new employees in Germany offices.  Also traveled throughout Michigan during office procedure audits and training."
good,I enjoyed working there with my coworkers as well as the customer interaction.  However I wished there was a little more time to spend with the customer.
good,"It was a great job to have while in high school prior to college, they worked with my school schedule and I gained customer service experience also. I scanned items, processed payments and gaved the customer their exact change with 100% accuracy."
good,was not happy with managers and how they treated there employies
good,"This job is not difficult. I enjoy meeting new people, but it lacks that 'something special' feeling that most people look for in a job or career."
good,Walmart is a great place to work. You always work very hard and go home tired. The pay is great and so is the insurance. Everyone is extremely nice and friendly and is always willing to help out.
good,"service customers, cut deli meat,make orders,cook hot foods,put up frieght"
good,walmart was a good work place i interacted with diffrent people every other day and the work was real reasonable
good,"Good job, Good hours. Communication could be better. Co workers are great. Job can be stressful."
good,Walmart was an easy job that becomes harder as you work there. Management was always on their jobs and made me feel welcome. I liked that I could meet new people every day
good,"customer service, customer care, stocking, unloading, handle money."
good,"Hard worker when there are certain people at work, the hardest part I would say is when a customer ask you where something is at an you don't know so you have to walk around the store and help them find it, kind of fun at the same time and you learn more that way."
good,Enjoyed working here and learned a lot retail side. Unloade trucks and stocked shelves. odd work hours from 4pm to 1am but I enjoyed it
good,On a daily basis I supervise about 15 cashiers. I would have to say with hard work and dedication to the job their is no hard part.  One has to be willing to learn and practice good leadership skills.
good,"It was my first job, I loved every second of it. Finally had  money in my hand and I couldn't be happier."
good,The people taught you everything you needed to know about each department even if it wasn't your department.  Plenty of room to advance.  They wanted me to go from a cashier to a truck loader and unloader.
good,"The night starts by unloading trucks, and pulling freight to designated areas for stocking. Logging and record receipt of delivery. Assign tasks to employees. Assist with customer service when needed. Work freight from on floor and from backroom."
good,Wal-mart was a very busy but nice place to work. Most days consisted of high amounts of team work. Lots of fun working with customers!
good,"Prepared food & drinks"
good,I clock into work find out what cash I am on I ring through merchandise process debit and credit card transactions. I really enjoy working there meeting people.
good,"Processed returns and handled customer complaints. In Money Center, assisted customers with bill payments and cashed payroll checks. As a Customer Service Manager I monitored cashier performance, handled questions and concerns from both customers and employees, balanced the cash flow in our CSM podium, I was also the back up in the Accounting office.  My job duties were to count and balance each register , created loan bags for registers, count balance encode payroll checks and WIC, created deposits to be sent to the bank, ordered change for the following day, and other duties as assigned."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for besides the slight problems with management. My co-workers were a big help in my success there, by helping me with projects and just helping the day go by without any problems. Management was the biggest problem there because some managers thought that they could just make you stop doing one project and make you do a personal project for them. Another problem was communication, none of the managers knew how to communicate well with the associates."
good,"A typical day included greeting customers, processing customer grocery/household products for purchase. I enjoyed the different personalities that I crossed."
good,learnd a lot at this job. I wouldnt mind working here a again.
good,Liked having the insurance and made lots of friends. Casual workplace
good,It was an okay place to work. It paid the bills for the time being
good,"I have the ability to obtain a position with a growing company that utilizes my education, exceptional communication and customer service skills and perform various inter-office duties within a timely, courteous and professional manner."
good,A typical day at work is punching in. Getting started on my work. Taking my lunch. Then going back to work. Last punching out to go home. I love to learn new things at every job that I'm at. My managers were very nice and understanding. My co-workers like when I come in because they know I get the job done. The hardest part of my job is being unable to help somebody that need help. The most enjoyable part of my job is listening and being able to help peole.
good,"From the time we clock in, the work starts with a plan to execute the work load. From there we move to secure equipment needed to secure the days assignment. We are required to work until the days work load is finished. As an employee with experience, I was certified with all equipment licenses, which made my job a bit easier to perform. Very independent style workplace, though from time to time we do work closely with co-workers. Extremely diverse place of employment with various positions to occupy. There can be a strenuous amount of hours to work, hence this job can take up quite a bit of ones down time. I made very meaningful relationships with, co-workers as well as managers and supervisors that I know am able to use as references."
good,C'est un endroit chaleureux ou l'entraide est très forte. C'est plaisant d'aider les employés et les clients à trouver ce qu'ils recherchent.
good,"the staff is fun to work with, and its a fast pace job with good customer flow to keep you busy"
good,"The job is enjoyable and there is variety everyday due to the customer base.  "
good,this place was good. It was not hard to do. The only thing that care about is good customer service. The bad is they are always cutting hours
good,"best place to shop,. has everything.nice place to work. friendly coworkers, friendly and fair managers."
good,"Good company to work for, Treat employees fair and try to accomadate schedules."
good,wonderful job and a great learning experience!! everyone knows that walmart is a good place no matter what and you work with all types of people which is great because you meet new people all the time
good,Pretty good company they work with you and they work around your schedule. A good open door policy to talk to.
good,"Customer service, switch board operator, customer service. organizing sales floor, setting modulars, employee scheduling and price changes, out reports, ordering, inventory and cashiering.  This position involved numerous tasks that must be completed on a daily basis in a proficient manner."
good,I enjoy working with the public and I like customers to leave with a smile.
good,"Each day starts with a morning meeting with the management team. At this meeting we cover where the store operational numbers and where the store is with sales. Then we prioritize the work for the day and what needs to be done first and when everything needs to be done by. After this I meet with my supervisors and give them the direction for the day. The remainder of the day is spent handling daily operates and customers. I also will follow-up with the direction given out in the beginning of the day. I also during the day make time to review other operational areas I am in charge of. Later afternoon is spent handling human resource responsibilities such as hiring, evaluations, coaching, and touching base with associates. The is typically wrapped up with management team again covering what was done and will be tomorrow priorities. "
good,"Assisting customers at the customer service desk.  I have learned to handle money, credit card, remaining calm when the customer is upset.  Co-workers and management are sometimes are to deal with; because its all about satisfying the customer.  Dealing with all the attitudes.  Knowing that I have 100% satisfied the customers"
good,"My day would typically start with the relieving of employees for break/end of shift. I would then check the parking lot for filled ""cart corrals"" and take them to the loading area on either side of the building."
good,"A typical day is usually busy, with many cars and keeps you busy."
good,"Over 250 cash or credit transactions performed daily, Unloaded Freight Trucks, stocked and Maintain a clean and safe sales floor."
good,"A typical day at work was busy. I learned that retail can be one of the hardest task but I enjoyed it for the most part. Management was all over the place and never around when you needed them, but there were a few helpful managers. My coworkers were the best, but some were very unprofessional and would be high or drunk at work making it hard for the rest of the team. The hardest part of the job was working on a test and without being able to finish being pulled to another task. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the customers I love customer service."
good,"If you enjoy retail you would like it here. Our store gave out donuts every payday, plus you get a 10% discount on most items in the store."
good,"A typical day at Walmart was stressful and hectic.Walmart Pharmacy in Hixson is a fact paced place to work. That thought me to multi-task very well there was never any time to stand still and focus only on one task at a time, The hardest part of the job is learning to deal with the fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting customers and becoming friends with them."
good,Enjoyed being in control of my department and making sure that the customers get what they need as well as keeping my department clean and full of product.
good,it was a good learning experience working with walmart company I gained a lot of skills now im ready to show other jobs I can do same at their company
good,"I ran a register, helped customers, kept my area clean & organized."
good,"I liked being in Quality Assurance, verifying the shipments coming in and being sent out of the warehouse."
good,Wal-Mart was a ok place to be employed the only problem I had is dat we could get overtime
good,"Working here was fun but also very demanding, depending on what location you were assigned to, and what part of the country."
good,I loved working here only because of the environment with other co-workers who would help to train you in the things you didnt know. I also loved how it was busy which made the day go by faster.
good,working at walmart was fun i would have stayed but working 3rd shift and going to school wasnt working for me..and other shifts didnt have the available hours..i would love to work for walmart again..
good,"Input prescriptions; billing; customer service; a lot of phone calls to clients, doctors, insurance companies, drug manufacturers; inventory; shipping and receiving;"
good,There are many different shifts that you could work depending on the type of person you are and what you would prefer. I have learned many more things about retail and customer service that I didn't know before I started. Just like any job there are coworkers that you will get along with and there are ones that you won't and this is a place to work to develop the skills of being able to handle customers coworkers and any problems that you could imagine. I made great friends and learned a lot of things to improve myself as a person.
good,Most days would be pretty busy. I learned how to unload the trucks and stack the pallets for the different departments. I also learned where each department was and where the items were located in each department. Management and co-workers were pretty nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting of certain items. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the back with the freight crew.
good,I start the day unloading boxed freight off a truck on to assigned pallets. In which goes to an assigned dept. then bin any remaining freight.
good,Walmart made me ready for the job market. i learned many important things. Customer service which always comes first an how to work in a team.
good,Like every job you will face good days in bed but overall the people you work with are friendly.
good,"AS typical day consists of cutting lunch meat and cheese. I help provide customer service, stock and receive deli items, maintain the department's appearance and cleanliness, following company policies and procedures as well as local and federal laws regarding food safety, and using and clean powered equipment including a meat and cheese slicer, deep fryer and rotisserie oven. I learned how to work as a team and to not be afraid to speak up and ask for help. My co-workers are easy to work with and i have no problems. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers."
good,"Fast-paced very hands on management"
good,"Experiência boa de trabalhar na empresa, com bons benefícios e oportunidades de crescimento.  Como na empresa entra e sai funcionários cultivei varias amizades e aprendizagem pois cada um te ensina um pouquinho do que sabe. "
good,The pay and hours are decent but the work can be difficult and no matter how much work is to be done you are expected to have all of it done by the end of your shift. Overtime is just about non existent and you are expected to cut any time over your scheduled hours
good,unloaded boxes from a truck onto pallets. used pallet jacks to take inventoru to floor
good,A typical day at work consists of interacting with lots of different personalities. I learned that each customer has to handled differently in order to aquire sales. Management is very helpful as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the is being able to handle the different personalities of customers. Some customers may have explosive attitudes at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment. Interacting and making sales is very enjoyable for me.
good,"Unloading merchandise in assigned areas daily, organize and management of products in warehouse, use of forklift, pallet jack, and clamp machine to move products to assigned areas, apply labels to correct location on freights/pallets/merchandise, manage freight deliveries, organization of work area, maintaining safe work area to assigned area, and inventory control, provide basic maintenance to receiving equipment (e.g., cleaning, changing labels and ribbons), and effective communication between manager and supervisor, knowledge of Citrix software."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of working with mostly the front-end associates. Would have to deliver money to associates who were running low on money in their cash registers. Would also have to manage the front end to ensure that customers are getting through the cash registers in a timely manner, opening other cash registers when needed, and therefore calling up associates from other areas of the store to help. That could be a challenge. I would come in contact with associates who did not want to help up front because they would say it was not their job and therefore had to tell them that it is part of their job. In a non-union environment everything is your job. I would also have to troubleshoot computer, customer, and associate problems. Mostly with successful outcomes. I've learned in this business that you cannot please everyone no matter how respectful you are of others opinions and try to empathize with them. Writing and giving associate evaluations was also part of my job. It was enjoyable as well as difficult because I worked with friends as well and was many of their supervisor. Writing an evaluation on their job performance is tough. Some of them did not work to their full potential and I had to let them know that they needed to improve. "
good,A very busy place to work.  Co-workers were nice but the management wasn't all that great.  Not necessarily the assistant managers or department managers but those higher were very rude and lazy.  There were plenty of times you would walk past their office and see someone with their feet up or sleeping on the job.  If there is an overly busy day the assistant managers are more than willing to jump in and help out but the co's are to good for that.
good,I was responsible for maintaining a balanced cash drawer and excellent customer service.
good,Non-stop business from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave. They have decent benefits available to management and associates.Always learning new and exciting ideas from a management perspective.
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar tinha seus pontos negativos mas todas empresa tem.Aprendi muito trabalhando no Wall Mart foi uma experiência muito boa que me fez crescer muito profissionalmente tinha uma ótima liderança,colegas agradáveis de dividir tarefas.A unica coisa que não estava mais gostando era do meu turno que era à noite.Gostava muito de estar com os meus colegas dividindo nossas experiências e aprendendo uns com os outros era muito gratificante."
good,great pay and learned how to provide customer service in a friendly environment
good,Best job I ever had. Even though managers talk to you any kind of way.
good,always busy helping costumers and stocking freight. Managers changed store about every 2 years so u were able to see different managing styles. My co-workers were always easy to work with. I would say the hardest part of the job was when a delivery didn't arrive on time and we had a very short time to get the freight stocked before store opened in a.m. the most enjoyable part was getting to help costumers on a regular basis
good,"Very large, national general retailer of home goods, food, produce, electronics, hardware, etc."
good,"Walmart gave me great opportunities to further myself in the retail job field. It gave me the success in other positions that I know I can take with me to other careers. Management was very helpful to me, they were on the same page which in turn made us as employees understand what needed to be done without confusion."
good,"Work starts off by stocking merchandise and assisting customers with phone needs or questions about products. Also checking the customer out in a timely manner. I learn to be more patient at work and more understanding of people and their perspective on things. Management helps keep things going as far as me and my associates work ethic. They keep us busy by sending us to other departments to organize or help out. The hardest part of the job would be working on holidays. Its extremely busy but staying calm and organized, also working as a team, help make everything easier. The most enjoyable part by far is getting compliments by customers letting me know how great of help I was to them."
good,Working for this company was mentally and physically challenging. I learned how to follow sanitation and safety regulations. I also learned the values of the company and its customers. The hardest part of the job was multi tasking and keeping up during the lunch/dinner rushes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the face to face communication with customers and co-workers.
good,"I learned a lot more sales skills while working there, lifting heavy objects, had some amazing co-workers and managers, a typical day was restocking and helping customers with their purchases."
good,"Always had fun, worked hard to get our jobs done, loved our customers.  cashed checks, money transfers, cash counts, document money transfers, money orders, load money order machines, answered phone lines, problem solved, love other co-works always work together as a team, management was always there to help us in difficult things and with difficult customers."
good,"Maintained department, making sure was fully stocked and cleaned. Helped customers when needed. Worked in and was trained in several departments. Ran register when needed. Helped train cashiers"
good,"The most enjoyable part was communicating with customers, a typical day at work was basically water plants stock shelves and help customers."
good,I loved working at Wal-Mart it was a fun job. The other employees and managers were great.
good,We usually worked short so me and other people had to pick up the slack.
good,"i liked the work i had to do but the management team treated people like trash and then didnt even care about some stuff that sbould have been cared about, They would only worry about certain people. They didnt care that there were certain people breaking rules"
good,"All associates make you feel at home. "
good,I have enjoyed working for Walmart Disturbution for the past 8 years but have felt lately that a change is in order for me to help grow my career in the work force.
good,Must be Fast And able to work under stressfull situations as long as you work together as a team anything is do-able
good,"A typical day at work was taking care of customers meat needs.  I learned different skills in different departments. Co-workers all worked together. The hardest part of the job was when a customer is dissatisfied, the most enjoyable part is when they leave happy and remember you the next time they come in."
good,Employees get a chance to interact with different types of people which can enhance personal growth.
good,"Nice job usually was lack of staff, enjoyed cooking for the food court. I learned many different cooking procedures and process along with new technologies."
good,"Although I had worked pharmacy previously this was a different experience. I was on the set up team for a brand new location, so most of my time was spent stocking. I was introduced to a different script program as well as new management styles."
good,"Very Productive workplace."
good,"you will always have something to do, very busy great place to work at."
good,time always went quickly i learned how to work well with registers quickly
good,You can transfer to any area of the store with no problem.. job advancement is all with favoritism and whos your best friend. Pay raises were decent. Hour breaks amazing!
good,Great as a second job however would not recommend for advancement unless willing to wait quite sometime.
good,I learned how to relate to people and how to give them great customer service.  My math skills greatly increased.   I was afforded the opportunity to oversee many transactions with money.
good,i liked to work with customers. i learned alot that i didn't do before. management were okey to work with and some  were bad. i got along with everyone but one that was very mean etc.
good,review your sales for prior day; work your freight asap;maintain paperwork. when your assoicates get to work give them there task for the day.communicate with your vendors.kept open communication with assitant manager over my area did walks on my areas.The hardest part of the job was changing modulars for my area.The best thing about my job was i loved what i did and enjoyed my job.
good,"walmart was a great place to work. honestly if i didnt get pregnant i would have stayed. i love having a job and i had no problems working for them what so ever. i wish they would hire me back! "
good,"My typical work day is going into work and going straight to work.  First thing I would start, is bagging and labelng the baked goods already baked.  After i did that, i would zone them on the salesfloors, and also organize anything on the floor that was not zoned. My managers we're very strict and consistant on zoning the sales floor every twenty minutes.  After I did all of that, I would typically layout the frozen bread for the next work day on racks.  Everyday it would usually be something different that I would have to do. For example, one day I would do the ""organics,"" the next day i would be organizing the cooler or freezer.  Which was the hardest part of my job.  Managers would pull pallets of frozen goods which I would have to unload and stock in the freezer.  But the most enjoyable part of my day that I looked foward to was when my work was all done, I could go decorate cupcakes, and cakes with my co-workers in the bakery."
good,"professional attitudes/ customer service oriented."
good,It was a very fun and fast pace environment. You were always busy and not easily bored. the co-workers and managers was very nice and respectful to each other
good,I was a cashier in the money center and  a regular cashier I cashed checks front lined my area and ring up customers
good,There was always lots to do and no time to waste. I liked the  fast pace.
good,"I enjoy working at walmart, the staff is friendly & easy to get along with, wages are reasonable. I work night shift & a typical shift includes setting up displays & stocking shelves, the hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Wal-Mart and hope that I can come back as permanent employee.
good,"Managers were not personable, they were very rude. Other co-workers were very nice and willing to help if you needed any."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with as well as the customers. Management was great as well
good,"A night at Wal-Mart is some what an unexpected one. You never really know what will happen. Sometimes it's easy, other times, it's more work than you can handle in 8 hours. Management was great. The managers I worked with on overnights were always understanding and nice. The co-workers welcomed me with open arms. They were helpful. The hardest part of the job was the climbing of ladders, only because of heights. The most enjoyable part was always having something to do. That job kept me busy."
good,"A typical day at work would sometimes be very hectic especially during the holidays. Sometimes there would be very rude customers."
good,"First real job where you really got in trouble for being late and not smiling at the customers. I learned a lot about customer awareness, how to keep your customer happy. Effective listening. I learned all of those things here. "
good,"My main duties as a cashier are to scan merchandise that the customer is purchasing.  I also work customer service.  I process merchandise that is damaged or not needed by return or exchange. In the money center, I cash payroll checks, process MoneyGram transactions, and assist customers with other questions.  I enjoy working as a team with my co-workers.  I also enjoy the one on one customer interaction I experience."
good,"I was an inventory control specialist- stocked shelves, rotated stock, counted  inventory, controlled shrink, organized back room unloaded trucks"
good,Always busy. Turnover rate is very high because they hire anyone.
good,"When I first arrive at work I use a Telxon to count, verify and print labels that are needed. I learn something new just about everyday!, from customers and coworkers alike. My department manager is great! At Wal-Mart we are a ""Family"", everyone helps everyone."
good,I somewhat enjoyed working here mainly because of the people i worked with. There no opportunity of me advancing and only advanced certain individuals.
good,"everyone helped everyone, learned many new things on the job"
good,Never had a chance to get bored while working here because there was always something to do. I learned how to become a cashier in someplace other than a fast food restaurant and enjoyed it a lot more because I met a lot more people and had a lot more to do. I was only there a couple of months and don't really remember what management or my co-workers were like. The hardest part of the job at first was when we had to go to another store to train to use the ebt cards and wic vouchers. The most enjoyable part of the job was without a doubt the different people I got to see and help everyday.
good,"As a deli associate I would cook food, serve, and clean the area. I also worked slicers, and rotisseries. Builds patience  "
good,A typical day would be sorting and picking items to go out on the shelves. My management and coworkers were pleasant to be around and work with. The hardest part of the job was staning on my feet for 9 hours a day but it was worth it. The most enjoyable part was the breaks I got every two hours.
good,walmart was great. offered decent benefits and good hours. holiday seasons are the worse
good,Walmart was a great place to work and had wonderful employees. 
good,"I have really enjoyed my time at Walmart as I have done many different jobs there, I have learned many things and grown."
good,"Meeting different people "
good,"Walmart was a good place to work in the fact that they did pay reasonably, but the management was terrible. Management did not appreciate or respect their employees."
good,"Company is very good to work for if you have no family,i tended to spend more time working 80 hours when i was required 40, it was very hard with three children at home.  Incentives were good and I enjoyed the work."

good,Walmart is a big company with many job opportunities. Customer service can be a very stressful job but the ability to help people is rewarding. Having a Good group of people standing behind you is invaluable.
good,"Csm's put you on a register and you interact with customers, finish transactions, and answer the question they have. You bag there items with items that are similar. Management isn't the best part about Walmart. Sometime they make you feel like they don't want you to succeed."
good,"the only thing good about this job was the co workers. pay sucked for the amount of work you had to do, management sucked too."
good,always busy so there was never a dull moment. customers varied from friendly to not friendly. most people were just wanting to get in and out no time for hit chat
good,"I was mostly a cashier at this company, and I enjoyed my days there. I could talk with customers while doing my job, and still could forge relationahips with my co-workers and bosses in this busy environment.

good,The Hardest Part Of The Job Would Have To Be The Fact That I Cant Get Overtime. The Management Isn't the Best. I've Learned  That I Enjoy The Hard Work It Keeps Me Busy And On Task. The Overall Benefits That you'd Receive For Full-Time Employment Are Awesome.
good,"I was a Unloader/Stocker , I was in charge of unloading all trucks in a timely manner.  It was a good job if you enjoy physical work.  We had 4 assistant managers so communication from them to employees wasn't very clear. I would say the hardest part of the job was unclear directions given from management.   "
good,From working at Walmart  I learned that planning your day with team members can really help the day go pass smooth. I had a great supervisor that didn't mind lending a hand when needed. MY co-workers where excellent every task was always a team effort. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks that came in but was also one of the best because of the team that I worked with.
good,Most of the staff are friendly. It's a typical work environment. Just have to make the best of every situation. They were good about getting us on our breaks in time. If not the register logged you out after 5 continuous hours anyway.
good,"Wal-Mart has it's moments like any other jobs, they really should pay their workers a little more for what they do. I have learned a lot about working at Wal-Mart such as inventory and other things that come along with the job. "
good,"My hours there were call over the place but during the day my typical shift was normal. I had plenty of customers and was kept busy. And when I didn't have customers, I got to re-stock the shelves around my register to keep me busy. Then as it got later into my shift it became more busy. (At night they closed more registers and only left 2 open) So everything was a lot more fast paced but it made the time go by quickly. I loved all my co-workers, everyone there was very pleasant to work with. I can't say there was anything hard about my job other than dealing with an unhappy customer. the most enjoyable part of this was when we were packed and I always had something to do with my time. "
good,"Working for a company like Wal-Mart is not as bad as some would have you think. It is not perfect by any means no job is, but I really did enjoy working there for the most part. I had the chance to learn many new things, and while there were times that my training in so many different areas of the store did interfere with my day to day job I loved that I was able to do so many different things.

The part I enjoyed most was meeting and talking to the customers, letting them know that I cared they received the best possible care."
good,"I worked for this company for 5 years and I almost never had a problem, at least no real issue. Management was great, always there when you need them and the employees became like family"
good,I met a lot of new people which I enjoyed while working for wal-mart. A typical day depending on your shift is coming in and checking your daily tasks before starting any assignments.

good,"For the most part Walmart is a good place to work. There is a very unique since of being part of a ""Walmart Family"" I worked in several different positions and throughout the store so I really enjoyed the typical day of being all over the place ""too much work not enough hours in the day"", so to speak, is what I like! There does tend to be a ""click"", which can be to ones demise if you are not part of it because moving up into positions isn't necessarily based on skill or being a great worker, it's who you know. Most all of the Assistant Managers; Tim, Alena, Travis, Tony, Trish, and Rick  are GREAT! I suppose the most difficult thing working there is the ever changing and rotating of Managers to different Departments each 6 months, because it seems that you just get used to the particular way a certain Manager wants his/her department to run and then here comes the 6 month change,but in todays world we have to embrace change.  "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, it was a temporary setup job so I was only there for around 2 months. I learned how to work together as a team with the other members of my group.  The hardest part of the job was working outside in the storage containers when moving equipment in or out of the store.

I retrieve all the materials I think I would need to complete my first task such as carts, pallets, etc. I work to achieve my assigned goal. During my shift I also assist any customers with any guidance needed or inquiries they may have. I learned how to be a more effective team player and also that different people require different approaches to fit their personality as far as motivation, encouragement and work habits. Management did the best they could with the resources available. Wal-Mart was a big store with many employees and limited managers. My co-workers and I got along greatly; I am a very energetic person and my enthusiasm is contagious. The hardest part of the job was managing personalities and remembering who needed what and at what time. The most enjoyable part of the job was when tasks were accomplished individually and collectively."
good,Wonderful job. Fun coworkers and great customers. Decent pay and hours. 
good,"My co-workers are some of the best people with which I have worked. We all work together as a team."

Co-workers become a part of your ""work family"" and we all would help each and pitch in where needed. Not being able to get done with all task during a shift when last minute high priority task come at you. Knowing you put in a long day of work.

good,"Varied tasks, busy days made the time go by fast.  Always new tasks to learn and do, which was interesting.  LOVE the customers"
good,I can do everything in walmart. management has their nose to the grindstone to make corporate happy. Coworkers are nice and we did group activities away from work. I felt the managers didn't care about the wellbeing of their workers.
good,"When you have the opportunity to manage around 400 employees and at the same time work with customers, you must be able to multi-task.  The opportunities to be challenged and challenge your associates was educational and made me a better Manager."

good,"If you want a job where you can see just about every kind of person that walks the each, this is the right place. The work is easy and they do offer evaluations a few times a year, which can get you a 15 cent raise. The longer you work there the more you can make. But it is full of crazy customers always demanding to speak to a manage because you follow polices they think are wrong."
good,A typical day could range from running the registers to working on the floor or even in the back. The environment is usually fast paced with a lot of independent work. Must be a self starter.
good,"My duties were to do refunds on items that customers return to the store. I also was over the bill pay. Customers will come to customer service to pay their bills, car note, car insurance, credit card bill, and etc. "
good,"Walmart is the icon of large corporate jobs.  It is a business that is out to make money, not to share it or give it away, and everything that the company does is geared toward that purpose.  There are, truly, good employment opportunities within the company if you are willing to make the personal sacrifices that the company demands of all it's employees.  You must be ready and willing to work when they want you to work, you must rarely need time off, you must be willing to work as hard as it takes to get the job done in the time provided though your hourly compensation will not reflect the amount of work that you do.  That is corporate retail life.  I was not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to rekindle my career in retail.  "
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart would be to nice to customers and give them their every need. I learned at Wal-Mart how to communicate with our supervisors and managers and let them know whats going on and they will work with us.

"
good,"A lot of people seem to give Walmart a hard time but I found it to be a good place to work. Most of my co-workers were good honest people. There were a few that weren't, but in a company this size it is unavoidable. The management that was in place was doing a terrible job of running the store and providing for associates but the corporate office recognized this and they were replaced with new management who have started to turn things back around. "
good,"My typical work day consists of many different things. I'm always around people, including customers and employees. I have to be the best I can be always.

I have stocked shelves, inventory control, support manager, and unloaded trucks, Assistant managed in three stores, many times by myself.  There were clean-up crews, and new set-ups I was in charge of.  I've done accounting, customer service, scheduling and other HR duties.

Training, problem solving, planning, organizing was the most rewarding job skills for me. "
good,"Com relação à colegas, não tenho do que me queixar, tive suporte na empresa quando precisei. Em um dia típico, aconteceria muitos desafios, por exemplo: clientes exigentes, funcionários sem engajamento, muitas funções para o mesmo cargo, mas ainda sim existiam dias agradáveis, porque além de colegas, tinha amigos.

I turn my light and and start as soon as I possible can to get customers in and out of the store as fast as they like too. I greet customers asking how their day has been and if theyve found everything okay. Management is great there. Theyre fast with answering questions and there to help you. The hardest part about my job is when you have a line and you are trying to go as fast as you can and some times you cant control how fast your customers move but the next few customers might blame it on you.

good,Cooperative and understanding with family life and schedule changes when needed. Overall a pretty good company to work for.
good,It was a very good Vision when I was first hired but did'nt know about the company failure.
good,"I left because the pay was too low and I had to carry heavy detergent bottles, fabric softener bottles, pop bottles etc.  Also the store was way too busy and usually long line-ups."
good,"My communication skills improved significantly working here. I used to be very shy and I can safely say I'm a people person. I asked about any concerns customers had and did what I could do to assist. At times, I was pulled away from my register to help out with organizing other departments. My management team was amazing! They were very friendly and made working there a great experience. The hardest part of the job was being 8 months pregnant when I was hired, but management was understanding about that, especially when I had gone into premature labor while at work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with other people on a daily basis."
good,"It was good, with lots of things to do but working overnight hours just wasn't for me anymore."
good,Walmart let me work there during my breaks in college and kept me on as an employee even though I was at college and only worked summers.  They were very flexible with my schedule as well.  I wouldn't say its great for a long term career.
good,"Customer service skills a plus in any position. I was hired as an overnight cashier and through the 10.5 years at this job I have learned many skills. Being patient, customer service, stocking shelves, rotation, time management, running a register, teamwork, and computer skills. Management was easy to get along with, the only issue is there is quite a few management staff and not enough associates to cover the work that needs to be done. All my coworkers were fun and easy to work with. Hardest part of job is getting used to using the Gemini's for everything that is necessary to get the job done. Most enjoyable part of the job is, there is not a day that goes by that you don't learn something new."
good,"I would come in and get straight to work and it was always busy! Demanding on time and breaks and lunches had to be timed precisely. I had to be very casreful to give the right medication and be cheerful to upset customers, even tho i idnt have to deal with thst many! Overall experience was great!"
good,I was very proactive at this job. I enjoyed interacting with customers
good,"There is so much opportunity within Walmart, being such a large company. The technology within the stores is really effective when doing your job and make it an enjoyable place. The management and co-workers really get to know each other and it facilitates a comfortable and productive work environment. "
good,"Marco en el reloj contro a las 07:00 de la mañana, luego superviso un modulo a cargo para que las empresas externas cubran su puesto de tranajo, luego monitoreo cada local a mi cargo todo depende del mudulo en el que este, esto ocurre en forma diaria todos los dias que me toca turno, y hacer los procedimientos diariuos requeridos por cada local segun sus necesidades en el turno."
good,"Greeted customers, accurately handled currency, maintained the work area, folded the clothes, adjusted displays and served customers on the floor as needed."
good,Everyday within the company was a learning experience and there is alot of versatility in the department jobs offered giving good chance for experience 
good,Working as a cashier you come across all kinds of people that come into a store. Being able to interact and assist the customers was a delight.
good,The job is ok I would just like to explore more. It was also my first job so Im looking for more experience in other job fields explore my options more.
good,"I learned to develop photos from negatives, learned to use the cash register. Provided customer service and answered telephone calls. "
good,"    Over all a good place to work , the only thing I did not like was managements ""good old boy "" way of thinking. "
good,"Great associates to work with and you get to learn different things everyday. As a customer service associate you help with returns, money gram transactions, cashing checks, helping customers with finding products as well as helping the photo center area. "
good,This was a pretty good temp job. The managers explained our duties really well so we knew exactly what we were there to do. I learned how to properly re-stock shelves and keep an eye out for any issues that could become a concern for customers and my co-workers. The only hard part was keeping myself occupied while standing in one spot for 12 hours while customers came through my area.
good,"When sam died, The main offices began taking away benefits. Now it is near impossible to make any kind of decent money off the business no matter how hard you work. You can do everything to the best of your ability and work every part of the store. No raise will be given."
good,My co-workers were great.  Same with the experience. The management are nice and responded to any concern the employee have. They listen to you and for me that is good.
good,"Come in check inventory, stock on floor and off floor items and complete the  daily task that was left for me. Then clean up put all other items away and get stocked up for the next day."
good,"In a typical night I would stock shelves, cash payroll checks, light cleaning and dusting."
good,Assisted customers with items and made sure that we had the correct products in stock to ensure we hit sales goals.
good,"Assistant manager working, but when it came for the manager to work on her weekends she would not come in."

good,I liked the people I worked with and some of  us are still friends after being a way for a couple of years. I liked the my job and the people that came in. 
good,Worked as Forklift operator and enjoyed this job..  The only down fall was short days or work.. Slow parts of the year ment less hrs on the job... Wal- mart Distrobution was also the first real job I had comming from N.Y.
good,There are times that the job is stressful but overall you meet new people and make new friends.  I have enjoyed working there.
good,walmart is an OK company to work for but nothing i would recommend for a long period of time. Moving up in the company is extremely hard.
good,"In unloading we clocked in at 4pm and left and 1am. The work was hard the fright boxes were often broken or covered in bleach, bags of cat and dog food would be ripped open and poring everywhere, and yet we managed to get the whole truck (often 2000 boxes) unloaded within 2 hours. We brought all the new and overstock fright to the sells floor so the overnight stockers can do their jobs. After, we maintained the overstock by doing system generated ""picks"" and unloaded additional trucks. The hardest part of the job was being the person inside the truck placing the boxes on the rollers at a minimum pace of 1000 boxes an hour. The rest of the team had to sort these boxes by department as the freight moved down the rollers. The co-workers were fun to work with and we always shared a laugh after the hard work was done. I learned that nothing comes easy in life and if I want a promotion I will have to sweat and bleed for my company, which I did."
good,lots of chatting between co-workers and customers..endless supply of things to ..hardest part is working on holidays
good,I enjoyed my time and experiences at Wal-Mart. I still feel I would be there if I still lived in S.C. I learned that you can be the best there can be at something but if one certain person does not believe in you it can all be taken away which is what happened so I found another job with another company. I loved making the store presentable for the next day!
good,Enjoyed working at Wal-Mart making all customers feel welcome. I also received cross training and was trusted to test as a pharmacy cashier. Through my years of working at Wal-Mart I got the chance to train new cashiers.
good,"Decent Company to work for, loved my co-workers, they made my whole work day better. As well as our customers, very fun working and interacting with different people daily."
good,"I managed the infant department, making sure it was neat and clean. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers."
good,cashiering was fun and meeting new people was interesting. My co-works they were all nice to work with.
good,A typical day at work would involve completing tasks required in Cashiering. I learned how to apply customer care service and to know that the customer truly is always right.
good,I loved my job at walmart because there was room to advance. I learned so much being able to help out in different departments when needed. The management is sometimes very inexperienced and won't give you accurate information.
good,"I lived out of a suit case from Monday through Saturday most weeks. I have been to every Walmart in the state of Missouri more the twice. I did not work for Walmart I was a Vendor, I don't think that Walmart is fair to there employees, but the do have great deals."
good,"At my job we work together as a team, we help each other on breaks and help with others departments. Always making sure the store is clean and zone looking top notch for our customers. I have 2 years worth of customer service experience. Manganment works with us to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of my day is putting a smile on our customers faces."
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work, however they offer low pay with high expectations. Although they try to enforce Corporate policies, it normally goes by the wayside depending on who you know. Opportunities for advancement are there, once again, depending on who you know. The hardest part of the job is accepting that policies are violated and overlooked consistently - depending on who you know. One person can get fired for something, while another can commit the same offense and just get written up. That gets to be extremely hard to ignore when it happens over and over. The best part of the job is definitely the friends you meet. Most people at Walmart are really good people, and I think its a shame they don't get paid what they are worth."
good,Walmart was a great place to work just wished i was officially hired and not seasonal. The people were all friendly everyone whom spoke back. The job was exciting by meeting new people an fun.
good,Dia de movimento atendimento ao cliente buscando a excelência.
good,"lots to do, learned how do handle money and inventory, coworkers all got along"
good,Good starting pay. Job security was great. Management could be better. Associate appreciation is lacking
good,A typical day would be making sure that the customers got what they needed and check them out.
good,My job is a little repetitive. I clean the store every night in a three man routine that is rotated through out the week. The co-workers are great for the most part. A little bit of drama but most everyone gets a long well. Overnight we are well understaffed and that makes it hard for the job to get done the correct way. Management overnight are pretty good about helping out the associates out as much as possible.
good,never wasn't busy always had something interesting to do weather it was running the registers or helping a fellow employee with a task
good,Very low stress most days and potential to move up in the company but lacked helpful co-workers.
good,Working at Wal-Mart as many other places had it's ups and downs. Overall I enjoyed the fast faced environment and being able to interact with customers throughout the day.
good,We always stayed very busy and still maintained a clean work environment.
good,"All corporations have their problems, every job is what you make it. Loved the job, and had a great time working there, just wish they would have played by the rules a little beter."

good,Typical Day: fold and stock childrens clothes. ALL DAY.
good,"Worked outside all day, some days were fast paced and very busy, other days were slow. Management was great, got out there and worked right along side us. Co-workers were wonderful, was like a little family. Hardest part of the job was being outside all day in all different weather conditions."
good,Good Company and wish I had stayed. Learned a lot about delegation and managing people during strict timelines.
good,"Mainly put out bakery, stocked milk, produce and food when needed on shelves."
good,Always moving and a good place to work. Usually poorly staffed.
good,Great job with excellent pay. Can not beat the three day work week.
good,"A typical day at work was making sure each customer was satisfied. Patience and being understanding is the key to mainly everything. In the work environment everyone got along or was cordial. The most enjoyable part of work was the customers, you run into so many different personalities."
good,In order to deal with an average day at Wal-mart you have to really love what you do.

good,Major Responsibilities
good,Had a great time with all co-workers
good,I have learned many skills while employed at Walmart as a whole the company is awesome to work for and opportunities are always available.
good,No regular schedual; always subject to change; only get 10% off if your a part time sales associate.
good,"good pay, need to improve on their benefits"

good,era muito legal de trabalha lá porque como eu era aprendiz eles tinham mais cuidados os colegas eram muitos atenciosos. os benefícios como o convênio médico era muito bom.
good,In my position was stressfull because it was understaffed.
good,A mi parerecer le falta capacitaciona sus encargados para saber manejar y poder controlar a sus asociados pues ya que se salen bastante de control.
good,Work was always busy. You get to meet a lot of new people. My co workers was fun to talk to. The hardest part was when customer was not satisfied.
good,Walmart is cool it can always be better. I was the fitting room consultant and phone operator.
good,Typical day at work would be generally customer issues with everything they can think of. Some of the people I worked with were just as bad as a typical customer. Others were great. The hardest part was probably when we were really busy and I was by myself due to being understaffed. I did however enjoy when things ran smoothly.
good,"Check back room for freight, run/and stock, bin extra freight that couldn't be ran, provide excellent customer service, and help cashiers if need be. How to read retail labels, tailzon, run register, and how to return broken items. Floor management is excellent and great teachers the big managers are not very good with filling in all the details. All co-workers are very helpful, and fun. The hardest part is finding room for freight. Running the register, freight, and helping customers find what they need was the best part of the job."
good,i liked working here in the beginning. I liked the department i was hired to help keep organized and running smoothly. What i didn't like was being pulled from what i was doing in my department to help other departments throughout the store only to have my department suffer for it. There was no form of organization in this store. Some days it felt like I was being pulled from different directions by the numerous supervisors.At times it felt like there were more supervisors than actual staff. In the end I left this job injured and not wanting to ever return to this place even to shop.
good,"I am responsiable for costomer satifaction. I enjoy the people I work with. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and the relationships I have developed with each one of them, they help bring a smile to my face and I do them as well."
good,"Cleaning, culling, stocking, zoning."
good,i enjoyed working here except the hours were not consistent.
good,"didn't learn anything new here. Management let you do your job without looking over your shoulders all the time. My co-workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet all day. What I enjoyed most was the discount the workers get on Wal-Mart purchases, especially clothes."
good,i was a overnight stocker so i would show up at 11:00pm and work until 7:00am. I would have meting with my coworks and supervisors in the back of the store to find out what aile i would be stocking for the night and what ailes my coworkers would be on. I learned how to use a box cutter and the right way to stock shelves.I dont think there was a hard part to the job the fun part about the job was working in the store at night with no one there.
good,"WalMart provides a team enviroment where all are set to achieve a common goal. Customer Service and products customers need and want. Everyday is a new adventure, from remaining seasonally correct merchandising to completing new tasks and projects. Interacting with several people on a daily basis, associates and customers."
good,Walmart not only gives me a chance to perfect my interpersonal skills but also gives me the oppertunity to move towards my career goals in management.
good,"Traveled from one Wal-Mart to Wal-Mart doing remodels. Took a crew of 4men to remove old sheet metal off the refrigerated cases and put on newthroughout the store. Wrote e-mails on daily progress, filled out timeSheets and went to morning meetings.hand unloaded parts into store, used pallet jack to move to the retail floor."
good,enjoyed working here but sometimes not enough workers to help. so many duties not enough members

good,clock in go straight to register and get to work. learning how to move at a fast pace. didn't like management. coworkers got along well. the hardest part of the job was being able to get along with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people out.
good,"Tive a oportunidade de trabalhar nesta empresa multinacional, foi muito bom, experiencia incrível como primeiro emprego."
good,A typical started slow we waited for stores to get done with there orders then we spent the rest of our time filling all the orders for bars stores and such.

good,customer service for all guests and cashier on a daily basis. Learned to be patient and driven with sales.
good,"Walmart is a great starter job for those individuals that don't know what they want to do. It is also a great way to learn how to work your way up in life if you don't want to join the military. Many employees that I spoke with said that they worked their way up from a cart pusher or stocker to assistant manager, department manager, or even store manager."
good,"Aprendi muchas cosas ya que me desarrolle en areas que nada relacionadas con lo que estudie pero fue muy interesante ver que pude realizar las actividades y adquirir muchos conocimentos, aprendi el trabajo en equipo y manejo de personal"

good,my co workers were very and helpful. The management was very organized.
good,A wonderful place to work. The people are all great. I wouldn't trade for anything.
good,"the best part was the consistent work or projects. Days went by fast if you were willing to seek them out. Immediate supervisors were fantastic to work for and with. Higher management seemed more callus and pedestaled. My co workers were fun and a good team, however, i did meet some employees i was glad i didn't have to work with. they evidently had been there too long, were depressing, complaintive and unhappy."
good,"I was the lead technician, inputting rx's, calling insurances, filling prescriptions, answering phones, counting meds, checking out people at the resgister, helping with OTC sells and questions. I learned a lot in the 3 years I was there. My co-workers were great and I loved going to work everyday. The hardest part of the job was trying to find time to take a lunch we were so busy it was sometimes hard to stop working to eat. I love that kind of enviroment. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the look on the customer's faces when you saved them money on their prescriptions and watching the same customers come back when you made them happy by being curteous and making sure they were taken care of."
good,"good place to work for,friendly people, good team work,very clean and organized"

good,It was always busy lots of wok to get done in a timely manner
good,"I would have to say that a typical day at Walmart being a cashier consists of craziness. Working there is alot like being back in highschool. No talking to other cashiers if nobody's around and alot of the managers treat you like your below them and as if you were a child. My fellow cashiers are some of my best friends. Really enjoyable people to work with and relate too. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the bosses. You get in trouble for every little thing and if you are sick and have to call in it is the biggest issue in the world to them. The managers take a store like Walmart WAY to seriously. It definitely isn't the worst job in the world and I have dealt with it for over 8 months, if you don't have patience I wouldn't suggest working at Walmart."
good,"My workday consisted of working in the utilities department, where I recycled and disposed of used assets. I learned better time management, and more efficient ways to lift heavy objects and materials. Management was reasonable. The hardest part of the job was the fact that it was a temporary assignment. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was able to continually finish my work."
good,"During my tenure, my typical day was interesting because I made each day a learning experience. I sought to serve in every capacity and it was my aim to exceed management expectations by completing my job assignments timely. It is was of no hesitation on my part for me to assist my peers with their job assignments and do what as necessary for the better of the team. I enoyed making everyone laugh and bridging gaps on some of the most horrific days."

good,"work with the freights, cashier stock item in back room and bring to the floor in the store"
good,"I was an optician with base salary and commission for selling bonus packages and upgrades to lense styles. When I left, I sacrificed all commissions for the sake of the company motto that you have to give 2 weeks notices that end on the last day of the month. Lost all commissions for that months and was never explained of the loss due to management negligence."

good,Normal day consisted of reviewing inventory levels and ordering as necessary. Developing associates to potential by coaching and setting examples. The managers were highly stressed due to heavy workloads and responsibility. The hardest part of the job was ensuring customer satisfaction with limited staff since tasks often took priority. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. The diversity was a major part of why I enjoyed Wal-Mart and has impacted me to carry on this line of work.
good,"Cashier responsibilities, data entry"

My co-workers were very helpful and patient with taking thier time to train me and answer my questions. The hardest part of the job was leaving because it was only seasonal and I really enjoyed working for this company. The most enjoyable part of this job was the experience."
good,"Clock in and walk the sales floor making sure no customer is left scratching their heads. Check that there are no outs on the shelves and if there are items missing make a pick list for the items. The customer always comes first so if your busy and a customer asks you for help, drop what your doing and assist them right away. Work closely with management to ensure the store looks its best all the time. Hard working co-workers makes for an enjoyable productive day. Learning inventory management can be tricky but the customers and conversation make up for the technicality in that department."
good,A typical day includes doing picks and binning. I have learned how to operate some of the machinery that they have. Manangement could be better. My co-workers are good hard working people who always lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting.

Always being friendly and patient is something that came easy to me, because I am a very out going person. I learned that always having a positive attitude and being patient and friendly will always make the work experience easier and enjoyable. The management at Walmart are very strict which they should be, The managers that were over me I enjoyed working with and became close friends with most of them. My co-workers were all amazing people they made the job enjoyable as well. Very easy going and friendly people work at Walmart. I dont really think there was a hard part working at walmart.

good,great company to work for! friendly employees and management
good,"Unloading trucks, pulling stock out onto the floors, stocking shelves, cleaning the back rooms, or dealing with inventory. This job keep you busy. It wasn't too difficult, all you needed was a little will power. The best part was the co-workers, we all kept keep other motivated to continue. But over all it was a job experience."
good,"It was the first place where I worked a set schedule, and it taugh me a lot."
good,"While workng for wal-mart, I have learned alot from how to provide excellent service to stocking and parts of management."
good,Fun environment to work in overnight. Very Hot and exhausting.
good,"While walmart used to be a great place to work now it has gone down hill, with no ability to move up even with the proper skills or training managment is so set in how they will run things they refuse to see any new potential other then kiss ups."
good,I would do phone contracts such as new customers and upgrading their plan. Also if they needed help I would work in the Electronics department.
good,Tend to customer that need help
good,"Responsible for researching PT Accounts in Wal-Mart's Pharmacies and Optical Departments for any issues that led to overpayment, non- payments, or any other insurance issues. My specialty was in Medicare and Medicaid Insurance for non-payment of claims . I also made and answered phone calls from insurance company's and patients' to verify and updating insurance information and collecting any needed information from pharmacies', doctors offices’, or from patients’ for payments on claims."
good,Large scale customer centered retail company with a variety of jobs.
good,Going to work you will clock in and check in for daily duties and assignments. The work day usually flies by due to the constant work.
good,Working at Walmart can be the funnest place to work because of helping people get the right products for the right price. It can be one of the worst places to work because of the verbal abuse you take from the customers that come in with attitudes.
good,I loved walmart. The people that I was around were excellent.
good,Its great as a starter job or a job to have while you attend school simply because they work around your schedule.
good,"It's ok for now, but I'm hoping to find something closer to home. Everyone is nice and they are helpful. I'm still learning, I've only been there a little over a week. It isn't reallyenjoyable, but it's money. Everything is hard."
good,"If you have a flexible schedule, this job is for you. They don't hire full-time and don't mind working around a schedule you already have."
good,"em dias tipicos de trabalho no geral havia bom relacionamento interpessoal com os colegas,em especial com o gerente do departamento no qual eu havia trabalhado,sempre muito atencioso,paciente flexível e compreensivo com seus subordinados,aperfeiçoei meus ensinamentos como vendedora,aprendi a ter mais segurança e convicção na hora de demonstrar um produto para o cliente,e a ter uma maior admiração pelos vendedores que atuam nessa área a muitos anos e os quais me ensinaram muito,o diretor muitas vezes se mostrava autoritário ,e incompreensivo em alguns casos ,mas também devo agradecer pela oportunidade de poder atuar numa área que eu não possuia experiência alguma,os colegas de trabalho eram pessoas superbacanas ,alguns fiz amizades sinceras e que vou lembrar com muito carinho,outros não conversava muito mas porém sempre que eu necessitasse da ajuda dos mesmos sempre que possível ajudavam,bem como eu os ajudava quando possível,a parte mais díficil do trabalho é conseguir sempre atingir a meta estipulada para manter o emprego,a parte mais agradável é poder conhecer pessoas e até mesmo histórias de experiências de vida que também me ensinaram muito ,mas de modo geral tenho que agradecer a empresa pela oportunidade."
good,"A typical day working at walmart was very busy an required alot of patience. I learned alot about customer service and how to effectively resolve issues between impatient, irate customers without there being any conflict. The management wasnt an issue they were fair and they really try and help in any way possible to make sure their employees are satisfied. I wouldn't say there's any part of woking the that I considered hard, most of it was new to m but i'm a very fast learner and catch on to things quickly."
good,"I enjoyed my temporary employment here, however I do wish they had decided to keep me. Unfortunately I was let go."
good,Working for Wal-Mart was hard work but didn't have the hours that was needed.
good,really enjoyed working with everyone there the hardest part was working there in the summer
good,"Lugar bem movimentado por clientes, aprendi muito na questão de contato com clientes (atendimento), o relacionamento entre colegas acabou se tornando muito familiar, pois passamos muito tempo juntos, a parte mais difícil foi no início até acostumar a lidar com dinheiro em meio a tanto barulho, a parte agradável é que gosto do que faço."
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job is I get to work as a team , going out of my way to make customer happy and putting a smile on there faces. I love to engage with my co workers working as a team . I learned how to work in a fast pace environment and how to handle complaints in a positive way ."
good,Great Company to work for. Alot of opportunities for associates to move up.
good,mediana. pois anda-se muito la dentro e eles nao reconhecem
good,Basically this would be what of my work would consist of everyday.
good,"you never get your breaks on time, everyones rude, but you get your raises when your suppose to"
good,"Buen horario. Ágil gracias al sistema, maquinaria e infraestructura."
good,"It was a great place to work, except for the very low pay that didn't balance with the amount of hard work."
good,Stock and unload trucks. Its a growing enviorment with respecting people
good,"Enjoyed it, Do your job and you will not have any problems. Manager was really nice, understood that i was a student."
good,"En esta empresa aprendi a ser Cajera, es una Responsabilidad muy grande y me encanta.."
good,estuve por una temporada pero la verdad estaba conforme por el compañerismo
good,Wal Mart was a learning experience for me because I was exposed to a bigger dept. store and I was always learning new ways to improve my performance. Everybody worked well and there was a grass roots organization format so that nobody was at the mercy of one manager. The hardest part was leaving because I went to school but the benefits were more than adequate and I enjoyed working there. I hope that in the future I can be employed by them again because I could always count on my hours.
good,My job was mainly cashier. I enjoyed working with people so it was a good fit.The hardest part of the job was standing for hours while being pregnant. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the people you got to interact with.
good,"It was very hard to balance my education with working here. They seem to not be very caring with the schedule that they were giving me. They were giving me full- time hours but I was not employed full- time. I could not get the full -time benefits even though they wanted me to do everything a full- time employee would do. I have done a lot working here, but I never got promoted to a hiring position with higher pay."
good,loved being outspoken really got a good attuide towards customers enjoy helping ppl and getting things what would fit there style hard worker and enjoying the work that i get refured to me to do so like talking to co workers getting to know them
good,Manage the day to day operations of a supercenter. Handle employee and customer satisfactions.
good,great management friendly co-workers. helped me learn to help people solve problems.
good,"I worked on the sales floor, in the toy department. I came to work and checked in with the department manager to make sure I new what to do that day. I learned different skills like; customer service, different tech. My management helped when I needed help, I worked well with the co-workers, the hardest part of the job was to work in the toy department during christmas, the enjoyable part was helping with customers"
good,good benefits and also challenging atmosphere to work. Has great opportunity's to move up.
good,At WALMART there were lovely co-workers and never a dull moment. Not one day went by were it didn't become a productive day!
good,Different environment than most retail stores. The management staff are a nice group of people to work for and the company has many benefits if you take advantage of them.
good,"My overall work experience was the best I had encountered since I was in employed into the workplace in 1975. The customer had their challenges, as well as, the co-workers per day but the courtesy I had to extended was priceless."
good,I typical day at work is greeting customers and checking out their merchandise. It is an interesting day meeting people of all nationalities.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers and providing good customer service. The management is excellent and tries to help you with any needs you may have. The hardest part of the job is the scheduling and hours being trimmed to meet their goals.
good,I would open items and put them on shelves or hang them up. I also would hang clothes up and make sure the area was clean.
good,"Era um lugar movimentado com varios clientes,aprendi a conviver com pessoas diferentes."
good,It can be a fast paced job. Which for me was good. Good atmosphere with everyday challenages.
good,"As an employee of Walmart I was able to learn the skills needed in order to become a customer service manager. The store manager and assistant managers were very observant of everyones skills and made sure to reward them for it. Each day is different because you don't know what kinds of situations are going to come up at any given moment. Most of the other employees were friendly, helpful and willing to be flexible with shifts and jobs. The hardest part of my job at Walmart was managing the schedule. I enjoyed the challenge of trying to give everyone the proper hours and days but sometimes it didn't work out. The most enjoyable part of my job was how fast paced and different each day was."
good,they need some improvement on some areas but over all an good place to work
good,Sweep the fitting room. Answer phones. I learned to be dependable. The management was NOT the greatest. And they were not fair.
good,"Wal-Mart strives on thier Key values, but Management in stores do not follow the key values set as a company."
good,Enjoy working for Wal-Mart. Co workers are easy to get along with
good,"Very fast paced, demanding job. Management have to be discipline, well organized to stay ahead of trends."
good,Enjoyed my time with this company. Looking forward to more years with another company.
good,meeting all kinds of people helping them find what the want management is fair
good,"I worked in both the Electronics and the Connection Center Departments during my time at Wal-Mart. In both instances, I'd spend my day straightening merchandise, restocking shelves, assisting customers and tendering purchases. Many times throughout the day, I'd be called to the front dest to verify a return according to the company's policies. I'd also frequently get asked questions regarding the products and their use, i always answered to the best of my ability. If I wasn't aware of the answer, I'd find someone who did and direct the customer to them. When I worked in the Connection Center, I worked hand-in-hand with cell phone providers to act as a liason between them and the customers."
good,I love working for Walmart. The customers are the people that keeps my day moving so smooth and swell but i love the co-workers and my managers were exciting people to be around. The hardest part of the job was learning the codes for the fruits and vegetables.
good,"My job is good,but Im looking for better.Im"
good,"I would start in the stockroom,get a pallet jack and start getting freight to take to the sales floor. I would take the product to it's designated area. Management was there if and when you needed them. Co-workers were great.They would come over and help anyone if they needed it."
good,Very good company to work for. I enjoyed every day i worked there.
good,This is a great place to work with lots of room for advancement.
good,Un dia tipico en el trabajo es llegar hacer un recuento de lo que dejo el turno pasado de lo que hay y de lo que viene en el turno y estar atento a los nuevos acontecimientos.
good,"there ok to work for but do not care about there employers your job duties are not limit to what they tell you, you are to do what ever they tell you to do they do not pay enough for the job."
good,Management at walmart needs to help associates instead of telling us what to do and then walk around and play on their phones and watch football games.
good,A great company with core values but along the way through the layers of management the little people(associates) get left behind or forgotten.
good,"I would work the toy department, there were quite a few duties. For one, I had to assist customers in locating merchandise and listen to any comments they may have had. I would also do some zoning, where I would organize the shelves. I also would answer the phone for my department."
good,Preventive maintenance on conveyors and equipment. We had a great bunch of people on the shift we worked
good,"12 hour work days, 4 on 3 off as a support manager, plenty of help to make sure the store was ran properly, great employees, great upper management, very rewarding."
good,"They are fairly strict on clocking in no more than 2 minutes before or after shift starting, however when you have 10-15 people coming in and only one spot to clock in that can be challenging. Past that though it was pretty straightforward work and they paid more than I expected."
good,"This is a fast-paced environment that keeps one busy through an entire shift, so a work day goes by pretty quick. Management was willing to teach anything I asked to learn about, which makes it easy to get ahead in the store. It does take a toll on ones stress level when there's as much traffic as there is here. It's a great way to build customer service and people skills."
good,"Una compañía que brinda conocimientos, oportunidades de desarrollo, que prepara el día a día, que está lidereada con gente capaz."
good,"Nice place to work, I was a cashier and also helped with Maintenance of the store."
good,"My typical day was running the register and getting products rung up. Self explanatory. The management while I worked there, was just ok. They are nice people I am sure, just not a fit for the job they have."
good,"its a job in the end but they do try to bring us closer together as a team, enjoyable"
good,"I just liked working nights stocking shelves, helping customers, learnign to audit items and bin items. Re-mod aisles is always fun to change up the look of the store. great people to work with mellow outigoing ."
good,Fast pace organized friendly environment. Worked with very friendly management
good,"My work day begans with me arriving on time. I greet my fellow co-workers and clock in. My duties involve me unloading the delivery trucks,Categorizing pallets for the various departments throughout the store. I use a manual pallet jack to transport multiple palettes throughout the depIarment storestore. At times I operate an electric powered pallet jack to maneuver pallet around the various departments. I've learned how to efficiently use and operate an Electric Powered Jack,a Cherry Picker,a Walking Stacker,and a Baylor. I've had the opportunity to develop team working skills with good hardworking, and dedicated co-workers. The aren't any difficult parts about my job that I am aware of. I find that the most enjoyable part of my job is unloading inventory from the delivery trucks and delivering the proper pallet to the proper departments."

good,I enjoyed knowing that when I got to work I would see all my friends that became like a family.
good,retail experience training
good,pulled pallets & stocked shelves.
good,"Had fun there, got to work at a fairly quick pace and my coworkers were nice but the managers were a little rude. Hardest part of the job was dealing with Holiday shopping."
good,"Na minha funcao nenhum dia e igual ao outro.aprendi que que para um bom desempenho no trabalho temos que saber como lidar com varias tipos de pessoas,a gerencia muda constantemente entao nao poderia por alguma observacao plausivel,meus colegas se tornaram bons amigos e com isso formavamos uma boa equipe,a parte dificil seria lidar com algumas diversidades,pois lidava com o publico tambem e a parte agradavel e saber que fiz um bom trabalho."
good,"Empresa de grande concorrência no segmento de hipermercados, com muita organização e preocupada com o bem estar dos funcionários, dando informações a todos funcionários sobre o real situação que se encontra."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consists of being around alot of people different personalities. I learned alot from walmart I learned how to load and unload trucks, how to organize a backroom, how to work a electric jack, how to work the cash registet, I learned how to do moneygram and money orders, I also lerned how to work the telzon. I had some co- workers and I had some bad ones but for the most part it was good ones. The hardest part of the job was nothing I overall liked working there. The most enjoyable part of working there by far Is all the different people you see and be around."
good,lo más complicado es realizar la producción para el otro día cuanto te toca trabajar en un turno solo.....
good,"I have learned how to deal with different personalities, also how to work with other people no matter what."
good,"I enjoy working for asda but there are no challenges as my previous jobs had more responsibilty, i enjoy greeting and meeting customers the staff are freindly and i enjoy going to work to see them. It is an easy job and there is not a hard part of the job."
good,"i start working different shifts 8 hours sometime in the mornings or afternoon good coworkers, the management was not that good i learn how to use the rf how check product hardest parts of the job deal with customers, enjoy helping people."
good,A typical day at work would involve unloading the truck and then bringing the merchandise out to the floor and then pick merchandise in the back warehouse for the rest of the evening. I learned that any job can be fun if you allow yourself to enjoy it. My co-workers were amazing they became good friends of mine. The hardest part of the job was having to come in on the weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would go out for our lunch break to a near by place.
good,"Learned how to manage inventory, stocking and helping customers."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. My co-workers are like family and most of the management are nice. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with people that I consider friends, and the hardest part would have to be working out in the harsh weather conditions, since I work outside. A typical day at work would include zoning, operation of the telxon, running the cash register and the forklift. I've learned more about customer service, such as how to properly communicate with a customer to ensure a happy and satisfying outcome for the both of us."
good,"The experince that I had while at Wal-Mart was good to fair. The management was sometimes pushy and demanded more of you than what your pay rate was. The other co-workers were somewhat friendly and helpful. If you were not a deptartment or upper management then you were low-life scum. The job was enjoyable most of the time except around holidays i.e. Christmas. The pay was minnium, with average benifits. If your a high school grad or working your way durring college, I would recommend this job to you. If you are a single mother with kids or even married and trying to make this job your income for a family, don't. Otherwise Wal-Mart treated me about like every other drone that they employ."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty busy with loading, unloading merchandise and assisting customers. I learned how to organize inventory, proper way to stack different types of products and goods, and also how to assemble various products. The hardest part of working there was not being to reach our store goal by the end of the month. Pleasing and make the customers smile is the best part of working at Wal-Mart."
good,It was a great place to work while i was still in school. Most enjoyable part of my job was working overnight produce. very nice people great work environment.
good,"Here I learned how to deal with customers. The management was okay but many times had no idea what was going on or what to do. Co-workers were okay, some worked hard others just goofed around. Hardest part was getting an hour lunch and getting out later because of it."
good,When i started at TLE (Tire Lube and Express) i was really nervous just because i have never worked with tires and all men before. But i would have to say once i got used to everything i loved my job there. unfortunately we moved and i couldnt travel back and forth from madison to leroy everyday.
good,"Unrealistic expectations will never be met, and that's the typical work day. With continuously shrinking payroll and continuously increasing freight flow the workplace becomes a dreaded place and no one wants to come. Starts at the top and customer service is no longer a priority."
good,"A typical day includes ordering, scheduling and customer service. I have learned impeccable time management and organizational skills from an approachable and knowledgeable management team. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is customer service. It is difficult to satisfy every customer, however that challenge is the most enjoyable."
good,"Good Company to work for, hard work daily. supervising directing average 80-100 associates daily. Morning tours and afternoon tours of the store to ensure in stock and customer service standards are being met."
good,i worked outside in the cold it wasn't a fun experience but it was worth the pay.
good,Working in the Deli is hard work and fast paced which are two things I like about working at Walmart. I enjoy the pace and making the day go by faster and keeping busy. I enjoy working with people and ensuring they get exactly what they want from the Deli. I also enjoy making party trays that we offer in a wide variety.
good,"I would go in and start out in my department, but I was often paged to go to other departments where help was needed. I learned several skills in my department and others as well as how to keep the customers happy while learning how to work with others. The management in my opinion was great. They were friendly but got the job done. My co-workers where very easy to get along with and everyone made sure to get their own assignment completed. The hardest part of my job was when I first switched departments but I quickly learned and adapted well to my new area. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the capability of helping customers find things and such and seeing them leave satisfied because I had been of assistance to them."
good,I always enjoyed going to work and giving customers the best experience possible
good,"Having been employed with Walmart so long I have been able to experience many operation functions of the retail world. Cashier, unloading trucks, maintaining pricing, stocking freight, communicating with vendor partners and daily deposits."
good,"Foi excelente para meu desenvolvimento profissional e pessoal. Aprendi bastante, com meus superiores, e colegas de trabalho. Formei uma ótima equipe e só obtive bons frutos dela."
good,"Order pharmacy drugs, fill prescriptions, bill insurance companies and provide customer service."
good,"It can be a good place to work as long as you stay productive. I learned a lot there, how to use a scrubber, buffer, fix things, make bails, how a stockroom works etc. The management is probably the worst thing there though"
good,"this is a good job, even if you are in school. some managers work with you with hours, you just have to know who to talk to."
good,I enjoyed working here because I never had a dull moment. They keep you busy.
good,They were very flexible for the work hours I needed at the time. I knew if I had any questions I could ask and not worry about anyone else knowing what I had said. I really enjoyed working with the different types of people and the younger generations that wanted to be shown different ways of remembering the how to's.
good,"Its an ok job for veterans and retirees. I like the job, but I do not like how the managers run their business. Also I work third shift and I wish that I would of worked morning shift in the beginning because it is hard to get them to switch you when you are ready to be switched."
good,"Begins with picking up your work itinerary, prepping area to be stocked.management informs you of current changes in that shifts Merchandise, Depending on the particular inventory you may work or partner with co-worker to accomplish task .The hardest part of the task was amount of Merchandise and the amount of time to finish Task.I found it to be Very Challenging , but You Learned how to adapt and overcome to meet the challenge at hand,therefore embracing a sense of Accomplishment, This was for myself the most satisfying part of the job."
good,Walmart is a fun place to work at. The employes are very welcoming. I have learned many of new and fun things
good,There are fun people to work with. I like the diversity in people.
good,"employment was good at wal-mart, interaction with the customers was great and finding out what they would change if they worked there. Some of the employees were kind of rude but other then that it was a good place to work if you dont mind standing for hours"
good,"greet customers, customer assistance, watch repair, cashier, store operator when needed, and sales associate."
good,I learned so much working at the business because I knew nothing about construction but I loved it.
good,"Working for this company was a nice experience, you deal with many different customers each and everyday. I've learned alot of valuable information from working there."
good,"There is a great comeraderie among the staff. We took great pride in doing a job well done. Most times, it was a real pleasure to interact with the customers. Also enjoyed interacting with fellow workers. Management worked with us whenever there was a personal need. It felt like everyones goal was to make our store #1. The hardest part of the job was standing on concrete floors for 8 hours a day. My cash drawer always balanced. I was always courteous to customers. I had repeat customers who only wanted to check out through my lane. Supervisors began sending new cashiers to me to train. I ended up training some who were promoted above me."
good,"Very fast paced work environment. Must be able to multi-task and be customer friendly. Typical day included stocking, taking inventory, providing customer service, and always willing to help in other departments including cash register."
good,"ALot of work, but got to learn alot of new things, great co workers"
good,very busy all the time i learned people from the customers to the associates. Management was extremely lazy moved slow all the time which put us in a bind the most enjoyable part about the job was all the times we could please a customers and make them smile .
good,"its very high pace at times and having to run to and from different areas of the store, handling multiple customers at once"
good,"I helped the pharmacy manager keep customers informed on status of prescriptions, kept our workspace clean and organized and assist at drop-off and pick-up windows."
good,"Worked in electronics and photo lab, provided customer service, translated when necessary, stock, cashiered, and inventory when necessary."
good,"A day at work is always full of newness and innovtion in terms of promotion planning and striving to do better to manage the category financials. It has been a lot of learning with new things coming your way every day. Learned a lot about the effective planning, vendor relation, people management etc. All the cross functions here are supportive enough to help you achieve your results. The hardest part fo the job is to how to get the maximum in the limited space and achive your numbers and the same has been the best part once you find the way and achive your target."
good,"Good place to work. Had good benefits, stock, enjoyed commrodery with fellow co-workers. Still friends with many that I worked with."
good,"Walmart was a great workplace. There would never be just a typical day at Walmart for me because everyday was different. One day I would be doing Greetings at the door, another day I would be helping out in inventory. I could be the customer service clerk another day, and cashier the next. Everyday was exciting to me, I loved this job the most. There wasn't anything hard about this job at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is to not know what you would be doing next!"
good,hard working job

good,"A typical day at work for me would be assisting customers with anything they need help with. From questions dealing with the store to how to send off a bill payment, I knew it all. It was a pleasure to be able to meet new people every day and to get familiar with my regulars. My co-workers were very easy to get along with. We were like a big family that always had each others back and that is what I like. I learned that patience is a virtue if you work in an environment such as Walmart but it's a learning experience that I could take on any day."

good,It was okay working for Walmart. I love interacting with people. I am very motivated and independent. I have great people skills.
good,stock everything before clocking out
good,i like working at walmart but the communication between lower employees and upper level management is not good. if you want something or need help with somehting only a handful of people will actually take time and help you alot of the other managers will only tell you to go to someone else and talk to them also i was a cashier for two years and i had to beg to be trained in customer service and the money center and any time i was able to move up to a higher paid position they wouldnt let me or just denied it

good,You will meet many of your long life friends working at Walmart. Much room for advancement. Great benefits.
good,while working for walmart i was able to gain people skills and aloud me to learn to de escalate several situaitons not tipical on every day jobs

I am either filling prescription, entering the prescription, or working on trouble shoot. Trouble shoot is where there is a problem with insurance and I have to called the insurance company to fix it or it could be a simple task when I don't have to call them. Also when we are short handed at the register I may give a helping hand. I get along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is trouble shoot.

This is why they had promoted me to customer service after 2 weeks of being hired. It was a great work place becuase they continuously asked me to do things that werent in my job description but it kept me very busy and that is something that enjoyed. The work place was great and i ot along with every employee. The hardest part of the job is when my register lines would get very long and another cashier would take my next customer. As an employee I like to get everything done that s given to me. Even though I know that it will benefit the customer to go to anothe register I still didn't like it on my part that I wasn't fast enough. The mpst enjoyable part of this job were the people i worked with. They made the day go much faster and better to get through."

good,I enjoy my job at wal-mart because your experience and possibilities are never endless. While being employed here i have learned to work in teams and how to read and set up modules.

The most enjoyable part of the job was doing a great job on something and getting recognized for it by manangement and also working with/meeting new people everyday."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart was a fun experience. I worked the overnight shift and in order to work on overnights anywhere, I think you have to be a little on the crazy side. People are much more laid back on overnight shifts but we always managed to get the job done regardless."

good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of a list of doings for the day, helpers of coworkers occasionally. The management needed a little more time training the new people and for who they chose for management. I learned good teamwork skills. The hardest part of the job was that most coworkers didnt hold their own weight of work and most of the time I personally had to cover theyre work load. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was able to help and communicate with customers."
good,"I enjoy my career at Walmart, however it is hard to advance from the position I currently hold unless you are willing to move at least half way across the country, so limited more local advancement in Asset Protection. Typically I monitor internal and external theft and case build through evidence and then prosecute whenever possible, I also have ties to all Local, State, and Federal Regulatory Agencies to insure compliance. ATF, Food Safety, OSHA just two name three. I enforce and teach, train, and develop associates and Management about all company policies and procedures and conduct a coaching process or terminate if needed. I am directly involved in accident prevention and accident investigation processes. Co Workers seem to not want to follow company policy.

good,"In the 12 1/2 years at this company I gained a great deal of experience. There was good training and the envirinment of the store was good. Have the SWAS program, which was Store Within a Store, you had the opprotunity to treat your department as your own store. I liked this model because it made more personala and more challenging. On a typical day, running your business there were tasks that had to be done as well as ones that were at your descretion. Schedules had to be made, inventory checked in as well as one on one customer service. Some days you would be in a different department. The people that I worked with at the time were family oriented and were willing to work. I made some lifelong friends. The hardest part was inventory because we had to count and then an outside company came in to count. Some years they did not do such a good job. The most enjoyable part for me was interacting with customers, forming relationships and have become repeat customers. I see some of these same people today and they say ""you worked at walmart""."
good,I always stretch before my shift
good,"Everyday I go to work and do returns/exchanges and money services. Very easy to do my job until a customer doesn't agree with how I'm taking care of them, then you become powerless because your CSM comes and takes over your whole transaction and belittles you. Other than that the jobs great."
good,The people were great to work with but management needed work.
good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers. They are friendly and helpful, when you need them they are there for you. During a typical work day I will interact with any where from 125 customers to over 250 depending on the season, currently I am a cashier. Management is mostly hands off unless needed. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with angry customers who feel they have been waiting to long, fortunately, that dosen't happen to often. The interaction with the customers can be the most enjoyable."

I offer the Walmart Rewards Mastercard to each customer and briefly explain the benefits of the card and let them know how much money they can save by getting the card. I am always friendly and happy to help customers with any questions or concerns they may have. In my time working at Walmart, I've learned that you can never do too much to help a customer, and it is very important that each person leaves happy. My co-workers at Walmart are exceptional, and I get along with every single one of them. The hardest part of this job is the repetitiveness and the long hours. However the most enjoyable part is engaging in conversations with the customers and bagging the items."

good,"Great place if you want to move into management. Hard work, but great benefits."
good,you guys need a man like me to work there i love to work at this job i had to make sure that the floor was wax before the store open
good,"In general Walmart is a good place to work. CoWorkers are like family, when one is in crisis, they all pull together to help support each other emotionally or physically, whatever is needed. What I do not like is that it is hard to advance in this store, though they encourage you to try. I do not like to feel like I am in a rut not progressing toward any kind of a goal, and that is how I feel at this point. I am thankful to have a job, but I feel that I can better myself if I close this chapter of my life and open a new one."
good,ok empolyees or lazy but there ther profession. manage are understanding
good,"A typical day for me at work consists of helping customers, stocking shelves, dealing with cash register and handling money phone calls.

good,everything made sense at this job. I really enjoyed going to work. Management was wonderful and the workers were good team players
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a great experience. Their store intranet ""The Wire"" was a great tool for learning company goals and policies as well as state and federal regulations for all departments. With the Wire being updated frequently through-out the day, I was never behind on initiatives or uninformed about goals. Moreover, the global computer based learning enabled me to enhance my knowledge about my position as well as learn the fundamentals of other positions I was interested in pursuing. I learned a great deal about logistics and human resources, project management, store level and district metrics, and managing a team. In pharmacy, my salary was 35% above average and I hired technicians at 14-17$/hour due to local economics. However, the location wasn't to my liking. Also, pharmacy was able to provide hourly employees with more consistent schedules compared to division 1."
good,"loved what I was doing, unfortunately the hours that you get don't help with going back to school. I had to leave because I was returning to school. Would consider going back there!"
good,I worked as a photo technician and LOVED that. I had to leave due to going back to school and the hours that you get at walmart made it hard to work and go back to school.

good,The job was a place of fun at work. They tought you ta get things done but also enjoy your job. Managers were als easy to talk to as wells as the co-workers. The job was never too overwhelming and every hour to the end was stress free.
good,A typical day at walmart consisted of clocking in and going to your assigned area. Upon arriving to your area you would then help customers or work on assigned tasks till your shift ended. Management would give vague at best instructions and you would do your best to figure out what they meant. The co-workers were mixed the younger ones were usually more friendly but the older ones were more reclusive and withdrawn maybe due to working there so long. The hardest part of the job would have been impossible to please customers. The most enjoyable thing about the job was having people come back and ask for me by name to help them.
good,Fun you get to work with a lot of people the managers are fun and understanding. if you want to work around girls this is the job
good,"aprendi a ter mais responsabilidades com o emprego, a respeitar os clientes e funcionarios, de colegas de trabalho sempre dispostos a ajudar quando se tem alguma duvida."

good,"Working at Wal-Mart is truely an experience. You learn a great deal of customer service skills, while maintaing a pleasant attitude. As with any job, you can make it fun or you can make it a task.

good,"Walmart is an interesting environment to work at. They do almost all training through computer programs and testing. The actual jobs are quite simple and easy to do. AT times it can become busy, but overall is not difficult at all."
good,"The hardest part of being an assistant manager with Wal-mart is in the last two years they rolled out company programs that required more associates/payroll, yet cut payroll significantly which made it almost impossible to be successful. It was a great job with advancement opportunities, but they stopped focusing on their associates needs and the foundations the company was built on."

I work with a few associates who have disabilities and walmart don't discriminate when it comes to hiring people with disabilities. which is a good thing because everyone deserve a chance. Wiorking in retail you get to know the customers and sometimes you know thiem by name and they become part of your walmart family as well. The hardest part of working at walmart is getting through the holiday season.
good,My days were non-stop with many different duties. I learned a lot about many different products and the inventory system. Co-workers were fun to work with and helpful.

It includes making sure everything has a place and figuring out the problem if it seems impossible. I, along with a group of my fellow associates are on a time frame. We have a schedule that must be kept every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that our group stays on task and we keep all our priorities the same.

good,I loved Wal-Mart for the long lasting relationships that i have build within the company also the customer relationships. I've learned in this company that if one person in the pyramid is not present that the pyramid will fall. Management changed more than advertisement.
good,Putting stock on selves(its like persents every day depending on the department)
good,My first little bit at Walmart was absolutely amazing. Near the end of my time there supervisors and management were not flexible with my schooling like they said I would be. I had a choice either go to work and miss class or go to class and miss eork and not be able to pay bills. I spoke to my supervisor about this problem and nothing was changed with my schedule.
good,After only working there for 6 months i had health benefits. Everyone says that working for walmart is the bottom of the barrel type of job. But when i worked there i was making the most money that i had in all of the retail jobs that i have worked at. And the position that i worked was wonderful.
good,"A mix of Logistics, running warehouse equipment and stocking. A high spirited, fast paced work place that provided a good customer service background."
good,I enjoyed working with my co workers providing cutomer assistance and running the front end. Each day is the same but each customer is differnt with different needs. You work with company guide lines to ensure each customer is happy. The worst part is when you can not help a customer and they become upset with you and there is nothing you can do.
good,walmart can be a fun place to work. the associates are friendly the managers are easy to get along with and they do try to take care of there employees
good,the day would start with a meeting with whole overnight crew both sides of the store. The managers were very easy to get along with. all in all a good place to work
good,It was a very consistent job from 4pm to 1am the management was kinda stiff but we got around it coworkers was really school mates so it was very fun as far as wrk environment the hardest would also be the holidays.

good,Walmart is a good place to work. Its always busy so a typical day at work goes pretty fast. Managers are helpful.
good,I enjoy working in the pharmacy because i love to know about new things and i learn new things every day. I enjoy working in a team to achieve our goal. I love interacting with customer and try my best to help them out. My long term goal is to get my CPA and work in accounting or financial firm.

good,I had a great time working for this company and it was a awsome job but I had transportation problems and could not get back or I feel like I would still be there today.
good,"Walmart is ok, but they dont give a lot of hours some weeks. They worked with me when I had medical issues"
good,"I loved working at Walmart. I have freedom to run my departments my way and I had the choices to bring in my decisions for product.

good,"I really like working for WalMart. While there a few aspects of it that I don't agree with, overall it's a good company. My co-workers are the best. We always have fun working together and we really are a team. I've worked on the front end as a cashier and customer service associate, but my favorite position is in IMS; Inventory Management Systems. I've learned so much about how the store works from receiving freight to getting overstock out onto the floor to keeping track of what we have in stock. I've learned so much about the screens on our Telxon and how everything we do effects the store. My assistant manager is so supportive and she works just as hard as we do. She lets us know when we're doing a good job and is always there to help us improve our work. My co-workers and I are very close. We rely on each other to get the job done and we help each other in every way we can. The hardest part of my job is making sure that we have all of our work done in a timely manner. We only have so many hours to get all of the picks, counts, audits done and we are scored on them everyday for a weekly percentage. Sometimes it's stressful, but the reward of getting good scores makes it all worthwhile."
good,I work at a very busy pharmacy which requires ability to cope with stressful situations at fast pace but maintaining accuracy. Every day was challenging because you never know what customer situation you may encounter. Insurance problems must be handled tactfully and in an effiecent manner to keep customers happy. I work well with all associates and try to be helpful with problems. The hardest part of my job is to keep smiling no matter what the day brings. The enjoyable part is that I like what I do. I wanted to be a pharmacist before I entered high school so I took every class that brought me closer to my goal.
good,"worked in garden section watered garden, helped customers, cleaned ext"
good,Management is so focused on themselves and their own bonuses that they forget the people under them.....Us. Over hire to pay the newer people less and drive your own ours to 10 a week maybe a little more if your lucky.

good,"Its been so long ago, but its all in a days work you have bad apples everywhere who ruin it for everyone else.its all what you make it"
good,"I have worked at several different pharmacies as a technician and this one by far is the least up to date in its technology. The RX program is extremely primitive compared to CVS or Safeway and I was really surprised. However, because it has a sister program for check out, there is a very low chance of a prescription getting lost in limbo compared to the other pharmacies.They pay is very low for an experienced technician and you do not get benefits until after a year! Only 10 percent discount after 90 days of employment! AND, they make you wear what all the other sales associates wear; no professional technician lab coats. Only the pharmacist can wear one! I have never seen that in any other pharmacy."
good,"I enjoyed working one on one with the customers, and the employees."
good,"My job title was a cashier. Some days I would work in different departments of the store, depending on the demand of the customer needs."

good,working for Walmart was an excellent experience wouldnt mind going back
good,I acquired the skill of working in a rapid manner. Management was fair. The hardest part was stocking after a holiday. The most enjoyable part of the job was going on break.
good,"This was a good place for a young single person to work, the coworkers were friendly and the atmosphere was good but working weekends and evening all the time didnt not appeal to me as i had a family"
good,"As a merchandiser specialist i've learned valuable information. A typical day at work is very much routine on most occasions. I walk my entire store to look for pepsi products that are on endcaps, displays, stackbases gondolas and simply in inline locations. My relationship with management has to be well inline for there the ones who order, and gives permissions to expand our products. The hardest part of the day and week is to persuade upper management to allow our products in various locations. The most enjoyable part of the day is making our merchandise assesible to customers."

good,Most days are really fullfilling. I get to associate and talk to many people as they come thru my line. I work with quite a few really nice people. Most of my co-workers are really good people and I enjoy working with them. Of course there are always those people who you do not see eye to eye with. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with many offensive people. On the other hand the most enjoyable part is all the wonderful people you do meet. Overall I would say the good outweigh the bad.
good,"My day was mainly working the floor and working with customers to make their life easier when it came to shopping. Management expected a lot from us but it was never too much to handle since everyone got along with one another. I had some problems with management towards the end of my job when my father died and caused me to lose many days since his death was hard to handle. I also had dental work that caused me to miss days and in the end that is what caused me to lose my job. I liked working there and never had many problems. Good people, good pay and good work."

I learned how to use the register, customer service skills, and how to decorate a cake lol. The managment there was great if I had a problem ther were there to help out. The hardest part of the job would be when I wasn't able to help the customer find what they needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and a grea outcome. Also the relationships I found with my co-workers."
good,Well they really do not care for the employees as much as they say they do on TV.....They want you to do everything that you can do but for as little money as they can get by with....And when they out stuff ob clearnece that is a joke because a lot of times they jack the price up then mark it back down to make it look like it is a sale....Then they got rid of there door gretters to save money now and they are getting stolen from popele a lot now just by walking out the door with stuff..
good,I was in charge of catching internal and external thefts. I sat in an office and controled several cameras in the store.
good,"I learned how to operate a register, cameras, and other electronic devices."
good,"I only worked at the front end of the store, cashiering and at the customer service desk, but it wasn't bad. The only reason I left was because I wanted more out of my life."

My co-workers and management were very friendly and were very caring. Next, The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making someones day by fulfilling their needs and making their shopping trip as speedy as possible."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart for me would consist of checking in with my Customer Service Supervisor to find out what tasks I was supoosed to complete for the day and then setting out to complete those tasks.

good,"Perform standard operating precedures on a cash registers, guide and assist customers in their purchases, stock and inventory goods."
good,"A typical day at Walmart would be planning out my associates day in order to complete the tasks I have been assigned. Some days are much more work while other days can be less. What I have learned from this job are effective time management skills. On any typical day we move between 1,000 to 3,000 items a day while giving exceptional customer service. I also learned how to manage other individuals. This is probably one of the most invaluable skills I have learned because I have to effectively manage individuals different attitudes to complete the days tasks. This would also be the hardest part of my day. We can be understaffed some days. This can make it difficult to complete tasks on busy days."
good,department manager and cashier
good,A lot of people working there would be very stressed about the job but it was fairly easy. The only time it really could get stressing would be any time an unhappy customer would come in. On the other hand when friendly customers came in it was easy to be in a better mood the rest of the work day. I was able to make new friends working there and the management was very easy to talk to. I learned that interactment with customers all depends on how you approach them regardless if they are unhappy or pleases with the services provided.
good,Worked in custermer services.and reciveing.stocked shelves and eorked register.
good,"Typical days were fast-paced with plenty of work to do. Excellent managers who train well in the logistics, and retail fields. Co-workers were very friendly and always willing to help. The hardest part of my job was working after breaks. I honestly felt like Wal-Mart has too many breaks. The most enjoyable part about my job was the isolation as well as confrontation with customers."
good,always busy loading and unloading
good,"Operation manager usually travels quite exstensively from distribution center to store investigating theft, safety issues(worker's comp)and assisting that center with their safety program. Ensuring the management is driving the associates to work safe ."
good,This was a great place to work the hours were not so great for me and it was goinf to be a long time before i could switch
good,"Entrando muy temprano ,verificando el orden de la tienda,hacer una buena zonz de defensa para nuestros clientes."
good,I started the day at walmart walking the floor and making sure everything on the shelves was in place and neat. then I would pass along notes to my other employees on jobs they needed to get done as I'm doing my price changes. After I finished that I would receive the new product and restock the shelves. In between all of this I would deal with all my customers needs.
good,"A typical day consisted on me doing recovery, and assisting any customers that needed my help. The most enjoyable part of the job was working at the customer service desk, talking with customers and assisting them."
good,The management is lackluster. The amount of help alotted is subpar and left to do much more than is capable
good,"A typical day at work would be as follow: clock in, make a list of what needs to be stock, make sure the floor is clean, and be friendly with the customers. My department manager was patient and understandable. And the hardest part of the jobs was the cold, especially the freezer were frozen food were kept. My most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
good,"I worked as a remodel associate at Wal-Mart. As a remodel associate I would move shelf and stock items. At times miscommunication issues between managment caused minor issues. However, managment was not bad. I felt as my co-worker and I worked well together and this was a great experience."

good,"En lo personal creo ke es una empresa muy buena, humanista pero en cuestiones de sueldo creo que estan pagando muy poco por el trabajo realizado."
good,"Cooking and preparing food for the customers. You learned how to cook and make salads,sandwiches,and many cold foods lik cole slaw and macaroni salad. The hardest part of the job is cleanimg up at night because you have to wash all the dishes and even the grills but you would enjoy working with the customers and the 1 hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks."
good,I stayed on time working at Walmart. Mangers never had a problem with me. I loved working at walmart
good,Help customers and collect shopping carts. Fun enviorment
good,Everyone is friendly and inviting to show you new work opportunities.
good,Although the company is good to work for each one of the stores is ran totally their way. Some follow company policies and some don't. Some people are held accountable and some not. Staying positive for the associates was important even when other management made the job harder then it needed to be.
good,"I stock freight on third shift. The most stress that I endure on my shift is getting my aisles done on time. But if I work ""smarter and not harder"" I get my aisle done in an efficient amount of time. I get along with everyone I work with, so during breaks and lunch I like to make people laugh with my sense of humor. I have been told I am the funniest person that works at Wal-mart."
good,I think Wal-Mart is a great place to work. The people that you work with can be an issue at times. I learned a lot while working even troubleshooting steps for equipment when they would break down and not work effectively. The management had certain people that was favored but I was okay with the idea because as a member of management I favored the co-workers that would do what was asked of them without too many issues or problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was just relationships that developed with customers. The hardest part of the job would be changing schedules and hours during the down time of the year.
good,i had to be fast paced there was alot of work. the only thing i wasnt satisfied with is that the position i had was not flexible and i had started college.
good,Not a great place to make a career but easy to start and move around and doing something you enjoy. Biggest problem is the more you learn the less likely you are to move up or anywhere else in the company.
good,"walmart is a good place to start out if you are a student fresh outa highschool or you need a balanced carrer field in retail. you will learn alot if you have the right mentor willing and able to teach you the buisness.but with little to not enough pay,and the fact that they almost do not hire anyone full time anymore makes it difficult for a adult looking for the hrs, able to survive."
good,"Your day can be very stressful at times with the interaction of different customers. It is always up to you how you handle them, but always remember that if there's a situation that you are not capable of handling, call upon management to assist you. My co-workers were all wonderful and sometimes challenging in the automotive department due to male counterparts that felt as a woman, I couldn't perform as well as they did. Our management team was always willing to assist you with whatever you may need help with. The hardest part of the day was when we were out of stock on certain items that the customers may need and not being able to provide them with, but always rest assure that we would do our best to provide them within a day or two. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my regular customers come in on a weekely basis with the expectation of seeing my smiling face and making their shopping day successful and complete."
good,The work is labor intensive and tough on the back.
good,Typical day at work was returning and selling products as well as problem solving. Everyday was a learning experience it improved my typing skills. Management and coworker were mostly pleasent to be around. Hardest part of the job was standing for 8 hrs. the most enjoyable part was solving problems and having happy customers.
good,I am an overnight stocker at Walmart and I love the people I work with.
good,No customer wants to wait in line all day after shopping. Get them in and out was my goal while working at Wal Mart.

My co workers were also very friendly. This job wasent at all hard for me because i loved when it was busy. It made the time go by faster lol.
good,"multi-culture, All the employees are hard workers and willing to help."
good,"When I left Walmart to move to Gulfport, MS I was a Customer Service Representative in the Lawn and Garden Department. I also worked in Seasonal and Pets, I enjoyed Pets the most because I got to maintain the fish aquariums and educated the public on proper pet care."
good,stock store as well as clearing parking lot of carts and make sure customers were able to find what they were looking for
good,Work day started at 5am. Ran the same cycle for more than 10 yrs.
good,"I waited on customers to meet their needs,operated registers,kept work area clean and stocked"
good,"Typical duties included deterrence and detention of shoplifters, occasional training on protocol and safety, and making sure that the associates in the store are maintaining proper safety and shrink habits. Management is very supportive of the Asset Protection department, in general more than the associates themselves. The hardest part of the job is its core component: dealing with shoplifters who are either angry, embarrassed, or offended that they were caught stealing. This can escalate to a violent offender or simply a ""runner""."
good,I liked working for them it was a great motivational work place also was very educational
good,"The people were great, worked well with the hours I needed and great training"
good,"Walmart is not a typical job so there are no typical days. Everyday is different, so you have to expect different things. As long as you are determined, energetic person you will be fine working at Walmart."
good,Stocked freight
good,i enjoy walmart it gave me good customer service experiecne
good,1-Sempre agitado e com varias informações.
good,A day at Wal-Mart is a busy day if your wearing 3 hats. I was doing
good,"A work day includes clocking-in and make sure all staff are present. I assign the cashiers to a register as the new shift begins, relieving others as their shift ends. I am responsible in making sure daily reports are printed, zoning or cleaning gets done, breaks and lunches are scheduled and taken, and the front-end is prepared for the next business day or shift before leaving. I've learned that more than skill, a great attitude goes much further. I love working as a team with my co-workers and seeing name badges to call them by name. The hardest part of the job was the disappointed customer, but the most enjoyable part was seeing a customer, co-worker, or manager greet me with a smile and call me by name when they saw me coming."
good,"counting out, customer service, staying active, positive and friendly towards customers and associates."
good,I enjoyed working her due to my ability to meet and greet different and new people when ever I worked. I inproved on my 10 Key and obtained several friends during my tenure.

good,"I worked as a cashier, life was easy. Get a customer, ring up their merchandise, take their money, smile and say thanks."
good,Had to deal with all types of customers.
good,A work pla ce for people like me that enjoy meeti g new people every day.
good,"Clock in to work walk to your department, unload the returns, assists customers as much as possible, clean under the shelves, and straighten up the shelves and merchandise. Clean up any hazardous spills or food left on the floor. Work in the freight as directed by the zone and department manager. If other departments are lacking associates, while your's has two or three help when told to or asked. Hardest part was the manual labor in the back and so strange characters that work with or over you. Enjoyable part was the friendly co-workers and lunch breaks."
good,Scanning items fast and accurately. Managers weren't tvery helpful.
good,i enjoyed the fun nights with co workers and the pot lucks that we would have to make the lunch times go quicker.
good,"Customer Service Rep, Cashier, door greeter at times. Love retail and most of the employees. Not a company that really works with you if you have a medical injury."
good,Boa escola de aprendizado profissional aonde mim proporcionou desperta mas minha liderança etc...

good,Very fast paced enviroment. Something is always waiting to be done.
good,Many multi task cash handaling sales management and teamwork
good,"ran register, helped customers, management was helpful, the hardest part was running the self checkouts, the most enjoyable part was helping the customer"
good,I was a merchandise supervisor for about 12 yrs. Then i left in 2004 and wanted to change for more money but didnt work out so i went back after 7 months.. I was in charge of many different departments through my years with walmart. I loved my job no matter what dept i ran.. I think the main one i liked most of the mens department.. I love working with people and teaching them as well how to do their job well.. i had good co workers that worked for me. I have learned about inventory as we had to do every year..
good,"Working as a cashier was not a difficult task, however, it was definitely a stressful enviornment due to the lack of staff. The hardest part of this job was definitely the fact that other employees always called in and the few that showed up to work always had to complete the same amount of work with fewer staff. The duites were never difficult, but the morale would always affect the productivity, especially since employees would be upset at those employees that were absent."
good,"I liked the people I worked with and what I was doing, compensation wasn't enough, management was alright, overall a good job."
good,Walmart is a great place to work. There are some days that are busy and some are not according to the season. At walmart you always know what to expect. I learned at walmart being that it was my first job that the customer is always right. I loved my coworkers there everyone was so down to earth. The hardest part of the job were the issues with pricing on merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing people leave happy.
good,"Fast pace,new areas,always nice,watch for errors,leaving,meeting people.Never leave madalways smiling."
good,Company as a whole is good to work for but each Store Manager has different knowledge and expectations.
good,"Loved my co-workers, however, Walmart asked too much of its employees for the little bit of money they paid."
good,I really enjoyed working with walmart company I loved my coworkers and all the benefits that was available to me
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work but I've heard that the benefits and pay has went down hill. It's a excellent place for a person to learn people skills and team work.
good,"A typical work day consist of coming in whenever they schedule you morning or night, going to my designated regaster and doing my job. I have learned that they policys on price matching change based on what each store does differently. There are plently of managers, sometimes too many of them and when observing things it seems like there is quite a bit of favorites that is played amongst themselves. I would like being there more if they would all be on the same page. My co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of my job is the fact that I know that they dont want to help me advance and then explaining to the customers all of the different changes that come up and why we did it last time but wont do it this time on the price matching. The most enjoyable part of my job is that its easy and I have a few customers who have become my friends over the time frame that I have been there."
good,"Follow sop. Keep easy shopping experience for customers. Days were never typical. Management down and going, easy to talk too."
good,"I had 2 reviews for walmart, and both said exceeds excellents. I enjoyed working for walmart, and liked my job."
good,A typical day at work was good. I learned alot from the public. Management was decent. My co-workers was great to work with. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the public.

good,"It was a happy working enviroment.people. coming and going with smiles, It was nice working with people that"
good,Management needed for rapport with employees and employees with customers.
good,Working here allowed me to interact with individuals from many different backgrounds. The management was helped me along the way by being understanding of my academic schedule and responsibilities. The hardest part of working here was probably managing my school and work schedules.
good,When i came to work i enjoyed it. i got along well with other assicoitats and i learned how to deal with angry and upest coustermers. that hardest part of the job was dealing with a rush and getting tired from the busyness but when it came down to it you really learend how to work underpresser and stay happy and patiant.
good,"I would come into work punch in and start my day. I got along with all of my co-workers. Iwould first begin by cleaning my area and then see if anything needed to be stocked, rearranged or organized. Then I would see if any customers needed any help. I would have to keep busy until I seen any costumers at my cashier then I would ring them out if so. If it was running slow that day I would have to sometimes juggle two departments. That wuold be my typical work day!!"
good,"great workplace, some of the higher authority were unfair and tend to not care about anyone but themselves."
good,Great job
good,"Work was fun, the employees were friendly. Would love to go back"

good,Management was either good or bad depending who the manager was.
good,"One of the best places I have worked, The co-workers are from every back ground just about so they are all fun to work with. The job its self wasnt to bad just stalk shelves over night. Even thou some of the management expected to much the others were happy if you can do your job in the time you have and help out others when you finnish your area."
good,Getting merchandise to the floor in a timely manner for the customers
good,"A typical day at work would be unloading and loading pallets. Pulling pallets out to floor. Over my 5 yrs of working at Wal-Mart, I learned how to use forklifts and electric pallet jacks. I learned how to deal with problems between associates/customers. The management was ok, I really never had any problems because I always did my job and followed the rules. Over the 5 yrs working there, I enjoyed every moment of just being able to say I had a job that I liked and enjoyed going to everynight."
good,"The 12 hours days were long, but that is the shift I chose. I loved the people I worked with and the duties that I was responsilbe for. My co-workers were the greatest, like family."
good,"Up to this point in my life I had never envisioned working in a security-type position. I was offered a job in the Asset-Protection department of the company. Basically my job was to surveil, detain, and question anyone suspected of shoplifting from my store. In my first six months in the position I had 73 apprehensions and more than doubled our stores statistics from the previous year. It was definatly a different type job for me compared to what I was used to doing but looking back, abosoultly loved it, and showed how adaptable I can be."
good,Biggest retailer with changes every 4 minutes. Lots of room for advancement if you want to move across the country. Hardest part of the job is to have the control of all your associates and any and all customers at the same time
good,Was an new college student and was balancing work n school. Walmart did not understand college hours!
good,a typical day at Wal Mart was a very busy day. While at Wal Mart I learned how to use a cash register. The management was together.My co workers was the best they could ever be. The hardest part about the job was really nothing. The most enjoyable part of the job was co workers and the customers.
good,"Working at Walmart was fun, the crew I worked with was like family, Had things turned out differently I would still be there, and if i could I would go back...."
good,"Overnight stocking is the best. You don't have to worry about assisting customers, you can just attend to your duties. Managers are helpful and so are most of the co-workers. Overall, a great work experience."
good,Easy but customers could make days hard. Overall good experience.
good,"Walmart in Madison, AL is a rather low paying job. I was there for a year and a half and was still only making about $8 an hour or so. That was with me learning how to do everything in the store except for CSM or Manager, etc...."
good,I thought Walmart was great. It gave me flexible hours and it was always something for me to do.
good,"i really enjoy working here, but i cant work here while going to school because i will be going fulltime for elementary ed."
good,"fast pace and working with alot of people. Management is okay, got to learn what they want from you.the hardest part is doint to many thing at once, they pay is great. i enjoy meeting new people"
good,There is so much to learn and it becomes very fun to learn new skills. Your able to work in many different areas and that is great because it keeps you from getting bored. Even after 10 years I was still learning something new everyday.
good,Worked for Wal Mart for almost 7 years which has given me the opportunity to expand my knowledge base and skill set in order to continue to grow in my career.
good,"The managers where very respectful . I learned customer service skills, team work, and also met new people, All of my co workers were very friendly and polite. The most enjoyable part of my job was providing the customers with the services that they needed."

good,Walmart is an excellent company to work for. They strive to please customers and co workers.
good,Wal-mart was a good job. Always kept you on your feet and moving. If you love working with people this is the job for you. The co-workers are great they are their to help you and learn from you as much as you learn from them. You might be labbled to work in one place but you learn it all.
good,Wal-Mart is a good company to work for. First time I ever worked for retail was when I started at Wal-Mart
good,i liked working here but it was a lot of young ppl n they were lazy so t made our job harder than it was
good,Walmart is a great company because it provides flexibility. for example you can work around your school schedule if u are attending school. If u have kids they will work with your schedules as well.
good,My job at walmart is a environment that is very productive and fast pasted. I have learned to handle situations that required a lot of patient. the most enjoyable part is to help customers daily and to work with people who have the same level of passion for there job as I do.
good,"It's overall a very friendly environment. However, my child comes first. She had been ill for a while and walmart does not accept doctors notes. It's an unethical company."
good,"I would usually go on to the floor and organize my department for the day. typically putting clothing back where it went, changing prices. When we closed up the store management and everyone else would go to departments that weren't ready to walk away and go home yet and help them organize their area so they too would be able to leave."
good,At this job i learned alot about working with those from many different cultures and backrounds. The hardest part of the job was many of the clients did not speak fluent english so it could take some time to achieve your end results. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with fellow co workers and learning about them and their cultures.
good,You learn new things and meet new people everyday. You sometimes get to work in other areas of the store.
good,"This Wal-Mart is a goal oriented company they want to make money plain and simple. I worked in one department at this store and that was it, other than being a cashier because everyone at Wal-Mart is a cashier. I stocked shelved and helped customers. Stocking is boring most of the time but you are always helping customers so that helps break it up. Helping people find what they want or need is fun."

Very open with open door policy and one can take any problem or suggestion to the proper chain of command and let their voice be heard.
good,If you are looking for a good experience and a place to try and move on up to better positions walmart is a good place. Its hard to get onto their staff but if you do dont throw away the job. great job!
good,I love to learn new things and I do it best with hands on learning. I have a large amount of customer service experience. I would not mind working in in customer service again but I'd love to learn something new and have new experience.
good,"Walmart was a job that i started just to start getting money coming in. But once i started i really liked job,customers and being a team player. I was Part-time there so i didn't have any benefits but the management was very helpful and loyal to there employees. I worked there for six years and moved on to my current position at PNC Bank.I enjoyed my time at Walmart but it was time for a change."
good,"Met a lot of new people customers as well as associates. Got some learning experience in the customer service field as far as learning how to wire money, check cashing and bill payments. Those task could benefit me in the future, as far as another job choice."

good,the ppl are nice never had a issue with anybody they treat you like family..
good,"My job at Walmart was a seasonal job. I would liked to have been hired full time, but there was not enough buisness for the company to hire all temps. Working with customers was great, I met a lot of people in the community that I haven't seen since High School. Good place to work, I would recommend Walmart to my friends."

good,I thoroughly enjoy the challenge of keeping each customer happy. The associates that I work with have become my second family.
good,Working there is alot of fun but sometimes there is not enough hours for everyone and they will send people home or only give you about 4 hours a day.
good,"Working with customers can and will always be a pain in the rear sometimes, but over all the company tries to make it a great place to work. The store I work at is a small one and no one really is leaving because they have been there for 10 + years. So advancement isn't the easiest thing to do in that store. I am hoping a transfer will be an easy transistion from one store to another and advancement will come in time."
good,This Company expects alot out of you. It pushes you to give your best at all times. Change is constant and you have to be on your game to adapt to the change. Everyday is a new one and seldom do you fall into a same day event.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for. The problem with the company is Management. Most of their managers are not adequately trained, and the company is too big to keep better track of their managers abusing the employees."

good,Fun workplace got work hands on and just a great environment to work.
good,There was a lot of teamwork displayed at Walmart. I was trained well and I enjoyed it. I was a good worker and greatly appreciated!
good,"excellent work enviorment,build relationships with everyday cutomers"
good,Nice place to work if you want to get into management. If you are looking for a part time jobs this may also be for you.
good,Very high pace job some what stressful managers need selectivity training
good,"After more then 7 years at Sams club,a company also founded by Mr.Sam Walton...a well intentioned honest man,I believe,unlike who now run empire...myself as well as my associates(I was departmental supervisor)were told we were no longer employed by Walmart and the company wanted a redirection.One of my associates was there since the club opened,14 years ago...a few others almost as long,others not nearly,but it was shocking,and handled very inhumanely.The years leading up to that day were,how shall I say,stressful,but I did enjoy my job.whatever I was asked to do,I did,for my own department,as well as others...and a lot of in between.I understand I learned a variety of jobs,use certain things(pallet jacks,texlon/box crusher..)but they way some people were spoken to,dealt with...not at all anyway anyone should be.The training some people received was not sufficient,yet there they were..thrown in to the job....and somehow managers were lacking in any people skills what so ever.That should be mandatory!They give you computer based tests to complete and comply with their company standards and state/federal also,but managers are allowed to speak and treat people like,at times,garbage!The signs in our break room spoke of respect for the individual...that should start with the higher ups no?I did enjoy my job,like I said,even through the superbly stressed holiday events(we were the demo department!) I am a people person and miss my associates,the people I worked with and our members I became so familiar with after so long,as many of my associate state too.The company,on a whole,is"
good,I loved working here! It was so fun and the patients were great. You truly get to know each and everyone of the patients and it feels like family.
good,Working here was the best financial thing that ever happened to me. I'm thankful that I work here and take pride in my job. I have learned so much working here in my seven years. Wal-mart has really set forth a great path for me and my career opportunities.
good,"At Wal-Mart I Receive, store, and issue materials, equipment, and other items from stockroom, warehouse, or storage yard. Keep records and compile stock reports. Also operator the forklift."
good,I like working for a big company because there is always something to do. It is a fast paced environment and I really enjoyed all 3 positions I held there. Claims was my favorite though.
good,"I loved the job, but the people made it less than desirable. Management did an OK job, but they were more concerned with making themselves look good than promoting a healthy work environment"
good,Would work there again; but depending on what you do or what location you work in it is designed for younger people
good,Walmart was a good place to work. I learned a lot about how to interact with customers.
good,wal mart is a really great place to work if u dnt have kids or if u have a great support of sitters they also allow room to bulid a career with them they give u a future if you want it. go for it...
good,"Walmart was a great place to work. You always had something to do even when you finished all the work you were assigned, the only thing i would say is wrong with them is there managment picks favorites."
good,"Wonderful place to work, but they only had part time positions."
good,I find myself a bit secure in the company benefits that they offer one these are purchasing a stock. helping you to save more. Incentives for employees...
good,"There is a lot of room for advancement if you wish to do retail management. If not, you may be in the wrong place of employment. The best thing to remember about retail environments such as Wal-Mart, is that the people make the place, and how much they care."
good,Great place to work.I would reccomend this company to others for employment.
good,i enjoyed my employment with wal-mart and would most definately work for them again
good,"This was one of the BEST jobs I ever had. We were like family, really. Great job, good pay. When in serious need the company does look out for their employees."
good,Loved working here!! Alot of things to do and keep you busy.
good,"Worked with schedule needs, leniency in scheduling and days off, kept on schedule. We’re sometimes bad about giving breaks and lunches on time. Overall okay employment"
good,I’ve never experienced working in such an outdated place. It really sucks because Walmart has the potential but they are dropping the ball. It’s really sad.
good,A lot of places I’ve worked had different environments and this one was by far my hardest and toughest. Working there for 2 years I’ve really learned about where I felt that was good for me to work in.
good,I am a deli associate and it is one of the most underpaid jobs at Walmart. I feel as though I am not appreciated or respected when I am at work. Good place to start but not to stay for years.
good,Options for advancement if you have enough time in the company and willing to move. Many rules and at times unrealistic goals to achieve. Mandatory computer training on a constant basis.
good,"My manager always felt the need to yell and demand orders disrespectfully and I always got points for calling out even if I had a doctors note. The pay is mediocre and if you cant work the hours they want then you wont get scheduled, also their is no holiday pay."
good,This is an excellent place to work if you can live on barely above minimum wage but most people need full time 40+ hours at minimum wage . Most ppl get 30 hrs a week.
good,Depends on store management team so will work with you and take time to help so dont.  People skills you will learn about and team leading skills with also be show to you at the store.
good,It is a decent place to work. Picked peoples groceries and put them in their car for them. Also helped customers out on the floor. Helped where needed.
good,I worked at Walmart for a year and 2 months and I obsoletely loved my job I’m a very social person I love staying active and keeping busy my favorite part about working is I got to see my friends that work with me.
good,"At first a very fair workplace. However, as time went on the management had changed for the worse. As the new management was much more strict in the sense that they would be ridiculing you over everything and anything. Eventually the staff I had initially started to work with left or had been fired due to no good reasons. Evidently this leads to this specific Walmarts downfall as they had spiraled down as their productivity has been reduced significantly. Indicated by the empty shelves all over the store ever since new management came into play."
good,The manager wanted me to work with an injury but I couldn’t so I quit we couldn’t agree on the right schedule so I had to part ways with the company we agreed things wouldn’t work out
good,"Really fun workplace, loved my coworkers. The department managers were often a lot easier to get along with than the higher ups. People definitely had a good time even while working. You couldn't stop theft unless there was a loss prevention team member working at that time, which was annoying, though policy may have changed."
good,"No set schedule, some management back me up and nice, some management target me, good coworkers. Some coworkers target me, relaxing lunch breaks, most the time can get help if needed. Etc"
good,"Working in Walmart is a great experience. However, you never get enough working hours. As a part time mostly get 12 hours per week, and if you have a full time schedule can get around 20 hours."
good,Company needs help in securing sense of direction for long term management. Policies set to standard in helping knowledge business procedure. Company  need to set performance goals.
good,"They are ok if your never sick, but their attendance policy is really strict. I felt unprepared after training, but I had help from lower level employees so it worked out"
good,"It was a nice place to work. I enjoy dealing with customers and if you treat them right and find answers to what they need they will leave happy."
good,"My son was sick for 2 days and the following week I was sick for 3 days. That is when the point system went from  8 to five points before they fired you. I talked to hr about it and had doctor's notes but they said that the doctors notes dont count,and I worked there for almost 3 years."
good,It's a good company to work for .it's just they couldn't give me the hours I wanted. The managers were friendly and worked together with other departments.This company believes in team work.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Wal-Mart although the hours vary too much. You go from too much O.T. to not enough hours! The management was fair and helpful, but don't do above your duties cause they show no advancement for it. Pay not so good but good breaks and reasonable lunch hours. Good training, nice coworkers."
good,"In my years at Walmart I have learned how to adapt to the rapidly changing tech environment. Furthermore, Walmart is the leader of modern retailing. "
good,Good place to work for young people starting out fresh. Flexible schedules makes life much easier and they offer good benefits. Overall a really good company to work for.
good,"Mucho requiere iniciativa propia"
good,"A typical day would usually go very well. I think the way they value the customer is fantastic. The management team could have been better, as they would usually just sit in groups in the office all day unless the Store Manage was around. The job to me seemed really easy and rewarding and the customers were amazing."
good,Muy buena empresa. Puedes crecer en el ambito de Administracion
good,"Trabalho em equipe, oportunidades para novos aprendizados."
good,"It was a wonderful place to work, I liked working there! Culture is great , people are nice , I worked with amazing people! And customers were awesome as well"
good,I love the job it was good but lack of mangers surport and no one tells you any thing like if the sore manger has a plan for me to do when i show up at work over night the asst mangers think they can change the game plan and the next morning the store manger yelling at you cause his plan did not happen
good,"I liked  working there by there was little communication among the managers , co workers were easy to work with, I liked the hours and also I liked helping the customers."
good,"La empresa tiene salarios bajos para la mayoría de los puestos, el ambiente laboral es complicado con las personas que ya tienen mucho tiempo en la empresa, difícilmente te quieren ayudar, prestaciones de ley más vales de despensa, uniforme, capacitaciones, planta inmediata."
good,"Pues el ambiente laboral es amigable y si necesitas ayuda, son bastantes amables en ese aspecto y sobre todo existe una bonita comunidad en trabajo en equipo"
good,"Good place to work if you don’t mind working long hours and physical work, management is good, but you need to learn who to go to for help or problem solving"
good,"•taught me work ethic"
good,"I consider my experience with Walmart to be of great value. I went to work there as an associate and advanced to become a department manager. Although growth is possible, I wish benefits were better."
good,I work for Walmart for 4 years I started off in a deli I ended up in the meat department I stopped Frozen and Dairy I also work the floor stop Zone help other departments do price changes helped out with Bakery I'm the type of person that loves to help others and get my tires done to I am such a people person I had always love my job and the people I work with I love how Walmart is a family and Walmart had taught me a lot help out community
good,"Walmart as a whole is a great company to work for with many benefits . However, at my particular store, a couple of my managers were awful to work with"
good,I love the employees and management and overall environment but just felt it was time to move to a new chapter in my life. It was a good job I worked there 2 1/2 years.
good,"I have 20 years of retail experience I have worked at tjmaxx, Walgreens, target, and I currently work at Walmart I have been with Walmart for almost three years"
good,"I enjoyed working for wal mart for the most part. It was very diversified and I enjoyed mingling with the customers. I also enjoyed getting to know my co workers, they made my job much easier"
good,You learn very quick that not everyone is very nice or will treat you will respect. You will get cussed out and no one will care. They accuse you of doing things that you didnt do
good,I was blessed to be able to work at Walmart. They provided me with work and pay and I am thankful for them. They are very understanding about your schedule and are more then happy to work with you.
good,"Recommend working at Walmart, hope to be back soon. I am now a student and would like a part time job at Walmart to supplement income while in school again."
good,This particular store is a far more friendly and manageable establishment than the last Wal-Mart store I was employed at. The staff is most helpful and management is very understandable.
good,Other coworkers are great but managment and the upper people are very hard to get a hold of and talk to. A lot of steady work and constant progress and helpful among coworkers.
good,When working at Walmart you are met with different kinds of obstacles and challenges. There’s always something new to learn. Things change in the store all the time.
good,The talent selection process is somewhat questionable.  The process to remove management from position was large part due to personal feeling instead of job performance.
good,I worked all positions in the bakery and the hours would vary from 5am-2pm to 1pm-10pm depending on the job I was doing that day. They had me in the freezer often which eventually became painful due to the cold.
good,You have to be prepared for long hours and your back hurting from the work you do and if you do not like to stand this is not the place for you . And You have to have very good interpersonal skills dealing with the customers.
good,The job I had was fast paced which I love but the management was useless. I had to keep people motivated but was very difficult because of management.
good,"Management was too overbearing and would micro manage and often criticize as well.  At times would make others feel incompetent and unworthy. I loved working at Wal-Mart, however my manager drove me away."
good,Estão  perdendo bons funcionários por má gestão. Se mudar o conceito da liderança seria a melhor empresa de se trabalhar no Brasil.
good,Walmart never gave me the correct schedule or wouldn’t give me requested days off. They would not let me have days off because of my school stuff I’m in. The majority of my coworkers were nice and very helpful.
good,Good place to work. Loved my job and coworkers. Flexible hours. Company benefits. Friendly customers and staff. Overall a nice professional atmosphere.
good,"Working as a closing cashier was pretty hard since I was the only one there until midnight, but with overnight stocking was way worse. 10pm to 7am then go home to sleep all day just to go back to work that night. But I would do it again just for the calmness and not being bothered by all the customers."
good,If you like cleaning pushing a broom it ok lots of repetitive work lots to learn contuing education they need to keep up on the equipment and supplies but all and all it’s ok
good,"Well at Walmart you have to be willing to work hard ,multitask, be able to learn new task to do new jobs. its a decent place of work and they give you a hour lunch."
good,Always something to do and areas to attend to. Most employees will be floaters and will have to go assist other employees in areas. Plenty of opportunities to succeed in if the cards are played right.
good,"way too much favoritism in pharmacy, unfair inaccuracies in training.   I  really enjoy working with a few but rest talk behind your back when you are not there.  huge turnover.  too small of work space to  not function as a team"
good,"Working for the company Walmart is in a word... easy. You simply have to come to work and take care of your tasks. After understanding the initial tasking, things can get a bit wavy after that."
good,Mainly management. They're great with hours and getting you a schedule that accommodates you but management has the habit of destroying the productivity level in the building
good,"All I did was push carts back into the store. I learned that the people that come to Walmart have no respect for the cart pushers at all. The management are Ok for the most apart, however there were a few that weren't to nice tow work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. I loved the fact that I wasn't rushed while doing my job/"
good,"It's an alright company to work for. Depends on the people there, especially the assistant managers. Some stores are nice and fun a family environemtn and some are more of a concentration camp"
good,It's a decent job for starters but it does have its moments which can be stressful at times but its okay. Working here definitely has built me a person like i can manage and do stuff better than what i could do in the past.
good,when the csm have a problem the talk to each other about it instead of coming directly to you with the problem and they come up with their own version of the truth instead of coming to you
good,"Walmart has been a good company to work for,  but has made several policy changes that I don't agree with.  And I  prefer not to commute to a place of business each day."
good,"working for Walmart was a very great experience."
good,The management could use some work and have less favorites in the workplace  staffing isn’t always great and the pay isn’t the best but it’s a pretty decent place to work especially starting out in a first job
good,Online grocery was similar to what I had done in the past with loading truck only this dealing with online grocery orders. There was decent work hours and at the time plenty of extra hours
good,"I enjoyed working here, wish they had been able to place me in a permanent location. I did more driving to other stores than I had anticipated and was difficult for me at the time (kids were young), would not be a problem if you don't have to be close by for kids, etc. I would work there again if given the opportunity."
good,"Wal-mart is a good beginning job experience that teaches you the basic. I learned what a typical job environment is like during calm and busy hours, and I learned that you just have to do your job, no complaining. Just do your job."
good,Clima organizacional bem intenso e agradável. Procedimentos com qualidade.
good,They are making changes to their policies making employees to be more responsible. Requesting time off is easy and fair. Management needs to get better at being empathic with their employees.
good,It was just a slow job for me it wasn’t hands on. I’m more of a hands on type of guy hard working man I like to sweat it just didn’t fit me as a person
good,Clima laboral favorable pero no te permiten subir de categoria
good,Es una buena empresa dirigida por un personal muy deficiente la satisfacción del cliente y el exceso de tolerancia causa desigualdad y falta de probidad entre los asociados.
good,"During my time their, hours were on the table to be made if you were willing to work. Customers in that particular area was very rough on employees probably due to past management issues, other than that it was fine."
good,"A typical day is the same, you put food on the shelves. I learned the organization of the Wal-Mart shelves. Managers were super helpful. Culture was great, everyone would help. Hardest part of the job was kneeling on the floor for the lower shelves. Most enjoyable aspect was the customers."
good,"I had a wonderful experience working at Walmart, started as cashier moved to Service Desk and finish my career as a Fresh team associate. Great job just not as flexible as I needed."
good,Walmart was had a great staff and management team everyone helped one another. the work loads however were not difficult but they expected everything to get done with a lot of distractions .
good,Most part the job is ok. I havent had a bad day yet. I love interacting with the customers an helping them get what they need. Walmart is a pretty cool job sometimes
good,Fast pasted environment with ever-changing tasks. New challenges ever day. Great team work environment. Great customer service is always provided. Flexible hours.
good,"Staying on your feet a lot and just unloading trucks and stocking merchandise."
good,"Not a hard job, alot of physical work, goodppace to learn retail. U get paid time off after 3 months of working there. They say u can move up the ladder"
good,"My typical day starts as I get up early and try to get to work at least 25 minutes before the start time. In this way, I can avoid any delay due to traffic and still be on time for work. Then, I sit down and plan my day."
good,"It was like any other job, we had good and bad days but the managers and coworkers I had made the job worth it, if you talk to your managers you can move around in the company."
good,Walmart is ok to work at if you like being surrounded by people and always being asked questions you dont have answering lots of the same questions but they did have good christmas parties
good,All and all a pretty good experience. They did stress upon speed and accuracy most of the time. I mostly enjoyed my experience there for the most part. I made alot of close friends there.
good,"some managers are more businesslike and tend to ""see past "" front end cashiers, etc,, not much verbal interaction, or negative comments; many younger customer service managers seem to help but have their own ""cliques"""
good,"Walmart was my first job, so of course I’m the beginning it was extremely nerve wracking, especially being a bit introverted, but as my time at Walmart increased, my social skills improved, and I achieved good customer service skills."
good,It was fine management just needed some tweaking. There were issues involving scheduling on a regular basis. Over staffed when it wasn't necessary understaffed when we were ridiculously busy.
good,tinha um ritimo de trabalho rápido porem muito tranquilo com respeito ao funcionario
good,"If its experience your looking for Walmart is great for people just starting out. You literately learn about everything, from business management to maintenance. You meet many people from all walks of life and you most defiantly learn and grow from your mistakes."
good,"I worked there for a few years and i enjoyed the friends i made in the yime i was there. The hours are plentiful, and most nights had variety with what i was doing. Overall a nice job to work at for a while."
good,Interacting with customers and supporting them with their financial and shopping needs can be very rewarding though sometimes challenging. Each day is different but the basics are constant.
good,"I like work at Walmart. When attending school, I was able to adjust my schedule however I needed to. The pay is not bad as compared to other companies, the work is not very hard. You will receive bonuses 3 times per year which pay out hundreds of dollars."
good,"Empresa que presa por boas práticas peca por ter alguns funcionários sem profissionalismo, de forma geral uma boa empresa."
good,As a student you get flexible shifts and the managers are really helpful. Working is fun and not stressful at all since you get ample breaks in a shift.
good,In my opinion the work experience was GreatBecause working with people I have great communication skills to work with that kind of job the management was all right and the people I work with I got along with
good,My schedule was flexible but certain tasks were sometimes difficult. They allowed you to stock and work many different areas so it helped in avoiding monotony.
good,"It was fun. Nice exciting cool awesome. Blah, blah, blah, blah. We had a pretty nice diversity. The customer service was pretty nice. And I liked working there."
good,Decent job to work at very fast paced job have to clear assembly line at a certain pace. The pay is nice if you like 11 per hour management needs improvements
good,Is a great place to work and learn new tasks..always has new challenges that keep the job interesting and fun. Can work your way up the chain of command if you are reliable and hard worker.
good,"Great work environment, work-life balance. Extends a lot of support to employees to help them do their best at work. I recommend Walmart as a work place."
good,"Typical day at work is simple and repetitive. Be prepared to deal with customers. Management was distant and often availabilities and weekly hour constraints are ignored. I often had to reach out in order to get this fixed.  The Human Resources at the Walmart I worked for were very helpful and were willing to work with me when I experienced a death in the family. Overall, not a bad place to work, but always expect to be short on staff."
good,Real relaxed and easy company to work for. Employees have room to do what they want as well as staying on task and helping customers throughout the store. With the high turnover rate due to a new attendance policy most associates work crazy weekly schedules that aren’t always the best for them.
good,"The store I worked at in Salem, MO was amazing  I loved the people, the managers  and the customers. Everyone listened to your needs, your stories. It was really just a great place to work. Now in Lima,  OH; We were greatly understaffed with high work demands. Some people made a difference there, but everyone was stressed. We made the most of what we could!"
good,Not bad place to work but I will say they should pay at least 15hr instead of 12.90 is more work two mans job not so easy to move up you only problem will bill management not giving hours need more pay and them not wanting to move you up in your position
good,"I've had my ups and downs working for the store.  The store manager is very open to hearing what you have to say, just have to find time to talk to him."
good,I loved working here.  They didn't follow my availability witch was frustrating but still worth working there.  I would love to work for Walmart again.
good,Working here was one of the longest and skillful opportunity I was given. I managed to work well with others and had the opportunity to change locations and my job title. If I were given the chance to go back to work for them I will be glad too.
good,Overall I did like working at Walmart.  My main concern was pay. Although 11 an hour to start is good for the job. The more you learn and job responsibilities change no more pay. I left on good terms and would go back. I left right before the yearly raise came but did hear it was .29 per hour.
good,It is a great company to work for. It is flexible with my hours and I love the PPTO that they have started. It come in handy a lot. And the work environment is good
good,This was a good place and you had some good days and bad ones but other than that is was good overall. I would say as long as you work hard and stay focused you can get your job done and still have some chill time if needed.
good,I enjoyed working with the people and getting experience with registers and more customer service skills. I learned a lot about stocking and how things are brought into the store.
good,"Through my whole experience working at Walmart, I was able to work and improve my customer service skills and be able to work in a fast pace environment especially on days where sales were about and when weekends came along. Which I became more open and approachable towards customers that needed assistance when a manager was not around."
good,"Laid back culture, not very good at communicating goals of the company. There was constant change and sometimes that was good and other times it seemed as if the company didn't know which way it was going."
good,I really enjoy working at WalMart. They work with me scheduling hours as a second job. I have had advancement opportunities which I have taken advantage of.
good,I enjoy my job as a technician and love the people I work with. its not an easy job but it's worth it. My management team is great! They work with me through everything that I need!
good,"Best place to learn initial step for new job."
good,Benefits are not to bad. Possibility of moving up in company if you let management know of your interest and if you have been on time for your shifts and no call in’s. Knowing some Spanish and or English would be a benefit to you.
good,everyone is very helpful most times althought management can be hard to get a hold of and an average day is usually routined but you may have to deal with difficult customers
good,Great place to work with awesome career opportunities. I mostly enjoyed working with a diverse group of individuals. Was able to learn a lot from their journey through the company and how to navigate through difficulties.
good,Nice place to work good atmosphere and work environment nice customers you might get a bad egg every now and then.overall it's fun and you never know who you might meet
good,The hardest part of the job is getting everything done by the end of your shift. Management has high expectations for employees and there never satisfied with work performance.
good,i liked working for Walmart at the start. Then new mangers started and things when down hill. would like to have stayed with them but not with the managers that are there.
good,"Walmart Pharmacy policy and proceedures are focused on keeping the company and patients safe.  It is important to understand those policies and procedures.  Walmart Culture is ever-changing and requires frequent information updates."
good,"I enjoyed this job worked with a cool group of people and management, only left because I had 3 other jobs and hadto cut some hours to make more family time at home"
good,Lugar calmo apesar da correria para repor mercadoria na loja e a quantidade de cliente que circula.
good,I love working for the company and making my workers and customers smile daily. The hardest part of my job is trying to maintain every area in the store while being the only front supervisor scheduled.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people and the smiles after a warm welcome and good customer service.
good,It’s a great company to work for. Management isn’t the greatest. They say they will work with you and they don’t. Working at Walmart has its good days and it has its bad days
good,Starting pay is good and you get what you put in. If you show up on time and work your hardest you will be promoted if you are willing to transfer to a different store.
good,"Trabalhar na empresa Walmart  faz você  crescer pessoalmente e profissionalmente,te ensina a lhe dar com todas as situações  para um crescimento interior e emocional."
good,"Its walmart, its not a career unless you intend to keep moving up the ladder to upper management and play the political games. Fast employment and great as a first job or if you cant find work."
good,Working at Walmart was an easy routine to get into and make apart of you life.  The many moving parts of the Walmart backroom was often hectic with much needing to be done in a short amount of time.  It wasn't too hard to adapt to situations which occurred but it was slightly difficult to grasp unfamiliar parts of the job as they focus you where you strive until needed elsewhere.
good,Must be adaptable and quick on your feet. You can move up and grow your career. You can transfer locally or across the country and there are many new opportunities in on line services and pick up today.
good,"Basic hard work, thought cause of the overnight part. You can move up if you try hard enough. Some coworkers are not friendly, that's a warning. Watch out."
good,I would push carts inside the store and if someone need help with their thing I would help them and help take it to their car and things like that and drive the electric carts in the store
good,"I think Walmart is a good job, they need to work on point the system.They also have good benefits the longer you work there the better the benefits are."
good,Walmart is an awesome company and will work around your schedule if your still attending school or etc.. The benefits are absolutely great and the bonuses as well
good,Learned new things remodeling the store . Helpful supervisors . Doing modules keep me pretty focus on the task at hand . There was always something to be done there
good,"I got along with most of the management but a lot of them had favoritism issues. The job itself was easy and fun because all of the co workers were very friendly. the job itself isn’t hard , common sense. i made a lot of close friends out of my co workers and some managers. the pay wasn’t bad either, i really enjoyed the company."
good,I liked working there but I had medical issues. I had got approved for FMLA but they still let me go never bother to call and say something Instead I was told by my FMLA agent
good,"The cashier and customer service aspects of the job are, in general, pretty simple and easy to learn. Most of the other employees are very helpful in learning new things and the workplace is very easy to integrate into. Management is often inconsistent and dysfunctional, however. This makes it very difficult to perform tasks smoothly or obtain adequate information about tasks or advancement opportunities. They are fairly flexible with hours and have decent pay. However, it is not uncommon to go several days (even weeks) without any scheduled hours. While it is possible to pick up hours, they're taken very quickly, and often there are not enough to make up for the lack of hours given. I would recommend Walmart to someone struggling to find a job, but to use caution. They do take notice of employees who intend to work there long-term as well as employees interested in moving into management (they prefer to promote form within, which is nice)."
good,"Good job if you like interacting with the public. Make sure you know all the sick rules or if you're in the hospital and can't come in, they can fire you if you don't give them notice for 3 missed days in a row. Also beware of coachings and what they mean, they can keep you from advancing in the company. They don't even tell you about them till it's late and goes on your file for a year! Ok work if you can keep up!"
good,Despite what you may hear Walmart really wasnt a bad place to work i really enjoyed my time there and if things were different I would still be there.
good,I’m bilingual Spanish as first language English as second language! I like to help people! Team work and I’m a hard working!  Always available to work in any department any time !
good,I can say during the 18 Years of working for this company I have learned a lot in order to get me to where I am today as a leader. The company has changed throughout the current years and I felt it was time to further my career with another company. I wanted to try something different other than retail but more so where I can help others in the healthcare field.
good,"At first the job was good. the pay, benefits, and raises made a hard work worth doing. After a while the raises got smaller and eventually ended and the chance to be promoted got more difficult, making it less desirable."
good,Work is good very stressful but the work and job life is very hard you work a lot but still get no thanks for the job you do the management appreciate their staff but store manager at least in that store does not
good,"The management was terrible, i could go days without talking to a single manager. someone died while i was working there and they didn't know for a few days. other than that the work is fine, customers are fine and the job wasn't hard work for the pay."
good,Walmart is a great place to work for someone who enjoys retail work and is a great people person. If you are good with extremely cold parts. This is the position for you. But it is not for me.
good,"I was working at the Hillsborough,NC Walmart as a remodel associate in 2018."
good,I really love it an will do it again if I had the   Chance u get great benefits an meet some really nice people if u are a peoples person this the job for u
good,It was cause u had to think on the go all the time and the customers were some of the nicest and some were kinda rude but all in all it was fun working for them
good,I loved my job until last 5 yrs. we be more people who want to work at this company! There are a lot looking for other jobs right now. Some managers don’t even seem happy with their jobs.  Moral just seems to get lower and lower.
good,Being a receiver at walmart is a very high paced and physical position. It involves unloading trucks and scanning merchandise into inventory. Receiving is a very important position to help prevent shrink.
good,"It’s a decent job to have for a few years. Sometimes work and school would conflict, but other than that it, it pays well, I get enough hours, and I get along with the vast majority of people that work there."
good,"Hours given were consistently to work late nights.  Working with customers was always a joy as I am a people person.  But the hours were long standing on your feet the entire time.  Not good for someone with back problems.  However, I would work there again and also recommend it to others for employment."
good,"Toman represalias ante nuevas ideas, denigran a subordinados y no aceptan opiniones diferentes"
good,As a self-checkout host all you do is Assist customers with checkout procedures as well as prevent loss. Very easy and also very boring job. Must be okay with standing on your feet doing nothing for long periods of time.
good,"Dont be lazy "
good,Too many managers telling Associates what to do when they don't have a clue what the previous shift manager has told associate to do. They need to be aware of and listen to employees and what they were told to do previously it was just too many managers for each Dept. There was alot of chaos while working for so manyforsomanymanagers who didn't even know what was going on in my Dept. Loved my job
good,I learned how to stock the shelves. I also learned that it was easy to stock the shelves. It was hard work on the body. The management for overnights were nice.
good,Walmart was a fast-pace environment that was always focused on meeting our goals. There was always days where we have to go above and beyond on what when had to accomplished. The hardest part of the job was having 2-3 trucks constantly during the week where we would have no room to put things anywhere. The best part of the job was meeting new coworker who made the job more fun and relaxing to continue going to.
good,This company has the most flexible hours and the management will help you if you are unsure about. The customers are mostly understanding. The paid fits the job given.
good,Walmart can be a stressful environment for anyone who isnt used to multitasking. You will be expected to do a multitude of diffrent jobs each day and you will have to do jobs not in the section you were hired for. I recommend having experience with costumer service and independent multitasking.
good,"Working at Walmart is a friendly work environment, we are the only Walmart that is open majority of the year. It tends to get busy near rush hour and dinner time but over all a great place to get some experience for a part time job. As a self checkout attendant it does get difficult to assist some customers when it gets busy, but we eventually provide them with the assistance they need."
good,Working at Walmart is all depending on who and what kind of Management team you have. I worked hard and was mistreated while I worked there and would tell different people to work there at your own risk. Know the Management team before working there.
good,"I loved getting to know the till, I enjoyed ringing in costumers products and bagging them. I also loved being able to make some people at least smile during my shift. I however preferred working on an actual till instead of the express lines which some of my co-workers thought was weird."
good,It was a solid job.  It was a relatively easy position.  I had a hard time receiving training while I was there due to the fact that I didn't work with the manager that much.
good,Good people and reasonable as well. I have no problem working fast Pace with them. Also the are very respectful. They make sure you succeed also. Very good company.
good,"Minha avaliação é boa, tive ótimos chefes e aprendi muito, trabalhei na frente de caixa, atendimento ao cliente e por final auxiliar de perecíveis (padaria)."
good,Was a good job easy and very nice workers only thing that you had to make sure was that everything is always fresh and greet the customers and helo them with problems
good,"Company is great, many options for advancement and relocation. There is however very little work life balance options. Never have major holidays off, so don't plan the day with your family."
good,Every day is different helping people receive money and send money pay their bills get the check cashed doing returns trying to keep everyone happy. Keep area neat
good,The people I work with care and are supportive they try to help however they can and the store managers really care about the customers and employees both
good,"Deli needed help, alot of workers wete not pulling thier weight. The compny has since hired new people. They do offer benifits however the benefits cost employee too much..other companies like tyson simmons and hills all offer better medical dental and vision.."
good,"The store I work for is a good one! I have never worked for walmart before but other I work with have, and say by far our store is the better ones to work for. I wish the company paied more an hour then what it does, but I guess being In the south that's a lot per hour compared to some jobs. Over all i am happy, i just need to get used to being on your feet 8 hours aday@ccx!"
good,I thought the job was a team effort thing. Put merchandiser in the right section that it goes in and then I took the merchandise to the sales floor and put the merchandiser away
good,"Depending on which locations you go to it can be good, horrible or just awesome. I've worked at 2 and had 2 completely different experiences. 1 was great work hard and move up get bonuses. The other was gossip, drama and horrible."
good,I have worked at Walmart for about 10 years and I enjoy what I do there.  It has helped me grow as an individual but it offers little advancement opportunity.
good,"A regular day of work would all ways start great and finish off better. What I learned is that helping others out even if it don't benefit me is the best feeling ever. The management at Wal-Mart was really understanding and flexible with employees.The workplace culture was really friendly and welcoming. I wouldn't say the hardest , but the most challenging part of the job was to always be aware of my surroundings because when I would be pushing carts I would have to be aware I don't hit a customer neither do I hit a customers car. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see the customers happy about their needs and able to satisfy them as they left the store."
good,"I would say working for Walmart wasn’t a bad experience. I did have a problem with management because they would sometimes ask the impossible of its employees or not understand the point of view what the employees were trying to tell them or give the employees what they needed to complete their tasks. I did enjoy working with everyone because everyone was very helpful, talkative, fun to work with and easy to work with."
good,Many tasked to complete.  Must stay focuses and organized.  Must be willing to help customers and have a positive attitude.  Must be willing to do many different jobs.
good,Just do your job and you will be fine until someone wants your job and will do anything to get you fired from there .................….....................
good,It's not to bad. As long as you come in every day with a bring it to win it attitude. Stay focused on the tasks your are given. And always try to go the extra mile.
good,"Lugar de trabajo seguro, buen ambiente laboral, capacitación constante."
good,"WalMart has a set way of doing things that gets updated as new ideas are attempted.  Associates don't always agree with the changes, but most work out or are changed again for the better."
good,"At first I didn’t like working here.   I came from being an assistant manager to being a cashier.   I can’t stand in one place and ring items all day.   I wanted to leave but my manager asked me if there was anything that he could do to get me to stay.  I said yes, change my job code to self-checkout host.   And he did."
good,"I think theres a lot they could improve on. They're a company I would not work for again. Very good money, but not worth the stress you have to deal with."
good,"Walmart is walmart. High paced, high stress working in management. High focus on knowing your business numbers with regional and market teams. Overall rewarding experience when plans come to fruition"
good,"Learned a lot here , met a lot of nice people , always drama tho , other then that Walmart was a fun two year experience for me . I wouldn’t go back tho."
good,I had problems with some of the managers there. When the managers are bad that brings the moral of the store down. It made me feel like I didn't want to be there anymore. Walmart as a company is a good company to work for. It is certain stores that is not good.
good,Empresa boa de trabalhar cultura americana de trabalho
good,"not a bad place to wrk co worker are very helpful, i would recomand people to work walmart , walmart have alot of opertunity for it employee i have work walmart for 2 years"
good,"The company was fine, it was more about walmart and its policy. And the industry of the store, I enjoyed working at the location I was at. I would recommend this to someone in need of a first job."
good,"Walmart is pretty good about giving anyone an opportunity to advance. In just a year and a half I was able to become a csm at the age of 19. It is a very stressful place to work though, always seems to be understaffed and you are not allowed to have overtime. And the stress only seems to get worse the higher up you get promoted. Once becoming an assistant manager you become salaried, which isn’t too bad of pay for what you start at. The yearly pay rais isn’t much though. They do offer paid time off, insurance, 401K, and stocks."
good,"WalMart pushes its employees to cover multiple jobs because they cut out those other jobs in order to pay you more. They pay very fairly, and you get two 15 minute paid breaks and an hour unpaid break, and you can accrue pto and ppto in case you have to call out. The hardest part of the job is getting the job done in the time allotted because they'll have one person doing five people's jobs. However, the people you work with for the most part are fun and it's a group effort to where they'll help you because they'll need help one day and you'll be there to help them, like a functioning family."
good,"A typical day meant a lot of walking and doing everything as fast as you could. I learned my value as a human being. Aside from that, I learned to pick my food better and a few tricks when buying stuff. The management was nice, but I think I was lucky to have a good boss. The workplace was fun and team oriented, with a few lemons along the way. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is that is not fit for a long term career."
good,"People were great to work with and customers were always nice and friendly. Management was super bad, were not very understanding of medical issues, had to quit because of that. Other than that, I would recommend it for students looking for part time work. Very easy."
good,"I enjoy the many people I work with. My supervisor is seems to busy, to stop and say Hi, or hello.  My CSM,s are busy also, but it,s part of there job,  So, but I stay positive, cheerful, hopeful, my customers tell me thank you for bagging there groceries in a thoughtful way.  They really appreciate what I do, and that is why I like working there."
good,"The first few days on the job can be very hectic only because you are just thrown into the fire, but once you get it all down it becomes pretty routine with a few variation here and there"
good,I absolutely love my job. I look forward to going into work each day. My only problem is Walmart rents you out sorta speak. I spend more time working in other store viruses my own.
good,"A great energetic, fast pace place to work. There are oppertunities to advance in the company. It's a great for students, they are pretty flexible with the schedule. You will get customers of all sorts, a great smile and a polite disposition is needed."
good,"My experience with Walmart has had it's ups and downs just like any other job. This job in particular is great as a part time job however, sometimes it was a hassle to get organization consistent in order to preform your job effectively."
good,Es un buen trabajo pero de poca paga pero con buen conjunto de trabajadores
good,Why does a start hire who every they feel like to base on no skills at all it’s not right because people who actually work hard & have great skills get not credit
good,"The job itself was easy,but MGMT made it hard to work there.they made u cut any extra hours u had, after they told you u can keep the extra hours. The company benefits were nice to have and helped when u got sick or injured."
good,Work environment could be less political. Social ladder is hard to climb without knowing people already or having been there for a long time. Seems to be generally a daunting place to start.
good,Good place to start out. Lots of hours standing though. For a little extra cash this is a good place to start. I started at 6pm and ended at 4am. Long day
good,It was some heavy lifting at times you had to be fast past. After stocking everything you have to do this thing called zoning witch essentially just means pulling Items to the front to look good
good,"Walmart has taught me how to be and relate to ""regular folks"" following my long career in the ""ivory tower"" as a college professor at a major university."
good,"Variety of task from customer service to cashiering, front counter greeter aiding customers with product services, fabric products along with arts and crafts with professional attitude"
good,Entry level: great opportunities for a beginner with room for advancement. Fast paced environment with flexible schedules. Friendly staff and great people to work with: always updating and progressing forward.
good,Good stable company with many oportunititees for advancement. Managment does pick favorites and offers little assistance. Some have set schedules while others change week to week holidays
good,"This job is good for what it is, if you dont have high expectations it is a good place to work. Management is decent and hours are good. The company had opportunities to grow if that's what your looking for."
good,The pay was ok and the management was ok but they didn't really be nice to me when it came to needing to get off work. I loved it when the customers came up and talked to me and said thank you as I was a cartpusher. I was always complimented.
good,Over all the opportunity was worth the time and the experience was great. They was good and they all knew how to treat others with respect. They was also good with making the customers a priority.
good,"Empresa meritocrática, precisa apenas rever políticas de salários e benefícios"
good,It is a good job overall with plenty of opportunity for advancement.  The expectations can be unrealistic.  There is never enough help.  Your availability determines your hours and can be as much as you need within reason.  The people who work with you are  great along with most of management.
good,Faily relaxed job as long as you keep busy. Everyone keeps to themself enless you need help. Co workers are friendly and willing to help. Leads or managers or very busy. Interesting guest.
good,I liked the stocking job. But the 3rd shift time did not work out for me. Also did not get full weekend off at all. Coworkers were helpfull to work with.
good,The overall company was a good company to work for benefits and pay was very good. certain managers gave good hours certain didn't. pay was very good.
good,"This is my first official job and it has been good so far. Good starting pay, relaxed dress code, straightforward work, good break and lunch time. Only downside is their attendance system"
good,"The job was what you would expect unload a truck and separate into departments, then work the stock to the shelves while assisting customers. It is a physically active job that doesn't pay enough for the labour and they only seemed to have hours around back to school time."
good,"You can move up in the company if you show yourself to be punctual, hardworking and motivated . It has managers that are good with people and very good at their job and others that lack the people skills to do their job effectively."
good,"It is good. A little stressful. They ask you to stay over if things aren’t done and then tell you to leave early the next day because they do not want to give over time. If you want to upgrade in departments, the wait to be interviewed is long and it’s usually months before you hear something. Some of the bosses can be great."
good,A empresa permite crescimento profissional e fornece treinamento necessário.
good,Fast paced environment.  Need to be able to multi task. Takes a long time to move up. Friendly multi cultural staff. Work life balance could improve....Associates should not have to work so many closes unless only available for said hours
good,I worked for walmart on speedway for 5years overnight unwanted change so I put in two week notice and had another job lined up left on good terms was able for re hire
good,"Good flexible workplace, chance of advancement.   Enjoyed the management, great work environment.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a fast pace environment, never a day a same."
good,"I worked at a super center, so my job was to stock shelves, keep track of inventory and attend to customers. I learned how to interact with customers, and strong time management skills. There isn't much of a workplace culture. Sometimes people would sit with each other at lunch time. The hardest part are the inconsistent hours and work load. I loved working there because I go to learn what type of shifts I liked and I was constantly busy."
good,They are ok to work for.They don't pay enough and you don't get the hours you want.The company over all was good.Some of the management were not very friendly and didn't treat their employment good sometimes.
good,My job is fast paced and it never lets up. In the mornings we can come in with 200+ orders to fill and 2500+ items to locate and retrieve for the customer.
good,Walmart is great place to start a career . They have many different opportunities to move up in the company. They love to move up with the company.  You have to be able to be able to be versatile.
good,"Every day was something different, at the end of the day it was all about the customer, from time tot time they do recognize you for work performed and provide employees with quarterly bonuses."
good,It had it ups and downs. You will have to deal with all types of customers. you would either put a smile on their faces by asking how their day was. Over all your day went on how based on your mood and how you would deal with people.
good,I began my walmart career with being hired as a walmart sales associate in electronics. I started out part time and worked my up to full in a couple years by learning how to learn new responsibilities and adapt to difficult situations.
good,I like the job. But it’s hard to move up to other positions because there’s barely any openings. The hours are inconsistent unless your a manager for a department.
good,"a day at work is greeting customers, ask how their day is and keep conversation going, clean aisle and restock items. I've learned accounting and unloading/ loading cards. fast paced environment. most enjoyable part of the jon is encountering customers."
good,Walmart wasn’t an easy job all the time but being a a cashier was pretty slow at times I wasn’t a fan of some of the CSM most of them were only a year or two older than you and they didn’t take things very seriously.
good,In my position I enjoy what I do but at times it is very stressful and we at times have more to get done than we have staffing for. Not all work as a team but hoping that changes from what has been said. When I started working for the company I loved it and I love it now just think that corporate does not properly give us the scheduling hours we need to cover every area at the store which in return cause animosity between everyone.
good,"It can be better, starting with management. If you are not looking to stay long term or if your vision is something bigger, do not do it. Yes, the starting pay is fair but it is only beneficial to you if you get your full 40 hours every week. They unexpectedly cut hours so be ready for that, and they do not allow overtime unless management approves of it. It's a job to get you on the track for something better but not long term  unless you are trying to advance in the retail field."
good,"Can bet a little hectic, especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas. I have not worked there in years. The environment is most likely completely different from my experience. Pointless required review."
good,"It was a good job, indeed. But only due to the poor management and cutting my hours. I had no choice but to leave. If they were to replace all management and start over, I would go back to that job in a heart beat. I had a good 401k going, great hours and great hourly pay. It’s worth getting a job there."
good,Overall a great company with some great benefits and advancement opportunities. Terribel work life balance and it continues to get worse. Under going large changes for the next year. Management hours are a killer and depending on who your upper management is they lack people skills.
good,"Customer service can be challenging enough, but adding a heavy work load makes it even more challenging. Not having enough staff can really make it difficult to juggle both productively."
good,"Overall Walmart is a great place to work, but it may be difficult because Walmart only mainly hires part time employees. This means no benefits. Also it may be hard to move up in certain stores."
good,Great place to be and work if you're into fast pace and customer service. My experience with them was different. I would recommend them as a place to work.
good,"I had good supervisors, managers, and human resource management. They were good to me when my daughter passed away by being there for me when I just needed someone to talk to."
good,I worked for this company for 18 years and it was o.k.  I was happy each day that I was there. I felt comfortable working there and having the ability to help others.  I also enjoyed the repoire that I would build with some of my co workers and upper management.  I  really liked going to work each day.   I would recommend it to anyone who likes people and the environment of the store. The hardest part of the job was to be stuck on the phone for hours on end.
good,repetition of duties including but not limited to inventory and stocking.. interaction with customers in assisting of locating store items.. alot of repetition.
good,I worked in the pharmacy for 10 years. It was educational and fast paced. There were times that it was fun but a lot of the times it was overwhelming.
good,I just wanna be comfortable at the work place I just do not like getting in trouble for stuff I can not control and I love over time and I strive to be on time
good,Walmart is a great first job. Wouldn't recommend making walmart a career. Walmart is a good stepping stone to build your member service also has other positions to grow .
good,"Wal-mart is the definition of a typical retail job. You will stock shelves from overstock product in the back of the store. You will discover that someone either plugged the shelves with incorrect product, or that someone set up the plan-o-gram for the shelves wrong and that the product does not have a home on the shelf, which is why there is so much over stock of it. You will need to provide customer service, whilst at the same time trying to figure out why there is either too much or too little of a product on hand."
good,"Ok place to work, love my job but get tired of dealing with customers. After 18 years the customers and changes in policies are very wearing on a person."
good,You have to learn quickly and be very productive in this fast paced environment. It was a good place to learn a variety of different jobs and working in a variety of states.
good,"Walmart is a big company And there "
good,Days are always hard and stressful with management never really appreciating your work. The most enjoyable part of my job is when i finish my hard day's work and I feel accomplished.
good,Loved it . Loved associating with the employees in the customers . Love helping customers find the right items they looking for just to make They day even better
good,"I would recommend this job to friends or family who are looking for a decent paying job and don’t mind hard physical labor. I excelled at my job here, but opportunity was very slim."
good,"I love working with the people I work with also enjoy most of our customers,  management is ok to work with you have to understand that sometimes they are under pressure. And that you are there to work not make friends."
good,Working for Walmart is fun but they don’t care about employees if you part time you are not entitled for no benefits they don’t give much opportunity on growth
good,"Your only job is to push carts, all day u look at the parking lot and nothing else. The carts arent heavy, but they want u to use a machine anyway. Notva difficult job either."
good,Walmart is a decent place to work at. It's like any other job you have your good and your bad. The pay and benefits is also decent. I would go back if the opportunity came a long
good,I’ve been here for four years and I’ve had two different positions. The company is changing so promotions are becoming harder to come by but overall it’s a good job. Pay is decent and I receive paid time off and discounts. The scheduling isn’t great though I pretty much work a different shift everyday but there are some people who have set hours.
good,The location I work at has great employees. The leadership can leave you wanting sometimes. I don't know if it is at the direction of home office that they are not allowed to be up front and truthful when it comes to changes or it is his personal decision.
good,Wishing it was a better job and better pay with all the experience I have encountered. Great people and great atmosphere. Management needs to be changed and pay needs to be raised with people who have worked their for over a year.
good,"Hard to move up and get promoted unless you are a suck up"
good,"As a service desk associate its best to be quick, concise, thorough, able to multitask and able to count and keep track of sometimes very large amounts of cash. The job also requires standing for long periods of time."
good,Easy environment to work . No experience need to work at Walmart..  All departments are easy. Keep doing your job and you will exceed in the company..
good,It was quite an experience 😉. Them company it’s self is actually pretty good. Just like any other hobbit had it’s rough patches but they more then happy to fix you problems right away
good,"Fast paced, at times competitive. Good benefits, good training. Communication can be hit and miss. But very helpful and friendly employees. Decent hours."
good,"Most Walmart stores are very welcoming and treat their people well. However, in smaller stores, advancement is impossible unless you know the right people and whether or not they personally like you."
good,Hours aren't guaranteed unless you're full time. It can be slow paced or it can be fast pased. They're are numerous jobs you can do in the stores. They probably have something closet to the area to what you want to work.
good,"Buena Cultura Laboral"
good,"Wal-Mart has probably been my favorite job so far!! I worked as a Fresh Cap 1 Team Member and it was awesome!! The hours were from 4am-1pm. The only downside to me was they got more strict on their attendance policy. You're only able to miss up to 4 days in 6 months. And u have to aquire sick days, u dont automatically get them. Hopefully they will make it a little less strict"
good,It’s a fine place. Definitely more professional than working at a fast food restaurant or the mall and their starting wage is better than most. I just wish the raises were better and it was a little bit more fun of an environment to be in.
good,Used a headset & Center Rider Machine to move around facility to pick preferrred items for customer Orders. Lifted & stacked up to 60 lb. boxes on a pallet(s) per customer's request.
good,Working at Walmart has it's highs and lows.  It is very fast paced and I spend plenty of time on my feet and lifting heavy items.  The downside is the extended amount of time I spend on my feet.
good,"Walmart was the only job I had that had nice employees. Also Walmart was the first job to teach me how to stock, I liked working at Walmart just was a temporary job for me that is why I left."
good,"A typical day t work would consists of moving shelves, replacing products, building counters to place merchandise on. The hardest thing about the job was the shift. I worked overnight therefore it was a bet challenging"
good,stock more stock fun fun fun fun stock more more more food apples tomates go go gog gog lolol hat hat for more to go plain plain good alsome bybybyby cool
good,Made employee of the week was reward a day of choice off was lead unloader Was recognize by several people for outstanding service and was able to quickly asset them with there needs in store
good,"As with any mega-company, upper level management is completely out of touch with reality in the day-to-day operations locally in each of the areas they operate, that being said management job duties expectations coworkers and pay are unique to each individual store"
good,"Very fast paced as a personal shopper, although, I am sometimes overly stressed. But when we are fully staffed I do really enjoy this job. You can also choose your own availability."
good,Walmart is a great company to work for plenty of opportunities for advancement. I think many young people would benefit from the Walmart working environment. Would learn work skills as well as people skills.
good,"I loved talking to the customers! The managers there are cool, and will try and help the best way they can. Wish I  had better hours. They pay is ok, definitely a stepping stone kind of job."
good,"The culture is overall friendly. you time is pretty busy, there always work that can be done. there are opportunities for progression. it really depends on your store location"
good,"I worked graveyard shift and had to clean the store over night and deal with any customers that came into tue store, it was a very relaxed environment, very friendly people, there was an issue with one of the night managers but she quickly got replaced by someone much better."
good,I would recommend Walmart to those who are looking for more of a career  type job.  Also have a flexible schedule. To anyone who can take stress and still perform good customer service.
good,"Walmart was a nice job. They paid well , and always made sure I knew what I was doing. Other employees were very nice . They do have a few problems that was hard to get around. They worked with my extracurricular activities a little ."
good,I actually really liked this job but I had a long drive an was not earning enough to live off of by the time I calculated my gas out of my check now they pay more so I could see myself going back!
good,"Es una empresa muy retadora la cual permite que llegues más lejos, a través de la diversidad de inclusión, y sobretodo te ayuda a desarrollar siempre las áreas de oportunidad que puedas ir presentando a lo largo de tu vida laboral es una empresa que en lo personal me ayuda mucho a generar buenas ideas para gestionar mis funciones e irlas explotando al máximo, tiene un enfoque 100% al liderazgo."
good,"I like my job and my customers, but I'm afraid anything I say will incriminate me and forfeit my job. I have nothing further to state. I've been with the company over 7 years."
good,"i honestly don't mind Walmart too much, i am a people person and i know how to talk to them. Sometimes customers were crazy but they usually calm down by the end of me helping them. My job was to return items, pay bills, sent money to different counties and for me the job was easy but differently not for everyone"
good,"My experience at Walmart, I’ve had great experience. You have opportunity to move up in company quickly. But the work place can be very fast paced  also. But overall nice company to work for."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy helping or guiding customers in the right direction according to what they need on site in a timely manner . Amen to that.
good,"Somethings need to be prioritized more than others and taken seriously. Also need to remember that saying, ""If something isn't broken don't try to fix it."" 😉"
good,"I enjoy working for the company. My management team are great to work with. Everyday I learn more and more, which helps with my growth in the company."
good,"making a customer worry behind and safety on the road."
good,I have enjoyed working for Walmart and all the opportunities that were afforded me in the form of advancement and experience. I am ready now for other opportunities and experiences as well as new people and new areas of learning. I look forward to meeting new people and soaking in every experience offered to me.
good,"I give my 100 percent on my job I am a people person I’ve worked in the deli , bakery, done mods, claims . I respect my surpieror and other associates I believe in team work I’m willing to show new associate the procedures I will be the first one to compliment on a good job done"
good,Great people to work with. Some management can be tough to work with. With everything changing right now a lot of unassured associates. Scheduling if you not a supervisor can be a hard balance.
good,Boa mas ainda tem muito que crescer mas está no caminho certo
good,"The job was fairly simple and fun at times . You get to meet different people from all walks of life . It can get stressful on very busy days and holidays are hectic but you are trained to do your job so nothing too bad. Sometimes there would be only 3-4 cashiers and you would take forever to get a break in, but overall I would go back if I could. Pay was good. Hours were good. Just the right job at the wrong time."
good,Nothing wrong just do your job! And assistance those in need. Seriously I'm done no uniform and wear jeans. You get everything is one place seems like.
good,"It was alright, paid well but many coworkers were disrespectful or made me feel like they’re out to get me. management was unorganized and stressful but it’s wasnt too bad, i’d work at a walmart again."
good,"People love Walmart. Even when they have reasons not to come back, after a while you remember you need to go pick some fresh produce. Devoted workers."
good,Walmart was one's nice company wen i started the job 23 years ago but after so many years the company change for the bad to many changes according to the company
good,There is a few rhings that would make the experience better if they changed but it's like any other job yoy go to work because you need the pay check so there is not much to complain about.
good,My experience at Walmart wasn’t entirely awful. I loved my customers most were nice. The only thing I would complain about is a few of the managers some are totally evil. They will work you to the ground. I could never get any holidays off. Great benefits and even bonuses.
good,Responsible for restocking products in the grocery department. I often get switched around for which part of the grocery I am responsible for restocking on any given day. Am currently in the candy department.
good,The difference is in management amd how we would help the community not tand how management can do things there way. We should work as a team. They don't communicate well to employees and it is important on customer service to have good communication and unifying the employees not dividing them without explaining things. Change is nnecessary.but the right and positive
good,very fast based and busy work but relaxed as to how coworkers interact with each other. some of the management seemed to have favorites. some of the managers didnt seem like they had the personality for their role.
good,"Es un buen ambiente, algo demandante respecto al tiempo y a saber cón exactitud lo que tienes que entregarle al cliente, los jefes y gerentes te ayudan en lo que pueden, pero el pago es bajo para el riesgo que se corre al dispensar medicamento"
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is my coworkers. They are like family. I enjoy customer service so in my role as a customer service supervisor I get to interact with them on a daily basis
good,"During my time at Walmart, I met alot of outstanding people who were really dedicated about their jobs. My manager and direct supervisor were super cool! Overall, I’d say this is a great first REAL job experience for me."
good,I have worked for Walmart about 5 years in plenty of different departments. I have enjoyed my time at Walmart and have made a lot of good connection with coworkers. I’ve been promoted and I’ve learned different sides of the business.
good,"I worked here as an overnight stocker and felt that the work load was fairly excessive, but the managers seemed to understand, therefore the environment wasn't bad. Pay could be better but it is to be expected being that it is an entry level job."
good,There was always a task to be done here. Time flew by and there was rarely any difficulty in this job aside from when there were many customers to serve.
good,"I worked many different levels for the companies, depending on what you are looking for. Entry levels are simple to get, the high the position the more less opportunity to advance"
good,Guidelines for food temperature and preparation must be followed.  Stocked the meat case and hot food case.  Liked helping customers with food choices.
good,"Each manager wants things done there way so no consistency in the way a department is ran.  Only pay raise was when company upped starting pay . No consistency in attendance policy,  was up to department head if you got a point for an absence or emergency leave early, so some got every one while others don't.  The people you work with are what makes it worth your time"
good,Many of the managers were rude and had poor communication skills. They acted as if they were better than the associates and would rather chew people out than help them
good,Overall it was a decent job as on orderfiller at Los lunas dc. Management was horrible however. Constantly being overworked for what the pay is. It's a secure job but they have you working as a bot.
good,"it had its busy days and its slow days like any other store but it had a lot of great co workers and was not to hard to do it correctly, efficiently, and safely"
good,I loved working at Walmart. All the associates I worked with were incredible helpful and we would work together to achieve goals. The management was on top of everything and actually showed concern about the employees.
good,"Es una empresa con grandes beneficios, la unica area de oportunidad es su personal de rrhh, normalmente son personas con poco profesionalismo que no saben manejar la cultura organizacional de la empresa."
good,"Most days at work went pretty smoothly considering a few things. On a typical day I unloaded the freight truck and then ran freight on the sales floor till 6 pm lunch. After lunch I went back to work typically switching departments, which took some getting used to at first, and ran freight there for the remainder of the night."
good,"The hardest part of this job is dealing with the verbal abuse from customers.  We check their receipt as they leave only if there is an unbagged item in their cart.  People just don't understand and they can get nasty with their words when we are just trying to do our jobs!  We even explain it to them, but they still have harsh words to say to us."
good,The Company as a whole is good to work for. I feel that there is a lot of different rules that not all are following.  They are picking and choose who is doing the process and the guidelines do not apply to all.
good,For the most part the work enviroment was ok. people tried to get along and help each other out if they needed it. most of the floor mangers tried to help if you had a issue to resolve.
good,"Walmart gave me a good introduction to retail. I started as a cashier and moved quickly to service desk associate, then customer service manager. The people who work there are good people, and management is nice."
good,"Overall, the job was not too bad. I was able to stay busy but we worked 12 hour shifts.  I have four children and was spending less time with them.  I needed something that I was able to spend more time with my family."
good,"The company itself is a great opportunity. It’s how management runs the store that brings morale down. Depending on what store you work, it can be an amazing experience or an absolute nightmare."
good,Fast pased job dealing with alot of diffrent pepole from customers to managers. Great way to learn how to do multiple things at once and to get used to speaking to diffrent people.
good,This is a overall good place to work. You  have to be a willing team player. you we always be busy and very productive. it makes the day go by very fast.
good,Started out a pretty good pay rate for a cashier and had reasonable hours for part time. The only major drawback was not a lot of help from your managers. Some cared and tried their best but there was always too much to do and not enough people. This was a smaller store so I can't speak for them all just my personal experience with this supercenter.
good,"Very good and correct orientations "
good,A day at work was good but it was a pain in the but sometimes because they didnt treat me right. I learned what it takes to keep the job and the most hardest part of the job is i had to to take classes and they sucked. The greatest part of the job is i was able to help people.
good,A friendly place to work. Enjoyed interacting with the various staff for the different departments. Pleasant experience. Manual work - can be tiring at times
good,I went to work everyday of the week it was a good day all the time but some days it was hard but I started to learn how to do more stuff and everyone always had a smile on there face.
good,The job requirements are easy to learn but you get very little training. Management shows a lot of favoritism which makes it hard to advance. The company is always changing things to find ways to be more efficient.
good,Great opportunities if you are willing to sacrifice your personal life and be an over achiever.  There is no work-life balance.  It's all about the bottom line.  You help them make profits...they feed you the crumbs.
good,When it came to working with Walmart I was concerned that with my lack of previous work experience I would fall behind my fellow employees. But when I began working with Walmart my previous thoughts were quickly put behind me. I arrived to a more relaxed environment than I originally anticipated and was given all of the time I needed in order to get comfortable with completing my daily tasks.
good,"Walmart Pharmacy gives an overall experience of how a fast paced work environment works and how to handle customers along with handling the order or the inventory. The positive attitude which you show at work, makes it a worth."
good,Working at Walmart has been exciting for me. Yes you have those customers who isn’t having the best day and treats you horrible but the people you work with overrules that.
good,clocked in and got right to work with my team. we went over everything that needed to be done that night  to be able to get our jobs done on time. we went through each check list given to see how far each was able to go and when others would get done we would all pitch in and help others that weren't able to finish on time.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Walmart, i had pleasant coworkers wit very distinctive personalities, i worked in the electronics department, however we were responsible for photo lab, fabrics, and the toys section. only thing i would recommend is that they look through rehires before they have to spend more money training new people that are not as dependable."
good,My day consist of gathering online orders for customers and I was able to meet and talk to the customers sometimes. Mostly I would try to find the items that my team couldn't find or give them an even better item than what the asked for. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the customers when they say they miss an item. The most enjoyable part is that I have gotten to know the customers and even other parts of the store better.
good,"Personally I ended up hating it. As a first job the pay was nice, but after spending a day dealing with people and stress, even after a full day of school. I got over it pretty quickly."
good,A typical day at work was fast pace. Loud. Everyone there was pretty nice. Management was decent when it came to the employees. I learned how to get a job done efficiently and correctly the first time.
good,"Depending what department you work in, it's a nice place. You'll get tossed around wherever they need help so expect to learn about every department not just the one you were hired for."
good,"I truly enjoy working for Walmart as a Pharmacy Technician. As long as everyone does what they are supposed to do, you won’t feel as overwhelmed. Not everyone holds their own weight in the pharmacy, and it affects everyone."
good,"It's  good to work with Walmart because you learn a lot about process and policies related customer service. Management is good  and always helpful."
good,The associates are great but some of the management isn't. Their attendance policy sucks. Causes many people to lose their job cause they don't take into account like getting into a wreck or having the stomach flu and trying to take an LOA is a long process that only complicates everything.
good,They have increase employee wages to show gratitude and fair compesation for a days work it show we value you and that we are worthy and appreciated. It also gives workers motivation and less stress outside of work. With the increase we can live on in stead of just survive.
good,Great place to work for college students. Great place to grow and advance in a company. Great place to work if you're a hard worker and don't mind working hard.
good,I really enjoyed working at my first 2 Wal-Marts. They were well managed.  Friendly co-workers. I also really enjoyed working for sams club. Great pay! Great staff. Great hours and flexibility!
good,Walmart overall is a good company to work for especially as a younger individual in school. They have flexible hours and also give you a great experience of retail. They allow you to fulfill the position that suits you if the primary position you applied for is discomforting.
good,They dont have a good system setup incase an employee becomes ill. lower management was very lacking and it was a sink or swim attitude while upper management knew what they were doing.
good,Empresa muy bn ubicada siendo una cadena de comercialización más grande de México tube la dicha de laborar para Walmar de México s.a. de slr.
good,Great place to start as a college student and earn an extra income while you go to school. It's a great place to work if you are customer oriented or detail oriented.
good,I was let go because I had some personal issues going on. I explained them to my manager he said after 6 months reapply and I could have my position back that was a lie. Needless to say the store manager sucks. he has run that store in the ground since the last store manager left.
good,Great place to work if management was better. Not all mangers are lacking there are some pretty good mangers there. I really love my job there and the people that I work with.
good,"Walmart was a very fast pace and steady work environment. Tons of oppurtunity for growth , but often overworks there staff or calls you in on short notice"
good,"Walmart work at home project was a nice program to work for, I enjoyed working there, and was greatful that my superiors saw my dedication and hard work and promoted me to Quality Assurance"
good,Fast paced company that's quickly on the rise with changes to make the workplace better. Eager to promote first time or rehired associates looking to better themselves in search of a career.
good,My usual day of work consists of fulfilling orders by a certain time frame which can be very demanding if all associates do not show up. The managers are fair but they do expect results.
good,Working at Walmart wasn't too bad except for the fact that it was exhausting after the first week. They expected near superhuman levels of quality (by yourself too mind you) and management would write up for the smallest slip ups.
good,It wasn’t something u really wanted to do i just needed a stable job to have a stable living because I was working and going to school so I needed money to pay for my place
good,"First, I contribute to the ""benefits"" I receive. Second, a benefit is not payment therefore my wage is far too low based on how hard I work and how I am expected to interact with customers and coworkers.  I am expected to produce on a faster, improved level everyday with 2% being the only possible wage increase. Greedy at the top!"
good,"For the time I was working at Walmart it was calm while at the same time very busy. Each day I went there was very unpredictable because I had a different role at different times, from stocking, to unloading trucks, managing carts, or even cashier. I did whatever I could to be the most productive as possible, and overall everything was easy and organized."
good,"I felt the pay was less than what the job was If you work and are having to cover more than one department it should be compensated "
good,The job pays very well for the type of work.  The production standards are very high and can sometimes be stressful.  You are not always guaranteed a full 40 hours a week.
good,"They let me do my work and allowed me to what I felt was good work."
good,Very relaxed easy going interview. Be prepared for the interview questions . Speak loudly and proud of your answers . Everything’s gonna be all right as long as u not shy
good,"First starting at walmart, I was really excited to work everyday. Everyday was a new experience, not sure what would happen and what kind of customers I would have to expect or communicate with. I made friends with all my coworkers and especially regular customers that came in often. Working at walmart was a great experience, but there were just minor problems that not alot of people liked. Management was not always fair."
good,5 days on 2 days off. 170 days and nights a year away from home. They would like you to think that it is a family atmosphere but it is a total corporate atmosphere that is controlled by attorneys.
good,"Extremely busy environment with multiple priorities.  All tools to do your job are not always available..."
good,Good expierence everything was there but there pay raises sucked because 68 cents in 4 years in unexceptable to me period and if someone doesnt belive me go apply
good,Good  people miss working there.meet alots of nice people at work.loved what I did there.lots of testing the whole time I worked there.Be a safety aware.
good,"I like all the different job duties, the people/co-workers are good. The schedule is not good. Its all over the place. Hard to get in a routine. No consistency."
good,"Foi muito bom trabalhar no Walmart ,tenho uma boa xperiência profissional e conhecimento na area que estive trabalhando ,indicaria para um conhecido sim."
good,"The bright side of working in retail is that you learn more about psychology, philology, anthology, and so that can have fun talking about the product there selling by doing your own research, in your own free time. There very few things I would complain about, but it turn out nice to be social and get to know people better, even if you hate people. Furthermore, I would say there's not enough wise boss leaders you can look up to as a mentor. However you'll get to learn new strategies on how to be urgent  during your time shift, which is something they look at often. Lastly, always remember to put your nice jacket and purses locked up in a locker or car, never let anyone you work with know your private good news, you'll never know who's jealous or/and never let anyone know where you live. Always remember to be respectful of others. I know you can't control everything, but never let any toxic people think they hold the key your spiritual and emotional house, that is the problem. If you don't like the department you currently are you can always transfer in 6 months."
good,"I enjoyed working here, but the pay is not good. there is room for advancement. you will get 30 cents per hour raise, each year !!! that s not worth the effort!!!"
good,"Walmart is constantly changing so you have to be able to adapt or get booted."
good,"First 4 weeks you can not get into the locked lockers to get a scanner. But you need one to tell you where the Dairy goes. Or frozen foods. Printers hard to find. And you need one to print a label for your overstock. And when you can get in the lockers are empty."
good,"Focused on customer safety and internal/external theft. I did safety sweeps everyday and checked high theft areas, checked register shortages from the previous day."
good,"Not bad for someone in school, you have to be available 7 days a week. You start out part time but work 40hr.  They watch to make sure you never get over time."
good,"A typical day at work begins at 6 am with separation of paperwork and filing daily and weekly work. Then we begin processing claims and cleaning up from the evening before."
good,I had like the people I was working with.some of The people there was ok but the meager was full is of it. Just was trying to work my hour and go by my day
good,"Walmart was an alright experience but the lack luster management does nothing to solve problems that occur at the store or in the store, it’s really a shortage on employees the managers always show favoritism."
good,"fast pace work environment, kinda strict with good "
good,"Good place to work if you are just trying to get out of the house and don't need the paycheck or benefits.  Otherwise, I'd say take your talent elsewhere."
good,"All in all a good place to work. Very busy at times and hours are good. Management seem to tend to employees rather then the ""get back to work"" attitude. Makes for a nice environment"
good,"Walmart is about your typical entry level job force, its fast paced and based on the people around you can be very fun or bad. I had no issues with Walmart and enjoyed my time there."
good,"The people I work with are what keep me coming back every day. They are absolutely amazing! The management however leave a lot to be desired. They would definitely benefit from training courses. A typical day involves a lot of manual labor and a lot of time on your feet. The most enjoyable part of my day is dealing with the customers that I see on a regular basis. Most of them are also amazing. Of course there is always that one horrible person, but we usually just laugh at how ridiculous she/he is."
good,"Great job for a driven person, someone with goals. You work from the time you clock in to the time you clock out most days. Especially in the clothes department. Walmart get trucks every day and my department always had something. I would go back."
good,It's a great company but as far as their attendance policy goes it needs some help in my opinion that is the reason why they have such high turn over there it needs attention.
good,"Too much hard work in production. Management not nearly concered with dangers of jobs in receiving. "
good,"It's not a terrible job. At least, it doesn't live up to all the bad stories I've heard. There are far worse jobs out there and I worked then before minimal wage went up."
good,I basically worked in lawn and garden at east Dundee. Walmart.  Water plants all summer long. Help when the truck came in to take plants off  .help customer out on a day to day basic 2  weather it was about plants or other dept section. Fish .toys.  bikes. Keys. Paint. Or whatever they needed help in... or help my other fellow dept out w their stuff ..help put away.  Their stuff clean up the dept. .....
good,Walmart pays great. I was hired for seasonal work at Christmas but kept on in a different department after the holidays. (Maintenance) cleaning the restrooms could get rather nasty at times.
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to not be sucked up by all the drama and lies. The people can be nice but most of the time they just want to know your personal business.
good,I enjoyed my time working there. I had a great staff and it’s was a healthy environment. Communication was great and so was the chemistry between all the members in my department.
good,"its a great job for cashiers and retail i would highly recommend this job based on its flexibility. Walmart is great for any age range and has great customer service,"
good,my coworkers always leaving to go on their breaks during lunch and dinner rushes. They love to leave they're pile of trash in room/ kitchen and  and huge pile of dishes in the sink for night staff to wash.
good,"Good place to work if you have a good work ethic. Management could be better, and there is a high turnover rate. It is expected that associates are cross trained in multiple areas."
good,Hard working fast paced clean environment if good also and like working with the people it's relaxing at times and then can be stressed sometimes but it's fun job to do
good,"Is a friendly and calm store, great team work, everybody helps each other. Managers and superviser are really helpfull. Very clean and organized enviroment."
good,"O nosso dia de trabalho era bastante intenso"
good,"I have nothing bad to say about working at Walmart, the time I worked there I really enjoyed it, and the people i worked with. The discounts were really nice!"
good,Working at Walmart could be draining because of the amount of customers that we have daily. Walmart is a good company to work at and to expand your customer service skills.
good,I have been here for about a 2 weeks and they have already changed my hours to 26 when it was 40 because they put me in as a minor on accident. Although it has many benefits working in CAP 2 has been stressful as I have been thrown onto the floor with little experience. We are highly understaffed and just can’t meet the expectations.
good,The overall outcome of working for Walmart I would say it is a great compa y with great benefits and amazing working people but the WORST management I have ever encountered.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be starting my day looking at the schedule to make sure I have proper coverage. Once I do, then I will place my associates in areas I know they can thrive. I've learned that things constantly change within the company so you always have to be on your toes. The workplace environment isn't bad, people are pretty friendly, and now we have a more relaxed dress code which makes the associates want to come to work, knowing they don't have to wear a uniform. The hardest part about my job is dealing with all the different personalities from my associates especially when they are having problems with each other. Last but not least the most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers smile. I love knowing them on a name basis and being able to assist them with what ever they may need."
good,"Not a bad place to work, coworkers have you back, and you met the most interesting people while working there. The inconstant hours are one of the few draw backs."
good,Overall Walmart is a ok place to work at it's not the best or the worst they could use more people skills treat there associates much better they also need to offer vacation pay and holiday pay and be more considerate of what people have going on outside of work more compassion
good,The starting rate has gone way up which is great. Most of the time the hours are flexible. All in all a good company. I do advise against getting into management there.
good,"A great company to work for, but you have to have patience. Customer service is rewarding but extremely hard at times. You have to stay cool, calm and collected at all times."
good,"Tive a oportunidade de fazer parte desta empresa,onde você tem chance de crescimento"
good,I likes the experience of customer service I received at Walmart. I met a lot of different  people and got to learn more about being an associate of customer service. I learned how to handle money. I do wish that they were willing to work with me and my schedule with college.
good,Over all good needs more hands on training instead of throwing you in and its sink or swim. Take the time to train them right and it won't have to be done again and it helps the new o e feel like he's contribute and learns in the process
good,A typical day was making sure every customer was taken care of while also keeping the store clean and appealing. I learned a lot but I mostly learned how to communicate better with other people. The management was one of the best I've ever had. They are all so friendly and fun people.
good,Fun place to work. Never bored. The more you give to the cause the more you get in return. A great place if you love helping people and love working within a team.
good,"Once your trained just be a fly on the wall is what I've learned to keep from giving them reasons to lay you off...I still currently work there on 3 years now. They play huge favoritism so learn to kiss butt beacause if ur not main management then you don't matter to them."
good,"A good company to work for  but the long hours makes it hard to spend time with family,  especially if you have kids and being under staff could make your job harder"
good,Walmart is a great company with good benefits . You must be able to work holidays though which is a huge reason of leaving . Family time is important to me .
good,"empresa de calidad,he aprendido a trabajar con diferentes productos,ademas del pisto leo de productos ,a trabajar en cabecera de muebles y revisar mercadería que hay en stock, cuando llega camien se debe descargar camion."
good,I honestly loved my job most days . i mean everyday was a surprising day . and they make you do alot of different stuff . so your not stuck doing the same job for a long time . management is easy to advance to .
good,"0 oo0 9 no nu mmmGood job if u do your job  to your best"
good,"Walmart is a equal oppertunity work place for all...Walmart helps u invest in the company, makes u feel like you got stock in the company... I love my job that's why I've been there for 17yrs and still going.."
good,Good place to work if you have little to no specialized skills.  They do have good opportunities to move up but the are quickly becoming sparse to find and are thinking out.
good,l like performing Product Demos there. Staff very friendly and helpful. Featured product usually in stock. Managers sometimes elusive. Not all are accomodating.
good,When I first started I worked in the toys department .i stocked shelves did recovery and helped customers it was a fast paced job the people there were really nice and helpful I also worked in the food department helping to stock shelves
good,I enjoyed helping others and being apart of a work family that work together I was able to get great work experience in a friendly enviorment the management was very professional and willing to help
good,Maintain freight. Make sure sales floor was properly stocked. Keep a clean work area. Make sure all fresh products are properly labeled. Make sure inventory correctly.
good,Cashiering is what i love to do. The hardest part of that job is having to deal with rude and difficult customers. It's a very easy and at times very fast pace and busy. All in All not too bad of a place to work for.  Just ur typical retail customer service job
good,"My hours were 4a till 1p and there was a lot to do in produce/plus. Those hours were when I was scheduled, although some days I might start early and end at 8:30, 9:00 or 9:30. Some weeks I barely had 25 hours. I needed something where they told me you are full-time."
good,I leaned at Walmart how to work smart at a quick pace. I Also learned how to use several equipment. I learned how to scan items and price them. Also learned how to lift
good,"It has it's up's and down's but in the end, it's a good-paying job and a nice and friendly work environment. I learned lots of things from my pathway's, and from hands-on training. It's all about how to deal with everyday life situations you probably won't learn in school."
good,Big family environment. Can relocate with company if you want and endless ways to move up in company. They are willing to train you and make it where you can succeed.
good,"Clock in. Warm up. grab your scanning device. take your stack of labels to your module, and start labeling the proper boxes. and send the proper amount down the assembly line. and then once you finish your labels. go help out your other co-workers until you start the next module. in a day you would do 2.5 modules, in a 10 hour period. more often than not it was mandatory overtime. was not optional. The hardest part of the job was not losing your mind to the numbers and being able to keep up with productivity. The management had a lot of miscommunication. a lot of times i had to put in a notice to upper management about my military schedule. and they would ""inform"" my direct management for me telling me not to worry. and then i would get marked down as a no call no show."
good,is a typical retail environment. quick pace and some hard work. The people that work there is better than the actual job. great place to work if your in college or retired.
good,"I worked as a cashier part-time you had to be very fast and have patience."
good,During my time working in walmart I had an excellent relationship with my colleagues.  the management had good treatment and respect. it was the night shift.
good,The job is fine. Department manager is great. It’s moreso personell that’s hard to get in contact with but everyone is fine. The pay is fine. Can earn PTO as long as you work. Pretty fair job compared to other jobs. Easy to work with everyone. Just do your job and hard your work will pay off.
good,"They have poor management skills , the pay was decent , discounts helped somewhat when it was really needed . You could quickly advance in the company"
good,"If a fast paced, clean, and productive work environment is something that you crave in your job place, this would be a place for you.  I've learned a lot about maintaining product, FIFO and OSHA standards.  Your training is reliant on management, but managers are spread thin throughout the store.  I would say that the hardest part about the job would be meeting expectations of a heavy workload, while dealing with a constant flow of clientele, and picking up the slack of being short staffed.  I would say that the part that I enjoy most about my job is looking back at all of my hard work before I leave those doors, and seeing all of the customers being able to find what they need to find, because their expectations have been met."
good,Walmart as a whole is great. The changes that came about this year has been fast and at times hard to catch up with. Communication is the problem as they can not provide adequate details to help adapt to the changes
good,The job can be stressful at times(fairly often) and depending on the manager the stress levels could go higher. The benefits are pretty good. The job is pretty easy but some of the Associates don't care about the job and it can make it difficult to work there.
good,Wal-Mart was a great company to work for. Flexible schedule with great benefits. Coworkers become family because of the work culture. Everyone made being apart of Wal-Mart a good experience
good,"The only thing that makes the jobs of Walmart difficult is the poor management, they'll treat you like you don't matter and make excuses and lie to your face rather than being upfront."
good,Walmart suppy chain management is very stressful you can help but take your work home with you. It bares down on your home life as you cannot fully enjoy your day off. The work itself and the excitement of running the operations is unlike no other. It is the behind the scenes that will get you cought up in the business.
good,Walmart is a pretty good place to work. It gets a bad wrap and bad reviews from people who refuse to adhere to the policies. Advancement is available if you apply yourself.
good,With it being a smaller walmart there was favouritism among the management team. You could work as hard as possible while your counter part done less but got treated better. It happens all over the location
good,"When I worked there, there was little organized management at my store. The manager I had was one of the worst people I've ever met. She was loud and rude and had no idea on how to motivate a team. This made the position I worked have one of the highest turn over rates in the store. After I quit she was moved to a different store and I honestly couldn't tell you what it is like now."
good,"Walmart claims that a cashier employee can get a $1.00 raise after 60-90 days but then find out that there are online tests we must do and then the raise will come but when it’s time to take the tests which are just here and there, never ending. It’s ongoing and can take a year or more to complete and most didn’t get to reach the goal because when we asked to take them they say it’s too busy."
good,Management is lazy and have no clue of their job or really seem to care except when they get ripped apart by upper management. They say they are a family but do everything they can to schedule you hours that keeps you away from your family.
good,Working for walmart was a great experience for me. I loved helping customers and all the new things I got to learn. And I love the few people that I worked with in the department that I was in.
good,Walmart serves a variety of needs for its employees.  It is a good place for retired individuals to stay involved in the community.  Any employee has the opportunity for advancement if he or she takes the initiative and pursues the many career and educational options provided.
good,So the team that wasn't management was fantastic! A quick summary for the management at the location I was in. It's 2018 and a hurricane is flooding everything. It knocks out the freezers throughout the store. We have to toss everything. They employ a mod change while everything is empty. Working in either dairy or frozen you need two people. I am alone in the frozen area and I tell my supervisor. I am suppose to have someone from a different area come and assist me with breaking down the pallets. I am left alone for the rest of the day. This had been a consistent experience other then the coolers/freezers going out.
good,I enjoyed working with the public and costumer service. Walmart is a good place to work as a cashier or costumer service counter. Only bad thing is trying to remember all the produce codes. Lol
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for with a lot of restructuring going on.  Every position in the store has been or will be changed over the past 18 months.   The Culture is changing.   Some for the better, some for the worse.  "
good,"I did overnight stock, some customer service, some cleaning, and some guest interaction. Mostly, I spent time keeping things in order, as opposed to interacting with guests."
good,It was decent for the time i was there.They wanted to keep adding on task for me to learn but didnt want to show me recognition for all i had done for the company.
good,"its an okay job, as long as you are used to standing for long periods of time . the breaks are pretty reasonable, only when the store gets busy is when it becomes difficult to get the job done."
good,I liked working at Walmart it gave a me a daily challenge and I loved meeting new people. I was always able to be myself and feel comfortable in my environment
good,"Walmart is a wonderful place to work, it is very fast paced and can be stressful at times. But overall it is a great place to work with great benefits."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and for the most part my job was ok. The hours were hard and management was horrible and unresponsive at times which made it hard to do my job.
good,It was ok.  Fast pace cashiering and a lot of lifting.  Customers were generally nice.  Pay could be better.  Employee discounts were very helpful especially around Christmas time.
good,"I was there for a short amount of time but all my coworkers were very nice and management was hard to get help from sometimes but they are very busy so that's understandable. Overall my experience was great and i hated that i had to leave as soon as i did, i was having personal issues at home and it was a 45 minute drive for me almost everyday so it didn't work out how i wanted too. i'd say its a great job and fun experience overall. You must have to be able to learn and do things by yourself sometimes because your coworkers and managers are busy because it's a very fast pace job."
good,Great place to work if you arent worried about advancement. Management isnt always that great but customer experience is cool. Training is good and theres vacation/sick pay.
good,Great place to work. Management at the time was a bit scattered and scarce . All employee concerns were promptly attended to until resolved .Employees were very nice to work with .
good,"They worked us hard but we continue to take wave after wave of customers with a smile. We were understaffed a lot but didn’t complain, had fun and crazy customers, but always gave 110%."
good,"It is a good job for people starting out, such as high schoolers. Yet there is a lot of physical labor to the job. If bending, squatting, reaching, pulling, pushing, and lifting about 50 pounds is too strenuous, I suggest you keep looking for a job. You are mainly stocking items onto the shelves from the backroom everyday. Cashiers are constantly standing and have difficult break reliefs. If you can't manage a daily workout while maintaining accurate inventory don't bother. But descent pay and good benefits."
good,"management was not always understanding of personal situations, especially if word got out that management was lenient on someones situation, the environment was like being in high school."
good,I worked for Walmart enough times and really just got tired of how they treated there employees. It’s a great job with great benefits and can teach a lot honestly.
good,Provide customer service. Be friendly. Be helpful at all times. Say hi to customers every ten feet they are away from you. When stocking shelves? Be as fast as you can.
good,"Meet lots of people, co workers are great and friendly, very clean, would love to work for wal mart again. I have no cons for them. Great work environment."
good,"It's a repetitive job.you sometimes end up feeling like a robot. although customers can be really negative and sometimes bring your mood down. iv'e learned not to take it personally. management are great, but to get in contact with them can be hard. there is no hard part in this job as long as you get your work done right. the most enjoyable part of this job are really just the breaks and lucnh time to be real  honest."
good,"Management doesn’t pay enough attention, makes you pick up others slack. Good pay though and good benefits. Your benefits also get significantly better the longer you’ve been there."
good,"Everyone is kind and the work is hard.  You will learn when to speak to your management  team.  The workplace culture is fast-past, clear instructions, and clear communication."
good,I really enjoy working with my fellow associates. I enjoy the daily interaction with customers in my area of the store.  I enjoy going out of my area to help other parts of the store.
good,Great company to work for just needs better management. There are times when they won’t schedule enough people to work and then the customers get upset because they have to wait in long lines. Other times you have to wait to take a break because they have a shortage.
good,Laid back. Easy work. Nothing hard about working at Walmart. As long as you did your job as you were assigned and didn't goof off management didn't bother you.
good,I’ve been at my Walmart in Navarre for almost 4 years now and it’s a very rewarding job and the people there are like my family. I would highly recommend this job to anyone and to make sure to always be yourself.
good,"Walmart is a Fast paced retail job, I learned many different roles to help in various areas. I enjoyed my supervisor role but often times were not valued."
good,When being an overnight supervisor at Wal-mart you are tasked with helping the assistant manager run the entire store from the front parking lot to receiving deliveries. You are also in charge of up to 30 associates on any given night and giving them direction to perform all tasks necessary.
good,Working at Walmart. Has been very good for me. It really was a start for me to get my foot in the door I feel I had a lot of help with all the tasks that I went through.
good,"Good for the area but can’t do it for 30 plus years. Locked into a position for one yr and can get locked in longer. Long term people are being phased out, by either looking for new jobs or getting termed"
good,"My experience at Walmart was great, I worked around a great team which probably made it easier. But overall it was a good job in I would do it again. If you focus it'll be a success."
good,I stocked shelves and helped customers. Managers were pleasant at the time. There was a venilated room people could go and smoke. If you are in to that. Employee sale days where we could buy items discounted. I enjoyed working here for the most part.
good,You're definitely going to work for your paycheck. Most days are filled with customers and some of those customers are filled with anger and irritation. Other times there are regular rushes with delightful customers.
good,"Overall, a good place to work as a pharmacist, but the direction from corporate no longer resembles pharmacy practice as we were taught in pharmacy school, nor what many believe it should be going forward."
good,"Had outstanding teamwork and manager work was steady and fast paced, which made overnight quick, love working there the pay didn't measure up to cost of living."
good,es una buena empresa sin embargo algunos empleados tienen mas preferencia que otros
good,Walmart was good for killing time while making money. My manager at the time was difficult to connect and talk with. But he eventually left after drama with another manager. Scheduling wasn’t too bad. Customers were usually nice.
good,Jonesboro Arkansas store management was good GREAT place to work.  Anna Illinois store the management was not very good. I've been told it's better now. It's been a lot of years since I worked there.
good,"Decent job, decent pay, decent managers here and there.  Some departments get too much slack and some get zero.  Seems like most ASMs only cared about their areas and didn't care they would be the only ASM on duty for the whole store."
good,"Overall, Walmart is a good company to work for. I have enhanced my communication skills by helping and supporting customers to meet their needs. Being a full time student and working at Walmart has allowed me to have a good balance of school and work. However, there does need to be improvement with management and scheduling enough staff."
good,"Very long hours, work holidays and weekends takes over your life but you can see all the work reflected.  Pay is very good and covers cost.  Culture to a store manager is rough as you are often forgotten.  Hardest part of the job is reviews with your manager as they can be unforgiving."
good,"When I first started at Walmart I worked on the deli department. It was great. Fast paced, lots to learn about meats and cheeses. How to make their deli salads, sandwiches etc. However, when the manager change came and it’s done every quarter every assistant manager is changed to a different department, it was awful. I had this one manager who absolutely disliked me. I could never figure out why. So I switched to cashiering. I loved it!"
good,"It was an ok place to work. I worked in the Deli, good atmosphere and the team I worked with were awesome. Sometimes I got the chance to make subs which was fun and I also helped with inventory which was difficult but the manager I had was patient and made sure I knew what I was doing."
good,Working for Walmart was a great experience. Enjoyed working with other associates. Daily there is always something new to be learned. With good leadership you may be able to advance.
good,Working for Wal-Mart was some of the best years of my life. I learned a lot about how to work with customers. How to order and schedule to fit the needs of the department. I learned the best way to work as a team.
good,"I worked there until my family had to move "
good,Walmart is an okay place to work however the hours you work always very in change during the year. Never consistent as far as your paycheck. Management does not attend Associates very well and they are free to work as they please which relieve some Associates working more than others
good,"My experience at working at walmart was a decent one. Being a cart pusher wss an ok job, lots of sun so you definitely sweat alot. The benifits of working there were pretty good. All the managers were fairly chill and my coworkers were cool. It was always a good work environment until it rained lol."
good,Demasiado estrés y poca valoración a el personal y nula motivación laboral
good,Good place to work good hours if you don’t have kids and only one vehicle LOL idk if this is gonna send to them or not but I’d hope this was private lol
good,"Es in empleo con miy buen ambiente laboral, prestaciones de ley y buenos horarios.  El sueldo es en general em todos los puestos  muy bajo."
good,"It was an interesting job I met alot of people who were so used to a daily routine that adding me in didn't seem to throw them off, management was always a little off sometimes."
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a good starter job out of high School. Overnight receiving crew was layed back as long as you did your job. I worked there from 2000 to 2003. So not sure how it is now
good,"Walmart has a huge turnaround, young kids are hired & as a ""first time"" job, its cool... but when they're adults that ARE going to work & ARE working, it's tough because these youngins make it a little tougher, you're stuck doing most of the work. As a managers point of view, we're stuck babysitting. If everyone can be on the same page, it'll run smoothly."
good,"The job would be fine if the company would see fit to hire more help. Unfortunately Company guidelines require constant improvement and once sales peak, costs must be slashed instead. Even with a full time job my hours would get cut. Lots of changes have happened since I've left but walmart shall likely remain the same no matter how they change."
good,it had its good days and its bad days some of the management was bad but others were good work conditions for cap team were terrible they care for us at all when something bad would happen they would blame us and we would have a meeting and we would explain that it was not us but they never fixed the problem.
good,The thing I like about Walmart they hire any race. The only thing I didn't like was the no call no show policy. Every quarter you get 3 chances to either call in. After that you will be fired. All though you should not call in some may have an emergency. There a lot of gossiping between departments which I didn't like. The managers seem to be in the middle of a lot of drama between employees.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is like a typical day at home, you have your job duties to do and some days can be really busy and some days can be slow. I would go to work, clock in, jump on a register and start checking out customers. I was usually on a register unless one of my managers needed me to tend to lawn & garden, do returns, get needed materials from the back of the store, or perform the new check out with me job. I've learned how to preform jobs other than what I was hired for and how to deal with different people in different ways. Management was good however like family there was some lack of communication between some managers. The workplace of Walmart was friendly almost family like, you had your good days and few bad days with co-workers but nothing that one co-worker couldn't help the other co-worker with. I believe my hardest part of my job at Walmart was learning how to control myself when it came to an over excited customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was the family like environment and being able to help people when they needed it."
good,My overall experience with Wallmart wasn't so bad. I just wish the way they handled certain situations were a lot better and the sense of respecting the employes. I feel that respect would've made more employes grateful and happy to work there.
good,"Walmart was a really cool and laid back job."
good,"If you want to experience new challenges each day and respond to customer complaints or service issues, this is a great job to be in. Management is fine, and so were the co-workers... however, the pay and working hours may not be what you are expecting."
good,"Walmart is a very convenient place to work if you are fine with little advancement opportunities. It can be exhausting to stand on your feet all day, but it pays well in the state of West Virginia. $11.15 was my final amount before leaving for college."
good,"A typical day includes: Assigning staff to their area of work, putting out displays, receiving 1-2 trucks per might, writing reports,planning displays, making sure all doors are secured and alarmed."
good,"Only reason I left Walmart was due to poor management, other than that was a great place to work for. Good benefits, good pay, management just expected you to do way more than you are required to for your job"
good,The Walmart Tire and Lube Express is an easy environment if you are willing to work hard and quickly. A perfect place to start a career as an automotive technician.
good,Sure you hear this and that but overall this isn't a bad place to work at all. The people there are great management could be better but minimum wage is $11 and great opportunity as well definitely recommended
good,Great employees and people to work with but management does not communicate so directions get twisted for the associate who will end up getting in trouble for the miscommunication
good,"huge pressure to meet goals that aren’t always obtainable . one mission is to respect"
good,ich habe gelernt mit Menschen gut umzugehen und Geduld zu behalten
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, exigente com seus associados, porém da condições de crescimento, remuneração a altura do cargo."
good,"I enjoyed my job but notice other associates should try to be more helpful and happy to help customers. "
good,The employees were great. The management was alright. Many customer would complain about the lack of open registers. That was a complaint for many of the employees as well. They simply did not schedule enough people to run registers.
good,"With my time spent working at Walmart, I’ve learn core values. How to be a man through constructive criticism. I learned when your at a point of no understanding then you ask for help. Aslo to work with a sense of urgency . I’m"
good,"Walmart is an easy job. I wouldn’t recommend at as something long term. Management could be a lot better, but over all the other associates are amazing people."
good,"i am a cashier and cash out customers all day i do  cleanup at my til when leaving, always replenish tools needed and help customers with packing and questions about product. The most enjoyable part of the job is the repeat customers that specifically come to me and the hardest part is not getting enough hours"
good,"You go into work, slog it out, and leave on your typical day. Oh, i almost forgot, management looks down on you if you are below them and finds it necessary to remind you of your basic job description."
good,The management is poor and does not listen to what you say. It is a stressful job and there is no team work. Make sure you are on time because you only get certain amount of points.
good,"Walmart does pay well above minimum for a job in some areas are entry level and are very easy to grasp the understanding of how to complete each work day. "
good,It’s ok to work at for like a starters job but not be there for many years unless your going to move up to management or ect. I think Pay is too low for the position I am working.
good,"Great Culture, Leadership, great place and good company to work for. "
good,Otima empresa ara se trabalhar . não tenho queixas o que impactou foi o salario baixo na epoca
good,Okay place to work as far as the money goes. Work schedule is another plus because you know your days off. Breaks can be better. Overall not a bad job for the money.
good,Walmart is very fast paced and competitive. A lot of hours and expectations. Great pay scale and benefits. Not a lot of work and personal life balance.
good,This was a well managed and well organized Wal-Mart. As a first job it was a good introduction to the work force. Management I always felt was supportive for the most part and would help employees. They worked well to maintain employee morale and kept a far more positive feeling for many of their employees despite being Walmart and it having its rather poor reputation.
good,I actually love working at Walmart. Even though the training process I experience could been better. Some people are not willing to train you for the cashier position. But other than that when I got the hand of it. The job was okay and it felt good to help others. I didn't like the crazy hours though you work a different shift every day or every other day. Also I did get some rude customers but I just overlook them. Everyone has their bad days. But I also had some sweet customer some that I see regularly.  I enjoyed talking to them when there in my lane.
good,if youre looking for a warehouse job walmarts Cap 2 associate position might be right for you. Managment may differ from store to store but over all a fast paced and energetic work environment.
good,Good place. No stress when I worked there. Easy to communicate with people. Supervisors are understanding. You learn new things. You have that opportunity to move up the ladder.
good,"It was an alright experience working at wal-mart if not a little boring My job required me to walk around the store looking for various messes. The job usually equips you with a radio to find out where spills are at but, there was a shortage of radios so I had to walk around the store blind."
good,Great place to work especially if you are a student and looking for part time hours in the evening and/or weekends while in school. They are accommodating and flexible when needed.
good,"It was an okay place to work, the employee’s seemed friendly and the culture of the job was good. Just not the type of work I had in mind. But it’s not a bad place to work."
good,A very well managed place and a good place to start learning work ethics. Had a good schedule and the staff were very forgiving to a person learning how to handle a cash register.
good,La cultura que tienen es de crecimiento y muchos cursos de preparacion para mejorar dia a dia.
good,I loved working with my coworkers. Walmart has CSMs that manage the front end. So some managers I liked and some I didn't. Some would come when you put a code in asking for assistance or money and others would come 30 minutes after you needed them. Customers are nicer in retail than in fast food. But they get horrible around the holidays so try to be prepared for that.
good,Picking orders is alright. Management is hard to find if you don’t have a walkie. It’s hard to get time off for appointments if you don’t have a weekday off.
good,"I loved the compensation within Walmart. Because at my location Management was poor I dont like the policy for reporting managers. Wish there was a Union to protect you, just would make me feel better when reporting managers and having something actually be done."
good,"Prepare to have every part of your life infiltrated. Walmart is very good at getting you to work even when you are not at work. Schedule hours are between 50-60 hours a week, but you work closer to 80-90 when it’s all said and done."
good,the hardest part of my job was that most of the time i would always have to handle situations by myself and management wouldn't be able to help me or the customer and that what i really didn't like about walmart.
good,"Easy going, great team. Pay isnt great but its a good entry level job for anyone looking to get into the auto industry. Career advancement isnt the best either."
good,I enjoyed Walmart due to all the work skills I developed and I enjoyed helping out customers the best of my ability and always looking for new ways to improve my work.
good,"Working at Walmart was decent experience. But if I'm being honest, the management was a bit dysfunctional and often did not communicated with each other which resulted in confusion among fellow employees and I. Other than that, my experience was okay and was able to have flexible breaks and hours. The benefits was also a worthy addition."
good,"Walmart is a slow-paced yet fun and engaging environment in which to work, there is a disconnect in communication between sales associates and assistant managers however."
good,A typical day at Walmart consists of taking care of the customer needs while also multi tasking the need of the associates. The customer service managers are responsible for a lot  and are required to accomplish numerous task in the 8 hour shift given. The hardest part of the job can be lack of help. Scheduling conflicts can make the job of being a customer service manager very tedious. The most enjoyable par of the job is interacting with the customers. Customers that notice that a manager is going above and beyond to help makes it worth it.
good,J'ai fais ce travail durant quelques mois à temps plein en attendant mon retour aux études pour faire mon AEC au cégep.
good,"A typical work day consisted of helping customers with their questions/problems, keeping area clean, watching out for potential theft, and refilling bags when needed. Working in a retail environment taught me how to better deal with all the types of people you will encounter at some point in your life. Managers are sometimes never around when you need them. The workplace culture appears to be that the mangers are more concerned about the sales than the associates. The most difficult part of the job is having to deal with rude customers sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the quarterly bonuses if you qualify for them."
good,Worked at walmart for 3 years. Management was a trip customers were rude at times and good benefits to get eye glass insurance health and dental really paid off.
good,"-A typical work day included standing at the registers and making sure all the customers were taken care of and attended to correctly and as best as possible even when they came in angry all ready do you best to calm the customer and give them the best option."
good,"At Walmart you see everybody, good people , happy people, and mad people , I was trying to keep management away, by satisfying the customers. I felt like a leader of the department"
good,"up until I went to overnight I enjoyed my experience and I felt welcome. my day managers was always willing to work with their associates, they have even prayed with us and seemed to really listen to us."
good,Working at this company makes you feel like the people you are working for care for them and they freight & that’s it no matter if you are giving 100% or 0%.
good,"I dealt with customers on a constant basis trying to make sure to take care of their concerns and complaints as best I could, also doing money center duties consisting of cashing checks, moneygram money transfers, bill pay options and money orders.  I enjoyed the fast pace work that I did.  The only issue I ever had is it isn't really a family friendly environment, if I had appointments for my children they didn't understand that being a single parent I had no other options to get my kids to them and I received points because of it.  My mother the last 3 years of my employment was very ill and I had been missing time and even though I had FMLA I was threatened on many occasions with termination because of it.  I loved my job and wasn't happy when I lost it."
good,I guess they have changed some things since i was there that the employees dont like. Schedules were pretty open to fit your needs. I guess its no longer like that from what ive heard.
good,"It is a decent job to start out with but management can be flakey. It is very organized even though communication is shakey during busy times (which is normal). For its pay it's a good starter job, but if you want to make enough to live completely on your own moving upwards into management is key."
good,"Typical days would include unloading trucks by hand and receiving an additional truck to stock shelves, racks, cases, bins, and tables with merchandise and arrange merchandise displays to attract customers."
good,Just started in produce. Start pay was 11.50 for all new employees. Part time employees is up to 32 hours a week but can get more just no more than 40. Do your work stay to yourself but work as a team member. Nothing to worry about. Career advances are encouraged.
good,The one good thing about Walmart is the team work. It’s nice to see employees so upbeat and motivated even after many years of service. Pretty relaxed environment for the most part
good,Any time you needed off schedule they would work with you. It wasn't a stressful environmentnment to come into. The management was very laid back and professional.
good,A typical work day at Wal-Mart for me was working morning shift. I worked 4am to 1pm in the stock room. I would also work different shifts on the register.
good,What can I say its Walmart you guys see everything we do.It is a good starting career job if wanted. but if not then its flexible our and continue to take care of other things.
good,"i was able to move to a department that i enjoyed working in, pay was good, and management was good at working around school hours and activities that i needed to have off for."
good,Walmart is one of the largest retail stores in the world and the store is always busy and associates have to hardworking and committed to their work. And one enjoyable part of working in the company is that we work as a family.
good,It is a great place to work when we had strong good store managers but when we had bad ones all they did was threaten our jobs daily.  They are always changing their minds on a daily basis and too many chiefs running around. I did learn allot but their is to much favoritism from up above is who you know that would let you get away with anything and the hard workers got thrown to the curb.
good,Walmart's workplace is constantly doing something and can be stressful at times.  If you work in CAP 2 you will have a physical job and can be pretty tiring when doing a big truck or having to load and unload very heavy products.
good,"Be loyal, respectful, on time, honest, and work hard everyday. My experience at Walmart was decent, I met good people and hard workers like myself an made great friends while working there."
good,"I was a district manager for Walmart for 12 years. It was a fast paced work environment that made the days pass quickly. I enjoyed my job and the interactions with the employees and the customers. However, after 12 years my position was eliminated and the only option I had was to take a demotion as there were no comparable positions available. At that point I decided to leave the company. This was also at a time that they had just changed the CEO and were implementing changes to take advantage of the employees and try to make more for the company."
good,"Most mornings you have a morning meeting going over the past days sales, events going on in the store, what went right , wrong and what we can do better. There are a lot of training modules you go through dependent on your specific position."
good,Each work day was different. I learned how to work in congested areas under tight requirements and how to adjust with changing situations. The mist difficult part was working with dysfunctional systems. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you could work without someone over your shoulder.
good,Walmart was a great company to work for. Co-workers were very nice as well as the customers. There was always something for me to work on and to improve in the store which was a great thing for working hours to keep myself busy during work hours.
good,Most work days were about 4-7 hours. The managers are all pretty easy to get along with & they are very fair.  The HR Dept is very helpful. It was a pretty enjoyable place to work overall. I really enjoyed it.
good,"La experiencia que me llevo es que existe siempre un líder que puede llevar a su equipo, y dentro de mi jefa directa me tocó la experiencia bonita de enseñanzas que gracias a eso me fui superando a mi puesto actual con el apoyo de mis compañeros."
good,As an apparel associate it was a steady paced job...but when you tried switching to other departments you couldn't nor they let you fix you r schedule that you knew you could work
good,"Clock in, start your role. watch your time, take your break, start back on time, go to lunch, be back in time, finish up your tasks, take your last break, come back on time, clean up your area, check to see if manager need you to do anything else or help someone finish or clean up their tasks, check your schedule, clock out on time. Overtime maybe available during certain holidays."
good,I always gave %100 percent working with walmart and sometimes other associates cant appreciate that. Some like to talk about you and they also love changing policies every few months and cutting employees hours. My friend is full time right now and they are telling him to go back part time or they will fire or move him
good,"One of the biggest assets WM has, is their people. They also are open to people moving to different area's of the company to broaden their skill sets."
good,"Job too far from home , don’t get brakes on time , managers overworking cap 2 workers  breaks be at 4pm but don’t actually go to break until like 5-6pm"
good,"I loved working for Walmart the last 3 years I was there. The customers were great, my fellow employees were awesome . The management could use some work. Some of them aren't team players and they go against what they promise for you. Advancing in the company is very hard"
good,I provide customer service to shoppers in the store and perform grocery merchandising which I like.  The changing hours are the most difficult thing to handle.
good,"Fun atmosphere, I just personally did not find it engaging or interesting for me to keep working there. Would recommend it for those looking for a good starting job."
good,"Its a great job to work, but the management is unreasonable and doesnt except new ideas for efficiency and would rather yell because you're not doing something right rather than being reasonable and showing and kindly explaining what to do the correct way"
good,nice place to work for ONLY if they would keep there word. was hire as full time but only gave us 25 hrs a week. very hard to get a pay raise I work there over 5yr and got 3 pay raise but they wasn't that much.
good,"I was working in the back inloading and it was pretty much laid back. It wasnt any stress, but it was a pace yu had to keep up with so you wouldnt throw off the next coworker along side of you."
good,Good place to work but mo oppurtunity for long-term career in my field my long-term career goal is to be able to manage my own HVAC company. Why Walmart is a good place to work to get a paycheck but opportunity for advancement for me I just don't see
good,Ok place to work. To many allowances stripped recently. Can make a little more quarterly if the DC makes certain numbers. You work very hard for every dollar you make!!
good,É uma empresa que possibilidade a estabilidade porém deixa muito a desejar em questão plano de carreira e salários.
good,El ambiente de trabajo con otros asociados es muy bueno existe mucha comunicación entre departamentos y todos se apoyan entre si
good,The manager were horrible weren’t helpful. They were never there to help the employees. The manager pick and choose who to help and who not to help. They hired anybody which wasn’t good because the place started to become an unwelcoming place to work
good,"My time at walmart was spent at a neighbourhood walmart and it was a great place to work at the time."
good,"It was a cheerful job. I greatly enjoyed interacting with customers and the opportunity to assist them with questions about the store, helping customers, especially mothers with little children in obtaining a shopping cart to use, especially when a specialty cart was needed."
good,I've worked for Walmart for almost 5 years.  Two different stores. 4 different department manager positions and multiple sales associate positions. I always want to learn everything I can.
good,"All the employees can call in from work and take a day off. When a lot of people called in, i do they're work and more and I hardly have time to finish mine. The rest wil be leftover for the next day and they will do it again the next day."
good,"Walmart is a very diverse place to work. You meet many people, even from other countries. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the public,especially with language barriers.  But at the same time our customers can make the job enjoyable. The diversity that is brought in by our employees is another enjoyable part about work."
good,"-I would typically work in the backroom, unloading and loading trucks. I also stocked shelves with merchandise and placed displays."
good,"Could be a bit more understanding with situations that occur. But overall pleasant people to work with. Some take pride in their jobs, but are in a sense overlooked and dismissed if one doesnt have it quite right after bit. It's a bit upsetting when trying to get you job back but your not excepted when all circumstance go unheard. It's also disappointing when to try to apply at another Walmart yet not giving the opportunity to start fresh."
good,Co works good to work with. Management needs more communication between each other and give employees more incentive to stay. Support and Department  managers are good people to work with and for.
good,"Management are always friendly and show that they care about you. "
good,"•Constantly maintain a positive attitude and enjoy helping people"
good,"Sin duda lo mejor de esta empresa es su gente, los compañeros con los que día a día trabajas"
good,Management was too busy trying to advance to store manager. Kept promising promotion or advance in department manager training. They never kept their promise.
good,Learned team work and quick troubleshooting skills. Fast paced work environment with little help at times. Gained valuable skills concerning customer service and setting up merchandise.
good,"working at Walmart is challenging, positive attitude and once workaholic attitude are much needed if u give ur 100% and force ur self ahead it is helpful, worth the experience."
good,When I was getting  layaway ready and set up for the season. I was told i would be the manager for Layaway so after everything was do and I got my team together. I came in one day for work and was told the store manager gave the job to a CSR that was back from having her baby. they had no other place to put her that would jive her the same job she had before. So I quit after hearing that same morning she had a meeting I made and didn't include me and I was told we are going to be pardners.
good,"I had fun working there"
good,"Working at the DC side of Walmart was a great introduction into logistics, material handling and supply networks.  I would personally not want to work as a laborer in a DC but working in management was a great opportunity to work on building large team management experience and understanding the operations side of retail."
good,Una empresa muy buena y con flexibilidad de horario para aquellos que estudian.
good,"It really depends on what personality you have and the different ones you have to work with; also when the head office make policy changes.  Otherwise, it is not a bad place to work for."
good,"las personas que te encuentras suelen ser excelentes, aunque tambien no tanto, existe la promocion."
good,"Cashiering is probably the easiest job there. You're expected to keep your area clean, register and impulse items, and you will likely move around when breaks are being done. Good management comes and goes, but that's service industry."
good,No chance for re-hire as a cashier. Walmart no longer using cashiers. They are going to ALL self check outs. I think this will be a BIG mistake for their business.  Many older customers don't use Self Check Out. They want a cashier to ring up their purchases and bag them. Many will go to Target and Aldi's.
good,"great place to work, co-operative team work,  Its fun to spending day at work.Chance to get knowledge about different products."
good,Walmart was a great company to work for but my schedule prevented me from truly reaching my potential there. But the environment was great and they pay well.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, I got to learn a lot and at a fast pace. The customers were great and so were the coworker. I liked the how they can cross train you and you are free to advance as fast as you are able to or as slow as you want."
good,"I like daily contact with customers and build rapport with them.  Also, I like working with my associates because they are very helpful.  However, the management team are not that helpful to their employees needs."
good,"A typical day at Walmart I do returns, zoning, top stocking and freight/stocking. I've learned a few things from my department manager. The hardest thing to do is get it all done in a 6 hour day. But I like my job I like to do freight/stocking."
good,"they pay is ok, but not enough to survive on. if you are young without children this is a good job for you. or if you not a single parent. but overall pay was ok"
good,It was a fast paced environment and adaptability was a needed skill due to the ever changing environment. Worked with great people around me who were willing to help me grow.
good,It’s a nice place to work some days and I do oil changes and tires and batteries.  I like helping the customers and my manager I have she great to work with.
good,unfortunately corporate has taken control over a lot of what management is doing in the stores. i feel there wasn't anything consistent between management and their employees. the employees though are great in teamwork and come off very family orientated which was nice.
good,"Great place to grow, and advance."
good,I unload trucks and stock shelves. We work together as a team and enjoy our work day for the most part.  The hardest part of the job is when you have call ins.  But all in all it is a good place to work.  I just need more hours and a better salary.
good,overall was a good place to work the associates are great to work with and management is very well handled to. the training they provide was some of the best i have ever had
good,"Walmart is an average place to work. Oftentimes it feels like you do way more than what you are paid to do, but the camaraderie is among the best I've ever experienced."
good,The company used to be a caring Place and you had fun and enjoyed going to work and being there it’s very hard to focus on the customers now because the company focuses on everything else but the customers
good,Management isn't the best right now and there are a lot of problems that occur. Good work environment with a lot of smiles and good people. Isn't always the most organized place.
good,As far as retail jobs go this place is an acceptable place. The breaks seemed fair with 1 15 minute break and an hour lunch. The benefits of the discount seemed worth while as well.
good,"They always made you feel welcome as a customer or an employee. A normal day at work would consist of just doing your job and having fun, if you had a bad day they would cheer you up and get your day to seem a bit better. Management was okay, they didn't really help out much and when they did they weren't very nice about it."
good,Its an alright place to work. It just depends on what department you get placed in. Some departments have too few people and they get overwhelmed with customers.
good,A typical day at work is not too bad. Wish theses were better managers but as far as gaining different opportunities there are many. You can switch to different areas
good,As a cashier the job requires a lot of standing and customer interaction. I learned how to operate their Point Of Sale system. My managers were great to work with. They were happy to answer any questions I had and were generally enjoyable to be around. The culture is relaxed and focused on saving people money. The hardest part of the job is the high volume of customers that come through a checkout. The people I work with are the best part of the job.
good,Clock in a scheduled time. Walk up front to CSM to be directed on where to go till your first break after about 2 hours. Someone comes over to relieve you and you take your first 15 min break head back to next person for a Break or Lunch. Then the next person comes to relieve you for your 30 min or 1 hour lunch. Then time to clock out after an 8 hour shift. Hardest part of my job is helping a customer who is upset. But I talk them through the process and help them anyway I can to resolve the issue. the most enjoyable is seeing all the customer friends I have made and seeing there faces when I notice them and say Hello.
good,Try not to get worked up over the little stuff.  Most employees ate willing to help you if needed.  The store manager will take time out of her schedule to assist employees.
good,"Walmart would be a great place if management wouldn’t have respectable people that they choose, take in more role of a manager than a buddy, and to give equal opportunities to al and not just to those you talk to all the time."
good,Es una empresa muy prestigiada con buen ambiente laboral y buenos horarios.
good,Production job that is changing day to day and the building as a whole is a bad place for advancements andthe workforce is not a happy place with the changes being made.
good,"Good job"
good,I think maybe it was my experience at that location and or my Cap2 position. I plan on working for another location...overall i would tell anyone give it a shot. To each it's own.
good,"Tends to hire part-time people at low wages to avoid offering benefits. But it's a nice, clean, friendly workplace. Probably a good starter job for some younger people."
good,The people I work with our wonderful for the most part its just we are short staffed but a nice break room some days are less stressful and others our hectic
good,Walmart gave me many different skills that I will be able to transfer to any career I would want to go. I was always kept busy. The hardest past of my day was there was hardly consistent.
good,"They promote learning through doing, and help to develop the required skills."
good,Hard to work with people that don't want to do what their job consists of. Everyday going in you had certain managers that would do the job right then you had others that really only wanted to b there for a check.
good,"i learned a great deal working with Walmart.  Many meetings and long hours"
good,"Fun and quick pace workplace but keeps you busy in on your toes.  Decent pay,Decent amount of hours,And a great place to be all around Without any problems"
good,it was  good i had fun working there the manager i had was not really good but the head manager was good they could have done a better job scheduling and approving time off
good,It’s a nice place to work but your on ur feet all day and only get three breaks. You can’t leave your register until some one relieves you. Sometimes the csm’s forget and you could be stuck on th register up to 20 minutes over time
good,Worked overnights and it was fun and busy.  Always work to do which made the time go pretty smoothly.  Always had a good crew to work with and the team helped each out to finish the tasks of the day.  Friendly group with made the nights go by faster.
good,"I am grateful for Walmart for the years of lessons I went through while working there. It has taught more about how to be a sales associate compared to when I started. There are days when I can say it was a good day at work where nothing went wrong, but there are days where things get out of hand and nobody is in control. Being in those situations, it has taught me how to stay calm and collective while handling the situation myself, so for having that ability I give my thanks to Walmart."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for,if you get yourself hired on fulltime.Dont get hired on part time then try to advance to fulltime status.The process takes too long.If you already have job experience,just go straight for that fulltime status."
good,"Overnight as a cashier and stocker, wouldn't recommend it as a first job.  Good pay for the work but not recommended if you are going to school or wanting a normal social life."
good,Every store is different due to management.  What you put in is ultimately what you will get out of your experience. The ability to grow and move up in the company is one of the best perks of working for the company.
good,"Entiende que no tienen flexibilidad en los horarios, son bien rotativos. Te ajustan el horario escolar, pero últimamente se ha vuelto un problema. Si estas en busca de crecer profesionalmente, no hay mucha oportunidad. Desde el cambio de c.E.O., Se ha perdido los valores de familia que tanto describía a la compañía."
good,"the hardest part of the job would have to be the angry customers encountered frequently usually for something out of my control, working on a time crunch, working short staffed"
good,This company offers many benefits for your family if you do like to shop at Walmart.  You have the ability to work part-time and weekends as well.  Full-time employees receive additional benefits.
good,I always tell techs in training to start somewhere that will give you more of a generalized experience in pharmacy so you can see the spectrum of work that we do.
good,"Long work days in the logistics warehouse. Learned a lot about logistics and change management. Work place culture was decent, but it was a good old boys network. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my teams succeed."
good,I enjoyed working at store 1502. People were nice and welcoming. Learned a lot in a short amount of time. Technology was used highly in the store. Thanksful
good,"Everything is decent for the money your getting paid for: the only thing I thought really sucked was linch break because it was only two,  twenty minute lunch breaks"
good,A great place to interact with other associates and consumers. Motivated and enthusiastic place to work. Employees have a willingness to help others. Respect for the individual is a major focus at Walmart. Strive for a clean friendly work atmosphere. Unfortunately management tends to give conflicting assignments. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the customers. The hardest part of the job is fluctuating work schedule.
good,My time at Wal-Mart was great very if they hadn't demoted me I would've stayed working there I had built alot of relationships I still have today great job
good,"A typical day is monitoring the self-checkouts and helping customers. I clean my area, restock bags, and pull customers into the self-checkout area when it gets slow. I learned better time management and how to work under pressure better. The management is polite for the most part, but could sometimes be more effective at taking care of some of the problems in the store and listening to us if we have concerns. Most of the people get along, although like anywhere there are cliques and gossip. The hardest part about the job is trying to get everything done myself when there are not enough people scheduled and the self-checkout area is completely filled with customers and five of them need help at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know customers and connecting with them."
good,A regular register day the shift managers would always walk by your register or have a short says on store information.The hardest part of the job was to view your line it get's long. You coulx move up fast and most mistakes are noted but forgiven. Eggshells.
good,It's a retail job. Lots of opportunities for growth if you want them. Work with all different types of people. If you dont like 1 area of the store there are a lot of other options for you.
good,Usually ran new freight and zone surrounding departments to make sure everything is in its rightful place. The hardest part was dealing with unruly customers and being yelled at for not knowing a specific product.
good,"Walmart is fast paced retail business. Retail is going through a lot of change and Walmart trying to find its way in a changing environment. Company is investing a lot in technology,will it pay off for a better customer experience. Time will tell. Expectations of the Associate is changing quickly. There will be a lot of turnover for those that cant adapt."
good,"Fun to work for enjoyed the other coworker, Just never enough hours to live. I always enjoyed going to work. Most of the time the people you worked with were always happy and fun to work with."
good,As long as you take the job seriously and do the the work your assigned you’ll be fine. Otherwise Walmart is a great experience to expand your cultural and work knowledge
good,If you enjoy working with a Team of confusion this is the place for you. They will work you too death because they are always short staff. A very diverse work force with many different cultures.
good,"É uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, mas com alguns pontos negativos, que necessitam de melhoria"
good,The job was fast pace and it gets tiring . Standing up your whole shift and ringing out long lines . Takes a long time . Only got a 15 minute break for your long shifts
good,"A good place to work to expand you skillset. managers are very flexible with working around your schedule. Diverse group of individual who all contribute in different ways,"
good,I like working at walmart but everyday its drama from one shift to another. Management and other associates never appreciate anything we do but quick to jump on things we do wrong
good,"Me pareció que te brinda Muchas oportunidades, pero necesitas de terceros para poder superarte"
good,"fun slow-paced work environment and can be faced paced but still a fun job, management was always asking how my day was and would be really helpful if I had any questions."
good,Working at Walmart is pleasant. Co workers are nice and friendly. Breaks and lunch times are fair. The only thing I didn't like at Walmart was the work hours weren't steady.
good,"Typical cashier job. Worked there during university and they were accommodating to my class schedule. Enjoyed working with my coworkers. Customers could get to you after awhile, unhappy and demanding and then you could have a manager come and assist."
good,I like working with some of my co worker and the some customers. So manager where okay. It was fun sometimes. It was stressful mostly of the time. Put I work better under stress.
good,they kept us very busy liked working there pay was good and people that I worked for were nice. management was ok and days I worked were very flexible
good,My job was cashier I the Lawn and garden never liked the job it was for a younger person  but I loved the customers.and I don't have anything else to say.
good,A typical day coming in was fine.  Sometimes I would be clocked in for 5-10 minutes and have no idea where I am supposed to go. I would sometimes be working a 8 hour shift work 4-5 straight hours and not have a 15 minute break. Some co-workers are cool to work with but not all of them.
good,"A part time position is usually offered upon hire.  I advanced to a position that although is still considered an Associate, paid more per  hour and offered a higher salary. If you show willingness to put in the time, and work hard at your job, it is often recognized."
good,My position at Walmart was orderfiller and it was fast paced and required attention to detail. I worked in the freezer so I had to be able to handle the cold while being proficient.
good,"the hardest part about Wal-mart is dealing with rude customers. Also, the assistant managers usually don't know what is going on most of the time. On the other side, wal-mart is like a big family."
good,"Walmart is a task-oriented environment. You pretty much work with a team in any department of the store. There are no hard jobs there, but they can be tiresome or time-consuming. The best part is the pay rate and but there is much to be desired for the discounts."
good,"My usual nights at Walmart mostly involved clocking in ""back stage"" (in the back where offices and stock was) and waiting in the break room to be gave the nights run down and whom would be doing what.  In most cases for my position and training I would operate a forklift or towmotor and possibly some pallet lifts. Other nights I would be moving stock and or entire side counters (shelves) as well as tearing down old non usable counters and replacing them with new ones."
good,Es una empresa con una buena politica laboral.  Y donde se puede crecer
good,This place makes me lose faith in humanity. Like I legit have no faith in humanity from working here. Only reason im still here is for the 13.75/hour and the fact that I need a job
good,"Working at walmart was fun, lots of interesting people.  Friendly and helpful.  Was hired for fulltime and then not given fulltime.  Needed benefits.  Pay wasn't enough to support my family."
good,It is a lot of room to grow. It is a great teaching experience and opportunity to learn new positions. The scheduling are flexible but if its not whats needed you could loose hours.
good,On a normal day I would stock and get the baskets from outside. I got breaks as they where needed and also was able to get along with coworkers during the work day.
good,I won’t say I enjoyed Walmart’s entire staff but I made some of the greatest friends there and that made coming to work seem slightly better.  I thought most managers were rather respectful and understanding.
good,Good place to start your career.  Not internally stable enough to sustain long term employment.  Constant job eliminations and realignment of job responsibilities.
good,It was a fun job because there was always people around to talk to and have friendly conversations with. never a dull moment. plenty of breaks and length of breaks(paid lunch hour)
good,"On a typical work day you won't see many customers for at least 1/3 of your shift, then a rush of people will come in. The hardest part of this job is dealing with difficult customers who don't know how to act properly. The most enjoyable part however, is the hour long breaks you get for lunch."
good,"Being a cashier with a customer in front of you and needing an approval or change or an over ride. Depending on who was working depended on how fast you got what you needed. At times if feels like the co workers that got assisted faster where the people that were ""friends"" with the csm/managers. Other times working there it was fantastic. Everyone was nice and willing to help. But it seemed like the cashiers were the ones to ask if you had any questions about what to do. Most csm/managers seemed like they had other things to do than to answer questions. However, it looked like csm/managers had a lot to do, due to there not being enough of them to go around during the busy times."
good,I enjoyed my job at Walmart I was a deli associate I work very hard card stock and coolers cutting cooking but also they would call me to unload trucks and stock shelves move things around building caps because I wanted to work
good,Maintain supplies on and off shelf. Make sure employee are within their area and keep shelves tidy and stocked daily. Make sure display is presentable
good,from my experience the workers were great and had awesome attitudes. nothing was to hard and if you ran behind someone was always willing to lend a helping hand
good,I loved working for Wal-Mart I ran a register did customer service desk the money center and I also worked in the accounting office for them. The manager team has changed alot.
good,It was a very fun experience while I was working at Walmart . It was always a chance to learn more and more about the history of Walmart . While working there I learned things about the company I never knew abt as a customer very interesting.
good,"I learned a lot working for the company as far as merchandising and team building. I have worked in several stores in different states and not one had the same atmosphere as another. I really enjoyed working around the customers, helping to find whatever it was they were looking for. The most difficult part was transitioning into a new store after moving/transferring to a new location."
good,"This company provided a lot of knowledge .. I learned merchandising ,computer based training along with academy training.. A lot about sales and consumer based sales.. Learned a lot about community needs and plannining seasonal and geographic within the community.. Reading planograms and using company equipment in order to do price changes.. Company also provided e commerce trading.. This company has shared a lot of knowledge for me.."
good,"Working as a greeter seems easy, but since your having to check Receipts there can be a whole lot of yelling.  If having to smile at someone while they scream at you doesn't appeal, I would suggest looking elsewhere.  This job hasn't been bad to me, and the time off with the management I've had has been more than reasonable.  But after that, it all kinda goes around a bit."
good,Easy tasks but can be hard work like working out in the weather during all seasons rain or shine. The easy part is all you have to do is push in carts and provide great customer service.
good,"Everyday is different depending on the work load that was done prior to your shift"
good,"In the beginning I was excited to join the Supervising Team. I soon discovered how the expectations of the Supervisors were somewhat unrealistic. I loved working with my team, but the management team needs to be evaluated."
good,It is a fun place to work. It can get stressful if we dont have enough help. Which seems to be happening a lot with the new scheduling. Often we are short handed. There is always something to do
good,Nice place to work but they keep changing their policies all the time. The staff is fun to work with but can be very deman6at times and want you to work any place that you know how to do
good,"The job was hard, but paid fairly well. I think they punish workers to much for productions/safety rules. The turn around was high due to people in fear of losing job or being fired for production requirements."
good,You will never be bored and will always have something to do which in my opinion is a perk because it can get pretty boring when there is nothing to do.
good,I love the people I worked with. Pay was okay Hours sucked aND where constantly changing or getting reduced. Management is often too stressed to properly assist and tend to over use associates that prove capable while other do near nothing with no repercussions
good,The co workers were amazing! It was like a 2nd family sometimes the management would be lacking but they always fixed were they slacked off at truly loved this job
good,"Overall Walmart is not a terrible place to work. It can feel dragging at times, but if you find some like minded people and develope a good working relationship you can have fun and grow. Walmart is currently trying to compete with Amazon; so expect new and exciting opportunities. There are often opportunities to advance, but do note this is from the sometimes extreme turnover."
good,"Overall good place to work.my crew was very good at what we did and received very little supervision. Asst managers were stressed and panicked alot during last 2 hours of shift, afraid they wouldnt get all tasks done.  We always got the job done."
good,its a great place to start off after coming out out of high school to work on. helps you grow yourself and takes the best out of you. I had hired just to have experience in my resume and look i already have five years in it
good,"Walmart was a good job during college, it helped me to pay for books or even a course or two. The pay is decent and the house are flexible. The only hard part of the job was dealing with unruly customers, and trying to keep things from escalating."
good,They had me working by myself doing a 2 man job and then yelling at me when I didnt get something done. It's just a lack of staffing. Overall it's a decent place to work at just not in the deli.
good,"Overall Walmart is a good company to work for if you are just starting to work. The job security is not great, and the training is not on par. The policy is constantly changing, and they are not appropriately enforced all around. Some policies are contradicting, while other policies are overly observed. The time off, and rules for absences are changing frequently, and not for the good. Turnover is too high, but it is expected due to demographics near a military installation."
good,There was a lot of videos to watch but well worth it. Very friendly employers it wasn't very stressed like some jobs out there. Good discounts good hours and pay.
good,"I'd start by checking what the store needs, find food in back, put on pulley and put in store. Then, load up more food to put out. Also, helping customers in store and facing products so the store would look organized. At the fitting room I helped customers into the fitting room while watching their carts. Answer the phone for customer service about store products or it would be a section of the store calling me for help. If no customers at fitting room or phone not ringing I'd help put clothes away in store while keeping an eye out for customers plus listening if the phone is to ring."
good,"A typical day at Walmart can vary. Some days are fast paced and stressful, while it can also be slow and relaxed. I learned how to effectively communicate with my coworkers by working together to help customers and complete tasks. I also learned how to successfully communicate  with customers to help them with their needs and problems. The most rewarding thing is having a customer leave with a smile. Management has always been complicated to me. There are some managers who push me to do my best and be successful, while some just simply are far too intimidating to approach with questions. The working culture is amazing. Many of my coworkers and I get along fantastic and always focus on teamwork. The hardest part of the job would be trying to simply stay calm on an off day. It is normal for both the customer and I to have a bad day, and sometimes that can truly show when communicating with them. And too look past those moments could always be difficult. However, the most enjoyable and rewarding is helping a customer successfully. May it be helping them find a product or recommending a product. Even if I do not have the ability to successfully help them my main goal is to always have them walking away with a smile and a positive attitude. That is the most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job."
good,Sobre panaderia en verbal y ejercitado con un poco de presision en las personas representantes de dicha en presa
good,"dealing with upset customers on a daily basis, with the occasional junkie or shoplifter."
good,"Very fast paced , have to be patient and good with customers . Very stressful and overwhelming. Management sucks at times like bad but over all it’s good ."
good,Promotes within but promotes the wrong people at times.  Management works long hours and can be put on overnight at anytime.  Management is never on the floor.  Management has done down hill in the last few years for sure.  Corporate has taking a lot away from the store to control.
good,"Working at Walmart as a stocker was pretty good. Being a stocker meant being a hard worker, for the reason that you must: unload the truck, Pull the line, Organize the line, Stock shelves and features, as well as being fast paced. A normal day would sometimes be stressful because you have a lot of gm carts to do. The hardest part is just the beginning because you must memorize all of the isles as well as what is In the isle. Walmart is enjoyable as long as you do your job."
good,i monitored and ordered ammunition cleaned and inventoried merchandise built  displays zoned merchandise helped customers choose best products for their needs
good,management is very strict about tardiness even is you call in to say you are gonna be late. so just be late instead you are going to be still written up in the end.
good,Many structure changes coming. Great people. Very fast pace. Must be technologically literate. Able to manage total store.  Manage operations and accounting. High turnover.
good,"A typical day at Walmart consist of running fright, and stocking floors, and helping customers."
good,Wal-Mart is not good with teaching employees their job. You kind of learn a lot on your own. It is a fast pace job and you need teamwork to stay ahead.
good,"While I enjoy the work and my associates, the help of upermanagement has slowly degraded. Myself and the other CSMs do the best we can with what we are given sometimes the days get too stressful."
good,I think Walmart workforce is something that needs to be worked on. Stability from within. I think Walmart strives to be better but they do not always consider the concerns.
good,The Walmart I worked at is one of those places that are open to everyone and the management tells every worker that favorites are not in the agenda but I have seen for first hand that they do choose favorites and if you are not one of there favorites then the cards are stacked against you and that happened to me so I left the day i over heard them talking about me getting fired.
good,Walmart has become more and more demanding about doing more with less people and as a result costumer service has suffered.I feel that Walmart has relaxed it's respect for the individual.
good,Night Stocker and I stock freight in many departments. the work place was ok expect for the under manager. Trying to do allot of freight without getting help to complete heavy lifting task.
good,"A very good place to work. Wonderful people to work with.  Lots of advancement opportunities available to you if you work hard and do your job. If your looking for a lot of raises, it wont skme qoth this place. Normally you will get a 2% every year."
good,"Fun , fast pace environment , and benefits when I was working there it was long days. You Had Long enough breaks. It's alot of work when your team doesn't show up"
good,The employees were extremely friendly and I loved all of them dearly. We were a family and we looked out for each other. It may be a different story for someone else but for me everyone was nice. Some of the managers however are wishy washy and don't know how to communicate very well AND have some kind of attitude. (Not all because I liked a few of them a lot but some had attitudes that made Walmart a hard working place) Luckily I was mostly surrounded by my associates which is why I liked being there. The pay is good and depending on your personality and you knowing what you're doing most customers treat you well... except the ones who are miserable... which of course isn't your fault at all... but yeah it's ok working there I guess.
good,"Aprendí demasiado, pero el ambiente general (no de mi área) era demasiado pesado, junto con el salario que es muy bajo. La cultura laboral era muy buena diría que excelente pero el personal de RRHH no aporta mucho."
good,"I really enjoyed working here overall. Compared to my points it sounds like a bad place. The store I last worked at having worked at 3 Wal-marts was one of the worst. However they were also in a transition of management, and it was steadily improving. While I personally did not want to be a manager there were plenty of people who were that were unable to pass Wal-marts Standardized test and promoted. This is bad because 1: Some of these people were not fit for the role. 2: This caused issues with people who were capable and could pass the test but were not liked by one member of management and so were looked over all together. Other than that the job is easy, pays well, gets plenty of benefits. I would recommend working for Wal-mart! Met wonderful people and customers there just don't let the environment bring you down it's not the best!"
good,The company was good to work for and the starting pay wasn't bad. The store I worked for didn't allow a set shift or schedule for the front of the store which was one of the reasons I left. Within other areas of the store they allow set shifts. The job is okay it's the customers that are the downfall of the work.
good,"a typical day would be running the cash register,customer service,stocking shelves,unloading the truck,i learned how to deal with differant types of customers,how to do a certain amount of work on a timed schedule,management was ok but changed alot"
good,"its a nice place to work for and my manager takes good care of his people,  the work place culture at our store is very good compared to the other store we do cover each others back and work as team and are like family."
good,"Walmart is a great place to learn job skills.  If you plan to go into management, it might be just the job for you.  The only reason why I left is because it was becoming too physically exerting."
good,Great learning experience learning how to read blue prints and set up stores and all the management was very helpful patient and had knowledge of everything overall the best place
good,Walmart wasn't a bad place to work but it didn't match up well with my schedule.  I enjoyed the people and environment.  Everyone knows what Walmart is about.
good,I liked my experience at Walmart the pay and benefits were good and the possibly of advance seem very easy. The only issue I had was that I did not know what my clear role was at the job. The managers also could not come to a agreement on how to schedule me.
good,At times the job could be very stress but also a learning experience as well as far as time management when you have to have everything done in a timely manner and also your communication skills when your dealing with customers
good,I applied there over the summer to have a job during high school. Overall the management at Walmart wasn’t too good. It was hard to get a day off. I had a bad back at the time and they didn’t work with me that good on that
good,"Trabaje para la firma atravez de una empresa contratista ,fui seleccionada por mi buen desempeño para ingresar en planta permanente cuando hubiese vacantes ,excelente clima laboral !"
good,I actually enjoyed my job working with Walmart. I always love to help people and being able to do so and make people smile was such a joy. I believe there could be more bonuses offered but that's my opinion. The company itself is great just the store I worked for had poor management.
good,"some of the managers were very nice but since they rotate managers every few months, I ended up getting some managers that weren't friendly and treated the employees unfairly"
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart and was promoted to customer service representative within 6 months of being employed there. Their benefits package isn’t the best, but it’s better than others."
good,Gives you a career to be proud of until you retire. I thought I was ready to retire at 65 but now want to work at least part time in a close to home job.
good,I ended up at walmart to help finish my college education. I enjoyed the night shift more then I ever thought I would. It was physical but I was able to finish school because of it.
good,Walmart was a great job I learned so much from it. It was also was my first job which was amazing I spent a lot of good hours in the company. It was a great experience.
good,"Es bueno el empleo, aunque no nunca conocí a mi jefa todo la comunicación con ella era por correo, las herramientas posta dar la correcta atención a los clientes eran deficiente"
good,"A typical work day is quite busy but, there are a lot of upsides to working with them and some downsides. You do get a 10% discount but, that is only on certain items, not everything and they aren't as flexible on specials as they say."
good,Customer services jobs are stressful. Hardest part is trying to figure out what the customer wants and finding it for them. Management can be great or difficult just like any retailer.
good,"Fast paced cooperative environment where people lean on one another. There can be lapses in communication from management to other employees , but the job is consistent and predictable most times"
good,Its a friendly place to work. The customers are the best part of the job. Helping them out was what drove me at Walmart. The store was clean and everything was easy to find due to the neatness.
good,"With the many and frequent changes in management come many and frequent changes in procedures and expectations.  What may have been satisfactory one month will be unacceptable the next. The month after that, reverts back to the original expected goals or even higher expectations."
good,"I enjoyed working in the different departments because it helped me to learn where things were so when a customer would ask me where something was, I could take them right to it and tell them about it as much as I knew, or I would get a different associate to help them."
good,Walmart was a wonderful place to work I loved my job it was late a night and i had another job during the day time. .so i had to quite in order to keep my day job which paid me more at the time
good,"it was okay i know its walmart but they did not manage their time wisely .They never helped out the cashiers, started cutting my hours big time......."
good,"It was fun helped out others when I finished my work . Overnight stocker, stocked, cashier, and I was on the floor helpin others out.. zoning the shelves"
good,"Working for this company for a long period of time, I have found it to be a fast-paced work environment with different management styles which help the worker adapt his or her working style to meet the needs of the employer."
good,I work as a parable as folding and replacing clothes and other item also pulling patters on to the floor to clothes on shelf or on hangers or make sure sale sighs is in place
good,Great day to day routine. task at hand was not that hard. great customer service is definitely needed . morning meetings were eventful. Great room for advancement and ability to learn .
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers. Showing them where everything was and getting them what they needed in good timing.
good,the job was very fun an full of excersie from unloading trucks day in day out .Putting stock away an connecting with different customers was the most enjoyable part of job most hardest part is when there is to much stuff on truck but always got it done.
good,Walmart was job that u have to exercise good customer service skills and patience.The culture of the plant needs a lot of work but all in all i enjoyed my job.
good,The location that I worked lacked essential teamwork to be a super profitable store. Most of the associates lack focus when assigned a task. The store I work at also hires too many underage associates. This puts unnecessary stress on customer service managers. Help is slow to come.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if your looking for something that fits your needs. "
good,Great company just had a few comunication problems and poor mangment skills. Some days are stressful when company come in town. And the rest is very laid back.
good,The best part about this job had to be my co workers and the job environment.The bad part was the bad management. The hardest part was watching the customers. The most enjoyable part is the hour break.
good,Fast-paced and you need to pack boxes and stuff item inside the box by the order that is ready. The items will go down a conveyor and slide down slots and then placed in slots to be packed.
good,i worked in the shipping department at walmart distribution. It was a very labor intensive position. Had to work long hours but the pay was worth it. Staff was great and management listens to there staff
good,Working here was always interesting because you were doing different things each day. The coworkers were nice and so were most of the managers. They could pay more so families can live comfortable.
good,A typical day would be to unload a truck and stock the shelves. I learned to read SKU numbers and face off a front. Management was available. The work place culture was very large. The hardest part was separating the product to the area in which it went. The most enjoyable part was the learning of different things and meeting new people.
good,Walmart offers great starting pay. The highest pay around. It offers schedule flexibility. Plenty of room for growth in the company. Also has great associate benefits.
good,"Management is helpful most of the time. A good place to work with multiple departments to choose from. Most of the associates you work with are friendly and easy to work with. In all, a good company to work for."
good,Is a  Ok  place to work. I feel Upper Management does not stand behind you when you need them. Is is a good first job for a young person getting start in the workplace. They do work with associates going to school or have other jobs.
good,I enjoyed the customers cause I kept my dept up and they enjoyed going to the shelf to get their items and it was in the correct place with correct prices
good,A typical day can be anything from crazy busy to slow and quiet depending on the area one works and time of day.  I learned that putting in a good days work gives me much satisfaction.  I always felt appreciated by mid management … my supervisors were always considerate and flexible.  The hardest part about the job is the lack of staffing necessary to complete tasks timely.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping other associates and customers with their needs.
good,I enjoyed my job at Walmart.  I was a Dpt. Manager of a Tier 4 Store.  So I had little help in my dpt.  This made it extremely challenging but kept me very busy.  I enjoy that!
good,"Busy on Sundays, the first of the month and every afternoon! Nights are usually relaxed. My coworkers were very loving & gave me a warm welcome when I got hired there."
good,todo se debe hacer conforme a una rutina establecida
good,"I do want to go back to walmart only different department like cashier or aparrel, working for walmart it is not really hard, but the manager is the problem. If walmart call me today and ask me to go back to work I would do it. I like working and I like talking to people.I did put an application at walmart."
good,Beginning this job I was very nervous and received a lot of hours. Working until 11 pm frequently on a weeknight was difficult including the fact that I was very invested in my extra curricular activities.  Attempting to change my hours and the amount I was working was a difficult task. I met a lot of great people at this job. I made plenty of friends and I am enjoyed going to work sometimes knowing I was going to be with them. I was unable to continue this job after 6 months because my extra curricular activities were overwhelming which I was later unable to continue completing my shifts. Overall Walmart is a great place and I wouldn't mind going back.
good,The day starts by down stacking. You learn where almost everything is. The hardest part is not having enough employees. I think the most enjoyable time is meeting new people.
good,"I loved my job, it was fast pace and the customers were amazing. I enjoyed helping people find what they needed or the older customers that just needed someone to talk to."
good,I felt like they over worked me because i was a good worker but on the tasks i needed help with i would never get the help that was needed i mean i love the people in the store it was just the managers  not professional
good,"I can't speak for every Walmart but where I am in small town Iowa it was a good place to work.  "
good,"Most of the time I worked at Wal-Mart, I worked at night full time and went to school during the day full time."
good,"The job required simple repetitive tasks in a quick paced fashion on a usual basis. It was not horrible but unfortunately draining to be doing the same things over and over again, this being personal opinion. The management were very nice and supportive of learning and helpful to assisting new or unknowing associates with tasks. Overall it was not the worst place to work."
good,My time shared with Walmart's electronic department was pleasant due to the fact that it gave me many skills. I was able to use my skills and knowledge to help my co workers and managers.
good,"I enjoyed my time working here, the lack of benefits and low pay caused to me look elsewhere to support my family. Otherwise, no issues with anything and would go back now minimum wage is higher."
good,"At first Walmart was a fun and fast pace, then I went to chino the FC and the building does not feel like you work for Walmart. The managment team needs to get the hole Walmart cultur."
good,I liked working there. Had lots of friends who were co-workers and we even got together a few times to have fun. Loved there was a smoking break room. And always liked checking customers out every time I worked!
good,"When I began I started as a personal shopper, and that was a great position. Although that position was great they had to switch my position because the lack of hours. Then everything after that began to start going down hill. The management began to play favoritism, and would help the people they wanted too."
good,"Stressful hours "
good,very task oriented and goal oriented and you must meet task time requirements. multiple managers on shift makes it easy to approach and handle work complications. hour luch was very nice. holiday discounts to all employees was also very helpful.
good,"learned houw to use a gene! work place was every relaxed, was on tase most of the time. needed to always ask for work and wait around on managers and team leaders"
good,"worked for them for over 5years and not much progress was made, raises and pay is not good. Barely over minimum wage, only way to make a living is to go straight to management."
good,Great for learning and gaining experience. Great managers. Hardest part was lack of time. Best part were the bonuses based on store wide statistics. Yay.
good,"Warehouse associate at Walmart Logistic. Performed all warehouse laborer duties including picking, packing, counting, record keeping, and maintaining a clean area."
good,I enjoy my job but have a problem with the lack of accountability. The overall work experience is okay but I feel more workload is given to the people known to accomplish more rather than being evenly shared.
good,Apply at your own risk! Long days and nights. No balance. Company is top heavy. Poor training. Poor management. High turn over rate. Great benefits and discounts.
good,"Great company to work for. Hard to advance, but good culture and work hours, people were also great to get to know. Loved it when I became full time.."
good,"WalMart is a great company and has great values. The only recommendation that I would recommend is look into the area that you are getting involved in. The area I was in was extremely restricted regards to advancement. You are allowed to transfer to other areas, but there are times that management makes it extremely difficult."
good,"It was a fun place to work but it was very stressful and the point system they have in place is ridiculous. I learned how to control my emotions as this place will test them. Mostly the customers, The hardest part of the job is the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers. I really loved them they were really cool people."
good,"Decent benifits,the management wasn't good the last year or so. We'd previously had some very good management but they moved on.i learned a lot there about how to run my department, I wish they didn't stiffle your creativity."
good,Empresa bastante transparente com seus funcionários e com boas possibilidades de crescimento profissional.
good,Fast work culture with an emphasis on protocols and time stamps to meet certain goals. A friendly work environment that helps you get acclimated within the work culture and teaches you the ability to interact and help customers with ease.
good,"This job is just what it looks like. It's easy to do, but can get stressful in a heartbeat. Customers typically are pleasant, but it can be hard to process a rude and belligerent customer with only 15 seconds until your next customer. Overall, this was a great temporary job for me transitioning back into the workforce after taking time off to be a mom. I wouldn't recommend it for long-term."
good,"As a cashier, i learned to make sure to stick on top of things and make sure things are done correctly. Time is of the essence because the more people you can get in, the more people you can also get out."
good,"Buen entrenamiento para personas que inician en su primer trabajo, sueldo bueno. Mucho compañerismo."
good,"A empresa garante um auto aprendizado e também oportunidades diversas, porém exige a iniciativa do funcionário para isso, têm boa cultura só precisa ser aproveitada."
good,Retail is not for everyone. The things we have to endure on a daily basis.  I thoroughly enjoyed working retail. I've always had the drive to do my best everyday.  Helping Associates and customers on a daily basis was very satisfying.
good,Walmart is a great place to work.. great benefits and pay. Only problem I had was with how the store was ran.. Managers acted like the didn't care about you.
good,It was an ok place to work. Some days were good others not so much depending on which manager was on during your shift. The management definitely played favorites with employees
good,"I learned quite a bit from this job. I loved my coworkers here and we got along great. I used my discount card all the time. The hours were great for being part time. I was late (5-10 mins) quite often due to the distance from my house but surprisingly they never said a word about it. I have social anxiety and depression which makes my life kinda difficult but my CSMs took care of me when I needed to have a moment to calm down. It was made a little difficult to keep up with things with inconsistent information and changing rules. I did have the occasional customer who decided to go off on me as well. Having anxiety its really difficult to handle situations like that. I do like the fact that Walmart closed for Christmas Eve. You could never count on your lunch being on time. It would be super late to the point the store could get fined for you not taking it... Which then you get in trouble. That makes no sense since you were not allowed to abandon the cash register. Or too early. During my time here we also suffered the consequences of other cashiers who were just hired and stole from the cash registers. We used to be able to carry around a clear bag but after that they took that away and we were not allowed to carry anything. I just don't think its right for the whole team to be punished for others actions, especially if they were newbies. Toward the end of my time there I had to take medical leave. I got to a point I felt I could go back if I didnt lift anything too heavy. I called to let them know what the dr said and I was told I can not come back until I can lift the normal"
good,"I work in the pharmacy and our manager is amazing, simply put!"
good,..............it’s a good place to work just wish the pay was more...............and advancements was a lot faster .......would make a good part time job
good,"Muy buena empresa para capacitar gente, con bastante personal"
good,"Challenging, team driven culture of associates working together to get the job done.  Varied shifts to fit a person's needs whether FT or PT.  Profit sharing was a great perk."
good,I enjoyed the majority of my time working here. The co-workers are amazing. Over the last few years there has been a drastic change in leadership style that I didn’t enjoy as much although I understood it. They are trying to stay relevant in the future and compete with amazon. It feels like they cared about the people in the stores doing the day to day operations less. I will forever be grateful for everything I learned from them.
good,There is no typical day at walmart things happen and change all the time the hardest part of my job is dealing with an upset customer the most enjoyable is when I can satisfy that customer
good,i like it was just the people i like working it because i was doing what they told me and i’m a fast worker and nobody taught me i learned on my own everybody had
good,"Fast paced job, loved working with team members and customer's. I'd work for them again. Good place to work. Caring superviors. There is always something to do, never a dull moment."
good,i was very bad treated at wal Mart maybe language barrier was the cause of my struggle i am convince today it was my problem they did not understood me.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart it was an experience I would have loved to extend it took me some time time to get where I was but I was happy progression is everything to me
good,"The pharmacy can be a very fast paced environment 1 minute steady or slow the next. you get to meet a lot of different people with a lot of different personalities. the actual work itself is not difficult,learning to adjust your personality for certain personalities that you encounter would be the more challenging part. For the most part my Pharmacy family is a team that works together to try to get our patients prescriptions out on time and correctly."
good,"good job for students or for those wanting to make extra money. Hours are flexible and people are cool to work with. got to meet cool people , and had cool managers."
good,"typical work place"
good,I loved working for walmart and was glad to add the experience on my resume loved the managers i worked for we all got along with no problems.id go back .
good,"Some days are harder then others. Holidays can get crazy, but the job its self was relaxing. always finished assigned tasks on time and helped other teammates when they where in need"
good,"Generally it has been a good place to work, but that can change quickly with changes in leadership.  Management can often vary or choose not to allow for certain flexibilities or options provided by the company in general - flexible schedule and remote work is often only allowed if the manager agrees with the option.  This does not seem to be based on anything logical such as associate performance, ability to do job other plces than in the office, etc.  There is no formal mechanism to provide upward feedback and I’ve not seen leadership put much focus on it even after several requests."
good,Same as working anywhere else with customer service. you have your good days and your bad days. You just have to make the most of it every day. You get meet new people all the time also.
good,There is always something to do at Walmart. If all your tasks are done we always have zoning. Zoning is something to do to past some time. After zoning we have reshop baskets; reshop baskets is everything that the customers did not by sonwe have to work it back to the shelf.
good,"routine changes everyday"
good,"This job is great for experience and resume building. If you work hard, you can promote pretty quickly for such a large company. It's like any other large corporate job, some people are great, some aren't."
good,"good place to work if you have a good manager. customers can be terrible because walmart lets them get away with whatever they want, shrug it off dont let things get to you."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-mart, I made a lot of good friends and I enjoyed my managers. I didn't recognize a large window for advancement in position, but I wasn't in that frame of mind back then. When I quit to go in to the military, I was asked by many supervisors to come back, but I knew that I was ready to move on from that time in my life."
good,"The chance for advancement is always there. The more you learn in each department the better off you’ll be. Customer service is super important, that’s one thing Walmart needs to focus on again. It’s a good company to work for, they take good care of their employees."
good,If you haven’t had a job yet this is the place to get started. Fast pasted and you build your social skills by helping customers and working with coworkers.
good,Having exerience working at Wal-Mart I can say that it's deffinatly a place that has many opportunities and potential outcomes. The work environment is friendly with a positive attitude towards product management.
good,"it was a nice place to work as a cashier, fun as an electronics dept associate, but it was only a temp position and was not even full time. wish it couldve been perm."
good,very pleasant people to work with. very few issues. if i had any issues with a schedule i could bring it to my manager and they would assist me with it.
good,Walmart  es una empresa con oportunidades de crecimiento en los puestos.
good,Good place to work. Easy to get alone with other employees. Very understanding with family obligations. But working in the garage at such low pay makes it not worth it.
good,"Working in the produce department, stocking, assisting customers with locating merchandise.  Cleaning Spills, assisting other areas in the store where it was needed."
good,"More often than not we already knew what we were doing on Maintenance when we came in so it was just a get up and go after the meeting. you'd make sure to do the undersweep before first break, after first break the customers would be out of the store and we'd go about the task we were assigned until the end of the night. If we finished our task we would usually check in with everyone else to see if they needed help getting things done and if they did then we'd work with them to get it all done before the last hour when the store opens. during the last hour we would do safety sweeps and make sure the store is in good order before clocking out on time."
good,"It was my first job in Canada so I got the chance to learn and practise my English . Also, it help me to build my confidence. I would love to be able to work again at Walmart."
good,"My shift was set to 1-10 five days a week. I would go straight to the back room and set up pallets with a team of 6-9 people. Unloading trucks was the next thing we would all do as a team . After trucks are done everyone is sent to a zone to stock the live freight. Best part of the job was the bond I had with the team, we really did become a family in that backroom. The hardest part of the job was getting all the managers demands done on top of getting our own work done . Great workplace for a social person like me just poor management."
good,"physically demanding, high energy job; inventory, merchandising, stocking,  daily meet; cross training to assist other depts; vendor relation building"
good,It’s a great job for starting off. If you could move up in the store I say go for it. You meet people new friends. Once you get there your job title basically doesn’t mean anything because you’ll most likely be everywhere.
good,"good place to start working until you can move forward with search"
good,Nice place to work for if you can keep up with the fast pace of the job.  The breaks seemed short considering you were on your feet for 8 hrs.  The company expected you to bag dog food with groceries or automotive oil with groceries.  It didn't matter as long as it got bagged and it had to be bagged within a certain amount of time.
good,Ok place to work for but work many hours good for someone who doesn’t have kids.. they have good benefits.. some mangement don’t follow sams respect for the individual
good,Managers helped as much as they could to help employees understand on which job they were doing. I learned how to zone and clean an area. The hardest part of the job was making sure employees are kept quiet.
good,A very friendly workplace most enjoyable part is the people. Management poor though they don't train properly job not hard at all very simple unload truck stock freight. Pay is ok but could be better
good,The job is a job and it's not for everyone. It's fast paced and customers can be a bit ignorant towards workers. Also it's hard to keep up with tasks because not everyone is working with you to finish those tasks. People slack off or don't even do their jobs.
good,"No me gustaba la forma como nos trataba la maestra, era siempre pura grosería y cosas, pero lo demás bien"
good,"Nothing much to say here things can be difficult here, as in the people I work with and by customers themselves. People can be annoying or mean which makes my job harder and annoying to do at times."
good,"Work schedules are flexible and could change every week. I receive an hourly pay rate with a 1 hour scheduled lunch. Company strives to have superior customer service, which is our main goal."
good,"Managers were not always there when needed, "
good,Management does not allow you to complete one task before giving instructions on new tasks. Associates are constantly being pulled to do other jobs outside of their job description.
good,I have worked for Walmart for over 10 years and I really have learned to love working for this company. This company has taught me a lot about myself and gave me opportunity to grow. I am now a certified Pharmacy Technician where I make decent money and have good benefits.
good,I would stay at Walmart if my coworkers weren’t rude to me as much as they are. Some of the managers are also kind of rude. The manager I work under now is awesome. It has good pay and really flexible house. They also work with school schedules!
good,the only really good thing is the pay everything else is stressful its not all bad they give you nice breaks but there management was not great and they played me out of a lot of bonuses.
good,Walmart has its benefits some benefits are paid time off. paid time off is great. Walmart also have a goid benefits dental health and etc. They also provide 41k which is good for a career at the job.
good,Walmart is a fine place to work.  My only complaint was working as a CSM on Friday nights with cashiers that were not old enough to sell alcohol.  I would have to run from one register to the next all night long and customers were not happy.
good,I really enjoyed my experience at Walmart . My only complaint would be that i had no idea i was just a seasonal worker until they told me my assignment had ended
good,La ventaja de trabajar en Walmart es que siempre estas ocupado y el tiempo de trabajo se pasa muy rapido. Es un buen empleo para comenzar pero no para toda la vida.
good,"Most of the Managers at the Walmart that I worked at were all buddies with each other so if you complained about a manager for harassment, they ignored your comment almost completely. The coworkers I had kept the place fun and inviting. The hardest part of my job as a cake decorator was that I had three different managers telling me three different things, like they were never on the some topic. Along with that, before I quit, they hired this untrained cake decorator for me to train and she was absolutely irritable, she never did anything by the book and brought in many complaints. So that showed me that they were too desperate to hire someone for the job, that they didn't care much for qualifications."
good,the work there was very hard at times especially around the holidays. the managers would take advantage of your work ethic and make you so more work to help pick up slack from slow workers.
good,"A typical day at work was to always run back in forth to different registers to help with a question or deal with a customer. I've learned to always make sure you always help or customers. The hardest part of the job was the managers. Every time we were backed up on registers, the managers never came to help like they were supposed to. My biggest important part of my job was team work."
good,"It's a good crew to work with and the job is Fast paced but still expected to do your best work. You meet alot of diffrent people and do diffrent jobs, so you always are worling and that makes the time go quick."
good,"The workplace culture is stressful and multicultural.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning skills."
good,I would rate Walmart 4 stars and also say it is a good career to try to advance your job into different areas of store. The environment is kind of relaxing at times but little hectic when heavy crowd comes in and at times some of customers can make your day or night easier for the employees
good,"Learned a lot from my co-workers, had the support of many of them for being a female in the automotive field. Management needs to collaborate better but for the most part things do go pretty smoothly"
good,"Working for Walmart was definitely a wonderful experience. I would say there were a few bumps in the road, as there are with any large corporation. I enjoyed working with my fellow associates and made several lasting friendships."
good,"Pretty decent place to work, you get a good amount of hours and get paid very well, and you can make some good friends at work. Its pretty chaotic, but in a relaxed way. Stress isn't much at all compared to a lot of jobs out their, and everything is pretty straightforward so you don't have to worry about things getting to complicated."
good,Stood door greeted people coming in telling them Welcome to Walmart I loved that part and when they left I would tell them to have a blessed day everything
good,"I worked as a cashier. The job was pretty basic, ring out customers while being courteous and working at a good pace. Straighten your surrounding areas in your downtime. When it isn't busy the day will drag though."
good,Good job just need to make hours more available for people who want to work management was great 9/10 but could always back you up if you had a problem with something
good,"The days are pretty long depending on how many tasks you're assigned. It requires a lot of team work and physical effort. The majority of the employees are friendly. But there are some employees that enjoy gossip, slack, and use foul language. Also some members of management are rude and have a over all bad attitude. Employees are not required special training when it comes to departments, therefore we can't answer all customers questions and concerns in regards of specific items. Sometimes the task are too much to handle, specially when there's not much employees. But overall you get good break time periods and lunch. The pay is also considerable."
good,"It’s a level entry job. You will constantly be on your feet, so expect to work hard. Absolutely great for experience as you can be cross trained anywhere though it may take time. You do not always need to wait six months and apply. Good communication and teamwork is very important in a fast paced environment. You may have your odd hours and may have a week that consists of closing shifts depending on where they really need you. If you do your best to help out your team and what is required of you, you will make many people happy. Just do your best, admit when you’ve messed up somewhere, and try to learn from it. Cheers!"
good,Walmart is a staple for everyday life it has everything it has its moments that you want to pull your hair out but some of the people you work with make it bareable. It is like they are your second family
good,"Start out pay is $11.00 an hour. It’s fast paced depending on where you are in the store. Some what strict rules. Overall not a bad place to work. Raises that they give out are based on a percentage 0%, 2%, 4%. They only really give out 2% raises."
good,"Aprendi a valorar lo que nuestros padres te dan, por que hay gente que no tiene estudios y suele tener mejor puesto y tu que estas preparado te tratan como un cero"
good,"Foi a primeira empresa em que trabalhei, foi muito importante na minha vida profissional, tinhas profissionais muito bons."
good,. I had a great experience working for Walmart. It a experience of a life time recommend anyone to give Walmart a chance to advance in life. Walmart teach you how to be a leader. You learn to work around different types of people.
good,Productive and fast paced workplace. The typical day changes everyday. You can do returns all day or work on a special project. Some weeks are the same while others are vastly different.
good,you can take all day to do something or 5 minutes and nobody would ever know the difference. training wasn't great but i'm pretty intelligent so i got by
good,I was able to get along with most of management. I was not able to advance into in a management position no matter how many times I had applied for the positions.
good,"I enjoyed working, my co-workers were very nice and I looked forward to being there.  Most customers were friendly and I was able to answer any questions for them.  I had a review annually of my performance. I was able to learn the expected duties and progressed very quickly to learn new tasks."
good,A day at Walmart is  typical. One minute it is fast and the next it is slow. Most days it is steady. Everybody tries to help one another if time permits. It is a learning experience everyday. Enjoyable
good,"Rather not get into a full review at this point in time, as I am still working there.  I enjoy my job, I push carts, help customers with loading their vehicles, and enjoy engaging with the staff."
good,"Good place to work love the culture and what the company stands for in a whole, but I Feel the Culture gets lost in the chaos of the many managers involved."
good,"Wal-mart is a good company to work for, However, the associates are very negative about anything management would say or do. I really felt that the management personnel tried extremelu hard to meet everryone's request. Personally, I am a verry optimistic person and feel that as an employee I am being paid to do the job that management request of me. Overall, it is a good company to work for."
good,"My manager was amazing, I pushed hard even through the cold to gather all the carts, had to clean the washroom as well, and the pay was the only reason I left."
good,"The co-workers usually are all very nice and welcoming. I’ve gotten along with most of them."
good,"Walmart is a great, consistently changing company. Very fast paced. Valuable work etiquette was gained while working here. The hardest part is not getting sucked into the drama in the workplace AND keeping calm when you have a angry customer."
good,"Greet the customers,  ensure the customers receive the upmost professional/ productive environment they could receive.  Things I've learned working at Walmart was patients, neatness, and timely order."
good,Great place to work minus personal experiences of a hostile environmental. Miscommunication was a big issue. Although overriding the schedule for adjustments is allowed management disagrees within departments on what an appropriate override would be.
good,"I would come into work and clock in. I then reported to my supervisor to see where I was assigned to work for the day. A lot of times where I was assigned would not be where I would remain, but that was ok I enjoyed doing different assignments. That meant I would learn even more about the company and be more efficient. The most enjoyable part of my job was making customers smile and feel like people/family."
good,"every job has its pros and cons. this job is like any other. there are things i love, mostly my coworkers and things i bare, the management team. we make through another year of retail holidays and hope for the best."
good,"Overall Walmart is a good place to work. They support teamwork and encourage interaction between their associates. they are just starting to give a quarterly time frame for full time, which will help maintain a better balance between home an work, and to ensure set schedules."
good,"La cultura laboral de Walmart es muy rica en cuanto a superación y capacitación de los asociados, a nivel gerencial esta puede perderse un poco dado al nivel de responsabilidad."
good,"I loved the job itself and some of the people that I worked with. There was always things to do, but management had obvious favorites and treated those people differently. Those who weren’t at the top of the pole would sometimes be put down or complaints against other associates would be ignored."
good,"i really enjoyed using my stocking shifts at walmart as my personal gym. plenty of heavy lifting and cardio to get a great workout in. the pay is reasonable. coworkers are generally a mixed bag, but if you are a self starter and dont mind picking up the slack, that isnt a problem."
good,"Managers too quick to coach, and no positive reinforcement for a job  well done. No choice of days off. Too much multitasking.  Hour lunch was way more than I needed"
good,"i was hired as a lube tech, in three years i became shop foreman. this was the longest job i ever had and if they would've been on time with raises and advancement i may not have resigned."
good,I enjoyed going to work the management and team was awesome to be around made work fun . Just wish I had more time to advance more loved being in that place in north Kansas city mo .on boardwalk ave beat walmart ever.
good,"I have worked at a few other corporate retailers, and Walmart has been the best of my own experience. However, the major thing I feel is lacking is the leadership training. There is very in-depth training on policies and procedures, but very little training about effectively leading and mentoring with integrity. Lots of focus on negative reinforcements and very little positive reinforcements, within the culture of the company."
good,"If you're completely open with your availability and don't have anything tying you down, Walmart is the place for you.  If you work hard, you can advance quickly.  If you have a family and are limited on what hours/days you can work, forget it.  While you can put in for what you are available for, you won't be guaranteed  any hours.  Contrary to what the ""haters"" want you to believe, Walmart does provide good benefits."
good,"There is a lot of favoritism at Walmart. The managers have their favorites and they don't mind letting you know it. After being there for like six months you get to pick your availability, but management wants you to work during the times you are unavailable. Then if you don't work they count it against you and then you are fired. Even if you have a doctor's note, Walmart does not honor the doctors note. I think this is a policy that needs to be changed a little because life happens outside of Walmart. Walmart would be a better place to work but there should be no favoritism and honor people's health reasons for not being at work."
good,Gaurnteed check every two weeks. For sure hours and some good people. If you having a bad everyone will have a bad day. Just a easy place to go to work and go home.
good,"Sales associates also answer customer questions about policies, services, and products. Help customers find the products they are looking for also serves as a typical, daily responsibility of sales."
good,"I recommend this place to people for work,good opportunity for get customer service experience. You can improve your communication skills because working with other people."
good,Fun to work as team. Learned a lot of experiences from my co workers and managers. Hardest part of the job is when the 2-3 truck comes at the same time. Most enjoyable part is to create new friends and have a good relationship with customers.
good,"For those who tough it out in Walmart, I am sure they feel quite happy that they have.  I, however, found a different situation far more dismaying.  There are those folks who find their happiness where they will."
good,I loved this job! Gives great benefits. Pay was great. Every job has problems but they try their best to solve them. I would return to this in a heartbeat!
good,"The work itself is fulfilling and straight forward. Whatever your position, you can expect thorough computerized training and management is usually available for any concerns. "
good,I had friends that worked there with so I get a lot done and i got to meet a lot of new people! Stocking shelves is easy. It was a little fast paced but it was up to you if you wanted to work fast.
good,"I learned a lot from my three years at Walmart. retail is a seemingly easy but in depth at times and any job dealing with the public can get pretty stressful but at Walmart i learned how to be patient, professional and kind to the public and help them with every issue they may have."
good,"empresa dinâmica, ofertou muitos conhecimentos, com cultura e benefícios bons."
good,It’s a great workplace but obviously wasn’t the right work environment for me. I was always harassed by other employees because they didn’t like me. So I ended up leaving.
good,"I recommend trying to work in the Photo or electronics department. It's pretty chill. If you decide to be a cashier, it gets super busy. Just be brave little one and don't let the customers break your spirit."
good,"do you wanna sweat, because you will anyway. Its an ok job if you dont mind the heat or cold as they only have fans and some lame heaters but from where im at its a decent job, just not one id hold onto forever"
good,"La mejor escuela en cuanto a retail por el volumen y el tipo de mercancía que trabajan, sin embargo crecer dentro de la compañía no es por méritos laborales y /o intelectuales sino por influencias."
good,"Good people, great experience. Plenty of adhoc requests during the day. The atmosphere has changed over the past couple of years, with all the layoffs, good people are afraid of losing their job. Other than that, the culture is great, there are a lot of very smart people working to make sure Walmart succeeds."
good,If you are young and looking for your first job Walmart is somewhere  you should look. They will train you to do whatever job you choose and you will learn how to do more than one thing.
good,Its a business it was ok I would go back if they had openings. I loved the pharmacist. I really loved the customer . When I worked their I got the most flu shots for the month.
good,It was amazing it also was my first job i learned a lot working their and had the opportunity to work with just amazing people. When i worked their i learned how ro do almost every job there.
good,"they hire at 11 dollars an hour and pay an incentive for overnight hours, sometimes you will run into overtime hours which are paid at time and a half."
good,"Fast paced, customer oriented,  got along great with everyone and customers. To control you thoughts and not expose them to customers  to stay focused on goodcustomer service."
good,Pretty nice job if you enjoy working with the public. Typical shift I would clock in do some training on the computer and then go find out what register I was on and take care of customers.
good,"Working at Wal Mart was also a great experience for me working at both locations in Wilmington,NC(Monkey Junction) and Southport,NC(seasonal) was a great learning experience working with people."
good,"i loved wotking at walmart, fun people to work with very fast paced, i started out as a stocker at night, we would go to the back and pull out pallets with all the products on them and go to our areas, and put all the stuff on the shelves in right order, it was hard , had to lift some heavy things,but all in all i liked it"
good,"The work is easy to understand"
good,"It was a fun work experience. I made some great friends and there weren’t too many stressful days. Sometimes the customers will push your buttons, but most are super sweet"
good,"I do not wish to write a review for this company due to the meaningless seperation that was performed.   It is insane to see that a company can eliminate a bunch of loyal , long term people from their positions only to turn around and hire new ones at a different name for the position. (developmental co mgr)"
good,I am cross trained in multiple departments.  Management utilizes my skills everywhere but I do not get compensated for that work.  I have no problem working where ever they need me but you can't have me do a management position on the minimum pay I am receiving.
good,"I liked working there for a long time, it wasn't very hard work either. I loved the people that I worked with most of all. It just didn't pay very well for me."
good,Overall it was a good job. You get rude customers at times but you can get that anywhere you work. The hardest part of the job would probably have to have been when there are a lot of customers in the store and the lines are crazy long and they have basketfuls. It sometimes can be intimidating and puts you under pressure to go faster.
good,según la cultura de la empresa todos están obligados a llevar un dialogo amable
good,"assembly mostly bicycles and furniture. help with hardware sales, stock and mix paint. help in other departments such as, toys, seasonal, home office and chemicals. stock and bin incoming product. help with returns."
good,Depending on what department you are in is how your day will go. It is fasted paced. you have to deal with customers. You get to talk to people all day.
good,Deli was a easy to learn job always busy n waiting on customers was stressful at times depending on who u worked with training was easy Id recommend Walmart definitely for a job n pays very good
good,"worked overnight at walmart. the best part about that was you could get your work on the floor without the steady stream of customers. at that time the management was pretty good. learned a bit about customer service. the pay was not at all a cost of living wage and also, you couldn't afford the health insurance."
good,"We always had a typical eight hour work day. The managers were good people who taught you what you need to know and help you out when you need it so that the job can be done correctly. The Over night shift is very busy. The hardest part about the overnight shift is the time limits you have to get things done before the store opens up again, but because it is  the overnight shift it is a little bit easier getting things done because you rarely get customers because the store will be closed. The best part was having a great team to work with."
good,Walmart isn’t like it was back in the day. They are straying away from their core values & what the company was built upon. Back when their company founder was still alive.
good,"I listed my available days and times when I started. I made adjustments when needed. However, the management would always schedule me for days and/or times when I was not available to work and then held it against me when I couldn't be there."
good,"walmart was a fairly good place to work. most of the customers were nice, most of the bosses were nice, the work i did was hard but never boring.on most days u would go to the floor and see what items were needed then go to the stockroom get the items take them out and put them on the shelves.the hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items like chicken and brisket, and the cold, its very cold in that dept. the part i liked the most about working there was the feeling of getting all the stuff out so the customers have a choice of items to get. the bosses were pretty good you always have 1 or 2 that needs to practice on their people skills at times. i learned to do the very best you can in any job."
good,"work your entire schedule, don't call in sick a lot, you will all get along great."
good,I worked there  for almost 3 years very good worked almost never called off  of work .  didn't  get any decent  job promotion at all. I did my best to help coordinate with team efforts and goals within the company still didn't help my over all situation.
good,"The pay can be better with more hours. Benefits are great, managment is usually good, There is also drama but you get that anywhere. It was a pretty easy job."
good,"The most enjoyable part is meeting customers that come in every week. They remember a friendly face and that what makes a great community. A typical day is to understand the scheduling, work on audits, have short concise chatter on the walkie for any additional information about certain tasks,keep customers happy and open and close registers."
good,Walmart store 3627 was a job that IU liked. My immediate department manager was a wonderful person (senaca). He provided a stress free environment. The upper managment was a bit standoffish and not personable.
good,"Worked in grocery online order."
good,"I work in the ecommerce part of Walmart (online grocery and site to store) which I feel is the best department in the store. The hours of operation are great, along with the staffing."
good,"Walmart a good company, there was a few hickups thats changes a employees perspective on Walmart. Walmart likes to have employees do more work then what they are really paid for."
good,"Wal-mart is a high stress but fun, fast paced place to work. I loved my time spent there and there is ample opportunity to move up in the company! They have a position in the company for every kind of worker and every type of learner."
good,"As we're working, we get told to work faster while our team is already going as fast as we humanly can. The management want too much from their associates and with that happening is why most of us either wanna leave or already left."
good,Walmart is very unique. better communication needed between Walmart and Marketing Co. Sam's Club LOVE IT. Great job for a giving person. Free samples!
good,Good place to work. Everybody watches out for each other. Productive skills builder with training programs. Training for managers was beginning to be used when I left.
good,"Since I worked all over the store, my typical day varied. As an unloader I would work 4 shifts evening shifts. As a sales associate in electronics or the garden center, I would work either midday-afternoon usually, and as a Customer Service Manager I usually worked day shifts. It could be hectic at times, but the enjoyment that I got from helping customers was very satisfying. Management could be a pain at times, but for the most part when you were able to get your job done, they left you alone. As a CSM, the responsibility of the front end, getting in 35 audits for all of us, and coaching for improvement of cashiers that were falling below expectations, as well as keeping our scorecard around 90% could be very challenging."
good,"It was a fun place to be, but the management was a little bit incoherent towards employees, the hardest part of the job was the strain the work had on your back if not lifting boxes properly. On the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job was the climate of the workplace."
good,"Learned a lot about retails management, retails operations, working with diverse people and professional backgrounds that helped me to better myself for the future."
good,The most enjoyable part was working with associates from all cultures.  I learned to listen and provide timely feed back to either associates and customers.
good,The work was within the realm of what i enjoy doing.  We have so many customers come through from all over the world.  The work was steady.  The staff was helpful and fun to work with.
good,Started as deli associate but it changed to include bakery to be called production associate. Fast paced compaired to rest of store. Severely understaffed but expected not to get overtime. Management played favorites and did nothing but stand around and do nothing not even order stuff that we had been out of for weeks. Not like this at all stores but similar. When trying to get out of department they'll stonewall you because noone likes to transfer in.
good,"I would say Walmart is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you going to get from day to day. Some days are smooth sailing and you won't have too many issues and other days it could be very hectic definitely when you're trying to be in 10 places at once. This job is definitely for those that can manage their stress and not become overwhelmed easily. Learn that each day is a new day and what happened the day before no longer matters (in most cases)."
good,I love my job and did it to the best of my ability and when I got hurt and was out of work and then my short term disability needed to be extended then they let me go. And furthermore I even went through the steps to be ahead of the game.     I was pregnant while I worked there got put out on maternity leave and a position came open for dept manager. I was notified of the opening and I went back at 6 weeks instead of 8 to try to get it. Then after the process I was told I was not qualified enough and this happened two more times.
good,te cambian de departamento segun necesidades. Aunque no quieras
good,"Empresa estable pero debería de mejorar su sueldo ya que su salario es bajo. "
good,My time at walmart was fair and enjoy my time. The staff was great and meeting new co worker of all kinds of race and different disability was legit! They treat the people solid but the management could've been better with helping to get more hours and a steady schedule.
good,My last position at Walmart was a Cashier at the front of the store; This was a fast paced work environment. My main responsibility was customer service and keeping my work area clean.
good,It was a good place to work laid back. Loved helping the customers. Enjoyed my coworkers only problem was management. They didnt do thier jobs like they was suppose to
good,"If all I needed was part-time, this would be a good job. But I need enough money to pay the rent and this job doesn't pay enough to do that."
good,"The people you work with are usually amazing and down to earth people. The customers can be a HUGE pain, but the pay was decent and if you were scheduled a decent amount of hours per week the paycheck was awesome!! But that's the thing, hours are always all over the place and never the same. One week you could be scheduled 35 hours and the next 5 hours... and management are not very understanding."
good,"I want to work at Walmart because i can makes more hours and get good payment. "
good,Wal Mart DC is a fast paced environment where employees can do well for themselves if they perform. Their is opportunity to advance which is nice for someone looking to grow with a company.
good,"pays well, gets you in shape, but its a huge learning curve. No matter how in-shape you think you are, your body is not ready for this job, so it will seem very difficult at first, but will improve over time."
good,There are not many jobs in rural America so when they are open you take the job. Worked here for three years in apparel and also in overnight stocking in soft lines. Great place to work if management is consistent for day to day
good,"a very good place to work, but does not give room for career advancement . hours are been cut time to time, workers are always let down on a daily basis."
good,"Wal-Mart gave plenty of breaks and my coworkers were amazing people. I enjoyed management and they worked very well to fit my schedule. The hours are flexible, and I received plenty of hours while working there."
good,Depending on the types of people you work with walmart can be a great job. They haves up their rate of pay since I worked there so that is nice. I enjoyed working there.
good,Wal-mart does allow you to promote up quickly as long as you show you can do the job. You can develop a work family really quickly and that is the most amazing part.  Over the last 11 years so far I have learned so many different areas of the company.
good,The Walmart working environment was good most of the time. The location of Walmart made some days rough because of the homeless people harassing everyone. Aside of the homeless people many customers was very nice and thankful.
good,I enjoyed it while it lasted. i would of loved to continue.  It was definitely fast pace.  there was always something new to learn and do.  the fast pace is where all the excitement came. you're the last face customers got to see.  it always made my day when the customers i interacted with left happy.
good,"With working with Walmart, a person is able to express their opinions or ideals with other associates. It is a company that offers a lot for their employees in and out of the work hours. A lot of possibilities given to associates or their families with relocation, discounted trips, or advancing in the company. Associates are able to know their managers on a one-on-one basis and it helps for their understanding of who works for them and vice versus."
good,It's at times stress full because you have a time limit to put up merchandise but you get to relax and talk to other coworkers and work is even more enjoyable when you coworkers have become your friends it makes work not so stressful
good,"I would not want to move up in walmart. I enjoyed working for walmart when i first started, but now it is not a fun job. I plan on being there until i find a new job."
good,A lot of freight that has to get done in a short amount of time. Not enough employees for the workload. Nice environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting off
good,The benefits are great!  You receive 10% off items.  You receive 401k and stock options and them match so much a month.  The eye and dental insurance are the best.
good,Walmart had lots of cashiers that need training on how to be customer focused and ready to help. The people there would always say they did not know the answer to simple questions. Ok for a teenager to start.
good,It’s a decent and easy job and can be fun but reminds me of high school but you get a hour lunch and Offers stocks and health and life insurance 401k and a two percent raise every year lol
good,Work was challenging yet attainable.  I learned how to organize my task and my time. Walmart tends to hire like minded employees so we all got along.  I found it hard to move up in the company.  I enjoyed my accomplishments at work.
good,"Working at Walmart, I never felt overly stressed, and I always felt well-compensated for my work. Walmart's individualistic style of  work allows for employees not to feel smothered by their managers, and it creates a comfortable environment for employees to exceed at both individual and team-based assignments."
good,Not much to say - enjoyed the position and employment until recent changes to their scheduling policy. I am unable to continuously change my shift through the course of the week and new policy has people working multiple shifts across a work week.
good,"Typical day for at Walmart stocking and pulling freight"
good,Always busy but good work environment with great people. Front end management wasn’t so great. Worked with employees schedules. A lot of favoritism from front end manger which made it uncomfortable to work with certain people.
good,It’s pays alright but the manegment was terrible and so was the hours I was forced to work. Overall it wasn’t as good as I thought it would Ben and I find myself dragging myself through the day
good,I've enjoyed working at Walmart in general.  I'd just would like to have weekends & holidays off. I miss spending most of the holidays with family due to his having to work the holidays.
good,"As the overnight manager I was responsible for executing all facets of the process.Oversaw entire team of stockers, maintenance staff and their supervisors, leading to increased sales."
good,"When I started here, I enjoyed the fast-paced environment and how easy it was to move up from Cap 2 to Department Manager.  However, to keep up with their competitors, a lot of positions were eliminated due to changes that were implemented to ""make the job easier"".  Several departments were combined and the positions offered in replacement would've been several steps down."
good,I’ve had a good experience working at Walmart. I was givIn flexible hours based on my personal needs and was treated fairly between coworkers. My supervisor was nice but still made sure everything ran smoothly and that everything was done on time.
good,I had a great opportunity to learn may things at Walmart including processing high volume transactions for customers.  I enjoyed working at WalMart during my youth and think others should too.
good,Walmart is a decent job with good pay and good management. I enjoy working here because of the benefits and good hours. However I am looking for a new job to fit my career I am pursuing.
good,I worked for walmart for about 5 years. It has its good and bad days. I enjoyed working on the register. Sometimes I had to work at customer service which I didn't like to much. I had customer who would look for me to just check them out.
good,"Walmart is a great place to get your foot into the door of success. Depending on the management and staff, will determine your experience for working at Walmart."
good,"Being this has been 20+ years ago since I worked here, it was a fast paced environment at the time, my job role was in the electronics department where I was responsible for stocking, merchandising and customer service."
good,"Working there was not a bad.. Was at three different stores over like 15 yrd."
good,"My day is very busy, i come in and check my emails, look over the metrics that are sent and customers comments. If there is any negative comments i call the customers and fix the issue. the hardest part of my job is trying to be in 15 places at once. i don't have an asst. mgr so I'm doing their job plus mine. The best part of my day is seeing my customers and their kids. their kids are always happy to see me."
good,Recommended work environment  for high school students or graduates. Fun and friendly work spaces; Bendable hours like say you are going to school or have a second job they are willing to work around that
good,I learned a lot working for Walmart. I made friends who happen to be regulars and long time friends. They ask constantly how I am and ask how my day went. The customers and most co-workers were like family and most still are. I truly did enjoy working here. I just moved on to something I thought would be better financially for me.
good,"Cap bins, run freight, section work, price changes. "
good,"Current operation of stores can't be as envisioned by Sam Walton. Big on mottos and image from corporate.  Not so much in stores."
good,"If you're willing to be completely flexible with your work hours, this is the right place. Compensation is fair for the positions, however not ideal if you need a consistent schedule."
good,"Interacted well with Management, Co-Workers and the public."
good,It can be a good place to work but also sometimes stressing. The staff are good people and so are the managers. Some of the projects assigned to you can be difficult but also easy to solve.
good,Walmart is a great company to work for you can always advance you can always transfer to a different store if you decide to move to another state Personnel department is very friendly and helpful.
good,"Working in tire and lube area, we stay busy and work hard. As for other positions in Walmart, it depends how the day will go. You work with all sorts of people and deal with everybody. As far as management, they are a whole different story. Could use more training and leadership in the management area."
good,I have learned to handle customers that are unhappy with my store. I have learned how to be a good leader and fair to both sides. I was responsible for stocking and fixing any on-hand problems. the hardest part was meeting the time schedule with the number personnel given to achieve the goal. The best part of my job is dealing with the customers.
good,Uno hace el ambiente de trabajo y el apoyo entre los mismos asociados para sacar adelante el departamento. Falta no sobrecargar el trabajo a la gente con mas experiencia y capacitar bien a los de nuevo ingreso. Respetar dias de vacaciones y descansos
good,I like working in the morning. I had my regular customer that always come to my line.My coworkers was nice people to work with. I like the fast pace I worked in.
good,"This location prioritizes customer service above all else, and held its employees to a very high standard of customer service.  Consequently, there were a lot of departures and hires during my time there."
good,You worked hard but it was fun. Bennefits were good but pay was low. Pay was way below the standard of living. Learned a lot of different positions at Walmart.
good,As long as you are doing your job above expectations their point system regarding absences and tardiness can be modified. They pick and choose when the policy will actually be enforced. Exceptions are made to this policy for select employees. If it is not enforced throughout the store then no employee should be terminated based on that policy. Also think some stores cheat to get the highest payout for quarterly bonuses.
good,"This was my first job. Although i had some issues with the previous manager, all in all it was a great work experience. I made new friends and of course learned new things. It was a great first job."
good,"The workplace is very calm and in order, the management has everything in control and they were very friendly. the work is very easy and the employees are kind and will help you out with anything."
good,They have an easy get your foot in the door employment proccess and you can move up im management as fast as you want just about. Plus relocation is easy with so many walmarts being wirld wide
good,"~ a typical day at work: pretesting, waiting on patients"
good,Walmart is a good place to work. A very productive and nice environment. No job is a hard job. Direct management are very good at what they do. Hours vary throughout the year.
good,"1) Stressful & very fast paced"
good,I worked at walmart for 2 years as a fresh cap 2 associate making 11.50 an hour.  Best pay for the easy work you had to do. Loved my immediate managers such as the support managers and department managers. Workers were all friendly
good,They had a good policy the only bad thing at that time the salary was low now they have high salaries but lack of job opportunitties i wish they had more.
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart back in 1995. Management was fair and caring. It is a good company with many great benefits. Not sure how things are today because it's been so long ago.
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, with a lot of customers. Management does a good job, but negotiating hours can be difficult at times. The hardest part of the job can just be when the store is really packed but overall it was a nice place to work."
good,"IT is alot of hard work, with no recognition for that hard work, the harder you work the more they want you to do, and its never enough. They don't care about the individual only about making money, their attendance policy is unfair to new hires, and is so strict so that they can keep using and firing people and not have to give them any benefits, there are people that have been there for many years and still are not made full time employees and have no insurance and no benefits. It's totally unfair employment practices."
good,"Typical day, typical cashiering, typical customer service.  Good job to fall on when in need of a pay check! training is not serious and quick!  Flexible on scheduling so make sure you express your flexibility or non flexibility on application!"
good,Not a bad company just doesn't pay enough. There is opportunity for career growth however I became a supervisor of my old department and just got an .90 raise.
good,A empresa é excelente só precisa de gestores mais capacitados
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Walmart. As long as you do your job as you’re expected to, there is never a problem. Being a deli associate was a great experience."
good,Walmart was a fun place to be and I would recommend it to anyone looking to work. I anticipated each weekly check and appreciated the benefits of working there.
good,"Walmart can be ideal if you like to work fast paced. However, I prefer attention to detail, such as thoroughly cleaning burnt-on bits in a rotisserie. It's also unfortunate that they got rid of the chemical which would easily bake off such grime, and left us instead with grease lift in order to save a bit of money. You have to use grease lift when the oven is hot, and a lot of elbow grease. Moreover, they do not provide adequate tools in most cases to remove the built-on grime. Also, it is very disheartening to be one of the only ones willing to put in the time and effort required to remove it, and then not be appreciated for it because it's taking too long and other employees don't want to help customers. It makes it much less productive in both to continue having to stop, wash your hands of chemicals, dry your hands, put on gloves that inevitably you have to fight since your hands are still damp, and assist a customer who may likely be shooting glares at you by then. I would say that's partly why I left: lack of appreciation and support in maintaining a clean work environment."
good,"Over the years, I have become familiar with the regular customers. They trust me to help them navigate the tough situations they encounter in their transactions and are relieved when the situations are handled correctly, the first time.  Management appreciates when we can do our part and stay on top of the issues.  The hardest part is saying no to a customer.  Sometimes, we can't do what the customer wants and that makes the customer angry or very upset.  This is when management steps in.  The managers I work with are very good with our customers and try very hard to resolve every issue to meet corporate policy and customer satisfaction.  The best part of the job is making the customer smile, seeing them return and calling you by name to just say hello."
good,"Working at Walmart was enjoyable though it could get mundane at times, your coworkers would often give you a boost. The labor itself could be tiring at times but it was manageable."
good,walmart was a very dependable workplace. had trouble juggling family and work. i went in at 7 o clock and worked hard during the morning but it usually gotten less busy after while. it was a great working experiance
good,"Was my first job as cleaner. The shift was 5x2. My work was identify the practices to optimize the clean process "
good,"They are able to work with you and train you "
good,Es una empresa de autoservicio con exelencia en atencion al cliente y buenas oportunidades de crecimiento la evalúo con un 9.
good,"Good for entry level retail jobs.  While it's a fortune 500 company, it's mostly entry-level basic retail work with a few career positions at the top."
good,"good starter job into customer service, working with diverse groups of people along as completing different tasks. management for the location i worked at sucked considering it was a prototype store."
good,Horrible management sucked and they didnt care about workers at all they treted us horrible didnt know how to treat us like regular people or humans....
good,"Enjoyed it for a few years but ready for a new career. I learned a lot during my time. However, they constantly work with limited staffing and expect the business to thrive and employees to want to continue working there with lack of support and help."
good,"Overall I would say that Walmart is an okay place to work except for inconsistent work hours and the management will not work with you even when you have kids to take care of at home. I feel that if they would have worked with me a bit more on my schedule and made it consistent, I would probably still be there."
good,no advancement opportunity for older employees; managers are not concerned with career paths of associates nor are they concerned with other problems facing associates.
good,"Coming from a military background, it was a culture shock working with civilians. Accommodating for a non uniform team, it was an odd shift working with demotivated persons. But when they’re motivated, they showed a healthy work ethic."
good,"Very fast paced. As a cashier, the lines could quickly become long and backed up. Had to be fast paced as customers could become irritable. Also, they made me unload trucks even though it's not in my job description."
good,It was a good place to work at first until they started hiring just anyone to work and a lot of the supervisors we had didn’t even do things by the book.
good,"Unpredictable work environment, unprofessional managers , a range of customers attitudes ,unpredictable shifts, heavy work load, mandatory holiday work days"
good,It’s a great way to work on your customer service. They have a good way of increasing your pay rate. It’s a great company to have on your resumé. You also learn hand to eye coordination while you there.
good,I spent quite a few years working various positions at Walmart so you can advance if you want just like anywhere else. Pro and cons to all retail depending on what you want to deal with.
good,"Very fast paced place to work, always on the move and constantly going. Timelines given to have work finished in their theory of time. Good pay and benefits, if you are a single person, not so good if you are supporting a family."
good,Walmart customers are fun and interesting. The job was hard at times but fair. No work life balance. Low pay. no benefit package. Hard to get full time.
good,"Arrived on time to meet my work schedule and plan out my job task,greet customers with a smile to make sure they leave the store satisfied with our product.Cashed clients out in a timely matter,via credit card transaction to build costumers credit.Cleaned up work area to prevent accidents applied  safety work place for the next shift employee."
good,"Es una empresa que trata a sus empleados bien, pero la paga no es la justa."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work. They have many shifts and areas to work.  Fast pace job and pretty good compensation.  Decent benefits, no retirement just 401k.  All in all Walmart is a good started job or secondary job."
good,Has changed since the original owner has passed away. It is such an enormous company  it can be hard to promote at times however if you get the right staff leader to work for the sky is the limit for you.
good,"Walmart was a great place to work, friendly faces everywhere, flexible hours for whatever it was I needed. Everything was great there, except for the management. Very very poor management, only about 2 of the 6 or 7 managers were bad but those two are the reason for me leaving."
good,The hours worked really well for me while I was in high school. The only issue I had while working there was that everyday there was a new manger who would come outside and pull you off whatever you were already doing even if another manager had you doing it.
good,"The pay is great for base level associates, but once you reach supervisor and management levels, the workload and hours vastly outweigh the pay and benefits. Too much is expected of managers and not enough is expected of associates."
good,"I spent three years at Walmart in multiple areas. I worked in the Garden Center and Sporting Goods as a Sales Associate. I was trained as a cashier and Inventory Specialist. "
good,You learn something new every day whether it’s in your department or another. Good coworkers work well with each other especially in team work. Pay is good it depends in the area that you work at.
good,uma ótima lugar e experiência aonde quis se contrato pra nova vaga. Mais uma experiência nova
good,I would prefer to have a job with regular hours.  My schedule is quite variable which adds stress to my life outside work.  Most of the people are strong workers and want to do a good job. I appreciate the benefits.
good,all i can say is i loved working for wal-mart unto i got hurt than they made me feel very bad about working there. i alway did what ever that was ask of me and they still try everything to get me out.l
good,"Walmart is good for those in between jobs or for students wanting to get a job during spring break. "
good,Good company to work for.  Works well with college students.  I learned how to executive deadlines.  How to plan my workload. Management works well with schedule.
good,"I would get the mods that we were setting that night, if we weren't setting mods I would get the dept. I was stocking. I learned a lot about setting modular. Management had there favorites. They did not always follow through with employee concerns."
good,It was just to many chiefs and not enough indians. Had to many people trying to be the boss. At times some of us would be scheduled to work but would get sent home time we clocked in
good,It is very fast paced and challenging but as long as you learn quickly and catch on to the pattern the day will go smoothly. Depending on which department you work is going to determine you pace you can always switch after 6 months but the 6 months will not be easy
good,Competitive  Pay Rate. Not always ethical on certain situations Company is down sizing and cutting a lot of jobs. Fast pace club .Cleanliness is important.
good,Great manager but didn't have the best coworkers very busy environment. Help was always provided whenever was required. A lot of business went through
good,"Pretty easy consistent work and not much to worry about. As long as you are on time, do a good job and smile then you are fine. Hour lunch. Management usually cool."
good,I love everyone i work with and i love the environment and the vibe with everyone besides the management. I feel like they favor a lot of people there and exclude some.
good,a typical day at work was long in till hour cuts back stock rude coustmers and somtimes rude mangers pluse the swithing of jobs and the hour cuts and pay cuts
good,"uma empresa razoável pra se trabalhar, pois os líderes eos diretores que está no momento na loja trata os funcionários como se fossem escravos ."
good,It was very competitive and I had great hours but there was some favoritism going on and it made the workplace very toxic and unstable to work in. It was a fun job though.
good,Typical work day was 8 hours but days would vary.  I learned to be a cashier then department manager.  The management at the time I was employed was okay.  The workplace culture was for the most part positive.  Company had good benefits.
good,It was always a different type day. It depended on the time of day and month for type of customers. Never a dull moment. Enjoyed interaction with customer
good,The job itself is stressful. You dont get any rewards until you pass a training course. It is very fast paced with often discipline and other jobs being placed on your shoulder.
good,I had a department and worked everyday 7am-4pm. I stocked the shelves and helped customer. hardest part was sometimes they would sent us home and ask us to come back and do an over night to put out stock from a truck. I enjoyed helping customers.
good,I throw the truck and I stock groceries. Make sure customers can find what they are looking for. Help out others co-workers.  We get a lot to groceries to stock and have to do it in a certain time.
good,A great place for opportunity and possible career. Good benefits and competitive wages. Great people. Very diverse atmosphere. Would hate to leave this store.
good,"I loved this job. Everyone i worked with always helped one another and worked as a team. The store i worked for was very understanding when i had my heart attack, and needed to be off. The employees all were like a family. The enviroment was relaxed yet steady and sometimes fast paced."
good,"the typical work day was fast paced"
good,"every day is different  changes continuously need to be adaptable  schedules manager changes frequently semi sympathetic to situations"
good,Very flexible with school schedule.  Fast pace work environment. Pretty easy to follow training.  You do have gain a thick skin and remember the importance of your job and not allow yourself to make mistakes that will put your job or the company in jepordy.
good,"Profesional and clean shop enviroment, mostly new equipment to work on. Good OEM support, high quality shop equipment."
good,I worked there 6 months as a cart pusher. My days did not change. Just the hours. Was never excited for work and was more excited about clocking out. why would you want to work here?
good,"Days were very busy with stocking, helping customers and cleaning work areas."
good,It's a nice place to work. But they need to listen to what there associate have to say. upper management thinks there always right not always so. Use a open mind and listen to what your dept. manager's have to say.
good,"It kept me really buzy working at working at Walmart as a Cashier! I enjoyed it,but I have moved on and currently looking for employment as a CNA! The Company is Clean and upbeat with many customers so, YOu have to have a pleasent demeanor! Have a Great personality and give great customer service,and you'll do fine in employmemt there!"
good,I was a front end cashier and I enjoyed it very much.  The interaction with the public was great.  Busy environment made the day fly by.  the scheduling was very clear and you could see your schedule 3 weeks at a time.
good,Not bad. Career opportunities are always available. Management and communication is a 3. The benefits are excellent for people who are not able to afford health care.
good,formation non satisfasante mais les superieurs sont toujours pret a nous aider en cas de besoin
good,"I had little issues at Walmart. I ended up with a severe medical issue that put me in the hospital for over 3 weeks and I had recovery and didn't go back to the employment. I don""t know what else you want!! This site is NOT user friendly!!!"
good,"we start our day off with a plan about what we are going to do then start working we have a goal we have to meet by the end of our shift, management is always in touch and co-workers are friendly"
good,The hours we're not good for me they had me on swing shift some days I would work days some days nights. Interfered with my sleeping pattern. And my hours got cut back from 36 hrs a week to 28 hrs a week.
good,"The job is tough, but doable.  It tends to chew people up and spit them out. If you need to work, you'll stay. If you don't, chances are you won't make it. Move around to different positions as often as possible and you'll find it easier to work."
good,dinámico es muy social y se aprende mucho es derivable de actividades y actitudes
good,"i did work in jewelry but then i switched to the back room for a full time position which im still not getting full time hours for. ive learned that since drug tests ended it has went completely downhill, ive learned not to much else its super easy. management less than half actually know what they are talking about, they are kinda useless for the most part, but a few are super cool. it feels like you are back in high school working there, but i did meet my best friend there so you will find the good ones too. its honestly not hard at all and ive done alot of stuff. the most enjoyable part of the job is the two breaks, hour lunch, and certain people."
good,Mostly easy and as long as you kept a good attitude toward everyone there were no issues. Customers could be difficult sometimes but for the most part it was pretty easy going.
good,"we would all get to work and our main thing was the floors , we would buff and wax the store one section at a time using propane equiptment. we also would help with lighting or faulity storage units."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. New faces all of the time and recommend it to anyone that likes to be around people and help customers with anything they need.
good,"stock all product received in. rotate food, drink and anything that had an expiration date on it.  A tot of heavy lifting and stacking.  Some days were heavy and some days were light.  Management was always a for  available for comment."
good,"While change can be good, the changes that Walmart have been making have costed people to have to step down a position or lose their job all together. They don't allow you to keep your overtime hours. They make you lose it either on lunch or by going home early for the day. While not all stores are like this, there are some that are."
good,A typical day was pushing carts to the bay and picking up trash. Management was fine. The hardest part of the job was being outside all the time. A great place to work for college and high school students.
good,Walmart was a great place of employment. I left due to a career change that greatly grew my salary and expanded my opertunity to branch out to a different field
good,i was responsible for unloading the truck every night an sorting thru inventory to make sure it went to the right department.. an replenish merchandise
good,Working here I learned a lot about customer service. I really widen my communication skills. I meant many great people well working here and learned a lot.
good,"i love working with my hands .i start my day with a strong cup of coffee and we used to have morrnning meeting,but not any more because management said is was taking to long.so we just log on find a job,ie work order and run with it. overrall i would love to see some new good things for the workers assoicates take place."
good,"walk the Deli , make daily order,walk the floor and zone ."
good,"I have worked at Walmart for the past twelve (12) years part-time.  Every work day is different, because of the customers.  I like that what ever time you are scheduled to get off that is the time you will get off"
good,"During my work time at Walmart, I had a manager that was not fair in her work. Causing me to no longer be part of the organization for which was caused by her actions."
good,"I learned all about merchandise , production of the back room ,how the store operates and how to satisfy customer needs on a daily basis.I also learned how to work in a fast-paced environment and getting things to the customers in a fast , friendly manner."
good,"In Sporting Goods department, I would handle large amounts of money. I sold rifles and shotguns as well as ammo. I organized inventory and the products. In Online Grocery, I would bring out the products to the customers and have conversations with the customers. I would pick their items as well in a certain amount of time."
good,"I enjoyed the work, but, some of the people I worked with weren't exactly good to work with, it is a good place to work, just needs to be people in charge who will do whats best for everyone and the company."
good,Wal-Mart can be a great place to work if the management team was better with their Associates. But other than that I would recommend anyone to work to
good,I enjoyed it just a normal 9-5 job for minimum wage. Managers taught you everything you needed to know. 401k is a plus as well. And the discount you recieve
good,"Very fast paced environment. Hours go by quickly. Management does nothing to correct work ethics of the slackers - often complained but was never corrected.  All in all, I did enjoy working their."
good,I'm tired of going to work and finding that the first shift didn't have time to finish their work but I have to finish theirs and do mine to completion.
good,Hours was good along with pay but management was kind of washy! Co workers were one of the best things about working at Wal-Mart. Management was a hit and miss
good,I loved working here it's a great environment and love the people I worked with. Sometimes long hours but was worth it. Always smile and help customers in any way you can.
good,"Walmart was a great place to work, nice people, and good pay, I had to leave for a family death but had not been there for 6 months so they could not give me any time off"
good,"stocked ,checked for out of dates ,rotated stock ,"
good,"I worked for Walmart and Sam's Club for 10+ years as a pharmacy technician.  I had good experiences at both.  It is a good place work, benefits are good."
good,productive work environment was able to do the work well with pleasant co workers nice benifits perks of pto and discounts on regular priced items good bonuses
good,"Empresa muito receptiva, tem paciência em treinar seus funcionários. "
good,It was a job you had to move very fast and accurately with and you have to stand on your feet all day with one hour break and the breaks are helpful .
good,"Work at Walmart was pleasant and fast-paced I would have enjoyed being part of their workforce for a long period. It  was difficult to leave an employment that I was comfortable  in, and the  reason that I was let go was even more frustrating. Walmart is a good place to work for and has ample benefits for its employees.The job itself  was something that I enjoyed doing, I enjoy working alone as well as in a group setting. The hardest part would be the physical part , which consisted of removing and/or replacing shelves to accomodate new products."
good,I liked working there. My coworkers liked working with me. I miss my coworkers. I wish they would give me another chance in a different position. Walmart is a good company to work for if you like to work hard.
good,Some managers were able to relate with you and others just put pressure on the pace you worked. Some employees would sometime throw you under the bus if you accidentally took a bit long on your breaks.
good,I'm honestly just making this review because this website keeps harassing me to make a review and doesn't let me do anything into I make one for as the actual place it was chill.
good,"Walmart was a pretty good company to work for. The people were cool, professional atmosphere. There was always something to do so it was never bored. Overall Wal-Mart was a pretty cool place to work."
good,The managers were understanding if you needed time off and flexible with your hours. Good co workers who worked as a team. My knowledge in electronics was a good fit for my position here.
good,"in my time at walmart, i had some amazing co workers. But unfortunately at least at my location management wasnt as understanding as i would of liked so i made the decision to move on to a more supportive working enviroment."
good,"Worked here for the duration I was in college, they worked with my schedule and made sure I had plenty of time for school. Managers were great but the pay was low compared to the same position at another place I worked."
good,I didn't like the fact that the didn't supply jackets for the frozen department it was cold the lunch breaks wasn't long enough to eat and but I enjoy the co workers
good,The average day for me at Walmart was typically getting an assignment form the front end manager to sales credit cards efficiently and effectively. I would be given a set goal to acquire daily or even monthly. I managed to have the task done every time I was offered the job by selling credit cards and was able to reach each goal that was thrown at me and my team.
good,"It was good overall for a place to work, some employees got away with being lazy and not putting much effort into their work which sometimes made the job frustrating."
good,"balancing environment "
good,Working at Walmart is pretty much straight forward. Just like every other Grocery Store; there will be days busy and days slow. But overall you meet new exiting people every day .
good,"A lot of opportunities to learn new things out of position hired for. Great staff members, always welcoming coming in and out of the store. Management was great,when needed to be addressing the issues or confirmation on a work related topic."
good,"Working for Wal-mart is a bit fast paced, customer centered and requires you to be on your feet for your shift. They provide good breaks and an hour meal time,"
good,"The job can be easy, but you must complete the task that is given to you, if not finished they'll ask if you can stay over time. As a cap2 employee you had to stock items and zone shelf. You also help customers as you stock the products."
good,"It's a cool place to work its just the people who make you want to pull your hair out,  but that's at every job.,  they don't listen to employee concerns,  if the manager reports you,  you can speak on your side of the story all you want and have a ligament reason for whatever you'll still get in trouble and the manager even if is in the wrong still walks away Scott free"
good,Wal Mart does not have a very good work/life balance and demands a lot from management. However it is a great place to move up if you want to and does pay well for the job.
good,The Company as a whole has a lot more positives going for it than the segments of groups/departments that seem to project and promote a cut-throat culture. Such activities and behavior should be identified and snuffed out - to ensure the long term success of the business.
good,As long as the stores overall management is good then the store will run well and the job will be fairly laid back. There is a lot of room to move up in the company and many positions to choose from.
good,"Every day at Wal-Mart is a challenge. From schedules, call offs, and overall heavy workload. We as Asset Protection Associates never know what type of person we may encounter when protecting a business or associate."
good,Have enjoyed all my years with walmart and will continue with the company. At this time hours are being cut and company has closed part of my building. I will continue to work but I am looking for something in the evenings as a part time job. Which who knows could become full time.
good,bajos salarios y poca convivencia familiar porlas jornadas
good,"Cart Associate "
good,"WalMart is a decent place to work, but the management can give you unrealistic goals they want you to meet at a certain time. And the co- workers I worked with weren't always the best. They would complain and make working there stressful and hard, felt they we're always watching you and judging you. You got paid pretty well and would probably try to work there again if they change a few things."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo con los compañeros de piso  a veces gerencia se pasa al querer ejercer su autoridas de mala manera. Bueno en donde yo estaba asi paso. Y eso crea mal aspecto en el ambiente e imagen de la tienda
good,Walmart that I worked at several years ago did not have the work schedule for employees correct. Some employees just wanted to work part time and they were scheduled as full time. Most of the co workers were very helpful in learning the different task of your area.
good,"I would recommend working at Wal-Mart, especially for someone just starting a career.  I was treated well and fair.  Pay is low, but raises and promotion are available."
good,"A typical day at walmart is very busy and fast paced. Associates are always on the run trying to help customers and management always behind the associates. I learned alot about customer service and satisfaction, keeping a positive mood no matter your personal trouble, to just the task you given and not think you can do it, about safety measures, and what to do in case of an active shooter.management  was not really the best, leading to disgruntle customers and associates resigning. Good workplace culture. The hardest part was dealing with rude and mean customers that you must always find a way to satisfy. The most enjoyable part was fun with associates. The diverse cultural atmosphere made room for a lot of laughter and discussions which helped relieved some personal stress."
good,It is a good company to start with if you are a college student and you are not looking for a lot of hours. If you have kids and have a family be ready to work two jobs to supplement your income.
good,I like to start my day off with a good breakfast. I learn how to multi-task. i think i will like the man agent. i got good culture in my work. waitting on the next task. interacting  with people
good,"I worked at two locations for Walmart. The store in Lynnwood was a great place to work. Associates got along and management treated the Associates with respect and courtesy. The Everett store however was a cut-throat from Management on down to the newest employees. We were not treated with respect at that store which made the workday longer and most times miserable. With so many Associates from diverse backgrounds our culture was a mixture of values, beliefs, behaviors and attitudes. This I thought was a good thing because it taught me how to relate to a diversity of different cultures which helped when relating to the Associates and our customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who are rude because their agenda was not met. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to relate to and speak to some of the customers in their own language."
good,What do you really expect when working at minimum wage? I was paid $10 an hour when minimum was 9.47 at the time. Management at this location was stellar! I would go back there if I had to get another minimum wage job.
good,"Started out as a sticker and loved my position. Great coworkers and awesome benefits. My managers were great and helpful, just needed more pay. Then I moved up to MRA, pay was a little better, job was a little more stressful. Just wish I had better training. But overall great company to work for."
good,"Walmart Canada, specifically the Topsail Road store isn't a bad place to work. The work environment is very friendly and more like a work family. You'll get along with almost everyone. The managers that I have had (as they can change over the years) were mostly great, a bad one here and there but that's pretty much in every workplace. Sometimes certain managers can be hard to get along with while others are awesome."
good,"Day to day work was always changing. My job title was what I intended to do from the beginning, but was frequently thrust into positions I had no idea in which to do. I would be berated frequently for not understanding instructions on a job I didn't understand right away, and the stress of a poor manager wouldn't aid in my success in a new field of work. I managed to conform to the erratic scheduling, poor management, and constant job switching that was required of me, but the work experience left me with an idea that I could do better."
good,I use to enjoy coming to work but now it seems like they wanted to hire a younger group of people.but i can work with the best of the best and have fun doing my work.i enjoy having a great time at work but at least I can do my job
good,"During my training, fellow employees would extend themselves to help me with questions and activities that were new to me as a new trainee. Left to position to work as Home Attendant."
good,When I first started almost 12 years ago I really enjoyed going to work.. Moral was up and every employee I worked with were happy everything has changed in the last  couple of years.. Employees are less happy and going to work was increasingly harder..
good,"Como prestador de servicios profesionales, los pagos se llegan a atrasar, es burocrático el sistema de pagos y la parte contractual siempre está a favor de su empresa, llegando a retirar contratos de un día para otro sin dar explicación alguna, siendo que el desempeño y resultados eran excelentes."
good,"A typical day at Walmart starts for a stalker seeing how the number of items you must throw to the floor by the end of the night. Typically throwing between 600 to 1900 pieces. Not including features and bulk items, the pace at which management wants the freight thrown is 60 cases an hour. You do how ever get two 15mins breaks during your shift first one at 2 hours into your shift, and the second break 2 hours from the end of your shift. also, as a full timer with working over 8 hours you receive an hour lunch at about 4 to 5 hours into your shift. I have learned plenty of skills; such as time management, critical problem solver, team work. Walmart does have a great workplace culture of hard work, teamwork. Management can be both great and terrible at the same time. One side will tell you to do something one way and the other side will tell you to do it another way."
good,My Walmart is okay but i feel like it could be better at others.  Sometimes i don’t get my break in time because i have to waait in a replacement. That could mean i have to wait 5-45 minutes. It all depends on whose working that day.
good,Walmart distribution is what you make of it. If you want the hours you can get them. The more you are willing to learn the more hours you can get  It is a fast pace environment with unlimited potential.They are good about moving people up within the company. You do not want to go here for a job unless you don't mind working hard.
good,I loved my job at Wal-Mart. I would have loved to stay but at the time I was working 3rd shift and I had some personal issues I was taking care of. I think Wal-mart is a great place to work
good,Good place to start out - maybe not so much a career choice - at least for me - enjoyed stocking however they like to rid people once you are getting close to FT status eligible.
good,they overwork you and they expect so much of you with very little help they also expect you to be courteous to customers. I liked working in the deli but not in the bakery
good,"Get along with everyone"
good,Was not the best work communication one assistant manager would tell me to do one thing then another assistant manager would tell me into another thing. Doesn't have enough employees in departments I was always being pulled to one Department to help out and never got the test done in my department because I was never in it.
good,"Wal-Mart is basically a fun and relax place to work,I would recommend this retail giant if your looking for fair wages and a great working environment"
good,"walmart was your typical retail store like any other company you can think of. When I first got the job, I was a salesman on the floor and replenishing stock. Then I got word that working in the warehouse pays more, so I took it upon myself to apply and I got the position"
good,"I enjoy working at walmart very much, great co-workers,clean environment to work in walmart brings everyday low prices to help people save and live better"
good,I worked in the Deli and Meat departments. I learned customer Service. management is cutthroat . and managers dislike other. managers. a lot of back stabbing occurred. luckily I was not a manager. I did enjoy working there very much.
good,The co workers and the environment could be better. Also the csm are lazy and never really interested in helping the cashiers when there is a problem.
good,It was a great work environment and good job because you work with your team to get things done everyone is a team that kept the store running but managers were a little sloppy at times and came down on the employees when things aren’t done in a timely manner but no workers showed up because they were either not scheduled to work or out sick etc.
good,Get better management take care associates  better we work hard but we don’t get the credit we need the management look what we do for them and get better lunch for all the employees
good,wish i could have stayed at the company. the job was very good with pay an people i worked with. sometimes they didnt give me my breaks on time was my only issue.
good,"Good benefits. Variety of jobs and skills to learn. They train you in multiple departments."
good,Provided support to administration of the store in making sure shelves were stocked on a regular basis. I was responsible for stocking of the hardware and paint department
good,The Wal-Mart Superstore 831 was a very hard place to work at times because of dealing with because of the homeless and drug addicts that would come in every day. But the management and employees I worked with were awesome and friendly to customers anyway. One of the challenges was to put back product that customers would leave every where and clean up messes that customers would leave while still getting the the work you have done. At the end of your shift you feel good that you got a lot accomplished. Overall it was a good place to work.
good,Walmart is a good job. I personally like walmart because they work with your schedule. and also they help with paying for school .......................................
good,"stocking dairy, down stacking trucks, taking freight to each dept. shift managment worked just as hard as us stockers.the hardest part of the job was standing on your feet all night.i learned customer service and had good time working third shift.i loved the people i worked with."
good,"I enjoyed working there, the hours and job tasks were fair. I had regular customers that I would see on a daily basis and had good work relationships with my fellow employees. I did however have a problem with how many sick days we were permitted, even with doctor's notes."
good,"It is a good place to work, but it is hard to advance at this facility. The compensation and incentives are great for the area, but do make a little less than other logistic facilities in the area."
good,"Was great working with different people and making lasting friends,  but management wasnt always helpful. Having a schedule thats fits you never works no matter how long of advancement you give."
good,"It was a good place to work, met nice people. I wish there manager would have been more accessible. I also wish they wouldn't have switched my shifts to overnights."
good,Theyre great with advancing. Ive seen employees come in as an associate and advance to a department manager within only months.. Great with pay. I only wish they had set schedules.  It made things complicating for me with finding child care.
good,"a typical day busy at cash register, enjoyed people management changed, frequently I think because such a busy store. culture was good they had a lot of problems with theft. Hardest part of the job not seeing supervisors happy, on there faces, and I find that said. The most enjoyable the ones that did smile."
good,"The typical work day involves clocking in, finding your manager and asking for your first assignment, this will typically be pushing carts, when the lot is cleared or a co-worker is already pushing carts, you might be assigned tasks such as, changing trash bags, zoning, stocking, or other tasks. Once your done your task, you will be assigned another, and another, until your shift is over."
good,Multi million dollar companies are pretty much the same across the board. They all care little about more than keeping their employees as mindless slaves to the company by providing them with hard to match benefits and a decent enough pay that it sort of makes up for the awful job
good,"I enjoyed the departments that I worked in. That would be Photo lab, toys and bakery.  I enjoyed the people and most of management. I didn't want to leave my job but my health said otherwise.  My health is now better and am eager to start a ""retirement"" job."
good,"A very full day full of checking our sales, stocking shelves with product, and ensuring customers are happy with what they are buying. Very flexible schedules and great benefits."
good,"This job requires a lot of travel for months at a time. Since we're salaried, you can expect a minimum of 60 hour weeks, and I've worked multiple 90 hour weeks as well. We are contracted at 50 hour weeks however. The benefits are amazing though, and so there is a fair bit of give and take. The job security is pretty strong, but advancement opportunities are far and few between."
good,always on your feet and having to pay attention to detail at work and focusing on the tasks at hand so they are done swift and on time. Group environment so must work as a team
good,It's an ok job if you're just starting out and/or you desperately need a job but I wouldn't recommend it as a career. It's very repetitious and stressful. Most customers are nice and friendly but you hear a lot of complaints and they can be very rude. Some customers will try to tell you how to do your job. Most co-workers are friendly and are willing to help you out. Most of management is nice but some of them make you feel like they don't care about the customers or employees. It's not the best place to work but It's also not the worst one either.
good,"Meat Department extremely busy all of the time and difficult to keep up with work load. Majority of the time there is not enough staff on duty in the dept. There are many different tasks that are expected but you can only be in one place at a time. Working on a particular task means that other tasks will either have to wait or not get completed at all. This dept. has a very cooperative, cohesive, helpful and friendly team that labours with diligence to get the job done and always manages to get most tasks done. The majority of the time the dept. manager will mention the tasks that have not been done but rarely mention the many jobs that have been completed which can often be very frustrating however this situation is not unique to Walmart. Being a discount store means that the company must shave all costs to the minimum in order to offer discounted prices to customers and that includes the rate of pay so there is no surprise there. The quality of meat products equals any competitors offerings. Sanitation and safety are promoted and continuously monitored. Do your work to the best of your ability, don't show up for work with an ""attitude"", help out if possible when asked to cover an extra shift and there is a good chance your manager will work with you to schedule you for your preferred shifts. Once you have three months of employment completed you receive a ten percent discount on purchases. While not huge, ten percent discount helps. The store manager is polite, professional and will never fail to say hello. For a part-time job it seems just fine if that is your desire. Full-time"
good,"Easy to learn, low pay, good hours, work inside with ac, usually close to home, hires teenagers so it's hard to get along professionally, good on breaks."
good,"Unfortunatly there was a lot of turnovers in this company. Not a job that i would work at for very long but it works until you can get on your feet if you are just starting out. If it wasn't for some of the CSM keeping the front end going, I believe the turnover in that store could be even worse"
good,"gostava muito de trabalhar nessa empresa, bom ambiente de trabalho e boas amizades"
good,"Great management, great people, decent workers. During my employment with Walmart, I learned how to sort items for inventory, stock the shelves for customers according to their product numbers, provide even better customer service than what I had been used to, and work fast and efficiently, The hardest part of the job was getting back used to constant physical labor for me, but after adjusting to it I was able to keep up very well with my position. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers get what they needed quickly."
good,"normal work. work hard and you will be ok. understand its a job, a place that pays your bills. I have nothing else to add. please let me stop typing about this job."
good,"Good job but didn't offer me good hours being a single parent. I liked the benefits, but you don't qualify unless you're full time, and almost no one gets full time."
good,"It was fixed, same day and time every week, 10pm-7am. There are easier and harder departments though. Work at your pace but with a quota. You should do fine, its not hard."
good,I went in to work in the middle of the night and worked hard the whole shift. A good work team . I enjoyed helping customers out on the floor.  The management could communicate better with their employees.
good,Working here was okay. it's very stressful there's was always something to do and not enough staff to do it. I felt overworked and underpaid. it's def not a place I would want to work at again.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work for those looking for employment. They pay well, you receive paid time off, and coworkers are generally friendly. I like the people I work with, but corporate is constantly changing the rules to the point where our managers can't effectively tell us what to do sometimes. Corporate has been changing schedules for many workers, either cutting hours or by changing certain shifts like from 3 PM - 12 AM to 4 AM to 1 PM. Honestly, I liked working at Walmart because it provides a comfortable income but corporate keeps changing, so it's hard to predict whether I'll have a steady schedule or not."
good,"certain people had more rights then other. managers showed favortism. too many managers not enough workers. if someone called off no replacement was looked for,others had too work the extra load"
good,"Walmart does have a lot of good work environments to choose from."
good,Wal-Mart was a awesome company to work for they cross train if interested and it is very awesome learning new things I learned to pierce ears and was certified in it .I was the best at watch and jewelry repair . It was a great company to work for I felt that it was fair.they need more flexibility with scheduling
good,"I like WalMart but there is a limit to what I can handle. I use to be a cashier till I moved to Frozen, that would be great except that the manager of the cashiers was telling the othera not to take me because I was a terrible worker. Because of that, it took almpst a year before they let me move. So if your good at tour job then they are going to fight tooth and nail to keep you there. I have been talking to them about manager positions or even assistant manager and they say that they will get back to me. Two years and nothing. I work  7 hours a day, I use to work 8 hours and sometimes I would work over to get more hours just to live off of until they caught me and cut my hours back. Im barely making ends meet. The people are friendly and all but this place gets so boring aometimes that people start rumors and its like High School all over again. Its a good temp job but it just isnt the place for me. I also work the cashier, stock frozen food and bread. I have asked for a raise but they wont allow it."
good,it was just life draining going in there everyday talking to the same rude people sucked the only benefit I liked about Walmart was there raise and discounts
good,"Productive and fast paced. The employees are nice, depending on your job preference there is room for advancement or you have a choice to transfer to other positions."
good,"Very busy, always understaffed. Management did the best they can but no one ever wanted to work. Not much appreciation for all you do. Customers complain way to much."
good,It's not a company for lazy people. You can move up quickly if you show up and work. The pay is actually pretty good especially in management positions.
good,"do freight processing ,stocking,price changes,put merchandise to shops,Telephone skills,"
good,"The work/life balance isn’t good. And the management isn’t good either. You do get paid well, and only 4 days a week but within those four days you clock in and never know when your leaving, but regardless you still have to be there at that designated time the next day."
good,"My job was great don't get me wrong but there were too much favoritism going on at the work place constantly. There were times where i was pulled out of my department to go and work other departments because we were constantly understaffed which is why i have Retail and Customer Service experience. There were managers there who were fair, and other who just pushed their work on you without any care. There were a lot of people quitting for the lack there of the work loads that was forced upon them that it was too much for them to handle so our team was constantly small. I would recommend someone to get a job at walmart if they're starting out but its a very stressful, high staked, high reward type of job and hopefully you can deal with the customers who come in doing the most criminal and questionable things.I would say the most i enjoyed at my work despite everything were my co workers and the customers who came in who smiled and asked for help instead of wasting my time by asking me where something is when its right by them or customer willingly opening products to only give to me moments later after its eaten or half used."
good,"The company is good to work for, but I don't believe the compensation was fair for the positions."
good,"O Walmart oferece oportunidades de crescimento ao funcionário, porém precisa melhorar muito a capacidade dos gestores, alguns ainda encontram-se incapacitados de exercer determinadas funções."
good,"I  really liked working at Walmart. they change they mangers and they had no clue what they was doing. "
good,I was a replenishment fork lift driver. Each day we are assigned certain isle to work and complete the movies for those isles and slots. If the receiving team hauls product down your isles then you are responsible for put those pallets into there assigned slots. It supposed to be a team organized environment but i always see employees looking out for themselves rather doing whats best for the rest of the team. The worst days would be working a 12 to 14 hour shift when its over 100 degrees in the warehouse and you have to wait on the order fillers along with the receiving team to finish before we can finish up and leave. The best part of the job would be the high pay rate and excellent 401k and stock options.
good,"This company is very easy to work for, There is no major need to have experience as they are more than willing to train their employees. They also allow for employee's to build and grow within the company."
good,I feel that this is a upbeat fast paced work environment that you must be flexible and able to do more than 1 asked task at a time.   Also you must be willing to help other co-workers as you work through your shift.
good,moved counters from one place to another. learned how to move counter. putting wheels on counters was the hardest part of the job. best part was the hour lunches
good,"Depending on your level in the company, stress can take its toll. I was never asked to breach our ethics code, this is a big plus to me. With their PTO system, you chose your holidays!"
good,No two days were ever the same working here.  I enjoyed the time I worked at WalMart.  I started as a floor associate and was able to move up to Claims Clerk.
good,"Acted as a role model and personally contribute to attainment of the department goals. 	Maintained all stockrooms areas in a neat, orderly, and safe manner.Maintained safe and orderly stockrooms."
good,I like the fact that Walmart is always there for their customers. Customers can shop at their own convenience.. Walmart offers shopping options for customers as well
good,Easy work. Tiring when busy. Decent pay nothing to complain about. If you work a full 8 hour shift you are scheduled for 9 hours of work because you get a full 1 hour lunch which is a blessing and a curse. 2 15 minute breaks. The hardest thing about working here are the customers can be difficult at times and management can be hard to work with they will hardly listen to your complaints or concerns will pick favorites over you and won't do anything to make your stay as an employee an easy one if you get on their bad side. The best thing oddly enough are also the customers who are amazing and come back often to see you as well as awesome co workers that you befriend.
good,"A typical day at WALMART DC as a Forklift driver is to ensure the handling of freight arrives to and from destinations safe and secure. We also maintain  and process merchandise to ensure proper deliveries ."
good,not everyone is held to the same accountability. some people can get away not doing all job duties while others have to do all their job duties plus extras
good,Walmart is a good place to work at. They have good benefits and sometimes you work good hours. They also have excellent customer service. Being a associate I enjoyed my time there.
good,This Is A Good Environment To Work In And A Good Shopping Place. Walmart Is Always The Place To Be. They Also Have Good Mangaers On The Team That Show How Everything Is Being Operated.
good,I learned that the retailers have to price items for the customers according to the areas. I learned how to keep prices comparable with the other stores in the area.
good,"My job is very good, but Walmart is changing there way of working. they are planning on cutting more vendor from the store. I don't know which ones will be getting cut out. So I figure I better start looking for another job"
good,i would refer many people to walmart for a job because it is a good place to work at and they always have an open door policy plus its a family orientated company.
good,As long as you know where stuff goes everything will be easy! The managers are really nice not sure if they have switched them. Sometimes they change the modular so you’ll get confused but it’s a good place to work .
good,"On a daily basis we handled at least a hundred customers, as well as keeping the shelves stocked and the store cleaned. Management would at times over work the staff, requiring associates from one department to cover for call outs in others as well as man their own departments. The workplace has a relaxed atmosphere and the staff does work together. THe hardest part of the job is around 5pm when the rush starts, the most enjoyable part would have to be assisting customers find what they were looking for"
good,"Overall good job i would recommend it. The rules are pretty strict on production and safety, but you can get quite a few write ups without it affecting you. Health insurance not great but better than nothing. Nice only working 4 days a week"
good,"Cashiering is a hard job, but if your nice to the customers and do what they ask, it goes by very well. Someday's I sure miss working there, but don't regret leaving. Was only a temporary thing."
good,"Learned a lot on Customer Service"
good,oportunidade de crescimento ate certo ponto.......
good,"I worked in a distribution center."
good,Competitive work place which can create an environment of distrust. Some management lack good leadership and in order to make change you have to complain. It just makes for a volatile work environment.
good,the position i held was a lot more technically challenging than working in other parts of the store and therefore should be paid more. it's easily the most dangerous job you can have at a walmart super center location because of the nature of the work.
good,a typical day at work would be fairly quick paced. I didn't like my position I had some issues with it but it was okay.i wish the floor support actually had nice atitudes
good,"A typical day at work was fairly easy.  Not very stressful unless the lines get too long. I learned that some customers are very impatient but you have to learn to get over it if customers are rude to you. Management was alright. The most annoying part of the job, as a cashier, was waiting for a manager to bring you more change or if you needed help at the register. This was hard because the customers would sit and stare and you and question why it was taking so long. An enjoyable part was meeting a whole bunch of different people and starting small talk."
good,"pretty cool place to work as long as you do your job. management its so bad most of the time.........................................................."
good,Good company to work for gained a lot of experience working at Walmart stocking shipping receiving the people were nice overall a good company to work for
good,"Walmart Transportation was once one of the best jobs in the transportation industry, bar none. In late 2017, Walmart began making wholesale changes to the private fleet that disenfranchised most of it's driver workforce and which has led to a mass exodus of many of the drivers. Corporate rolled out a new, lower pay scale for new hires starting after October 2017 and began taking away many of the perks and benefits of the job. The general consensus is that corporate is preparing to do away with the Walmart private fleet."
good,"I love working for Walmart. I work in the online grocery department which is pretty cool to work in, i also have a good and he is pretty cool to work for. The part i enjoy about my job is when i bring the items out to the customers car and they are happy about the items they requested and got what they wanted and happy that they get to order their items online."
good,"Walmart Is an overall solid company to work for. The pays not bad and the compensation is fair enough with great benefits after the first year of employment. Also If you want a promotion you can get one in 3-5 years of your start date assuming you are a known hard worker, show up, and get in good with management directly over you."
good,"I enjoy working with customers however as corporate changes are implemented the management team seems over worked and negative, this is a trickling effect on all employees."
good,The environment was great I enjoyed working in a the fast-paced environment. My manager was efficient and professional. I would recommend this job to friends.
good,At the Wal-Mart I worked at the management was so bad that she got fired for being a corrupt manager who was cutting workers hours to make herself look better. Can't say I got the best experience.
good,"I really enjoyed the job. good hours and management was good. the co workers were great. not a whole lot of freedom. longer breaks would have ben nice, but overall a great experience."
good,Most days of the job require you to help off load the trucks that come in every week. This took about 2 to 3 hours depending on size. On good days we would have enough people for it to not be a problem but other times only 2 people for the first hour.
good,"under paid, over worked under appreciated never thanked.  I ran the entire hardware department by myself Every other department had help, except me and I had a great deal of work placed on my shoulders."
good,"I've worked there for a while and have moved a couple positions but i didn't feel like i was advancing anywhere $ wise, my hopes were boosted up a couple times but i was let down/misled. Good starting job and if you get nice and chill with management your likely-hood of advancement is far greater than just working hard."
good,"like I said these are nice places for temporary work, but management have all forgot what its like to have to actually do the job. I have more than put in my time, and know what I am talking about. yet no one cares. I cant work like that."
good,"Most days were stocking shelves with the products, occasionally worked other areas of the store.  On holidays there were pot luck dinners and sometimes grilled burgers and hot dogs."
good,My time working at Walmart was relaxing when i first started working at Walmart. The relaxation turned into a little stressful after a while because I wasn't used to the work but once I got the hang of it the work wasn't that bad any more.
good,I loved my job and my co workers. Was upset to find out when i had to have a medical procedure done that they were not going to accept my medical excuse.
good,This is good overall but the manager is stressful but if you do your job right they usually don't complain. The job was fun for me and enjoyed myself when working there.
good,Overall it was great when I started and I learned a lot and after they change management things got worst.  But if they are all on the same page it's great.
good,"It's a job. It's not my ""calling"", but it's employment. I previously worked there, and was a good employee. When I found myself needing to return 15 years later, they were glad to have me back. I wish they kept their standard's up when hiring new employees, like they used to. We seem to get so many ""duds"", they are worthless. The employees who actually work, and show up when scheduled have to do double, sometimes triple the work to cover for the ""duds"" because the ""duds"" either don't show up, or just stand around twiddling their freaking thumbs!"
good,need to be constantly working stocking shelves. being lead alot of people were not willing to listen and didnt seem to care about their job. worked hard to become full time and not very good benefits.
good,"Performed duties at the register, in customer service, and wherever needed. Trained new employees."
good,It could be a good place to work but its too hard on my body. But im 7 months pregnant. Its alot of walking and heavy lifting. Medical issues make it hard to do the job duties.
good,It was an great store customer was awesome they mad friendly and some of the managers was all that nice some was rude and some was nice but i think it was cool
good,Good workplace for someone who is looking for a fast paced job. Dont get caught too long in the rat race. Work for yourself. Also people who dont follow the walmart guidelines dont get disciplined. They get handslapped and then it gets thrown under the rug. People always complain daily and they hate their job and worked for years. Get good brownie points with the right people and you will move up the ladder.
good,Over all its a good place to work if you a single person with no family. The points system grants no leway if your child gets sick and the system they use for attendances is hard to use and figure out with no help in doing so by managment.
good,"I worked there a couple years ago so I don't remember with precision, but the customers and pace stressed me out. I did not enjoy having to work with so many customers hourly."
good,"El trabajar como empacador en WalMart Nicolás Romero, al ser mi primer empleo formal, te enseña más que nada lo que es responsabilidad de tener un trabajo, la cultura de puntualidad y el compromiso tanto con la empresa como con uno mismo."
good,The job itself and scheduled days are awesome. The managers however are horrible. They don’t nessacarily lie but they will manipulate numbers and try to put words in your mouth to justify your work load if u are doing more than the job requires.
good,"Shifts start off with meeting of how everyone needs to work together to push through the night.  Shortly after, half the supervisors start to do their own thing instead of helping th crew accomplish goals.  That trickles down into"
good,"Working weekend graveyard 12-hour shifts for maintenance was a little different...but work three days, off four...was great. Miles and miles of conveyors in the .Com building kept us busy with preventive maintenance. By the time you completed all of the machines in a month, it was time to start over. No maintenance management was assigned to ""shift 5"", so a crew of 5 technicians maintained the facility, over 100 forklifts, a Lan/Wan network and about six miles of high speed conveyors to keep the ""online"" distribution center working."
good,"janitorial is just not something I want to make a career out of. The manager don't really acknowledge maintenance, not even a ""good morning"" the pay is good just looking for a job with weekly pay."
good,Loved the people I worked with. For most jobs they train well. Standards sometimes changed from Assistant Manager to Assistant Manager. Attendance policies hard to comply with.
good,I love working at that place. I've learned a lot from working as a cashier there. People there were very friendly and most are Asian. The working place was clean.
good,"It has been a while since I worked there. But I had to quit because I was working about 40 hours a week and I was still in high school. I learned how much I love talking and meeting new people. I don't really remember anything about management. I never really encountered with them. The hardest part was probably learning -different positions at once. Wal-mart was my first job, so I was learning the register, self checkout and doing apparel all at once. The most enjoyable part was the customers."
good,This is a place where you get to interact with customers. Set up new displays with seasonal merchandise. Management was easy to work with on a day to day basis
good,"Good place to start your career and learn essentials of business. I learned a lot about running a small business, reading financials, customer service focus, and sales. management leaves you alone as long as you make your budgeted numbers. The hardest part of the job was that management would not always back you even though they may need to."
good,Great place to start your work environment experience when dealing with customers they also have great perks like if we keep a work safe place we get BBQ's and pizza parties it's was pretty cool.
good,"I learned many great services, from returning to cashing checks. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers, but with a positive attitude, the day goes by quick."
good,I loved working for the company. I’m sad they let me go. Wish I could’ve saved my job. I had fun and I loved my family there and they were always there when you had a problem
good,"Walmart is a good job, just on many days it can be stressful. You have to make sure you take care of yourself. Once you are employed their for a while you will be able to take vacation time."
good,"Very fast paced place to work, great opportunity for a person fresh out of school, to make money and get career experiences. i wish I would have started years ago."
good,Customer can be very rude and talk to workers in a very under minding tone and would curse employees out and management would not stop them at all. Can't have your feeling on your shoulder working here.
good,"The CSMs are very helpful and nice to work with. The hours are inconsistent from week to week. The job security is good as long as you show up to every shift; however, they show no mercy for attendance."
good,Very competitive and fast Place work environment that keeps you on your toes but also stressful. Also the company pushes their employees to work over 40 hours
good,Do not provide a set schedule makes it difficult to plan anything like doctors appointments and or family outings and lots of back-to-back scheduling and it is difficult to get a promotion
good,"A typical day working stock at Walmart all depends on whether or not you're doing an early shift or a later one. You either open by helping bring in product off of trucks, and then run a quick-paced work day, or you come in to slow work traffic, and an even slower closing process. The people there are nice, but mostly all of the people I worked with were either there because it was all that they could do, or vocally despised their job and want to do more. Walmart appears fine, starting out, but after working there for a time, it feels more like a corporate trap to fall into if your passion of work doesn't line up with what they can give you."
good,"Como empresa motivan mucho al trabajador, tratan de formar una familia dentro de ella."
good,I worked at the Walmart in Kemah as part of the cart crew.  This was a temporary summer job and involved working 40 hours a week in the Texas heat.  I also served as a Walmart greeter on occasion.
good,"I loved working here, I wouldn't have left if I didnt have a choice. Fast paced, great customers, Management needs some work, but many other caring staff members and team members. The hourly rate was pretty decent. Hours were great. Learned more responsibilties, made new self challenges, gave you a sense of home, somewhere to belong. Time off and Workers Compensation company could be more understanding. Overall great company to work for!!"
good,I had fun in the deli at walmart but the management didn't care that i was in school and wouldn't try to work around my schedule. they even tried to work me on finals week.
good,"Walmart was alright, the pay for the position was acceptable, nice coworkers, and a perfect place for people looking to start work, good first job, to build customer service."
good,It was sometimes a lot if heavy work that needed to get done each shift worked and other days were light work. Other co-workers would try to help on heavy days or when a department needed to be straightened up before end of day.
good,A good company to work for. On the job trading. Promotes from within. Gives you the tools to succeed. Endless resources for your job. Always changing (a good thing).
good,"I resigned walmart because I got a new job,but I l loved and missing working in Walmart as the management was fully supportive and helpful in every one or the other way."
good,Walmart is a good company that provided some incredible  experiences for an individual to take advantage of.  It can be a little over-structured but you can feel comfortable speaking to executive leadership.
good,"Out of high school, I was hired by Wal-Mart to be a photo center technician and later a front end cashier.  I have have worked for Wal-Mart for 8 years so far and I have gained knowledge regarding the retail business and customer service skills.  For anyone that is out of high school looking for a decent entry job, Wal-Mart may be for you.  The work environment varies from slow and calm to fast and chaotic.  Management is usually competent but sometimes are slow to act on other store matters.  Customer interaction will be a mixed bag, some customers will be in a good mood and some will not.  It is important to maintain a sense of composer and respect around the customer and other employees/managers.  In conclusion, Wal-Mart gives a decent work experience that can provide a good stepping stone into the bigger world of business."
good,Very stressful job that makes it hard to balance work and home. Overtime is mandatory. The pay is really nice and is acceptable for this job. Benefits are average.
good,I am one of the Self checkout Hostess there at Walmart. I always have a good time at work because I am a friendly person and when my customers come into they self the volume of the day..
good,"Stocking shelves , assisting customers,time management skills,workimg as a team,learning became a team playeretc.management was helpful.Halfway descent environment to work  under. Most challenging part of job was trying to gaining additional pay and heavy work load at times.The sastisfaction of cmpleting the job task and with job done with excellence and making customers happy."
good,It is a great place to work with above usual pay and while the days may be tough and fast with angry customers or overall heavy workload it was pretty good.
good,Fast paced and very busy with always more than enough to get done. Friendly work environment with most managers providing a positive workplace culture. At times the work load and expectations can be over whelming and unrealistic.
good,"You get to work and clock in. Thin you either start the day off with cleaning the bathrooms or find the person that opened. You find out what has and has not been done. Thin the mid shifter or the opener goes out on the parking lot to get the trash. If you're the opener you start off the day with cleaning bathrooms thin sweep the selling floor, then after that, you get the trash inside the store. Then you go to lunch. When you come back you most likely will have help unless they have a short late shift. As you go about your day any spills or mess you have to go clean them up."
good,"Productive and fast paced most days.  The hardest part of the job was stocking freight. The most enjoyable part was meeting new and interesting people.  I learned a lot from my co-workers about how to manage time, products and people."
good,It’s not too bad. It’s pays pretty decently for the job that you’re doing and provides decent benefits. The only con is sometimes management can be a pain and sick time isn’t too great
good,"Solid compensation for being entry-level. From what I saw it seems reasonable to think you can move up in the company. Since it is such a large company management has a focus on numbers which was troublesome, because there are unforeseen circumstances. However, if you learn the job well and get on a good quick pace things should be fine, assuming you get along with management and coworkers."
good,"The job was fine and the employees were very willing to cooperate to get whatever tasks that were assigned done. While I preferred some managers to others, I had no trouble with any of them."
good,Why does it matter if i give an review? Will this help me get a job? Why is it necessary for me to write an review of my past employer. Is this getting me any closer to find a job?
good,It provided me money when I couldn’t get a job anywhere else. They are not competitive with other businesses pay wise. All in all It was an okay place to work.
good,it is very nice to work there with my colleagues as the atmophere is quite pleasant and less stressful. I think it is one of my best decision i ever made.
good,No se puede esperar mucho apoyo de los mandos altos
good,"I never wanted to leave. I was terminated because I cared to much for the people I was training. I loved what I did, never wanted to leave, I was forced to"
good,"This was a good job but the work load was a lot to ask. The management team was pretty helpful for getting tasks done, but overall it seemed unorganized and a bit understaffed."
good,you can be paid well by working extra hours lots of extra shift if you are willing to work but when you're about to hit full time status management will schedule you to a 38 hour work week so they don't have to give full time benefits.
good,This company has many opportunities for advancement. Positions both up front alongside customers or in the back with stocking and other associates. Fast paced and exciting environment to work in.
good,"I was a manager of Electronics and Lawn and garden, I enjoyed doing my work and enjoyed working with my associates. The work was hard but if your motivated to work it is very easy to move up (depending on your managers). Other than that if you stay away from the normal work place drama you'll enjoy it."
good,Great place to build a career. Good team of management. Good morale to help each other. Team building experiences. Many coworkers are friends outside of work.
good,This job would be a lot more fun if the management tram allowed for promotions within the store. Overall this is a great place to work. Great place to work if you are just trying to have a little cash on the side.
good,It was always go go go for me. It was just a continuous drone of work until we went home. The night managers were very understanding and defended us if a day manager had a problem with something.
good,"Working at Walmart is hard work, it is very busy and there is all kind of people going in and out of the store. you have to be a people person to work there.The interesting part is you meet different people and make new friends."
good,There are plenty of avenues that you can take. Choose the right path because the further you go into the rabbit hole that is what they expect you should go
good,As far retail goes the pay was good. Scheduling is decided 3 weeks in advance so be prepared to plan ahead for time away from work. Your position doesn't decide what your responsibilities will be during the day. Management tells you what you are going to do.
good,"I actually enjoyed working at Walmart was easy to avoid the drama. There is always something to do, staying busy is important, for the most part friendly coworkers and management."
good,Good place to work when starting out. But not a maintain a family job place. I liked the people i worked with and the people interaction. Overall decent place.
good,It is like being in high school. not fun depending on someone to do there job so you can make your production. If a order filler stands around talking and does not move it can effect the way you can do your job.
good,always changing procedures and people get  lost some time . on line sales is the future for Walmart no more big box stores . Trying to keep up with Amazon
good,Overall Walmart was a very good job.  I went to school while working here and graduated.  Only reason I left was because I thought I would have a better career with the job I currently have now.
good,A typical day moved at a fast pace. It was important to be at the cash register as scheduled and on time. Management was average and the workplace was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was having to work on Sunday but I enjoy working in a fast pace company.
good,There is always plenty of things to do while working for Wal-Mart. The list is never ending. You also cover more areas than just your own. I was working in 8 different departments on a daily basis. 
good,"The work is steady enough to where the days pass by without too much of an issue. Working in the lawn and garden center was especially good, because you work out doors a lot and it is generally a more laid back department than some other ones."
good,I enjoyed working with the people that shop at Walmart. Walmart has  people working for them that like a lot of drama. In the department I worked the drama was outrageous. You couldn't do your job with someone saying something.
good,it was ok i didnt reeally like working there but it is a place to go shopping with there deals there secuirty team is on point if it werent for them i wouldnt feel safe
good,It was a good company that was able to accommodate me with my schooling hours. They tried to fit me with a job that I was comfortable with and that I could  Achieve thier expectations.
good,I enjoyed my overall time at Walmart however at times it could get stressful. But that is every job. Had I not run into the medical issues that I was having I would still be working for Walmart.
good,"A typical day at wal-mart is fast pace, when the store is very busy. It fluctuates from time to time with customer service. I have learned to be customer friendly no matter the environment. Wal mart is very customer diverse, all type races shop there. I'm the best me I can be to serve our customer with the utmost respect. I have learned to be customer friendly at all times. Wal- Mart is a palce to learn and grow if retail interest you."
good,"Ok Career Job,Poor Management,No Time with Family,Always Tired Don'tTo Give You VacactionTime Off.Rash inParkingLot,People Stealing Your Food,Tell Management About A Problem. They Look At You Crazy."
good,"As a deli associate there were three different shifts you could work. First shift you would come in, make the needed salads/sandwiches, make bread, start the first cook, and serve. Second shift typically took the trash out, did the second cook, maintain the salads/sandwiches, and serve. Third shift would come in and start the final cook, serve customers, close deli, clean the entire deli, take the trash out, and put out the extra food."
good,"Un buen ambiente laboral "
good,"Summer job collecting shopping carts and returning them to the store.  Also, cleaned up trash in the parking lot throughout the day.  Help customers when needed."
good,Walmart es una empresa que ofrece estabilidad laboral y oportunidades de aprender y desarrollar tus conocimientos.
good,When the deli soon be time to close and the plant workers get off from work looking for hot food or for so lunch meat. It was even worst when you don't have no help at all.
good,"I handled defective merchandise, product recall, theft logs, insurance claims, and inventory. Ran register when needed. Management was hard to work with being a woman."
good,"This is a really great company to start with for a beginning job, or just something to put a little money in your pocket. Wouldn't try making this a career though."
good,"Most people are really pleasant, but there are some customers and management that make the job stressful.  There is a lot of set up and then redo projects, but Steady work and had great benefits when I worked there."
good,Its great experience and I have the opportunity to learn  the store operation process and how they process and buy the products.  The hard part of the work was the communication system. I enjoy to work with public.
good,"A good working environment, the managers, and associate make you feel welcome. But it's going to take some time to get used to working there especially if it's your first time. Management is sometimes poor."
good,It requires research and analysis. There are a set of task that must be completed each day. I enjoyed the peace of the job. The hardest part of the job is fixing the cash machine.
good,"This was my favorite place that i worked at so far, working with children and adults and people of all ages and culture made it very interesting and entertaining."
good,"I personally have had a positive experience with Walmart for the most part, the benefits are great, not enough equipment , Telxons,MC40' to do work in a timely manner."
good,"A typical day of work included clocking in, going to the assigned station and checking items out for customers. Sometimes I had to work the self checkout station but not often. A very easy, entry level position for anyone looking to make a little cash."
good,"Always something to do, Managers were friendly and professional. Very low pay at the time I worked there. Long shifts sometimes and short breaks. Clean work environment."
good,"Walmart has a management structure which often overlaps. This leads to misdirection rather frequently. Favoritism is a bit it of a problem there, but overall, I enjoyed working there. You stay busy, breaks are reasonable, as is pay."
good,"I really enjoyed working with people and also talking to really nice people. So i would say meeting with new people, also working with a register so i got to learn how to use one of those. the other thing was it taught me how to use my time wisely such as no customers there is time to fill in that time wiht restocking and folding clothes."
good,Retail is retail. You work the cashier and you stock shelves. Its uneventful and repetitive but I found working in the garden center to be the most exciting of all the departments.
good,"working at walmart was a wonderful  , the managers are nice the associates are nice, the team leaders were fair, they allowed you to switch your job within the company"
good,Great company.friendly staff.Loved the discount.Manger help solve problems when issues occur. Room for growth within company.cares for there employee's
good,working overnights at walmart was easy but a bit difficult at first because you are re stocking the store. you have to learn where the things in the area you are assigned to must go. but it becomes easy as you work in the same area and you begin to stock faster with time.
good,I enjoyed working here but there was miscommunication on holdiday scheduling  but its a laid-back fast paste job quick to learn needs lenience on sick days if DR. note is given
good,"typical day in online grocery department was running around and 10 miles a day at least. "
good,I got in early afternoon for this job. I spent an hour on the floor cleaning the aisles until the truck showed up. Then I spent the next couple hours with the team of people unloading the truck. After lunch I spent the rest of the shift unloading the boxes onto the main floor.
good,I like what I do and helping customers. I don't like the fact you feel like you should mot be calling in when you are sick or child is sick. You can call in and feel like you will get repercussion for calling in. There is favouritism.
good,"great benefits, lots of growth oppurtunities, networking available. Great management, great customers, great locations, many oppurtunities available, gggg"
good,Empresa que se posiciona com um espetacular apoio ao funcionário e remunera muito bem.Adorei trabalhar nesta e se fosse possivel gostaria de voltar nesta nova Gerencia de vendas pois o apoio é de um gerente de equipe.
good,"Working at Walmart was a learning experience, the employees there was always helpful and made my time there a lot better. the store was very organized and i connected well with everyone."
good,"started straight out of high school and been there since  its a good enviorment to work in and you meet a lot of people.managers are alright also"
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you need to learn how to run a business. It is the only company that I know of where you can start at the ground floor and work your way up to management. Yes, retail is known for not having great pay or benefits, but at least with this company, you can learn knowledge and skills that should move you ahead in your career and life."
good,"i opened store un loaded delivery and then did rest of day work. learned the workings of large corp workings and was a good benefit    "
good,Was not bored and had opportunities to  work independently.  Just wanted more.  Felt like this was a stepping stone and needed to move on to the next stage.
good,An interesting n wondful place to have a future career. Walmart always welling to hire friendly n proactive associates that’s looking for job within Walmart. It’s a very friendly work place for customers n associates.
good,"Long hours wasn't very flexible, hours and schedules are only available up to three weeks at a time and job duties vary. The management differ from store to store so ask around about the management before you start or it may not be a fun experiance. Overall it is a way to get a pay check and everday is different depending on which department you are in."
good,"Good place to work just need to be more consistent with work and life balance and fair promotion "
good,Very flexible hours to work with my schedule.  Other coworkers were easy to get along with.  Management accommodated days off for Dr. appointments.  Got to meet a variety of customers
good,"Poor work life balance. Very long work hours. Average of 65-70 for a salaried manager, a week is common. This could increase with meetings or required volunteered events."
good,This Walmart job was a warehouse so I had to be fast and very focused. They are very unfair at this warehouse everyone have they favorite person and it’s very messy I didn’t enjoy working there they pay was good
good,"The company expects a lot, but they pay well if you stay with them for a long time.  The management team has both good and bad people in it's ranks so take it for what it is worth."
good,"A typical night at work was just stocking the shelves of the grocery section, and during the time I worked there I learned to pace myself to work faster and more efficiently. My supervisors were strict and thorough but sometimes could be unorganized. During the night it was a quiet and laid back workplace because there were no customers in the store. The hardest part working there was pacing myself to get tasks done on time when my supervisor gave me multiply tasks. My co-workers was the most enjoyable part working there."
good,There's always room to move up or over and try or learn something new at Walmart. My only real problem ever was the hours and wages. if those were better and easier to work with I most likely would have stayed
good,"It all depends on the store. Where I work at is relaxed but can be stressful. promoting is difficult. managers lack on communication with one another. manager mistakes are pressured on department managers expecting them to deal with it. short hours. rarely fulltime. the respectable managers are chill, will hear you out, understandable, and will help you out. easy overall.  "
good,"During my time at Walmart I watched it go from being some place where I felt at home with family to someplace where there was never enough staff and people with high work ethic were taken advantage of instead of praised.  I can honestly say that for a majority of my career there I felt wonderful about going to work and being there, the mood was one that was enjoyable to be a part of.  Slowly though, changes began to happen that caused less associates forced to do more than possible in their shift but also do it in less time."
good,For the most part working for Walmart is okay. I really loved working as a cake decorator. However they are not very understand to family issues or everyday life issues
good,Working at Walmart can be fun it just depends on what your mood is that day. It also depends on how fast paced your department runs. Walmart is also easy to move up in the company if you are a hard worker.
good,"Yes Wal-Mart pays wells, but they don't care about their employees well being. For example, when we had that terrible wind storm, I couldn't call out because I couldn't afford another point so if I would've called out it would have been automatic termination."
good,They made sure to make adjustments to work life when needed be. The highest management is very involved on the floor. There is never a hard time helping a customer.
good,I am a driven associate. I get the work done. I train other associate in my department or someone in other departments..help with.  Perform customer services.
good,"aprendí a:"
good,was my first retail job and i have to say i very much enjoyed the environment it was a fast pace work place yet u do not feel overwhelmed there is alot of negativity towards  Walmart but all and all i enjoyed my time there
good,Attending customer is number one priority .  Making sure they leave with a smile it guarantees they will be back. Customer service is essential we like our community to save money and live better.
good,"Pay is great, used to be very flexible to accommodate family life, not anymore.  Just a number now, too much work, not enough hours in the day to get it all done."
good,"Decent place. just not great pay.. hire management that have no clue what there doing, Transferring people from sams with higher pay then ours normal walmart workers"
good,When I first started I would learn very fast so I always cought on and it is very fast paste so u def have to be quick I would suggest that if u work there to stay to ur self and don’t get in anyone business just do ur job and go home
good,Uma empresa seria me ensinou e tive um aprendizado bom e aceito como pcd
good,"Typically, an average day working at Walmart was fast-paced and a task was always needing to be done. Co-workers and management were amazing and friendly. The pay-to-work ratio was unfair, considering I would carry out tasks for several other departments, including stocking for grocery, unloading trucks, doing/carrying out certain management tasks for online pickup, and always tended to customers who required assistance with phones, data plans, services, and technical support. There never was a hard part of my day, for this job, always easy going and the customers rarely ever added any difficulties."
good,Interesting customers and friendlyfor the most part. Meeting new people is the most enjoyable part of my job. My typical day at work consists of helping customer. I have no problem stopping what I'm doing to assist a customer with their shopping.
good,El ambiente laboral en ocasiones no es tan bueno. Cambio de administración frecuente
good,Busy fast paced and friendly work days  where you are expected to learn fast and adapt quick to help your team achieve their goals for the day. Great place to work .
good,I enjoy helping customers find items they are looking for and love my co-workers. It's fast pace when it's holiday time and when there are major sales going on. It's a fun and peaceful environment.
good,Wal-mart is a great place to work. You get discounts as well as you get to meet and greet new people everyday. Theres not much bad to say at all about wal-mart
good,"Walmart is a challenging place to work, especially when a person is trying to maintain a healthy work life balance.  Maintaining staffing is always a challenge."
good,"Overall it was a very enjoyable experience working at Walmart. Didn't agree with how management ran things but I was just a ""grunt"" and had little to no say in the matter."
good,"Walmart is a decent company to work for; they offer decent benefits and a good pay for the work you do, as well as accrued paid time off. There is, reportedly, many opportunities to move up in the store, though none have really come my way in my time with the company."
good,"They customers were great along with the employees. Several of the management teams were excellent in helping out on busy days. Quarterly, we were always treated for our sales."
good,"Es una empresa con grandes beneficios, se preocupa por el bienestar de sus trabajadores y por el desarrollo de los mismos. En lo personal adquirí muchos conocimientos respecto al giro comercial, la productividad y la rentabilidad de una empresa, así como el manejo de personal. Una de las cosas más difíciles es la organización y administración del tiempo, puesto a que se necesita invertir mucho tiempo y dedicación para lograr buenos resultados y adquirir nuevos conocimientos. Lo  que más me gustó es la interacción entre  el personal y el involucramiento hacia las diversas áreas de la compañía."
good,"The job was fast paced and stressful at times, but the hours usually flew by and you had no time to get bored. You also got praised if you did a good job and sometimes a small raise."
good,"Serving stores, merchants and customer in roles as Merchant, Operator and Support areas of the company.  Enjoyed working with various amount of people in various roles, backgrounds and experiences in keeping the customer at the center."
good,Able to gain experience working in a strong working environment with the possibility of moving forward in the company quickly. Face to face interactions with Head Office and the CEO and VP are consistent.
good,"Decent fast-paced environment, can be stressful at points in the day. Start of shift would begin with cleaning, helping customers when they would arrive."
good,"I usually clock in and start covering everyone's breaks and lunches. Or I start cleaning areas that need a clean up such as Customer service desk, Money service desk, or a register in which I would be going on. I learned that the more you learn out of your position the more Management would want you to go on the more technical spot that you don't get paid for. The managers that I've had in the past and now have been excellent. Unfortunately, I have met some  other managers that don't follow certain policy and just play the finger game where they blame their associates for not doing their jobs and doing their own. Some expect unrealistic goals as a retail store of little amount of associates. Some associates are more Favorited then others. I worked to get where I am, but cannot go more above then what I already am because of lack of acknowledgement by some members of management. The Hardest thing of this job is the amount of customers with high expectations of the store being new and not having a lot of associates to work with. Leaving those who do work to be stressed out by the rude comments and awful community of people. For the most part the usually customers are respectful, but then there's a handful of them that are just head aches. Another thing is the hours you are given. Because of this customer first program, some associates are only able to maintain some hours as a full-time and not just a guarantee of 40 hours. Some part-time people want as little as 16 hours at least but could only get 5-8 hours in a week. It all really depends which Walmart you go to I guess.The"
good,"arrived at work to set up for unloading the truck or trucks that arrived that day. then began unloading the truck of merchandise and placed it on pallets, which took about 4 hours. after lunch the pallets were pulled to the floor to the appropriate departments. we would  then open the boxes and stock the shelves. after that we would pull picks from the back room to stock the shelves as well. that was usually the end of the day. they were very strict on paying no overtime so everyone had to be done by the scheduled end time."
good,While I built many relationships from the store manager to our customers and I am very thankful for the experiences I was able to witness as an employee. Many employees at Walmart work two jobs and attend college as well. They are dedicated to their jobs and families. While my employment at Walmart was a stepping stone for me to return to the work force. I am very thankful for the opportunities that were made possible for me while employed by Walmart.
good,"The culture at Walmart is phenomenal.  When they say Respect for the Individual is a core value they mean it.   "
good,Start day by breaking down freight and restocking. Easy to stay busy all day. I learned a lot about produce on how to pick ripe or over ripe produce. Learned possible uses and how to prepare multiple items in produce. It's easy to bounce around multiple areas in fresh to gain experience in multiple departments as well.
good,"This was not a bad job. The hourly pay was horrible but, other than that i had no complaints. The management staff was great! I worked the graveyard shift which, i did not like."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you are open and flexible to their ever changing schedule.  I have met wonderful associates, managers, and customers."
good,Good Job for a student. Options for all shifts which gives the max flexibility. Most supervisors treat you well and they are understanding of the work/life balance.
good,"Something need to be saying about HR employee discussing your private family business with other employees and u the one gets the axe.After 6mos of being gone I can""t get a job there in Rockingham NC and I need to work,is there someone can make it happen.Some workers in management need to be replace overall a decent place to work."
good,"In my opinion, this is a great first job but unless you work your way to a management position it is not a great job to spend your life in. Both me and my husband started our working lives in a walmart position."
good,Working in this company really allowed you to interact with customers. Working hard could lead you to a better position within this company. The customers were great as well as the employees and management.
good,My Store Manger provided me with some of the best management training I have ever received. Given enough time and available positions I truly believe he would've promoted me.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral (no en todas las areas), salario regular"
good,The lawn and garden center staff are very friendly. Each is a team player fully capable of doing their job. The supervisors are always knowledgeable and are happy to answer any questions should an employee not know what to do. Management always encourages employees to be the best that they can be.
good,Walmart has been an amazing place to work at. You get tossed right into the job but you are not going to flounder. Senior programmers are able to assist and provide you a solid understanding.
good,"Walamrt is a fair company to work with. It is always changing, and it does allow for career advancement. Some of the management is very good, but there can be a lack of communication and sometimes very poor managers. Some associates do become like family, but some associates are always causing drama and create a stressful atmosphere."
good,Walmart was one of the better jobs I have worked at. Besides not telling us new cashiers we were seasonal it was an ok place to work. Didn't have much drama and you didn't feel you were in high school. However they made up excuses to let go at least 20 people after Black Friday.
good,"It is a great place to work if you only want to work part time hours. It is possible if you can stick around long enough to possibly get full time, but it is not easy. Your hours will vary and you must be willing to work any shift. There are no set hours."
good,Walmart is one of the top hiring employer in the country. The standard interview and orientation system of Walmart is fair. But employees such as myself  lack training and guidance on the sales floor. The employee definitely needs to be a fast learner and adjust to new procedures quickly. Time schedules are really not flexible to outside living. Employees are able to change their job preference every 6 months but Walmart lack different career opportunity titles.
good,"Walmart is not horrible but not a place you want generally want to put all your eggs. If your looking for work then your in the right place. They will hire anyone at least once. You will have to open your schedule if you want to get steady hours. Be careful if you want to go into management, its a lot of politics and every store is wildly different. Recently two people who have worked there for 10 plus years (in management positions) where given 2 months to find a new position or be forced to take a ""severance package""."
good,"I don't mind working at walmart. It has good pay and good benefits. However, it is not easy to move up to higher areas. It is also extremely difficult to move to other areas in the store."
good,it was a wonderful exprience for my first job in retail. but i wasnt able to further my career through walmart. i will always be greatful for the opportunity that was provided to me.
good,"Working at Walmart was okay to work there. Everyone one was a team player and worked together to get the job done."
good,"Yes the title is just a metaphor. Some days it gets so stressful that it feels like you are literally walking on ice. It was rough some nights and better on others, there wasn't much time for relaxation. It was quick paced and quite angering some nights when you had to take on others' responsibility. Great pay rate though, that's the one thing I will miss about it."
good,"very supportive management team, great co workers, good benefits, if you were able to afford them, but the pay was not very good, I was recommend the job to a retiree or someone with a second income, the store that I worked at was very small and family liky like"
good,Between struggles with management not backing up policy in front of customers and customers being outright vile and violent at times the job can be stressful. but compensation is enough to live on.
good,"Easy work but wanted to work full time.  Starting off you do not work full time.  They always wanted to put me on nights, didn't want to work with me on my schedule"
good,"I work part-time 3 nights a week. I enjoy helping the customers. I work in Kirksville,MO. The management there is usually helpful. I like working there as it allowes me to make extra money."
good,From working at different stores at Walmart I have found out it having a dedicated and caring management team makes or breaks the store. My favorite boss I have ever worked with was at one store. Walmart has the training and good work flow available when used properly. The more people have a team mindset the better the experience.  For the most part my time at Walmart was a positive experience and I would recommend working at certain locations.
good,"If you work outside, like I did, then you will have some communication with co-workers. The job was straight forward and repetitive. The worst thing that happened was the feeling of alienation because everyday was basically the same."
good,"constant work flow, a lot of customer contact and experiences, management lacks tactic and employee relations, hardest part is to keep your weekly work hours withing 40 per week, fun working with all other emplyees"
good,Es una muy buena empresa con un salario relativamente bueno pero con muy poca oportunidad de crecimiento
good,"Good place to work for a couple years, provides good benefits. Salary is descent.. good place to start career and promote within the company.. Bad management, there always moving managers throughout the store, hard to adjust to so many management"
good,"Always on the go, fast paced work environment. Emphases on customer service and creating a memorable shopping experiences for all guests. Wages are not ideal but seem to be moving in a better direction."
good,"Management does not care much for employees, not willing to work with associates very often. Will schedule you all hours besides nights, leaving no time for family or friends. Not very many options for job advancement or not a good chance."
good,On a typical day working at Walmart is very busy and  fast paced with a steady work duties.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers assisting and making sure the customer is satisfied with help that i provided.  The hardest or most difficult part about the job is that  management appears too have an overload of duties to assist at times.  I've learned it's always a plus to listen first.
good,I enjoyed my co workers and customers. The only downfall was keeping equipment updated and filling our material request. other then that it was a fun work place.
good,alot of working back to back and fun with customers. there are alot of helping and hard work going on which shows how much we all can be a team and get the job done.
good,"I am in personnel and I do all the new hire orientations and training.  I  also do benefits, paychecks and other HR duties.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with great people day in and day out and see the people have have orientated move up in the company."
good,"Fue una excelente experiencia de trabajo, siempre tuve sentido de urgencia por aprender de todos lo departamentos un excelente trato a los clientes."
good,"Typical work day consists of working with 2-3 fellow managers and setting up the plan for the day and making sure that we are staying in stock and working on continual plans to make sure the assoicates stay productive. There is daily interaction with customers, good and bad, but it is all of how you proceed with each interaction for how the situation gets resolved. Best part of the job is the daily interaction with the associates and developing them to become the future leaders they are meant to be. There is a lack of a work life balance."
good,Wal-Mart can be a great place for someone looking for a temporary place of work or for the more competitive can become a great career for those looking to advance to management.
good,"i enjoyed my time working at walmart i was trained to work in different departments staff was nice, i would work there again if i had the chance loved it."
good,"Trabalho bastante dinâmico, mas muitas trocas de lugares sem necessidade."
good,"I love the people I work with and I have regulars that come through my line that I've come to know and enjoy."
good,I enjoy working there at Walmart over the years and now I feel is time to move on for more money and better benefits people are great but there are no more raises and if hired by the shipyard it will be closer to home
good,"* Like working at Walmart.  "
good,I hold a very labor-intensive job and compete  physically. I have had to push myself intensively in order to keep up with the others and am now able to perform better physically as a result.
good,"Working in the electronics department i got to help several customers, that had no idea what they were looking for. I made connections with my regulars. I enjoyed learning about new products."
good,"It can be hectic at times. The job itself is great, but the managers can be awful. They are all about the numbers, getting tasks done on time, regardless of circumstance. They do not care if you are sick or injured (unless it was work related). "
good,"I honestly miss working at Walmart. I love working in a retail environment. I am a people person and I loved working in customer orientated environment. Each day was different. Some days were relaxed, others were not. Each department was different in its own way. I worked in many different departments and did different things in each one. The hours were long and you're on your feet for most of it. Sometimes customers were ornery, sometimes you'd go all day without a problem. Wages were low and you don't always qualify for health insurance. But you can get vision and dental no matter what. It's not bad for a starting job and if you're good at what you do, you may be offered a management position."
good,"Good job to stay afloat, but not a career choice. This job was very fast paced. The management was extremely unprofessional. A lot of things were based off of personal opinions."
good,"Nice workers "
good,"The company was fun and enjoyable to work for. I made good co workers as friends, everyone was nice and management was good. I do recommend someone there to work."
good,"Work is fast paced, stressful and competitive but financial and non-financial rewards were fair.  Over the last  5 years there has been no consistency or security in the project/program management job family."
good,Good thing is there is always something that can be done at Wal-Mart. Problem is that there is neither enough hours in the day to do it or not enough people to complete the tasks in an 8 hour shift. Managers there micromanage you like crazy creating an extra stressful workload for their employees with unrealistic expectations which causes their customer service to suffer and high turnover rate in employment.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart for the most part.  There was a great diversity of people working there and I met a lot of people both customers and employees.
good,"Was a decent job to be honest, the managers can be somewhat annoying to a pedigree. Although I've only been there for only 2 years when April hits, I've had my fair share of annoying managers."
good,"A typical day at Walmart involved interacting with the customer by greeting them or accepting cash, check or credit card payments.  Maintaining my workstation.  I learned how much customers are valued."
good,"I worked as a cashier.  I enjoyed the customers and most of my co-workers.  I learned how to watch for shop lifters and found many while working the self-checkout area.  I think the hardest part of the job was that I was limited in moving up since I was unable to open up my schedule to work any hours. "
good,Wal-Mart was a place for me to work for a summer before I went to college. It is not what I would consider a career unless you get into management at some point.
good,"My happy place! I really love the work environment. Co-workers are easy to get along with. "
good,"Walmart has a lot of employees so as one, you have your own specific department in the store and your job is pretty laid back, considering that you only have one task to do, most of the time."
good,"Walmart Pharmacies are probably the best place to be within the retail environment. The hours, the pay, the benefits- all are subject to your level of experience. It can be a hard learning curve, but once the ins and outs of the software are learned, it becomes a stable and sometimes fulfilling job. Walmart will train you, over and over again- it is in their interest to have trained associates. "
good,I love the interaction with my customers. Most of them just want someone to talk to. Some of them are just looking for an argument. That keeps my job exciting. No two days are the same. I smile when I know I have made someone else smile. That’s my goal.
good,"8 hours work keep area in order,learned customer service.work place is to save customer money and a good value on goods,when assistant was not very helpful and no help,best part of job was work went smoothly and time went by fast"
good,"There's several things Wal-mart does right, believe it or not. Paid time off, sick leave, vacation, yearly wage increase. The chance to promote is there if you're qualified. But, the Wenatchee store has a few problems. Namely, the management, there is of course, drama as well, but when you have that many people in such a space, some people just wont get along,"
good,As a cart pusher associate many things are expected from us. It is a tiring position and managers do not seem to understand how it is when working outside because they expect us to hustle. It seems like they want me to literally be running around. overall it is a good job because it is a simple task.
good,"20 years with Walmart and plenty of changes."
good,"Wal-Mart is a fast and up coming retail place. Customer service has to be at the top of your list. Stocking shelves and making sure things are where they should be, prices are right. always getting ready for the next holiday or the next fad out there"
good,Very fast paced had a time limit to finish tasks only get paid every other week never have enough money to stretch those 2 weeks between pay had to find other means of support
good,Very nice atmosphere friendly staff management willing to support and I see many opportunities to progress. Very understanding and supportive leadership team
good,Management differed in approaches from double work to very efficient work. I'm not saying work is a place to make friends but there's gonna be someone or group of people to mesh with. In all jobs there's gonna be those who don't work hard but the majority of people work diligently. The hardest part of the day is sometimes its very slow so you'll find your self doing a lot of just standing or doing tedious tasks.
good,"As long as you come in on time and do what(somewhat) you should, you'll be okay.... Sometimes  the associate managers would expect the regular stockers to do their jobs of completing a certain task, but then again, what jobs higher ups don't expect the lowers to do their stuff when they can."
good,"it was pretty good working for walmart, was my first job. i got paid pretty well, made good hours. i also got a discount for working at walmart which i loved."
good,"Over all working for Walmart was productive, although the management did put a lot of pressure on their harder working staff members and not enough on the workers who needed a little push."
good,"the management isn't very helpful in situations when you need them. you ask them for help and they leave you waiting forever and they also don't explain anything to you, your just thrown out to figure everything out alone."
good,"Typical Day - Long Hours. Learned - Many skills in various industries and sales divisions, retail layout and transition, relationship Management for cross sector community and governmental strategic partnerships. Good culture in Corporate Office.  Opportunity to develop culture in standalone facility management.  Hardest part of job: retail demands."
good,The Managers worked with me well to try to accommodate my school schedule with my work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was when i would get a chance to experience other parts areas of work other then just working at the check out isles.
good,"Un ambiente laboral muy bueno, además de que fomentaban mucho el trabajo en equipo, y constantemente te rotaban en áreas para mayor soltura en varias áreas de atención al cliente."
good,"It is retail. The number one retailer in the World, so anything you can expect to see/experience you will."
good,It was a decent job with ok pay. Just a temporary job until I could find something better. The managers were good to work for. They were very knowledgeable. I improved my skills in changing tires and changing oil.
good,Walmart changes hours and requirements annually.  When things are working smoothly hours or schedules are changed.  Bonus structure is consistently changed decreasing bonus payments.
good,"I don't remember much just that we had three hours to unload the truck, one hour lunch then five hours of moving merchandise to the floor and help stock the floor."
good,I enjoy my time at Wal-Mart. They are very good with your schedule and are willing to help you. They take into consideration your school life so they can help you do your best to achieve your goals.
good,The pay isn't worth it. It's constantly being changed. Rules are still getting changed. Overwhelming. Too many customers orders are never ready. Corporate kept raising amount of customers allowed to order despite short staff and losing employees when they start.  It's under new management.  Could be different. Always under pressure. Something always comes up. Management never responded when we were desperate for help. Was told grocery pickup was the most profitable and high demanding department. Even effects your bonus if we fail. It's a 50/50 job for me. I don't know how I feel for it.
good,A typical day at work is always busy no stop.I learned that it's a fast environment which i enjoy your helping out costumers and doing your assigned job.I personally feel that management was below average.They were lost on what directions to give the employees.They continually kept contradicting each other.I was very comfortable with my work environment.Having to multitask your assignments and helping customers at all times.Being able to do both helping your customer and doing your job making everyone happy .
good,"A typical day at work would be cleaning up around the department that they assigned you for the day. I learned a lot about team work, and putting things back were they belong. The management was okay. The workplace culture was very good. They hired people from different backgrounds. The hardest part of the jobs was when there wouldn't be enough people for the night and you had to work all the clothing departments. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,El ambiente es agradable ta que quienes laboran lo hacen con pasion
good,Productive and exciting place to work. Very fun and family oriented environment to work in.  Management works well with employees that are still in school.
good,"Stay busy from morning until you leave, with company direction, follow up and customer interaction. Walk the floor, give notes to management, follow up through out the day. Have conference calls weekly. Have tools to find company changes and direction. Have to plan on merchandising themes and seasonal changes."
good,"i really enjoyed working at Walmart, the staff and managers are very understanding. They worked with my school schedule. Sometimes they would provide a free lunch, coffee and donuts for the staff. They also have fun days, ex: jersey day, blue jean day etc."
good,"1st line supervisors, were outstanding. every holiday had food IE, Dinner or lunch.........never worked retail, learned how to stock the back room, and floor.(departments). Culture was good, management some were great to work for, others not so much. being told you can leave at the end of your shift, then having to stay later or even much later! Could never get two days off in Rowe. IE Wednesday and Saturday but never back to back! Loved working with the people I worked for and the people I worked with! Helping the customers!"
good,fast pace 
good,"surprisingly I had fun at this job. the pay was decent, however, it was in Fairbanks, Alaska but it was easy and the pay was decent. For me it wasn't a career but a fun job that I did not need to take home with me."
good,"I've never worked at a Walmart before, but this gave me a really good experience. I worked part time of course, but the job was easy. The management was on top of their stuff, everything was always taken care of. Staff was all lovely."
good,A great place to work . Great training in all aspects of customer service. Great proucts and low prices . Advancement opportunitys and training are available
good,You can Advance quickly as long as your motivated and always moving. You need to be dependable and flexible on the work schedule and 24 hours a day availability
good,"As a cashier you will stay busy. Scanning items, greeting customers, and even maintaining to keep your station clean. Hard to get a job here but once you do good to keep."
good,"Management makes it fun as long as you work, "
good,"Empresa muito agradável de trabalhar e  grande espírito de equipe  , com muita visão de crescimento."
good,loved most of my customers. most of the associates and management are good people. they do have good insurance benefits. the personnel staff and awesome people and are willing to help in any way they can.
good,Sam Walton's philosophies are great!  The company is always changing and evolving with the times. There are always opportunities to move up in the company.

good,"i was able to transfer from another store out of state. the transfer process was very efficient. frequent reviews and raises. good working conditions such as cleanliness, safely, airconditiong and heating."
good,Walmart is very busy and fast.  I learned how to deal with many difficult kinds of people.  The management was good.  There was nothing hard about the job at Walmart.  The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with people.
good,"In my time at Walmart I held many positions from being an overnight stocker to being an assistant manager. I enjoyed it for the most part but During the time I was an assistant manager the daily requirements were 4 12 hour days, which usually turned int 16 hour days."
good,Walmart gets a bad reputation. Seems people with a good work ethic enjoy the place. It's fast paced and stable work. I actually regret leaving. I miss the teamwork atmosphere.
good,"Overall a decent workplace, you get you task assigned and you do it within allotted time. Some things I learned during this job was how to stock and organize shelves correctly, how to handle customers and their problems correctly and time management."
good,Walmart is a great company to work with.  My management team and I have a great working relationship.  They make it worth coming to work everyday. They know how to make me smile with I am feeling down.
good,"Each store is very different from one another. You can have a very fun work environment, or you can have a bad one. It mostly depends on you. Depending on the position you hold is depending on your work/home life balance. The higher you get the more your hours change, the harder it can become with home life. Overall it's not a bad place to work."
good,"Walmart was a place where we worked as a team and I enjoyed that the most. I learned various things customer service, being a cashier, working with coupons, food stamps, WIC,  etc...Overall what I left with various skills from Walmart and they were a great company to work with I really enjoyed workikng for the company."
good,"start my day off waiting to punch in,iv'e learned to be courteous,and polite to people and being able to help them,the work place culture is slow pacedthe hardest part about the job is not being able to finish stocking all of the product."
good,"I enjoyed going to work, enjoyed and made lots of friends.. Stil friends with most of them.  The job is stressful at times. but nothing u cant deal with."
good,"But that's okay. This company will suck the life out of you, but as long as it's a temporary gig (summer job, making money during career gap, etc.), you'll be fine. The worst part wasn't the customers, or the managers, technically, but the constant demand to do things that weren't in my job description. Moving to other departments or the front end put me in positions that I wasn't trained for during rush hour, stressing me out significantly. If that doesn't bother you, your biggest concern will be the back and forth between insufficient hours and 39 hours with no consistent schedule (off at 11pm, back at 7am), all while expecting standards that the company as a whole doesn't maintain. But, again, unless you plan to build a career here, all the negatives should be water off a duck's back."
good,Really enjoyed working here.  Shortly after being employed I had surgery and their benefits program supported my leave with very little work for me to do.  I never felt like my job was at jeopardy.  I would definitely go back.
good,"its pretty much exactly what you expect, people get angry about bags costing money, people get angry because you looked at them the wrong way. its walmart"
good,the walmart i worked for they had alot of favorites. I felt kind of out casted.  It was stressful and hard to remember things in one day. I was left alone the first day i was there.
good,After being there 4 years only given $0.25 per hour after company revised hourly pay for new associates.
good,"Trabajaba de 6 a 8 horas por día, aprendí todo lo que cobro con tarjetas de créditos, cupones y cierre de cajas."
good,Stocked shelves graveyard shift. Couldn't get used to sleeping during the day. Had to move fairly heavy boxes so could get to be a strain physically. Nice people to work with.
good,"Nearly every coworker was hostile, very frustrated, and usually for no reason. People I worked with treated customers terribly and after telling management a few names, nothing was changed."
good,Needs more employees. You perform so many different jobs functions other than your own. They cut hours randomly and do not allow you to go over forty.
good,I liked stocking st Walmart BC I got to see all the new stock items before anyone else.i loved having store discount. Received 5$ bounce after being there 60 days.
good,"The pay at Walmart is very good. The overall culture is pretty good, but starting to fade a bit, as older, more veteran associates are being replaced. There is a shift to youth and more of a ""Dot Com"" culture/"
good,"I loved my job very much, until we started getting different managers in and out every month or so. There was not any consistency as far as who to go to for questions. Scheduling was always an issue. But aside from management, I made many different relationships with customers. I loved ensuring that they were always taken care of."
good,You don't have to have a college degree to advance. Work hard and it can pay off. The worst part of working in retail is cutting hours. If you can't work weekends or different shifts you might not get any hours.
good,"Durante o período que pude trabalhar nesta empresa , consegui  passar por varias áreas ocupando o cargo de aprendiz administrativo. ."
good,"I was part of the opening of the store crew. Everyone was new including management. We worked together as a team and I enjoyed my daily challenges. "
good,nice place to work. I get along very well with the other workers. I am very friendly and I take pride in my work. The work is very competitive. You have to make production to keep your job.
good,Too much working and little time off. Had little time with my child and with no set scedual. The staff were kind and considerate even in different departments.
good,I enjoy when I can help a customer find an item they are looking for. The hardest part is when you can't make a customer happy at all. All you can do is try and make them happy.
good,They treat people like robots instead of human beings. They need to treat people like Sam Walton wanted them to be treated. Hire enough people to cover the entire floor.
good,"Working at Walmart was an experience, I met lots of people from different walk of life. Working at Walmart was a challenge because there wasn't a set schedule, and having other obligations like family or school could make that very hard to juggle. The pay at Walmart is also very low and so are the raises."
good,"I started as an hourly with Walmart in 1993.  I rose through the ranks in Loss Prevention and then later on in the Safety department.  I loved my positions there, they each challenged me in there own specific ways.  The most enjoyable parts of the positions were the associates and managers that I interacted with.  I learned from them as much as I when I was running the training seminars.  In the 90's and early 2000's there was many opportunities for growth.  Since 2010, those opportunities became fewer and fewer.   After numerous restructures, our department went from 17 down to 4 and then finally was eliminated.  I took my experiences and am looking forward to Chapter 2."
good,"Walmart had been very good to me as far as time off and family activities go. It was surprising on how well they worked with me when I had family activities or needed time off. Its not a glamorous job, but they where surprisingly accommodating and family oriented."
good,My time with Walmart was very education and eye opening for me. Before I was withdrawn and shy around people and didn't know anything about customer service but I  had a wonder team that taught me many things that I will always carry with me.
good,"From the time I worked there til the day I ended, opportunities were available to grow within and throughout the company.  Walmart opened a lot of doors for me."
good,"The automotive is a fast past environment, You have to make sure that you do a thorough job in a high rate of time.  I enjoyed working in the automotive department"
good,"A typical day at Walmart is very busy depends on your position. Cashiers are the most hard working people up there, also the deli associates. Walmart has great benefits as well."
good,"Good company to work for. Moving in the right direction in the eCommerce and retail space. The workplace culture is excellent because it tries to adhere to the founder's values."
good,This job was always very reliable when it came to hours. They were very flexible with my schedule. The pay was great. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,The people at my Walmart are wholesome and good people who support each other and try to strive to give the best customer service they can possibly give.
good,"Working at Walmart was great. There was a different experience each day I was there. I could not believe how much the dirty staff tries to trick humans. Mind games is avoidable at any cost, but yes dirt it was. I cannot say..."
good,Hard work is easy to someone who is use to it and Wal-Mart is the place for those people.its has the best work environment around.nice friendly people with the up most respect and I also love helping those in need
good,"Fun meeting new people everyday. I've learned to be more friendly and energetic. I've learned to greet all customers with a smile. I also learned better time management. Management was attentive to employees needs. Although, employers didn't give fair chances for advances. Very strict policies. The hardest part was not calling out even in emergency situations or sicknesses. If you call out more than 4 times, no matter the situation or even doctor's excuse, you will be terminated."
good,Walmart is a typical retail store. They have lots of employees and all are pretty much treated the same. It can be fast paced or slow depending on the time of day and if it is near the holidays.
good,I enjoyed working at WalMart because of the multi tasking from landscaping to electronics. Great working place with lots of friendly people. I loved the opportunity to take care of the guest.
good,the supervisors were young and very playful wasn't about there business you had to graduate from online assessments in order to keep your job at walmart
good,The work day is busy and filled with tasks that you must be able to multi-task on. Co-workers ranged from amazing to difficult. I learned various aspects of teamwork and what it take to be a great leader.
good,I loved my job but it was too hard to advance I missed out on a couple bonuses which was hard and I got a pay cut  it was fun working there despite everything else
good,Stocker 3 Shift I Always Wanted A Job Doing That So It Was Very Easy To Me No Problems At All I Loved It. I Would Go Be Back If I Could. Walmart Is A Good Start For New Workers In Life
good,"Hard Work, but Pay is well enough. Hours are flexible, and I was offered a fair benefit package after working there for three months. I would recommend this job for people that are looking for part time."
good,"Unloading trucks an learning where to place things on the shelfs and the staff members were friendly an they let me know what I was doing wrong an helped me fix it , the hardest part was unloading the truck an the fun part was put the stuff on the shelfs"
good,Walmart kinda speaks for itself. Company is bad and treats employees like dirt. Employees are actually the best part. Fellow co-workers made the job fun. They did maybe still do provide a employee discount on everything in Walmart and Sams club. Too many levels of management hard to keep track of whos who. Holidays are nightmares incarnate especially Thanksgiving-Christmas.
good,Walmart is a great place to work you have plenty of opportunities to move up and they give you great pay. Friendly and understanding staff. Always willing to work with you about your schedule or position.
good,I really liked most of the staff at Walmart. They really try to get you to the next step and Walmart is a great and easy job. unfortunate my online testing account had been messed up and no one really did anything about it until it came past time that a test was due and it said i failed and i never even got to take the test that i got fired for and they just said they had to fire me.. but really other than that its a good place to work i would recommend.
good,"My cashier experience with Walmart started out wonderful in a very fast paced environment in Texas. The employees were all kind and helpful. They offered advancement tips and were generally easy to talk to. I transferred to Virginia, in a rural mountainous community when disaster struck my short lived career with Walmart. Human Resources had absolutely no idea how to deal with a transfer. It took them over one month to get me back to work! The lady in HR had been there for over 5 years, you would think that she had done this at least once in her career with Walmart...needless to say, I was an outsider coming into their community and a way to boot me out was shortly arranged. They were a much slower store that liked to have family reunions in the check out lanes, not cool...my goal was to leave a positive lasting impression of my local Walmart to keep customers wanting to come back to a good store. Better luck to any of you!"
good,Steady work with a lot of customer interactions. Each day seemed different so it kinda gave me something to look forward to. Also enjoyed working with team members.
good,"Excellent store. entire team pulled together at all times to get the jobs done."
good,"I really enjoyed doing the best job I could do.  I would go in a little early to make sure my part of the store I would work for, since I was a  floater is in great shape."
good,Good work place insuring that the customer comes first no matter the situation. You develope better people skills in interacting with customers while satisfying customer wants.
good,"I clock in, i do inventory, my associates are very helpful with me, and the day goes pretty smooth. I learned how to express myself in a positive aspect and build life skills with others. The management was fair but could use a lot of improvement. The culture was vibrant and colorful. The hardest part of the job was staying focus when everyone around you isn't. Most enjoyable part of the job are the customers."
good,It's alright they change your Schedule without letting you know and the managers act like their better then you and their stuff don't stank and just really disrespectful
good,i really enjoyed my job here even as short as it was i got sick and was let go because of the attendance policy i believe it needs to be ammended to suite family and chilldren emergencies
good,Walmart was an okay place to work. Management was terrible at times but the consistent schedule was good. I did not have benefits but that was okay at the time.
good,"Working at Walmart was an enjoyable experience. Helping staff and the public gave me a sense of pride. Customer service and human relations was a high light of this job. "
good,very demanding fast pace job. requires on demand split second  adaptation to the changes of the need of the business. Most be able to make important business decision.
good,"assisted guest with cashing check, paying bills, money transfers, and money orders. me and my co workers got along very well. the hardest part of the job was during tax season when the lines are out the door. the easiest part was assisting the guest."
good,"The day consisted of walking in, clocked in, see the tasks, and complete the said tasks. For a full days work, you get 2 paid 15 min breaks and one hour lunch break unpaid. Able to move up quickly."
good,from time to time you can have fun at what your doing then there are other times where you have to work very fast paced under stressful circumstances. the coworkers can be very helpful and welcoming
good,It was a good place to work at first pretty much full time hours. But then they cut your hours after the holidays cuz they don't need as much help from you.
good,all i did was collect carts and put them back inside. i had one 15 min break on my short days and on my long days i had two 15 min breaks and a 1 hour long lunch. the best part was closing because there was hardly any people by that time so i was able to go inside and help put returned items back where they went.
good,"Your normal day working for walmart is going to gve you a complete headache if you don't brace yourself before coming into work, or unless you have a lo tolerance for people. I personally enjoyed working there despite the rude managers. If anything your fellow coworkers will be the worst part of the job."
good,Recruited to the company as a Co-manager. Very fast paced. Enjoyed my job.  Was demoted in the re-structure. A lot of long term associates in our store so the departments ran well.
good,"Enjoyed working there until my job was eliminated. Fast paced time went fast, always plenty to do. Great people to work with. I thought I would retire from there."
good,"I have excellent customer service skills and have been in retail for nearly 15 years. I am in search for career enhancing experiences at the moment. As for as my skills go, there isn't much that I haven't learned concerning retail except upper management functions but I was a customer service manager for  three years on the front end on third shift. I came off third shift and started working on days as a stocker in the frozen/dairy section. I really love both positions for different reasons. As a customer service manager and cashier, the customer contact was very enjoyable to me and fast paced. I love the stocking part because it is more physical and give a certain amount of freedom to break the monotony."
good,"On a typical day, my main responsibilities consisted of stocking products and ensuring that these products were properly rotated with regards to their expiry date. Overall, it was a positive experience. The managers were always such positive people."
good,"Physical labor and customer service was hard work and exciting. Dealing with customers, stocking/restocking shelves, working closely with other departments and helping out as a team."
good,I liked my job unloading the trucks. I worked with a good crew that worked well together. The work atmosphere was friendly. We would go in and work on unloading the truck until the job was completed before our first break. Some trucks are bigger then others so sometimes the breaks would be after longer stretches of work. Worked in the back so didnt really interact with customers much.
good,"This job was acceptable to me to work at, lots of room to grow in the company. My biggest issues were with people, it seemed to be more about who you knew than what you could do. If you are able to keep your thoughts and opinions to yourself then this is a great job!"
good,Walmart is a good starting point for someone in need of a job to pay bills. definitely not a long term goal. the hardest part of the job is keeping up with the demand from superiors to do several jobs in the allotted 8 hours.
good,Typical day at work would include starting in my section but ending up where ever they needed me.The fast paced environment made the day go by faster.
good,As a 3rd shift stocker at Wal-Mart you are in for a long and boring night. With the size of the store you are generally working alone all night and rarely see other coworkers.
good,Never know what you can expect when working with Wal-Mart. Plans as expected as thing will be easier along the day. Assign task and follow up accordingly. Management is skeptical at times but everyone has a family to feed. Workplace depending on associate moral can vary. Hardest part of job is not knowing what to expect throughout the day.
good,Walmart has a great bonus program that recognizes hard work.  Their salary is based on the pay prevalent in the area where your store is located.  Upper management was truly excellent. I was constantly being taught and was never made to feel unimportant.
good,"Stocking shelves, sorting product, documenting damaged items, and being in assigned areas by manager on time. Difficulty with duties of the night were specific employees not wanting to stock in their designated sections."
good,"10-12 hour days, fast paced and always changing retail environment.  Oversaw operations of $70+ million store and 300 associates."
good,When working for Walmart it is best to be a full time employee. For job purpose be ready and willing to work anywhere in the store at any given time. The company is reasonable and hours are flexible.
good,Loved working with Walmart everything was fast paced and the managers were always there to lend a hand if needed. Mostly i loved working one on one with the customers. Making sure there needs were met
good,Walmart’s a great place to work and I’d recommend it to anyone. My coworkers and managers are great and always help when it’s needed. Working at Walmart will have you very busy and always on the move.
good,"In the area I worked it wasn't stressful, very relaxed, you had your task for the day. water plants move around displays, stock empty sections on isles. greet customers, 1 hour lunch :)!!! work on the registures. Super easy job."
good,"Unloading and separating freight requires a lot of movement and flexibility. Unloading more than one freight truck depending on store demographic. Even more lifting and pulling with pallet jacks. Physical workload aside, still a fun and good learning experience."
good,Overall I love working for Walmart but sometimes when restructuring certain positions the process is not fair.  It is not judged by experience or qualifications but rather a buddy system.
good,"Worked well as part time job worked around other job schedule, co workers were friendly, management was helpful , many chances for advancement, store could use some updates"
good,Fair place to work. I enjoyed most of the people that I worked with. Management was overall good. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the late shift by myself. The most enjoyable part was being able to interact with customers on a daily basis.
good,"I like walmart it is a nice, friendly place, that has everything u need in it. A very great place to shop and could be a great place to work if you are flexible."
good,"The environment was excellent, though management was very poor. Emergency absences resulted in termination, no matter what the reason. Nonetheless, work was fun and enjoyable, and the hours were great."
good,"you need to be in good shape, very fast paced, you will be walking and running for about 12 hours a day, they use a percentage system to tell how fast you need to moved for each order."
good,Cooperative environment with a company culture of encouraging staff members to assist clients in finding the most affordable and suitable product they need.
good,"A typical work day was a good day.  I learn how to collect, count a large quantity of money, balancing the money for each cashier, look for errors, trouble shoot errors, solve errors, find out what caused the shortage in a cashiers drawer, prepare money for deposit, complete deposit slip, have manager to recount money and seal the deposit bag with deposit slip inside before the looms truck comes to pick up deposits. Management was okay, workplace culture was okay, the research of trying to find what happen to missing money was the hardest of the job if not find.  The enjoyable part of the job was working with people and give excellent customer service to my teammates."
good,"Love working for them for 4 years and enjoy working with the customer.  I am a team player but work wonderful on my own.  Have worked in cashier, customer service, and apparel/sales associate."
good,"I would still be working there if they could have gave me 40 hr. and benefits.  I liked working in customer service but I really liked working as a  cashier.  You had your slow hr and then you had your fast pace hrs. I learned how to send and receive money, do money orders etc...Management was ok, sometimes they had to many orders coming from the higher up and didn't really know how to place us."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for. They offer good benefits, such as medical, dental, vision, paid time off, 401 match, and live insurance. Walmart is also good for the community."
good,Walmart was a really fun place to work you always talked to deferent people and always busy either from stocking shelf's to unloading trucks to running casher
good,"O que sei hoje grande parte aprendi na empresa Ex: gerência pessoas, a responsabilidade onde tive líderes ótimos e alguns regular Uma empresa boa de se trabalhar, com oportunidade de crescimento profissional, com uma cultura muito boa, um nível de engajamento médio um ambiente de trabalho bom ...... A parte mais difícil acho que a comunicação poderia melhorar. Gostei de fazer parte da equipe......"
good,"Walmaet was demanding . I worked long hour because l know every demand so l fill in for no call no show. I love the fact the at l was well trained in all depart, however the pressure was tought. I thank God l was strong and able to get my job done plus help other. I did become a shift lead and l love the training walmart gave me. I learned how to cope  and survive working under presure."
good,"Era un buen trabajo, me ayudo a ser un poco mas responsable con las tareas que te asignaban y me sirvió para ser mas servicial con la gente (clientes y compañeros de trabajo). Pero consume mucho de tu vida social si estar en el turno rotativo y aveces te exijan cosas de mas, aparte de ser vendedora de piso, también era la rotulista suplente cuando salia un cambio de precio inesperado y no estaba el rotulista en turno, así que no veía mucho en mi desarrollo profesional."
good,is a good company to be employed for nice people well some are most managers are good some are not depending on if u are friends with them or not other then that store manager was good person and a few of the assistants were good to work with and for but that's in every job u got good and bad people
good,"working for walmart was not bad. i was able to meet some great people and learn a new business, however the managers were not great managers and could sometime be lazy"
good,"Being a cashier here was not too bad for the most part. The worst part was that customers would sometimes get mad about things you don't have control over, such as the prices of items. It was also not very fun to have to wait for a customer service manager to help you out, as a lot of times, they would be very slow about responding, sometimes because they are too busy goofing off instead of working. That would sometimes make the customer even more angry. "
good,"A company that values respect for the individual at its core for fellow associates and customers.  A wide variety of benefits, but most are not available until 6 months into position.  Work schedule can be varied, but is usually available 3 weeks out to plan."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for . You should have a open availability , the schedule verys, hard to get a set schedule . Good team building learning experience . Learn good customer skills and there always room to move around and learn other areas of the retail business"
good,Can be a great way to make money while going to college or for young teens and adults who have just finished high school also can be a great place to make a career in business retail and management
good,It was a great job exsperence i learned a lot wish i never had to leave. Fresh food aera was fun got to try new products to let custumers know how somethings are if they ever had questions about any of them.
good,"A cultura de Segurança do Trabalho era regular."
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers and working with my many customers. I learned that some people you have to keep minimal contact with in order to avoid conflicts. It seemed that there is a fair amount of favoritism in place with managers. Some managers focus on the negative and do little to encourage staff working under them.
good,The work was productive work place. 
good,"The management & supervisors were great. "
good,I cashiered for 7 months. Definitely some interesting characters but you find interesting people in every job you have. It was a lot of fun and I would definitely want to be rehired if they would ever call me back to rehire me. LOL. I had to quit because of a hernia (not work-related) but I haven't been able to get my job back yet.
good,"At the start of my 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift, the mornings were fairly slow until about 10 a.m. when the pace would begin to quicken. During the first few hours we were open, was the time I would spend cleaning and tidying up the Self Checkout space. I would ensure the machines and drink fridges were spotless and there were enough bags for each self use machine. All throughout my shift I was on constant watch for possible theft attempts, and deterred any suspicious customers. I worked for Wal-Mart for well over a year, and passed the test to become a Customer Service Manager, but because of poor management, I was never given the chance to fill my desired roll. The part of the job I enjoyed most was, engaging with the customers. It allowed for me to interact with the people of my community and better understand what kind of people I shared a hometown with. The hardest part was working with coworkers that refused to learn or put in any real effort to service our customers to the best of our ability. I believe laziness should not be tolerated in the work place and customers needs should be our first priority, they're the reason we have a job in the first place."
good,Just another job. I found my position boring. No excitement. It seems like the company is just too big. Wal-Mart has lost that interpersonal touch. Thank you.
good,I had a fun time and walmart and everyone was nice and productive i learnd to work in a fast past enviroment and got a few nice tricks in my time there
good,"I worked in lawn and garden, I worked with plants but mainly helped customers with loading their vehicles with mulch and dirt. I normally had a good schedule."
good,It gives you the opportunity to grow within the company.  Some managers are better than others and due to opening new stores there is lots of changes on management. But over all it was a good experience and I learned a lot of different things.
good,Was able to do my job with no situations coming from it. The manager would expect you to work as many hours as possible. Would work many hours without being able to take time back for my family.
good,The workplace was enjoyable but the security of it was HORRIBLE. People use to steal and the security was so bad to the point that they ended up being robbed. Everything else was great about it though.
good,"faced paced career retail enviroment omaha nebraska advancement and fair hiring practices"
good,"I personally feel that employment through Walmart has been very flexible, as they are willing to accommodate students in the workforce and will work around the student's schedule, provided the student gives enough notice before their events. I personally have been able to advance and take on new tasks and responsibilities through my time at Walmart, and have learned invaluable information through working with the other cashiers, customer service associates, and customer service supervisors."
good,its very fast pace. learned basic handling of food preparations. customers are easy going if you are honest with them and consider there feelings . management tries to push you because the know you are capable of finishing tasks. its only hard when I think to much the most enjoyable part of working is creating and making a family work environment .
good,wanking her was a great time working here I enjoyed it very much if I needed to I would love to go back and work for wal mart great company to work for
good,"I have worked for Walmart 22yrs now. A typical day for me is busy from the time I clock in until the time I clock out. I learned the entire warehouse which means all departments, I have gone for Management several times but, I am starting to realize that building is not looking promising for me to advance my career with. I love interacting with people and, always want to help them be better."
good,"Un gran ambiente de trabajo, donde la dinámica hace que no se torne monótono, con trabajos variados."
good,"Travail physique et productif"
good,"Despite being paid $10.00 per hour they didn't schedule me for full time, Barley making enough to pay bills. I would be scheduled for 2 times a week very rarely were there weeks where i worked the full time required. I worked harder than most of the managers did managing 10-13 isles worth of product keeping it tidy, organized and managing to restock and help customers at the same time."
good,there is nothing to really say the place was good and all but just wasnt a fit for me. i think i can one thing about them they do treat they employees with respect.
good,"it was fun but stressful at the same time, a lot is expected of new employees and my direct supervisor didn't seem to like my performance for some reason."
good,"My experience at Wal-Mart was enjoyable, i had good co-workers and helpful respectful managers, I helped customers with merchandise and pricing, I also help find merchandise or with orders and stocking product."
good,"It was a good first good paying job, but I would recommend something else. You don't want to do the same exact thing every so how day when you could be doing something better."
good,Typical day is to work top stock then do section work. Restock or set up new features. But primary is to speak to customers and serving their needs all while getting your responsibilities done for that day.
good,"The work was kind of strenuous because I had to bring in carts from outside in very low temperatures. I worked the night shift, so the temperatures were even lower."
good,When you are fast and friendly you start to build a friendship with customers. You will notice that the same customers will find your check-out line and wait for you. It makes you feel really good that you make someone's day a little better just by being nice.
good,"I worked in the Produce department, so I normally stock produce all day unless we had coverage and another department needed help. I have learned great customer service and productiveness."
good,I worked at Walmart through school.  They were able to work with my schedule and gave me a lot of work experience.  Company discount is a great bonus and a great place to get your feet wet in the world.
good,"Enjoyed my job,loved working with my co-workers, was responsible for entire deli area,wasnt paid properly ,trained co-workers an was paid less than them even with longer employment there an experience"
good,"At Walmart, every day was different. Some days would be slow, while others were very fast paced. I started off working as a cashier, then a customer service manager, then a pharmacy technician. Every department that I was a part of, allowed me to learn something new. the best was working in the pharmacy where I was able to learn about a lot of medications."
good,Fast paced retail environment. Team work involved at all levels. Inflexible on working hours. Great environment if you enjoy customer service and are a people person.
good,Es una empresa en la cual desarrolle mis conocimientos adquiridos en la universidad
good,stores made up of good and bad customers and workers. wide variety of people and no apparent limits on vertical mobility if you're up for the task. managers are hardest part of job due to variation in ability and difficulty finding one to help. most enjoyable part is the good people that make days go smooth and the bonuses received when accidents are avoided
good,"Walmart has been a great company to work for. I have been employed there for 22 years and 4 months. I have served as department manager, Assistant Manager, Co-Manager, District manager, and for the last 12 years I was the personnel manager. I would really be interested in something in the HR field."
good,"Was trained as a cashier. Worked as a cashier for a couple of weeks. A quick change artist asked me to make change for him several times. The next day my manager called me into the office asking why my register was short by a few hundred dollars. I hadn't stolen any money, but the quick change artist had come in. I suggested they review the security tape so they could see my actions during my shift. They reviewed the footage and moved me to the garden center, worked there until I was injured with a hernia. Requested to be moved to the toy department. Worked in the toy department for a few weeks and decided to seek out other employment opportunities."
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. The people are very friendly and are always trying to find new ways to help you. I would recommend people to work there as well.
good,great place of work just if you have career goals make sure to actively peruse them. Very easy to get comfortable and lose focus on your goals/ dreams
good,working at walmart is ok-ish but the customers are just straight morons i swear to god who the heck goes to the cereal aisle to talk to the person stocking it and askes them where the cereal aisle is like come on people how dumb are you
good,"a typical day at work is calm and relaxed,managers were understanding, work was easy and very manageable. I was able to learn different aspects of the company."
good,"Plataforma - (Todo Dia) não seguem a cultura Walmart por não ter a estrutura que toda loja precisa ter como um todo de equipe profissional. Muita cobrança e pouca solução dos superiores. Não há Conciliação profissional/vida pessoal,  pois  as escalas 6x1 impõe que nossa convivência seja mais no trabalho do que com a própria família. Porém embora tenha seu lado negativo também há seu positivo. Plataforma vasta para oportunidades dentro da empresa, além do seu compromisso é dever com seus associados. Sou grato pela minha estada na empresa Walmart Brasil (plataforma- Todo dia) Salvador - BA."
good,"As a cashier I found the customer service managers hard to find or often talking to other associates a lot, sometimes more than necessary. Other than this everyone at Walmart is very friendly and they give a warm welcome to any new associates or customers. The only issue I have is the lack of proper training (depending on the store)."
good,"So much has changed so it hard to give an opinion of Walmart today. Management always needs more training at WalMart. Some do not have skills to know how to talk to their associates. I'd say that if I had to recommend any additional training it would be in active listening. Still, the other associates you will work with are some of the best people you will ever meet. You learn to work as a team or you will find it difficult to work there. I worry about some of the new policies I have heard that they are implicating this year. I'd say that the best part of working for Walmart is the coworkers you will work alongside. The worst part would be the inconsistency of hours. Almost equal is that there is little as far as full time anymore."
good,"It was a good job besides our shift manager, he would get mad at one team for something another team didn’t do. The work was fair and they pay good, i would work there again."
good,A typical day starts with being in the back unloding the truck then off to stock the shelves. I learned that you need to be fast able to do many things at once. The hardest part of the job is when u see many people that you might know steal right in front of you even employes.
good,it was a fun place to work. most co workers were like family.  some favoritism among management. hard to advance if you were not a favorite. Hard to transfer if it was needed.
good,I enjoyed working at walmart.  The computer generates the schedule and the schedules are crazy.  Needs to have schedules that make more sense for each employee.  Example working till 10. At night and then have to be back at 6 the next morning.  Or working every day of the week at 3-4 hours each day.
good,Overall Great management is different story some are workable others are very disrespectful and don't know how to give better direction or information. Don't follow the polices that are stated on Walmart polices
good,la empresa se preocupa por mantener al empleado motivado y de que el empleado se mantenga en contante adiestramiento cada ves que llega un producto nuevo.
good,"Inspect and repair tractor trailers, fuel trucks, drive the tractor trailers back and forth from the shop to the lot. I honestly loved this job. The management at that time was not the best, though. Training and job promotions were not given as they should have been. Prior experience, training and seniority were ignored and a lot of favoritism went on. They did offer great pay and benefits."
good,"nice place to work. great people to work with. some managers wanted too many things done at once, like if you were doing something in your own department, you were pulled to do something else in a different department you dont even work in. but over all it was a great place to work. customers were great also. and it helps that you had fun and energetic people to work with."
good,"Nice working place , great people in management, they expect  you to know your job.and let you do it . good brakes for employees. Management is concern about the warfare of their employees."
good,"Worked as a stocker and worked mostly by myself. Worked grave shift and didn't have many customers ask questions since it was usually always late. Overall, good place to work, and the discount could be a little higher."
good,"A typical day at work you never knew what to expect. The management was ok but everyone has bad days. The hardest part of the job was wen you were the only one in the department and had 10,000 things to do."
good,"It’s okay working at Walmart it’s just some people , also they don’t like working around your schedule if you have school or anything and i can’t work with that"
good,"No set schedule; hours can change depending on workload. Stressful job, but team orientated with the aim to provide excellent customer service. Plenty of opportunities to advance and coworkers are experienced and helpful. Strict attendance policy; late arrivals are considered half occurrences while absences are considered a full occurrence. Extremely customer orientated; avoid the front end if not a people person. Start off as a cashier with a choice of changing departments after four or six months of employment. Strict dress code policy. Breaks and lunches are mandatory; for a full eight or seven and a half hour shift, you receive two fifteen minute breaks and one hour long lunch. For a five and a half or four hour shift, you receive one fifteen minute break."
good,"Competitive and never run out of things to do. I learned how to inter act with different type of people everyday. Being a Department Manager, I have to be in sync with management goals but still have to be a good motivator to associates under my supervision. There were times when you feel overwhelmed by a long line of customers to deal with but as I learned from experience, always I only have one customer in front of me. To keep me occupied I enjoyed cleaning the machines around me and my work area fully equipped with supplies needed."
good,"Great place for some to work and advance. I am ready to talk to other retailers , and to work with new associates and leaders.I have been in retail for 37 years, i still believe in  the  customers needs, the store is for the community."
good,"Definitely fast paced, never slow down. You work on your own, with little to no help. Never get off when you're supposed to, and are always working over."
good,Walmart was a good place to work but it was very demanding of your time and you worked long hours.  But managing a Fortune 500 company requires dedication and being able to know what's going to sale at a particular time of the year.
good,i was a cap 2 associate and your being timed for the work you do from the time you clock in to the time you clock out. so if you have a problem working at a fast pace to get a unreasonable amount of work done this isn't for you.
good,Help with filling prescription and insurance related issues. Help the consumer about any questions related to store merchandise. Make sure they have good experience when thinking about me.
good,After working their for half a year almost all of the current cap 2 employees hours were cut in half or more. It was a great to work the coworkers are great and your managers actually care for you.
good,"Prior to a new scheduling system Walmart worked with people and their real life scheduling needs. Getting time off for appointments or any other of things was easy. Now you are required to work when the system needs you there, or you don't get hours."
good,"very demanding, fast pace. lack of commutation on manger part.. no paid time off. . always on the go... though I did enjoy working with others... always willing to teach but never pay according"
good,My day was fun with the customers and co workers. In my time of employment I learned many things to take with  me. Overall I enjoyed my time working there
good,"Walmart was a good place to be employed. I did not agree with everything that Walmart did, but they treated me very well. The pay raises were far and few in between. The best part of Walmart is that they hired the elderly, so if you are retired and wanted to earn a few extra dollars, Walmart would be the place."
good,"Fast paced work environment, customer are the number one priority.  Work life balance is tough especially for someone with young children.  High expectations and performance driven. In retail expect to work holidays and long hours. Good benefits provided across the board. Advancement can be done quickly if you do well and are willing to move."
good,"Wal-mart as a whole is a good place to work.  Some stores better than others, depending on the management crew. Somewhat willing to work with you on difficult situations, getting approved for leave of absence it dificult"
good,"Just dont apply for supervisor role unless your ready to have every yhing be your fault. Keep to your self, dont let others around you know whats going on in your personal life."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work. I am kind of upset about losing this job because of relocation problems that could of been resolved. Overall, Walmart is a fun to work at, and a great place to start a career."
good,"Co workers not enjoyable -lazy, learned a lot about retail food management. Work culture very diverse .Work load heavy,workers few, loved the customers"
good,"I worked in customer service for 3 years at walmart as my first job as a college freshmen! very fun job, sometimes stressful. Management could be a pain when ""home office"" is visiting. Overall decent place to work."
good,Working at the Wal Mart distribution center was a fair experience. working here allowed me to not only provide for my family but also allowed me to go to school and focus on my degree.
good,the thing about this place is that its shut down. they closed this walmart but it is a good place to work and it come with benefits. and they give you extras
good,"Productive entry-level employees have job security and low chances of disciplinary ""coaching"". "
good,Show up to work and immediately begin to unload truck. After finishing unloading the truck you get a 15 minute break. Then you return to work you will stock store until finished with an hour lunch at 6-7.
good,"I had several duties as a department manager in sporting goods, automotive, and toys. I did my job and did it pretty well.I also worked in other departments in addition to the regular ones I had to work in."
good,it was a great place to work got plenty of hours and they did there best to make you feel good but like any place there is a lot of drama great discounts and bonus
good,"Relatively easy job, I was moved around a lot from sales associate to maintenance or door greeter and I was the only person working the 11-8 shift at night where everyone else was 10-7"
good,"All in all as a employer walmart's not the worst. But the expectations"
good,"Management are not for the employees"
good,"Learning experience but not forever to stay. If you have classes , they can provide flexible hours. Paid sick time and vacation. Receives bonuses too."
good,"Started off as a people person, but by the time I left Walmart I felt like I never want to return to retail ever again! Between lazy co-workers and the consistent turnover rate this make for a stressful working atmosphere for the people that actually want to work. The assistant manager over my department was really nice, but management seems to be always changing and are not always on the same page. The pay and benefits were always decent and even if you are part-time there are shifts available to pick up as long as you don't go over 40 hours."
good,"It was a decent experience working there for the amount of time I did maintain a position there. The workload was a great deal, and the pay was not enough in regards to compensation."
good,"most of the time you are none stop"
good,I loved the people I worked with. Everyone I worked with helped each other and enjoyed it. Including Management  even though I moved to Florida from Indiana I still talk to my example co workers and my ex Manager. It’s been 6 years since I left and we all remain Friends. When I visit Indiana I make it a point to see them
good,very unprofessional. Highschool job good beginner job to gather customer service skills moved to alot of positions in company but barely open roles to move up in company.
good,"Walmart's not a bad place to work. It gets repetitive. I worked in the apparel department, probably the easiest department. Required a lot of folding. Management wasn't bad, I had no problems."
good,This company is a great company to work for. They invest into there people. I started with the company in 2002 as a temp and ended my career with the company in 2015 as Co Manager.
good,"Typical day at Walmart there  really never was a typical day."
good,I had fun during my time working at Walmart here in Evansville. The Team Members and Management were easy to get along with and the job was not difficult
good,I worked here for a short time. the workers were very kind and very helpful when I needed guidance. They were great with training and making sure I was prepared before putting me on my own.
good,I had a good experience working at Walmart. My managers were awesome. I liked working in the diary department and working with the customers. It was good overall.
good,"Walmart was a great place to work the associates were very cool and some of the managers were cool as well, but just the order in the store is all off and causes things and people to clash at times"
good,Management could be better. Good scheduling. Typical day at work includes start up meeting then tending to all of productions needs. Hardest part of the job would be watching my every move to make sure I don't offend no one.
good,"Hire just about anyone they can, and in my experience they don't really that low man on the totem pole too well. "
good,"Ceey fast pace, hard working. Its a job that will challenge you.  but doesnt allow you to make you own schedule to accommodate you everyday needs. Management is very goodand understanding in some aspects."
good,Walmart is a great place to work. It is a great first job or if you need a job. If you are a go getter then there is great opportunity for advancement.
good,"I would consider most days at Walmart in Vicksburg, MS to be very productive. Some days are stressful depending on what's going on. A day with management can be very up and down. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with thieves, and the most enjoyable part would be meeting new people and interacting with customers."
good,"Work days go by fast on busy days (most days are busy). Breaks are nice throughout shifts, you get 3 for a full shift (9 hours including 1hr lunch).  Nice job for college students!"
good,it was hard work for a little bit of money. i would not go back unless i could get paid way more. it was not worth the money in my opinion they over worked me
good,i started out as a cashier and liked it well enough. then i changed over to working in the lube bay which is where i liked it more but the work was harder and i was unable to do it . so i tried to transfer back inside to cashier and they refused to let me do so so i quit. they had at the time a mgr who didn't like me and that was why i couldn't get back inside. so it's an ok company to work for.
good,Some of the staff was alright to work with. There was alot happening at the one i was at seemed like i was in a soap episode. Alot of the staff and management had alot of drama going on.
good,"They are very understanding."
good,"My parents tell me that I am underpaid, etc., but I am paid fairly for the work I do, and I am part of a great team at Walmart Store #2145. I have learned so much about teamwork, timeliness, interpersonal interaction, and even valuing a dollar; I will take these lessons with me to whatever full-time job I get."
good,Rangement des articles services à la clientèle et responsable des caisses
good,"Wide range of customer types that walk in every day. Most arent as friendly as you would like. A lot of times, it didnt matter how friendly you were, if they were in a bad mood, they took t out on you. Job keeps you busy because of how many people come through there, but sometimes management isnt as attentive to their employees needs as much as they should be, esp when health issues are the main problem. Pay is decent, but with it being a multi-billion dollar franchise, you would think they would pay its hard workers more."
good,"Walmart was my first official ""Job"". My starting rate was $10.40 just to stand at the door and say ""Hi"" to people. I eventually switched to being a cashier. The management at my store were not the nicest people. I loved working with my coworkers, they were all super friendly and just like family."
good,Come into work clock in and go find out which register i'm at that day. We learn all kinds of things up there from all the different people running in and out that place you will learn more than you imagine. The manager is who i see to get my place on a register they pretty cool for the most part. The workplace is pretty cool everybody try to stay happy for the most part. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers and they attitude but we have to know the customers are always right. The most enjoyable part is when we all can get together and enjoy the job site.
good,had several roles in our small town Walmart. had a lot of fun working there and loved all of my coworkers. I wouldn't mind going back to Walmart for a supervisor position now that I am experienced
good,"In the time I worked for Walmart, I had 6 different front end managers.  Each time we were assigned a new manager, we were given new working rules, none were in writing and generally were passed along from one cashier to another rather than from the new manager.  No announcements were provided informing staff of management changes which caused confusion regarding who you were now to report to."
good,Walmart was a great start to my working start. It helped me a lot and I thank Walmart for giving me a chance to work with them. I am truly greateful for all the taught me .
good,my review of this job is that a typical days work was very productive and always had something to do. Learned to work solo/ and well with others in a grocery environment. Management was ok to work for and the workplace culture was very diverse.
good,Most of the employees there are very friendly and it is an easy place to work for as long as you can follow the rules and use common sense. The procedures are easy to learn.
good,"Hearing a customer appreciate my hard work, theirs nothing like busting but and helping solve a problem for a customer they appreciate and really like how much I care"
good,"nine times out of ten, management wants the job done no matter what. They want it done in a timely fashion done the Walmart way. If you have a hard time then you must ask for help rather than just doing anything"
good,As a manager I was expected to make sure everything at the store was being taken care of. My employees were to be assigned tasks on a daily basis and I was to follow up with them to ensure completion of these tasks. All patient issues were forwarded to me and I was expected to handle them in a timely manner that also satisfied company policy.
good,When I worked at walmart in the ICS department I knew nothing about it. I was trained properly and loved it. The managers at the time I worked there were very friendly and answered all the questions that needed to be asked.
good,help people find the things that they were looking for and then walk them up to the register. make sire that we ordered the items that we were low on.
good,Buenas prestaciones pero requiere mucho tiempo que no se paga posteriormente
good,It was an ok job however they would rarely allow you to receive 40 hours a week and if you did by some turn of events acquire more than 40 hours in one week and you are scheduled to get more than 80 hours in 2 weeks they will have you burn your time so not to acquire any overtime.
good,Great company as far as compensation and pay. Some management needs a lot of help with personality and dealing with associates under them. A lot of dishonest people in management in my experience
good,the pay is minimum wage but the position of IMS is an easy position if you have co workers who will work than you will have a lot of down time. But overall the job is great experience for someone with no experience
good,"You cant really base your decisions to work at walmart based on reviews. every store is different, management is different, and the operation of each store is different. you would have to take to employees at the store you wish to work at to get an idea of what to expect. Pay is good. a typical day depends on customers, time of day and time of year."
good,"Working at walmart was fun and made me learn new skills, but it isnt a good job if you are at school and you are not that availible. It is very demanding"
good,"Walmart is a constant sea of changes and that is for the better.  However, with this change, lots of jobs are affected in that they are eliminated or redifined.  Once you have figured out what you need to be doing to excel in your job, it goes and changes once again."
good,The environment was friendly and the company was nice. They were understanding with so many situations. Unfortunately the timing of me working there wasn't the best and had to leave due to personal reasons.
good,The store manager of Walmart #1477 was very very nice and still is he would work with anyone that he could. He is the type of manager that you always hope to work for.
good,"For all the bad things I heard it actually wasn't too bad to work there. Management seems to change monthly, but that's to be expected. High turnover rate."
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work for best job that I like so far in my work career. I just wish there was more career opportunities and they paid more. I work my butt off and make only 12.60 an hour. I have a family to take care of and can barely make ends meet. But at the same time I love working there and don't really want to there. Just wish the pay was better.
good,"The management sucks. Other than that its fine.The benefits are great, but you dont get that until you've been there for three months. You have to be there for 6 six months before you get the good stuff."
good,"there were 2-5 that were exceptions but the rest played around too much taking longer than 15 minute breaks and taking forever to start on their work when they got there, two of them screeched and cursed while customers were around, most of them stopped to talk while working and management didnt do a thing about any of this."
good,"Hours were great, co-workers were awesome, management under experienced and lackadaisical. They hired managers just to get bodies in those positions.."
good,This job was ok. The management was mostly really good but the hours were low. I tried many times to advance but never got offered the advancement even though they would tell me that I would be great in a higher position.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work to get a little extra cash. Now that they have changed to customer first scheduling however, it is hard to live off of the salary. They have cut hours and only schedule people four and a half hours a day. Since I live far away, it doesn't make since for me to drive so far for a short shift and such few hours. I've been working at this store for almost 3 years, and the saving grace has been my coworkers. They are the reason I keep going. But now that my hours have been cut, I got a notice that my health insurance is going to be cut at the beginning of the year. Walmart as a company likes to surprise people, and they try to work against you to get the most money out of you. If you work here, just keep your eyes open, and take care of yourself, because no one else will. That's our motto among all the sales associates, ""take care of yourself, because no one else here will."""
good,"Acogedor, aprendi a tratar a la gente, los directivos eran organizados, lo mas difícil era lidiar con los cajeros ya que no eran considerados, me gusto muchísimo las propinas y la paga diaria"
good,Most fun but also can be stressful dealing with customers.  Coworkers are very friendly.  It is a place for young people to learn customer service....
good,"A typical day at work meant running around helping customers, stocking shelves, cooking food, and cleaning absolutely everything."
good,Work here from July 2002 – January 2003
good,"A lot of work with a feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day. I learned to be. A forward-thinking and results-driven construction manager, with a demonstrated track record of achievement in retail store construction, remodels and expansions, relocations, production planning and scheduling, safety and OSHA compliance, storm water, contractor selection and management, budget administration, and project management.  A proven aptitude for safely operating heavy construction and transportation equipment.  Utilizes strong communication skills to coordinate with vendors, contractors, engineers, and architects.  Ensures peak team performance through enhanced preparation and detailed review of procedures.  Anticipates challenges and adapts to diverse situations to consistently complete projects on time and on budget."
good,"This is a great job for college kids. Fun because I love the customers, but its hard because you have to stand in one place your whole shift.  Management is great.  All the different types of people that you will work with is awesome.  I really enjoy my customers."
good,"The benefits are great, once you qualify for them, just seems near impossible to qualify.  Occasional cliques happen though, which makes things difficult.  There can arise an issue of being too good at your job, which makes promoting out of your current position difficult. Biggest drawbacks I've found is the overly harsh disciplinary system, and some times a lack of appreciation shown towards the employees.  As for the positives, I've actually met some very interesting and engaging people, both fellow associates, and customers.  You feel pride when you finish your tasks, especially when your hard work is acknowledged.  It's fairly easy work, just sometimes a bit repetitive."
good,"A typical day was clocking in, finding your assigned area, and socking shelves. Breaks were fair, employees were very nice. Management seemed to be on the same page."
good,I worked the front end as a cashier. The day would start out slow but then would pick up and become very busy especially on the 1st and 3rd of each month. There was always something to do. You meet interesting people and some not so interesting.
good,"Walmart will hire almost anyone, they have lots of jobs and hours, at $10 which is about par for a retail stocker position these days, and still competitive for someone whose other option is a fast food position at $8.50 or even less. Typical day at work is typical for a retail position. Learned customer service, cashiering, stocking, inventory management and loss prevention, was trained for fire safety. Hardest part of the job is inconsistency in hours, shift and job expectations, the most enjoyable part of the job is learning lots of new things and meeting all kinds of people every day, there's always something new and different in such a large retailer like Walmart."
good,My assessment of Walmart is it could be greatly improved with a better work/life balance and advancement opportunities. Associate support is very lacking.
good,"Walmart comes with all the expected duties and drawbacks of retail sales. The management team was somewhat willing to work with scheduling needs. Advancement is possible, but it can take quite a bit of time."
good,"Is a good job, the personal is very active and the security is good. My managers were very flexible with me in the labor time. The job team was very nice."
good,Depending on which store you go to you will have good and bad workers. my particular store is alright. theres drama but you do your best to stay out of it.
good,"i had an excellent time working for Walmart. i left because i was not getting the income that i wanted at that time i worked two jobs at once, so i needed more hours and chuck e. cheese gave me more."
good,"some times things don't flow our way how ever that story is fair to often to to many people here. promise a job or promotion than the next day someone else has it. that story happens more than its fair share. As fair as the people in the blue vest fantastic to work with."
good,"I liked my role at Walmart, but I want to advance my career and provide a better living for my family. To advance and better myself I have to seek employment with another company."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves and attending customers, with an hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks. I learned how to use different technology to assist in the job."
good,started off as janitor and cleaning bathrooms and isles stayed for a couple months until a position I really wanted then as soon as it came open to apply the management laid me off
good,"asset protection was interesting having to check for potential theft and checking recipets , management was very understanding and easy to deal with. most enjoyable interacting with customers"
good,Walmart was not to bad of a place to work. It was just 3rd shift was not my cup of tea. Management was nice and friendly. The job was easy but the hours weren't for me.
good,I liked my boss. I worked hard and the boss said I did a good job. I tried my best to do a good job and my boss said I was doing great. They liked me a lot at Walmart.
good,Fair working conditions with better than most retail hours. Work day hours were 8 hours on a normal basis . The culture was of customer service and fair prices. There was always change in the direction of the company .Insurance and benefits were fair .
good,"I loved working at Wal-Mart, worked with a very big variety of people and ages. I didn't plan on leaving this company any time soon, but had a pickup in my life and got let go. A huge variety of hours are available. I was a customer service supervisor and I made major decisions on the front end cashiers and customer service"
good,the good thing about working at Walmart was u get to help people find things and go help in different departments and other co-works was great with helping
good,Walmart is an okay place to work.  Some days are good and you enjoy your day but then other days you are doing not only your job but other peoples too while those people are just goofing off.
good,Enjoyable place to work. Long days. Pay could be better. Typical day at work consists of receiving and processing prescriptions from physicians and waiting on customers.
good,"I had a great 3 years with Walmart. My co-workerd turned into great friends and my direct manager over electronics was extremely understanding and would work with my schedule. I was able to work on my school work, and they understood my priorities. However, when it came to management in general, it was lackluster and poorly ran. I ended up having to work on several things outside of my job description and was hardly ever thanked for my efforts."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work but you have to be able to put up with rude customers on almost a daily basis. Depending on your shift and what department your in, you may have a busy job description ."
good,It's alright. Nothing to much to complain about. Of course every work place has there pros and cons. Hours are fair. If you're a good worker they might ask you to stay over to get the work done
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar com equipe organizada, mas o horário não era agradável"
good,"A empresa se preocupa bastante com o cliente mas nao muito com o funcionário. As regras da empresa Walmart são bem exigidas, isso é um ponto forte, porem as vezes afeta a qualidade do trabalho do proprio funcionário e o resultado final de atendimento direto ao cliente. A parte boa da empresa que ela da oportunidade para quem nao teve experiência na devida função, isso é bom para a empresa e tambem para o associado."
good,"The hardest part of the job was seeing and dealing with disgruntled customers because they are in a rush and wanna get in and out of the store as quickly as possible but a lot of times it did not work out that way. You try to work and move fast but sometimes a customer takes longer than another."
good,short staffed and expects one person to do the job of 10 in a short period of time. its a great job for someone who doesn't have children at home to take care of.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart and the promotion opportunities it offered.  I left and aferward regretted that I did.  The salary was low, but I also realize that I was in one of the lower-paying jobs.  Just wish that such jobs came with a higher salary."
good,"You would never think it, but Walmart was one of the best places to work in Tulare. The people were good, the pay was decent, everything was fine if ya didnt mind the foot pain."
good,"The company is changing rapidly within IT, new technologies that are required that change within months, so many technologies that its impossible to keep up. Walmart is huge and and any mistake can cost millions if not billions of dollars."
good,"Working here is nice and isn't too difficult but you will see people that are just not having a good day and give attitude. Also, when it come to getting days off you must know your life schedule three weeks in advance which may be hard to do if you go to school or have a lot going on in your life."
good,"it was ok, didn't get along with my coworkers, was frequently denied my paid time off, and had a change in management resulting in me losing a lot of hours"
good,My role was to ensure that  my stores were staffed (Hrly & Mgmt) appropriately to ensure that we met our customers needs in a clean/ safe environment.
good,"Being that I was a cashier at this establishment, a typical day would require getting the customers to your line, ringing them up and getting them out in a quick orderly fashion. I di learn how to work quickly but still be aware. The hardest part about working there was never the customers but the people above you."
good,"didn't have much time for anything but running register, you did get breaks on time for most part, schedule  was never the same.I would have liked to have been permante like I was at the Trumann store I really liked working at that store alot better"
good,Love to work for walmart.gives me alot of hours an have alot of fun working with my customers an coworkers make it fun!!:)i would work for walmart anytime an anyplace...
good,"The job was fine, it wasn't hard it was easy money. But stressful when it came down to schedules. Sometimes the manager's wouldn't listen if you had to miss a day they would count everything against you."
good,"There is so much variety in a typical day at Wal-Mart.  It is necessary to learn the whole store and continoulsy update yourself about the layout of merchandise.  There is always work to be done in and around the store and being departmental, there are always extra helping hands if one department falls behind."
good,overall good management and leadership showing me how to do important tasks and overall fair scheduling. fun people to work with and I've learned a lot about technology from TV's to phones to video games.the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers but that doesn't happen to often. the best part of the job is socializing with nice and fun people while still getting our work done.
good,"Not all associates are friendly or as friendly as they could be. "
good,i have worked at wallmart and enjoyed training as a motivational and enthusiastic learning. also actively participated in team work and enhanced skills in work.
good,"I was there for ten years, in several positions. I wasn't looking for a career and was satisfied to be a worker. One bad thing is that everyone wants to be your boss. That only got oppressive when I was a door greeter, and there aren't enough hours in a day to do all that. I like people and keeping busy, so generally it was a good fit for me. I'd be happy to go back and work there now."
good,Typical employment for anyone. Routine tasks and entry level activities. Holidays test your stress levels and you learn much about the neighborhood. Advancement is consistent with effort put into position. Many opportunities for different positions with time.
good,"Great place to work, easy understanding of training practices. Job section placement was coordinated with the individual's skills. Moving around to different departments. Learning new skills."
good,Busy but not overly rushed. Can be difficult around holidays. Work load was normally not overly heavy. Sometimes it seemed unfair when you would be asked to help an extremely slow associate knowing they were going slowly on purpose.
good,"A typical day working at Wal-mart is constant customer service, From the time you clock in to the time you clock out your services and job duties are counted on."
good,Its fun working at Walmart you will sometime run across a upset customer but its up to you to fix the problem and know how to deal with that customer. I think customers are always right
good,"É uma empresa boa de trabalhar,todo tempo que passei no hiper,me serviu muito de aprendisado."
good,"Working at Walmart is a blessing and a curse. It pays well and your associates are nice, for the most part. the main gripes i have are the customers and the scheduling. However, it is still a fine place to work and is great for building workplace skills to apply onto other jobs or everyday life."
good,"A typical day as a cashier - The Job description: The key duties undertaken by Walmart cashiers upon hire concern various aspects of customer service. Primary roles include scanning coupons, applying discounts, processing payments, and ringing up sales on computerized cash registers. Cashiers also take responsibility for handling returns and answering questions about merchandise, store policies, and ongoing promotions. The job features part-time hours at start, with options for full-time schedules or promotion into managerial careers with experience. Work environments include checkout aisles at store front ends. Cashiers sometimes assist sales and stock associates with remedial tasks during slow hours."
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart, I learned alot. And had many different jobs over the years. Started as a cashier, went to the returns and customer service desk, moved to jewelry,  then menz department and last weekend clothes processor."
good,"i worked at wal mart more than once and had the chance to learn and do different jobs both time i worked at wal mart so my typical day and my opinion of my job differed based on the job i was doing at the time. i personally proffered working as a stocker/truck on loader. i liked the fast pace, being able to work at my own paste and the quality of my job being based on my own work ethics but also based on team work."
good,If one is conscientious of their responsibilities and is reliably on time and works well with others they could find plenty of opportunity to advance into management positions after working there for a good long period of time. If one is willing to put that much effort into it. Otherwise its a good job for added income.
good,es una empresa con varios requisitos para tener mayor venta en productos comerciales
good,I worked 3rd shift so the store was pretty empty sometimes.  I enjoyed my job at Walmart but management had negative attitudes at times.  I just did my work and stayed to myself unless I was helping another coworker with something.
good,"Working at Walmart can be fun and enjoyable. You not only get to interact with your fellow associates you also interact with your community. It can be fast pace at times, but you also have your slow pace as well. Adaptability is the way to be with the company, things changes new technology to help you work better is introduced. Overall it is what you put into the position you are in as to what you will get in return. Hard work does payoff."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. They treat you good and give good support to their employees and customers. There is lots of places to advance in the company, all you have to do is try."
good,It is fun working for Walmart but  I want extra money. We have good benefits and a great team. The best is the store manager. He is pending of the employees and make us feel good. He has an open mind.
good,"great benefits "
good,"Head in to work around 4 a.m. did a group meeting with store manager before shift along with stretching then went and picked items to stock and put them on the shelves."
good,good place to work management can be a hassle depending on where you work but overall if you give it your best you can really embrace the vision Walmart gives you
good,"As a maintenance associate my day-to-day duties include keeping the restrooms clean and stocked, keeping the floors clean, emptying the trash, and cleaning up any spills that happen in the store. I work as a part of a team with one or two others, and we split up duties with one person cleaning the restrooms, one person mopping, etc. How stressful the job is usually depends on the time of week and year. Weekends are busier than weekdays as most people like to do their grocery shopping then, so we get more spills. This gets worse during Holiday season, as the busier the store is, the harder it is to keep clean. On the busiest days, we kept getting called across the store to clean up dirt and such before we have a chance to respond a call made five minutes prior. While this is very stressful, as long as we're seen doing our best, it's not held against us."
good,Walmart was a really good company to work for at the start. After about 7 years management started to go down hill. They stoped caring about the individual. you used to be able to walk into a Walmart and see a lot of ten year tags. Now they find reasons to get rid of you before you hit the ten years l.
good,"La empresa es muy buena solo algunas personas que las administran pero en general su cultura y manera de ejecutar  son exelentes , en lo personal aprendi mucho como lider y como ser humano"
good,Really cool co workers. The management (for cashiers) stood around on their phones a lot when we weren't even allowed to be. All in all not a terrible place to work. Just a little boring
good,Great place to work. No advancement opportunities. Would definitely refer the store to other applicants. Just would also state the fact the opportunity for growth is not there.
good,"management is great, very fast paced work, hard at times depends on the load of work you have but a typical day is fast paced and fun, managaement easy to get along with"
good,Required to work 4 12 hour shifts but then you had 4 days off.  Enjoyed the associates but upper management was difficult at times.  Overall not a bad place to twork
good,Se realizan juntas comunicativas diaria lo cuales son muy efectivas para reforzar el buen ambiente laboral
good,"Processing sales in timely manner, accurately and efficiently, cash register operations and safeguarding company. Maintain orderly appearance of register area and supplies stocked. Sales, customer service. Planning on merchandise retail. Department organization. Merchandise distribution. Liaison between customers and managers. Department organization. Answering and transferring phone calls to correct department. Department manager. Merchandise Supervisor. Train new employees. Merchandise distribution. Any other tasks as assigned."
good,This company at one time or another was great to work for they offered good hourly pay good benefits full time vacation. but then they became nation wide they become corporate and they got stuck up. so no more pay raise after 90 days no more good hourly pay you get a minimum wage no full time unless your management . no more benefits or vacation. the stores are always short handed because like all corporate companies they prefer to work on a minimum staffing to cut cost for big corporate boss bonuses. Just don't do it
good,"I absolutely adore my manager and I am so sorry I have to leave because I will miss her. It is just the fact that the job can become repetitive after a while. But overall, it is an amazing place to work."
good,"Depending on what area you are working in, the job is fast paced and can get stressful. You learn how to work as a team and how to multitask with working. The hardest part is being on your feet and moving around all day, but it is very rewarding."
good,"Walmart employees are great to work just sometimes upper management doesn't have great communication skills, it's a fast paced environment , lunches are an hour long paid time off that was great !"
good,Trabalhar nessa empresa foi um divisor de aguas sobre coisas que eu imaginava e coisas que realmente vivi uma ótima experiência...
good,"Walmart can be your best friend or worst enemy. If you can go with the flow of the workday and provide quality customer service then you'll do just fine. Co-workers were friendly and management was surprisingly friendly and overall on par as long as you were working diligently. Overall a really good experience whether this is your first job, or your just looking to find something part time to earn some extra money."
good,"nice place to work but standing long time is hard. Management is helping , friendly environment ,  learned a lot how to work in a fast pace environment."
good,"Typical day is walking and touring with my associates where I teach and train new processes while evaluating daily performance."
good,"I learned that one has to be punctual, on-time (or even early) with everything in life. And that in order to have any kind of job advancement/security, one has to learn what people/management to please/get on the good side of."
good,"Not a high paying job but also very easy to maintain. Never get more than 35 hours a week, and full-time is very rare for cashiers or ""fron end people""."
good,Its Wal-Mart the ladies that have been there forever all work in the morning and look down on you. they take advantage breaks and take forever. but they do work with your school schedule
good,Walmart is kind of fast past and slow pace depending on where and what department you are working in . But it just best to do your job and get out of there where it’s done
good,Working here is always fast paced with something to do or fix right around the corner. stay busy and working or find your way out the door. Learn team coordination.
good,el ambiente eesta muy como de trabajo se ve un compañerismo y actividad de la genet que te rodea agradable
good,"it was alright, unloaded a truck typically everyday and then stocked what came off the trucks onto the floor, helped customers, ran a register if needed, went to the parking lot to grab buggies."
good,"From my person experience, the work environment was great, employees get along well together, working was fast and we'll paced, work directions were clarified and simple, overall a very well work experience"
good,employees brought their personal problems to work and lots of call offs with no help.  Management did not run registers if too.  could not complete .daily tasks when only person doing sales and register and would get rerpermqnded
good,Walmarts environment is great my coworkers are all awesome I just feel I am not receiving enough hours since I transferred departments. I enjoy my job just need something with more hours.
good,Good friendly environment everyday between management and associates.  Durring my time working for Walmart I learned to be better with customer service.
good,It was a pleasant company to work for but the pay and benefits were terrible.  I did not make enough to pay my bills.  Management was great and had wonderful personalities.
good,"My typical day at work was getting change for cashiers, making judgement calls, in charge of the money services, customer service and cart pushers. I learned being at walmart great people skills and keep you head on a swivel. The management was okay could be better. The hardest part of the job was getting overwhelmed by cashiers, customers and etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was the repeated customers who knew you for what I did and helped them with anything I could provide them."
good,"I loved my experience working here, very neat , clean and organized working environment . Nice and respectable co-workers and managers.  I enjoyed my days of working there"
good,Overall Walmart is a good place to work for although some management need to work on their people skills Walmart has great customer service Walmart also has a great team associates know how to work together walmart has great products to offer their customers all Walmart customers are friendly. Walmart is good with teaching all associates the new policies and procedures as they come out.
good,"Ive been working at Walmart for a little over 3 months now and i must say its a lot better than most people portray it out to be, i started at part time but moved to full time within just 2 or so months so you can definitely work your way up if your a good worker. I just feel pay is a little low."
good,"The job is good, the training is sufficient, but the managers seem like slightly more senior employees and have little to no experience or capability in managing people."
good,"the place was a fast work environment and also you have to know how to deal with customers on a day in and out basis, the pay was okay fulltime positions are available."
good,It has ups and downs but overall it is a good beginning job the pay is average dealing with most customers is easy but sometimes it can be annoying. Management can be either good or bad
good,I loved working for Wal-mart. The employees were great. They were very friendly. I got along with most of them. It was a very fast-paced job. had to be quick at getting stock out and ringing up customers.
good,Good I was happy working there I loved helping customers and I like working with my Co workers and my Manager was very cool . He was very helpful thank you Walmart.
good,"It was a productive workplace and very fast paced.Safe, friendly, respectable environment. Gave good service to customers. Management was very nice.Always clean"
good,"It was good experience working in a pharmacy while in school. I did maintain health insurance as a partime employee and it was expensive, but necessary."
good,Good place to work.  Good hours. No experience  required they train you. Family oriented. Good boss people. Many ways to move up on the job changes. Good work experience.
good,"acomodo de mercancía y atención a clientes, muy buena relación entre los compañeros"
good,Es una gran empresa donde existe un muy buen ambiente de trabajo.
good,Working with a temp service was very interested due to the fact that you could get a job quickly with them but the pay wasn't as much if one would have gone through Wal-Mart itself.A fun experience overall.
good,"Working at Walmart is good for someone who is joining the workforce for the first time, I love working at the money center because I get to know my customers and they know me. It is like a have a family. I try my best to meet every customer`s need to the best of my ability with a pleasant smile on my face despite what i may be going through. I believe in giving the type of service i would love to be given."
good,Love the opportunity to gain more exsperience to work in the dep. artment. Just wish there was more of a hour promise. the training doesnt  help.  there is none.  You get more training as cashier. there is usually  not much to product to complete the department or they ran out.
good,Wal-Mart is a fast paced that want's an open availability at all times. Wal-Mart is a competitive company and it does pay for your experience and starts out above minimum wage.
good,"It was a good job, I enjoyed going to work most days however their attendance system has flaws that could cost even the best associate their job. The policy does not except doctors excuses and, unless a member of management is will to override it, you will get pointed a whole point if you leave work to even go to the er or are two hrs late, and a half of a point if you are more than 10 minutes late. 9 points and you lose your job."
good,"I was a cart attender"
good,very diverse with ok management. the pay is very low and they are demanding pushing their products. You can get overtime if you like just ask. Pay is every two weeks
good,It was a slow-paced job pretty easy to handle. If you like jobs where you stand around and get paid pretty well for little work then you found your home.
good,As a manager you are ion charge in the most faced paced environment in retail. Walmart is a fast changing company that is used to adjusting to the economic needs of its target audience.
good,Hard to get promoted. They value tenured reps versus qualifications. So its hard for growth. The job is relaxing not to stress full. Management team is good.
good,"It was a really fun place to work for and I was informed that promotions are something they love to do within the company especially if you work for it."
good,"pay was good, benefits were good, but micromanaging managers do their best to drive off good workers and destroy the company. too many stories of this happening all over."
good,i worked at walmart while i was pregnant doing stocking on 3rd shift. the work wasn't horrible and my coworkers were pretty cool for the most part. i simply couldn't continue working due to issues with my pregnancy but i have considered going back
good,Being a new team member is difficult. Most of the people were rude and not helpful. And you get points against you if you are sick and miss work. not fair
good,"I really loved my job at Walmart. Me and my family relocated to Fort Myers, Florida that's the reason I left Walmart. Walmart was a fun place to work when I worked there."
good,Every store is different and I have worked at three different locations in two different states. The environment was different but the job requirements were all the same. Some locations have managers that are more laid back others have management that are strict. All in all this job was stressful and very busy but it was all worth it. you meet great customers and employees. If you work hard and really want you can move up so fast in this company.
good,over all I feel working in Walmart is not hard it is a bit in organized but after leaving there was a change of managers and a change of store manager as well so I cant say what its like to work there anymore.
good,"The management at Walmart was really good. The managers told us every day what was expected of us. They gave us specific jobs to do at the beginning of each shift."
good,Seems a little unorganized and you never get an opportunity to get your raise as they promise after completion of your training courses. Could be a little more friendly.
good,"For stocking, it's always a 9-hour shift with 1 hour for lunches. 10pm-7am. It's honestly a lot of fun, I work with really amazing people, and I've learned about backrooms and how to organize, how to take care of freight, and customers. Managment is mostly super amazing unless they're under a lot of stress, they have a tendency to take it out on the associates. The managers will also leave you alone once they discover you know how to do your job."
good,"A typical day at work would be working as a cashier."
good,"Here i was usually always busy. There was never time when i didn't have something to do, also the coworkers were friendly an i was able to learn quickly what and how to get things done."
good,"It was a fun position , enjoyed working with and helping the customers with orders and with questions they might have. Learned how to handle unruly and or upset customers by offering a customer satisfaction discount. in general I thoroughly enjoyed it"
good,The only problem is that they prevent you from working in other places that they consider competition.
good,"At times the work can be stressful with deadlines to meet but the people make it worth it. Can be relaxed at times when all work is completed. Your work changes day to day just depending on parts coming in, ordering and paying bills."
good,Working as a team to exceed the expectation for customers. Store had motivational incentives to keep morale high. Learned to treat every customer with respect and a smile regardless of the situation.
good,On the night shift at Walmart we would start buy pulling pallets from the freezer to break down. We would break down the pallets to separate them according to their aisle. Then we would start to stock items. I've had great co-workers and the work environment was good. The hardest part of the job is keeping my energy up through the night because your constantly moving and picking up things which exerts a lot of energy.
good,It was quick pace and the expect you to do everything if you're a fast Stocker and the also expect you to do other people jobs as well. I enjoyed the friends I made but I regret working there.
good,Good steady work environment. Little advancement opportunities. day work week 10hour shifts. Long days but the plus is working Monday -Thursday. Then off Friday - Sunday
good,"Fun, very easy work. The hardest part may be trying to find where things go. People are very friendly and nice usually overnight don't really see people though."
good,"uma empresa adequada, gostaria q eu fosse a principal avaliada aqui e não a empresa. uma dica ninguém gosta de avaliar uma empresa que não trabalha mas é ante ético"
good,"Responsible for processing forms, orders, applications, and requests made by customers; keep record of inquiries, questions, comments, suggestions, and complaints from customers; take record of interactions and transactions with customers."
good,Good place to work to gain experience. Must be able to interact well with counterparts and associates to be successful. Work can be challenging but the payoff can be rewarding.
good,"Typical day is customer service, stocking sakes floor and/or backroom area, helping out in other areas than I am desiginated, running cash resigter. The people overall are enjoyable. I have learned to stock, put overstock in desginsted areas, run a cash resigter, help unload trucks by product to designated departments. customer service (helping customers find what they need). Management is overall helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job is finding balance between stocking and helping customers."
good,Productive workplace that gives the possibility of providing excellent customer service. Few opportunities to have a  full-time job. The salary compensation do not agree with the work done.
good,"I had a really good experience working for Walmart. I was going to college at the same time, and my managers were very supportive of that. My hours never conflicted with my schooling and I also usually had enough time to study and do homework. Now it has changed quite a bit. All of my mangers have left, and new ones have taken their place. I have asked a few of my friends that are still working there how it all is going and apparently its has gotten a lot worse in terms of management The job itself was a simple one and the pay was pretty reasonable; holidays were insane, but that is the norm for retail jobs. All in all it is a decent paying job that helped me get through college debt free, so not that bad id say."
good,"learned a lot about the register and how fast the pace was, it was just a job, management was helpful, employees were helpful, the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the customers"
good,"Its an okay place. they paid good and was always busy. got paid what I deserved as I worked, good customers and great place to work. its a friendly environment and they work with you good"
good,"I only worked for the summer season, so I did not have a permanent job, benefits, or even that many hours. What I did get to do for Walmart was enjoyable, interacting with customers was a highlight of my day, and I was able to select my hours to work. If I had been offered a full-time position after my seasonal job had ended, I would have happily accepted."
good,I enjoyed my job when I had the correct support and encouragement. There is a lot to do and a lot expected of you as long as you pay attention during orientation and training ypuu will have the tools to do you job.
good,Good place for part time work. Fast paced and required lifting. Hours not consistent. too amny days in a row with not enough time off on weekend for family.
good,Princípios adquiridos com dedicações estabelecidas pela união de uma equipe na formação para com o melhor atendimento e responsabilidade para o principal núcleo quer são nossos clientes .
good,Its great with the co works I. Had but kinda iffy about management at the store. They are a lot stricter than I honestly expected. Other than that not bad for it being Wal-Mart.
good,"I have worked at Walmart for a little over 12 years and the work is not easy. Retail work is hard work, and it doesn't matter what department you work in, whether you are a floor associate or in management, it is a very busy job. The most enjoyable part is the customers and the people you work with. The hardest part is the hours, as you do not work a straight day shift unless you are a dept. manager, and you are scheduled the weekends and holidays."
good,"N/A nothing much to say. just need to improve in management, it a job not a career, look for something that well make to happy and not stressed out..."
good,it a great place as long as your willing to work hard i did overnight which worked for me... for the amount of work you do i feel the pay should be better
good,depending on what walmart you are management isa lways different. i feel at my own store management is very sketchy and doesnt care so much about their fellow associates as they do themselves.
good,"Of jobs that I have had in the past, working at Wal-Mart I would have to say was my best.  I worked in the Ebensburg, Pa. store and practically everyone is friendly.  If you make a mistake its fine you just get showed the correct way to do it.  I have worked at this location twice and I left both times due to the stress."
good,"It's a good place to work for, offering a lot of variety and decent benefits. You work in various departments and perform an assortment of duties such as (but not limited to) stocking and maintaining merchandise, display of merchandise, customer service, cashiering."
good,"Aside the fact that management has their days just like any other employee, i love serving my customers and it is a fun place to work most of the time."
good,"Walmart can be a great place to work if you get the right management. In my case I had great manager for the first year and a half with the company. She was nice, understanding, and knew what she was doing and what everybody else should be doing. But the last six months with the company I went through a couple of managers who did their job poorly and made me and my associates who worked under me miserable every day due to thier disrespectful and careless nature. All in all this could happen at any job with any manager. I suppose I just expected more from Walmart management considering they expected so much from me."
good,"Walmart was a productive work place, worked well with coworkers. Work place culture was balanced and management was fair. I learned how to be a team player and provided assistance to my coworkers."
good,Disfruto de mi trabajo y me gusta hacerlo de la mejor forma para mostrar buenos resultados.
good,"Fast paced environment.  Good amount of hours per week,  Good amount of breaks.  10 percent off discount on general merchandize after ninety days.  Good people to work with."
good,Has great insurance pay is ok fast paced and highly stressful management is good for the most part open door policy must be friendly and fast to workon here
good,Many advancement opportunities. Fast paced though. You have to be able to handle rude or even buligerant customers. Not many hours a week but decent pay for retail.
good,I enjoyed the job that I had.  I only left because technology plus a new cash office machine was brought in to do most of my work. I was offered a severance package and decided it was in my best interest to take it.
good,Work was fun always something to do and more to learn. Serious management problems. Extreme lax of comunication between management and workers. Working the floorvhelping customers is the best part.
good,I would be on the register assisting customers with anything. I would answer any questions they had about our merchandise and I would also help take their groceries from the store to their car. I also pushed carts.
good,You meet a lot of new people everyday. you learn more about the company than you do about your own job throughout the time there. management did his best to keep the employee happy along with the customers.
good,"Checking in FEDEX, UPS and other vendors"
good,I liked working for Walmart as an HR manager. The pay is less than the industry average but there is a lot of support from vendors and market HR that makes the job less intensive than with other companies. One main issue with a position in the store is that there is little room to grow unless you want to switch from Human Resources to sales management. There are endless job opportunities with Walmart Corporation in Arkansas but I was not willing to relocate.
good,"I worked here briefly but it was ok. The work loads were not very bad and, you worked with limited supervision. The pay was not the best but, i worked there many years ago. The most difficult thing about the job was working behind someone who did not do a good the previous night."
good,"Very stressful environment, fast paced, but no respect or good management, lots of helping customer and working one on one at the cash register, and I had alot of stocking when we werent busy. I"
good,I love work hard with co worker and we alway finish our job and we finish those task and on time. So we keep focus our job and help team work if they don't know where it at so we teach them like training.
good,"I worked in grocery filling shelves so it was very busy because the Wal-Mart in Cape Girardeau, MO. was always packed. They really didn't have any major competition around and Cape is a college town so people were always there. It was alo one of Wal-Mart best selling outlets. When I wasn't working in grocery I was helping in the warehouse."
good,An easy place to work. Very fast paced with minimal effort. Staff are generally friendly and the pay and benefits are worth it. Even The night shifts are fast paced.
good,I enjoyed working here.  Liked stocking and unloading trucks. Some people were great workers. Enjoyable atmosphere most of the time.  Might return to this employer at some point.
good,This is a company that if you want to progress in it you can the managers were ok if they liked you and you don't get on there bad sides pay was based on what you know and how well you did it .
good,In all working for Walmart is good but could have better pay I'd rather work a job that has better pay so I could live off of and pay for transportation each check I get.
good,"As a cashier at Walmart, I was always treated fairly and received more than one raise during the year of time that was put in there. I never felt stressed and it was a very balanced work environment"
good,Walmart dose not provide fair work environment for older workers.  Today's workplace do not want to provide the necessary lunch breaks and accommodations to do your job. Being a pharmacy manager is extremely difficult to care for patients and keep up with all the other metric requirements demanded by the company. It is interesting to learn the business side of the job but not enough education devoted to that part of the job.
good,Clean work environment extra hours if wanted co workers help you  supervisors available to help keep job flow going treated fairly good benefits breaks and lunch break given
good,The hours were hard cause they would have you working till midnight one night then have to be back to work at 7 that morning but nice co workers and management
good,"Fast paced work environment. I learned how to stock and do security tags. You have some good managers and your bad ones. The workplace culture is very diverse and always changing. The hardest part of the job is the stocking, and cleaning. The enjoyable part of the job is helping customers."
good,the job itself was fun and kept me busy but after we got a new manager everyone was either getting firedog quitting. overall the job was good but the management didn't know what the were doing and firing people and falsely accusing workers of actions they didn't do.
good,"Me adapte fácilmente al trabajo asignado, el cual me permitió obtener una buena experiencia laboral."
good,"I enjoyed my position at Wal-Mart Cash Office. Unfortunately, I had to leave for more money as I was a single mother with 4 teenaged daughters to raise."
good,I worked at walmart as a cashier and enjoyed it very much. I worked the over night shift from 10:00 pm to 7:00 am. 40 hours a week but no over time. You get a discount card saving 10 percent after 3 months.
good,"Family oriented an incentive for school scholarships, Long term employment. Promotion possibilities. Great place to work; especially for a young up and coming college student or even a college graduate."
good,Overall a good company to work for with great benefits  with room for advancement.If you enjoy a culture with change the this will be the company you looking for.
good,"Walmart can be a very busy or slow environment, depending on the month or time of the year but it's a job where you are always busy and could have something to do for you shift to go by. also, you meet a lot of different people because of its diversity."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Employees are fun to work with. Management is good, better than other places I've worked. Flexible hours and a relaxing place to work. Only downside is you tend to get treated like you're expendable."
good,"Wal mart is an incredibly large corporation with great benefits (time-off, bonus payschecks). For the most part it is a friendly environment and certainly cares about the customer"
good,"Es una empresa muy exigente pero a la vez apoya a sus asociados, yo aprendí a perder el miedo a manejar dinero, aprendí a tener trato con diferentes tipos de personas, también estoy agradecida con los jefes directos que ahí tuve ya que siempre me apoyaron en cuanto a mi jornada laboral para que yo pudiera continuar con mis estudios, en fin, mi experiencia fue buena."
good,Facilidad de promoción dependiente del capital social que cuenta el individuo
good,"Walmart is cool place to work, the job of stocking isn't hard in my personal opinion.  The lunch breaks are an hour long, my co workers keep me laughing all night."
good,"Mostly an enjoyable workplace atmosphere. A typical workday consisted of unloading trucks, stocking consumable merchandise, and customer service. Management is helpful, friendly."
good,I worked as a cashier at Wal-mart for almost 11 years. I love working with the public and being able to put a smile on customer's faces before they leave the store!
good,"unresponsive management, unfair attendance policy, constant physical activity, little support from direct manager, unreliable team of associates, little to no opportunity for career advancement."
good,"Great work environment, do as you are asked and you will be fine. Easy to talk with when problems present themselves. Special events for employees from time to time. Very good training, informative and patient."
good,You will learn to manage large groups of associates and challenging situations. This has been valuable as I have advanced in my career.  Working at Walmart will train you for every situation
good,"a cashier position is very fast paced. You,re the last person the customer sees so you must be the friendliest and the quickest. main goal is to make sure they come back to shop."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work, be it full time, part time, day shift or night shift. The  employees tend to leave a mark on you, and the customers even more so."
good,I like working for Walmart in general. I just didn't like the swing shifts and inconsistency in the number of hours you were scheduled. Being a single mom I needed more hours and they weren't made available to me
good,I'd say if you have little experience then try Wal-Mart first. It has alot of positions open in many departments. I was a cashier was very easy to learn the register.
good,Pessoas sérias e que se importam com os colaboradores.
good,I really enjoyed working here but they werent as flexible as me as i was with them. That created a lot of issues. Otherwise it was a great job! Sad i had to leave.
good,The early morning hours do take some getting used to at first but other than that it is a decent job with benefits and paid time off. Management is absolutely terrible with exception to a few.
good,"Dress was casual but clean."
good,"Not too bad, customers were almost always pleasant. Got pulled away too often to help other departments, which didn't allow enough focus on own department."
good,"Working at walmart gives you knowledment"
good,People in management positions should stay in there roles and should not abuse their power. In order to be a team there needs to be more of a solid structure.
good,"Expected to learn quickly, team player, multi-task, would still be there but job was outsourced co. wide. Hourly assoc. are hard working and great to work with. Short staffed."
good,"There is no typical day at Walmart. Different focuses daily. Rather it be from market level, regional or from the food merchant. Also constant direction from store, and co managers, while running your assigned area, and using your ideas as well. Managing your associates on top of all of it, from hiring, firing, mentoring, and scheduling."
good,"My job was at the deli and a typical day was low-stress. Just helping customers and cleaning, making sure that the customers received great service from a clean and safe fresh area"
good,"Working at Walmart is great it's fun, entertaining, and can be good hours. Management is great but some days could be better. The pay is nice but the benefits kinda suck especially wth him holiday pay for working thanksgiving or Christmas Eve. You only get an extra 15%off of an order one single order."
good,"Some days may be hard but walmart is a wonderful place to work. I love working here, they give off a vibe that makes everyone feel as though they are a part of a family."
good,"I found my time with Walmart to be an illuminating experience."
good,Having job security is a great think to have. Working at Walmart I constantly had that security. As a consumer we know that every Walmart could use more workers.
good,Working at Walmart Pharmacy gave me a different perspective on how other companies treat their employees and their customers. There were defintely clicks in the pharamacy but overall we all worked together as a team to provide the best customer service as possible for the community.
good,"Normal day I would come in cahier all day sock up front stuff near my register.  Help customers as much as possible.  Load groceries etc. Make sure no appliance left with zone tags that would embarrass or go off at the exit doors.  Kept drawer counted and balanced."
good,"The job was productive and kept me busy, I enjoyed this job it was very active,  fast paced. The managers were professional and helpful. I would have liked earlier hours but it was a good job"
good,"It wasn't the best place to work but certainly not the worst. The pay then was not so great especially for what you were asked to endure, the yelling customers and late nights away from your family just trying to earn a paycheck. I did enjoy the discount however not enough to affect the paycheck."
good,"I worked for Wal-Mart Inc for 20yrs. I worked in the stores for 10 years worked in every area in the store from the check outs to departments, layaway and claims clerk. I transferred to the home office and started in accounting on the help desk and moved to the people divisions RPA and then on to girlswear merchandising. I learned many valuable life lessons while working for this company they were always good to me."
good,Good place to work but it does get stressful at times. The only bad thing about working for Walmart right now is how they have changed you getting your vacation days and holiday pay and also the shortage of hours thru out the stores.
good,"En lo general es buena empresa para trabajar, aunque últimamente algunos jefes de departamento no tienen buen trato con los asociados"
good,Overall Wal-Mart is a pretty decent place to work no overtime but you do get raises every year at your anniversary managers are easy going and laid back
good,"Es una gran familia, con ambientes agradables, zonas de descanso con juegos y refrigerios a cargo de la empresa"
good,Sometimes  you get smelly customers and the computer systems are extremely bad but thats fine ... i loved the people I worked with but most of all the the fact that customers that come in all the time was always talking to me.
good,"Fun work place, all managers are supportive, enjoyment in work, no tensions, motivation in work, multi culture activities. but salary are not good. some time not getting enough hours."
good,"The typical day consist of reworking the freight that night shift leaves and tagging it to put in the bins and filling the milk. After that we usually look for out of dates and zone the department. Then we divide the department and start stocking with items from the cooler. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up on the weekends when we are busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my department manager, she is really nice and teaches me the different things she has to do as a department manager."
good,"Bom de trabalhar.pois os funcionários da empresa são agradáveis,nos tratam bem."
good,"It can be a good temporary job unless you want to promote. Wal-mart does have a lot of career opportunities but management is not well organized. It can be a stressful job,  if you're a stalker."
good,"It's a place of some routine, and most of the employees are nice and genuine people. Work hours are flexible and it can be pretty fast paced, so as long as you are a willing worker I would recommend the job."
good,"I enjoyed working with my associates! That was the best part of it all. And helping take care of the customers. Fast pace was amazing too. Some management worked with you others didn't, but that's pretty much any work place."
good,in the 23 year i have been there i have seen the good years and the fun time's we use to have and the middle time where thang were ok seen a lot of people come and go some good works and some not so good and how we have the not good years so its time for a change
good,"The job had great pay, and good benefits.  However, you had to watch what you say or there was a good chance you might be fired.  I didn't trust upper management.  My advice is just shut up and do your job."
good,There was really no typical dat at the work here because everyday you never know what management may have you doing depending on your job title. I actually had the privilege to travel within the company to different stores for remodel and was actually a cool and fun experience. The hardest part of the job is closing such as working from 3pm to 12am.
good,A empresa é boa de se trabalhar porém o salário é um pouco abaixo no mercado de trabalho da região.
good,The company just needs to have more compassion when the employee's get sick. They also need to start back taking doctor's excuses. The Company needs to hire more people that way. Each department isn't short staff.
good,"Fue una buena experiencia  para mi  me formo más como persona ,ahora se como dialogar  con las personas y tengo más actitud"
good,Work hard and keep to yourself. A typical work day would be getting mostly 2 to 11 as a work shift and keeping up a positive attitude with rude customers.
good,A typical day long fun very busy. I learned the value of making customers happy. Management was not the best very slow to respond. The culture was unique to see different people and what they like to buy. The hardest part was probably coupons and/or price matching. The most enjoyable part was seeing everyone smile when they leave my presents.
good,"The management at Walmart had some ups and lows to it. The most hardest part about the job was there was no set schedule for when you could work, but the pay was good."
good,"I've worked at Walmart as a cake decorator for almost two years now, and it honestly feels like a dream job to me. Yet, sadly, it doesn't come without it's faults. "
good,"Depending on what department you're in, I worked in lawn and garden and I built lawn mowers, table sets and any displays in lawn and garden. I cleaned, watered plants and ran a cash register. I helped people when they needed assistance."
good,Greet customers and make sure they get through your line quickly and scan every item accurately. Help customers. to their cars with bigger items. Also dealing with the angry customers.
good,"Walmart was my first real job. I LOVED IT! Very strict rules, but if you follow them and do what you're getting paid to do, you wont have a problem. The only thing I didn't like about walmart, was the management. It felt like they were always against you or trying to single you out. But i loved it, for the most part"
good,"Everyday I go to work I am expected to follow this routine as a department manager but things does not go that way because the managers above me does not help or do their job so that leaves the department mangers to do so. I learned how to do inventory, makes sales, train associates, customer service, how to keep account of items, manage time well, works well with others, independent and motivated, and work well with a diverse population. The hardest part of this job is trying to do my own and my assistance manager job. The most enjoyable part is being able to work with others and communicate with customers,"
good,"Walmart is a great opportunity to learn new things. You learn how to run a cash register which involves knowing the different techniques to run a check, a debit, a credit card, load money, do a wic, do coupons, and learn how to clock in and out of work."
good,"Fun place to work.  Friendly staff and customers.  However, The employer always sided with the customer even when the customers point of view was basically a lie."
good,"Everything was great until I needed to be transferred to a different store. Communication is awful with all of Walmart's management.  Communication aside, it was a great company to work for."
good,A empresa é muito boa pena q era temporario gostaria de continuar
good,la direction ne fais pas assez bien leur travail. Le salaire l'horaire et  bonus est avantageux.
good,enjoyed working there it was very nice customers the only bad part was the hours were not the same and short breaks 30 mins and pay is only .40 cents every year
good,"Alta demanda diária, oportunidade de atuar em diversas áreas e se qualificar , pois se trata de uma das maiores empresas Varejista do mundo."
good,"Wal-Mart has changed since the death of it's founder, and not for the better. However, it is still a fair place to work. The best part of working at this company for being able to move around and work with others as well as by myself in the office. I enjoyed fundraising for the children's hospital."
good,The store when I worked there was trashy... always dirty. Recently it has become better. The management was actually really good and had no bias. I dislike surveys..
good,walmart was a great place to work. the customers were friendly and not rude at all. most of the time they were very patient. there is always plenty to do and the time goes by fast.
good,"It was a good place to work i have around 5 yrs experience if you were to add it all together of Walmart experience. If you're looking for a good part time job, or even something while you're in school then it is definitely a very good place to work."
good,When I worked at Wal-Mart I was a cart pusher and it was a hard job but I enjoyed my job. The place was organized and fast paced. If highly recommend walmart.
good,"Well I have no problem performing tasks required, this is not exactly a full-filling job. Supervisors are not the best planners, but do get jobs completed for the most part."
good,At Walmart there is a lot to learn everyday it's a new experience with new people it's fun working there co members are very good and friendly they understand
good,management was good but there can be some better structure for training and when it comes to assigning work. hours were fair and i liked the opportunity for growth.
good,"For me, Walmart is like family. Most of the employees have been there for a long time. There is a rapport between the workers and management. The only bad thing is the pay is pretty low and there are no health or pension benefits"
good,Greet every customer. Smile. Smile. Smile .Be polite. Listen. Stay busy.The job itself is easy.Do your best. You can only do what you can. Do your job.
good,A typical day at Walmart would start with unloading at 18 wheeler. I would palletize the product that came off the trucking short it by sections. Half way through the day I would take it to the sections
good,"Walmart has a lot to offer anyone who likes working with public. However, I feel the management staff should be required to take courses in Business Ethics annually."
good,"Walmart Is An Amazing Work Place , The Longer You Are There The More You'll Like It . You May Stumble Across A Few Rude Managers But Overall Its A Good Work Place"
good,You will be overworked and underpaid.  You will make many friends.  You will learn a lot about customer service.  No experience is needed. You will have the opportunity to climb.
good,I really enjoy Wal-Mart.  It's a great field to be in. Mostly helping in alot of ways. Working here definitely gave  me a different outlook on team work. I appreciate all the customers as well as employees. Great experience
good,"work is good at Walmart wish they would high fulltime, no health benefits for part time. wanted to become manager but no help in advancement. Overall I did enjoy working at walmart"
good,I loved my job at Walmart. Hate how they don't accept doctor excuses and on point system. Love working 3rd shirt we worked together as team. Management on third shift helped each other
good,My experience with Walmart was it was not a family friendly workplace. It is 100% business needs and any issues you may have they will be quick to try to get rid of you. The pay is decent but the new way to run the store is how little amt of people can we work with to help profits.
good,"Enjoyed working with Walmart, however if you do not have plans to relocate to home office which is in Arkansas you are limited. Overall I am pleased with my experience but I have reached my limit in my location."
good,"Work was very busy, fast paced, but sort of out of control. Managment wasnt that great and alot of the high authority act like they were in high school gossipping about other employees, just childish much"
good,"Advancement was easy, the company was good to work for except when it came to illness within the family and the absences that come with it. My store had a high turn over for management. Other employees were helpful and friendly, but lots of high stress and understaffing."
good,A typical day at work was stocking and rotating fruits and veggies and stocking other items in the produce section and interacting with customers and helping them out. I learned how to deal with certain customers and coworkers. Some management was cool while particular others were not. Nothing was really that hard in the job. Most enjoyable part was constantly being active and interacting with people.
good,"Very busy and upbeat place, loved my schedule and always learning something new on the joy. Almost never a slow day and benefits were very helpful when on full-time position."
good,"My hardware manager was my favorite manager i've ever had, but other manager's like to make up rumors and spread them quick. I worked with my boyfriend and got accused of sleeping with a different coworker.  My boyfriend and the guy I was accused of sleeping with both laughed at the accusations."
good,"Typical day: Lots of customers, opprotunities to make someone happy, lots oof mismanagement"
good,"i actually enjoyed working at wal-mart, you make good friends and everyone is like a big family. they will take care of you if you work hard. Its a great place."
good,"You help customer with questions put cloths away that customer try on clean your department make sure there is merchandise on racks and shevels'"
good,"I enjoyed this job. The only problem is the schedule was never the same, it was hard to make plans. The pay was okay but I did have to quit because I needed a better job with more pay because of getting married."
good,I worked as a cashier.  I assisted with checking customers out and keeping the front end clean.  I loved meeting new people and satisfying the customers.  At wal-mart the like to keep the customers happy and coming back.
good,Walmart was a very well-run store going through a lot of changes at the time but managed to come around the curve very well with improvements to security and loss prevention and equipment improvements
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart for a little over ten years and most days, I had no complaints. But they are a revolving door when it comes to employees and management. I can't name all the assistant managers I have worked under, or even the co-managers... And I don't even know how many people I spent a month, or often less, training in before they never came back. However, I always was appreciated for the hard work and commitment to the dairy department and was offered multiple times to move up in the company, I just never took the offers due to focusing on my son and family."
good,"Enjoyed working there. My hours were good. Pay and benefits were good. Customers were sometimes more negative than I would prefer. Fellow associates were good, some became lifelong friends."
good,"The typical day at work could be stressful, because sadly many don't realize the opportunities available to them through the Walmart Corporation, and therefore don't take their position in the company seriously. I learned more fully how to navigate the corporate world. Management although, presumably, well meaning often falls short in balancing the workload of associates. The hardest part of a position at Walmart is the work/life balance. the most enjoyable part is the interaction with the community."
good,I learned quite a bit about being a Sales Associate at Walmart. everyone was very welcoming the first day I started and excited about me being apart of the team. the Job is not hard at all because my co-workers would explain everything to me clearly and walk me through every task i would be doing. I enjoy being apart of the Walmart tame.
good,Walmart was fun and a learning experience. The managers there wasn't professional at all. They had no control of the employees and very little organize. They wee willing to promote whoever they thought were ready. It's a lot of nepotism going on in the Walmart company
good,It can be a lot of running on your feet but the people you work with make it worthwhile. All you need to know to be a good employee is to always smile and know where everything is in the store.
good,I found myself working in the bush department of Wal Mart where I learned new computer skills and sharpened my math skills also. I spent sometime cashiering which is something I wasn't use to doing in my previous jobs so I learned some new job skills which is awesome.
good,Walmart is a good place to work the benefits 401 k  all around a great place to work . They work with your schedule sometimes . Not a lot of help as far as being a cashier but it's not bad .
good,"Great Company to work for and to be a part of, lots of room for advancement in the many divisions and departments. Moving around can be a bit challenging with interview process."
good,Learned a lot grew a lot. held several different positions inside the company. Seen so many different vibrate cultures learned how to cook a lot of different dishes.
good,"just being honest I don't really know what to say about walmart, I have mixed feeling about them. Some of management was great while some was lazy or rude"
good,Walmart was a great experience its not one of the best jobs but it does make a effort to help employees in the work world.  Really Great customer service training even though some employees don't understand how to make it effective.
good,"A typical day of work consists of cashing out customers and cleaning up your work area."
good,Was a good company to work for. The management wasn't so great. The work itself was stressful yet the check was good. They are a very wasteful company though which I found to be bad. They should donate food they waste.
good,It's an ok place to work just didn't like the fact that they show favoritism and give positions to people who are not qualified and never wanted the position
good,"Llegar a realizar actividades pendientes por terminar y realizar la junta de comunicación de 10 mins con los asociados por departamentos."
good,"Its not a bad place to work, but if your more then half hour late you shouldn't have a job here, i was late but not too late five min or so. but because of miscommunication in the work place (know that i will take responsibility for my actions) but some management need to be more focus on there job then just going out for a cigarette."
good,I was a part time worker. I enjoyed the people I worked with but managers tended to expect more than one person could do. I had a different working schedule every day.
good,Working for walmart wasnt to bad you see new people everday and learn alot retail from babies to automotive lawn and garden electronics sporting goods groceries and a lot more.
good,"While the company is a fun place to work, with many things going in its favor. There are many things I do not  agree with. After 9 years with the company I have learned many things, but I feel as if it is time for me to find another, hopefully better, opportunity"
good,"Management was very unprofessional. I loved working there because of the customers, fast paced environment, and because it was always busy and something to do. I would recommend this job but the management just sucks."
good,"Works as a meat and produce orderfiller. Like any job it has good days and bad days. It's a production based job which has pros and cons but mostly cons. Pay is good. Typical day is clock in have a quick 10 min meeting and stretch then it's 9 to 10 hrs of moving boxes of meat and produce. With boxes varying from 1lbs  to meat boxes that weigh 90lbs. It's a workout!!! Seems a lot like the upper management sees most of us production workers as replaceable so they don't care about the workers as much. You're easily replaceable and You're just a number to them. High turnover rates so the few of us that are good workers get the shaft on that. Lots of stupid rules. Call in sick for a day they take 10hrs of your vacation pay no questions asked. Claim safety is the number one thing but don't care if you have to orderfill 6 straight days @ 120% plus. You really do need your off days to recover. "
good,"I started at the beginning, before the store opened. It was great being there and seeing how everything came together. Then I worked as a Sales Associate in several departments. Good job!"
good,Walmart is a great company to work for when you are starting off. It gives you mulitple chances to get many different skills in a workplace. There are plenty of oppurtunities to move within the company.
good,Walmart is a pretty good company to work for. Management is kind of hit or miss sometimes but there are alot of good people there. I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for pretty solid hours and money.
good,Una empresa donde siempre se busca la mejora continua del área junto con el personal
good,"My typical day consisted of unloading truck, stocking shelves, inventory using One Touch PDA.    This was my first job.  I learned how to perform the tasks assigned, assist customers when necessary."
good,"Acredito que hoje todos nós buscamos um crescimento profissional, sabemos que para alcançar isso é necessário muito esforço e dedicação total. Porém a empresa não dava oportunidade para nosso setor de atendimento."
good,"Many of people had the same problems I did, management is never on your side and will not back you up if needed. The pay is pretty good and you do have the opportunity to advance within the walls you work. Management will punish you for missing work and do not allow you to take sick leave even though they say you can, and good luck getting days off. Be ready to work all holidays year round as they do not care for your family or family time."
good,There was always some thing to do. Would move from department to department which enabled me to learn a lot. Gained a lot of experience during my employment with Wal Mart.
good,Working for Wal-Mart has its benefits. I enjoyed a ten percent discount on most items in the store and quarterly bonuses. I had great co-workers and most of the customers were wonderful.
good,"Learned a different set of people skills working with truck drivers."
good,"Calata de coordinación. Pero buena empresa,falta tener mas control en las areas de supervisión y administrativas,yo le otorgo el crédito a los empleados por su desempeño ,gracias a ellos funciona mas adecuadamente la empresa."
good,"Always busy with lot of interaction with customers.  A typical day starts with answering the phone with sending it to right extension.  Learning how to use equipment, all of the different departments and where things go.  Finding answers to questions takes some inatitive because it's difficult to find a member of management.  Helping other associates and training leaves a lot to be desired.  Making new friends and meeting new people is the best part of the job."
good,"The managers never seem pleased with what you can do, always pushing more out of you.  The Co-workers are the best.  I still miss some of them, but management could be a little better promotions in store."
good,Walmart is a quite place to start out if you looking into retail. They can be kind of shady when it comes to company hours cuts but for the most part the pay was good and i got a decent amount of hours and quite a but of experience.
good,"My day would consist or making sure I had enough cashiers to run the front at night. making sure my closing CSS's did all their drops before their shift ended as well as all their  night work. then I would do m y fright as well as assisting customers at the cash register and as well as putting all of my tills out when they need to be done and doing all my go backs and also making sure that my front area of the store was clean, zoned, and ready for the next day."
good,This place is horrible please do not work here if you want to have a life. They never give you off when you need it and they never care if you have a family emergency
good,Its an pretty good job to have the start Off pay is good but once you finish your pathways you get a dollar raise to look forward to the work load usually is easy but some nights it'll be a lot of work you have to do but it's manageable also your supervisors are a big help they will assist in anyway they can and every once in a while they will have free lunch for the workers that's what I like the most.
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work especially for a first-time job or part-time position. There are opportunities for advancement. Scheduling can sometimes be cumbersome but associates work with each other to make things work. Great employees! Typical work day included greeting customers as they entered and exited the store. Cashier on days when there was a cashier shortage. Management has a great team but there is always room for improving processes. The hardest part of the job was standing for 8-9 hours. The most enjoyable was the customers.
good,"The work was not hard and you had help all around.  Easy to get help anywhere you look, but they are very by the book.  they follow policies strictly, which lead to my termination."
good,"I have worked for Walmart for three months now. They have great cultural values. The one thing i have to say about the business is that it is very hard to be sick and request leave, to not be able to get it."
good,It has been an interesting experience. Many of the associates are enjoyable to be around. Most of the management team are great. Days can very on what you do depending on coverage in the store.
good,"Typical day began with stocking shelves with new product then zoning and removing items left in the electronics department. It was also important to straighten up DVD and Blue-ray movies, gaming accessories, and other items to make the area neat and appealing. Supervisors were the main suppliers of direction on what needed to be done on a daily or weekly basis. Managers would usually run through the area once or twice a day as they were responsible for other areas. I learned locations of movies and electronic accessories. Learned how to deal with customers who did not know exactly what they wanted, and customers who knew what they wanted and were upset when we didn't have that item. The workplace culture was customer oriented, fast paced, and actually fun. The hardest part of the job was trying to stock shelves per direction of the supervisors, when the shelves had no room for the product they wanted to be stocked. The most enjoyable part on the job was dealing with the customers.  Most of them were nice, with only an occasional jerk in the bunch."
good,I was a CSM for the whole front of the store from 4:30pm to 11:00pm.  It was a very fun job that I enjoyed a lot.  You had to have very strong customer service which is one of my strong points.
good,I worked 3 departments and got register trained im a sales associate i shouldn't need too be called on a register if you have and hire enough cashiers then management wants too complain about working not being done when you ask me too do 3 different jobs located in 3 different locations of the store
good,"They can't keep people working in apparel for a reason. "
good,"I was a caps 2 member, for the most part I moved items from the trucks onto pallets and moved this to the floor. The system they had was a bit wonky at times and from what I heard the upper management would order without looking up overstock so we we always packed and pressed for space, but other than that it was ok."
good,Es una empresa que brinda mucha estabilidad laboral pero las oportunidades de crecimiento son muy bajas.
good,It was ok . Maintained 35 hrs per week . Unloaded plants and trees that would come in . Do displays around the Department . Do weekly orders . Customer service .
good,"Aprendí a hacer conteo de mercancías, el compañerismo es importante hay, lo más difícil es el trato con clientes molestos, pero el trabajo tiene buen ambiente."
good,Walmart has given me a lot of experience in customer service and a many other skills I will take with me to other jobs and help me build a career. the hardest part of the job was the work load they put on one person and the expectation of being able to change your schedule at a moments notice. The most enjoyable part of the job was cross training in multiple areas and the people I worked with. As with any job there are some good people and some bad people in management. Communication seem lacking in my opinion and was sometimes hard to full understand what was expected of you.
good,"I worked at Walmart full-time "
good,"Constant contact with customers, fast paced. always something to do. not very much down time, management easy to work with. many departments to work in. employees are fun to work with."
good,Worked for Wal-Mart for over 10 years each was progressively harder to endure until I didn't even want to show up anymore.  The hourly associates you get to work with are the only pro other than the pay.
good,"Most managers are really cool and fun. Not a hard job unless the managers see that you're a good worker, then you have to do your job AND a few others jobs too. And if you don't get done with their jobs, you'll get in trouble. Days go by fast."
good,"i enjoyed working with coworkers"
good,learning different things everyday. Fun typical work day. Management makes it stressful at times. But it is easy at times. Workplace is good.  Hardest part is doing mods
good,This Walmart has a surprisingly caring and fun management team. They are not perfect or anything but when my sister died the entire team was there for me.
good,A typical day at work is very busy. I learned how to better manage people and that there are more than one way to get to a solution(Respect for the individual).
good,"A Typical day at work, you have a lot of angry customers, and you have to be patient with customers and provide them with the best customer service to make the customers happy. Workplace culture is very diverse.The ""Customer Service Manager"" recommend and train you for advancement from Cashier to Customer Service Desk or Money Center, you would let them know that you are very interested in learn and move to that position. What I learn is the manager are never on the same page as their workers. Example: Walmart return policy, they don't have meetings to explain how the return and refund policy works."
good,"First few years where good, changing Managers has become the new norm. And very tedious for employees. Lately middle Management has been overruling company polices and making us look foolish in the costumer's eyes."
good,es exelente el trabajo ahi lo unico malo era el contacto con jefes que solo buscaban conflictos
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for ! I've had my ups and down, but if you stay to yourself and come to work and do your job you shouldn't have any problems."
good,"Quick paced, Responsible, and Respectable. Fun environment with co-workers but also very professional. Hardest part about the was getting used to the graveyard shift."
good,Working in the jewelry department was interesting and sometimes rewarding. You met people from all walks of life and helped them to find that perfect piece of jewelry for their loved one or themselves.
good,its not about the money all the time more of the lines of coworkers i worked with some of the coolest people and ignored the pay because of it. i did expect to move up considering how hard i worked but no promotions were offered and i didnt get accepted for any. not all managers where good but the ones over me were pretty awesome if i didnt wreck my car and move to del city i would have stayed.
good,"En la vida nos encontramos todo tipo de personas, tambien hay que saber dividir las relaciones laborales y las amistades tuve el placer de trabajar con un equipo de trabajo donde me dejó un muy buen sabor de boca donde a pesar de existir diferencias pude aprender demaciadas cosas, que en la vida diaria me han servido"
good,"the overall business was really nice to work in. However potential to move up in the company is somewhat limited, so once you start as an order filler you can expect to be locked into the position for at least 3-4 years if not longer."
good,"Wal-Mart the company is a great company to work for; Wal-mart offers room for growth and unlimited career advancements as well as a competitive salary once you have proved yourself capable."
good,great place to work but the pay is not good at all when I was there and that was back in 1998.  The people were nice to work with so that is a plus. It is definitely a learning experience for someone fresh out of school to build some responsibility roles.
good,"The atmosphere was fun, the pace can be fast.  The store management could've been nicer, but the department supervisors were great.  Excellent job to make extra money part time, excellent first time job experience.  Room for advancement if you want to get into retail management."
good,This was a fun place to work very laid back and easy to learn as long as you did your job your day was great. Some of the management was poor managers and they played favorites but overall a good place to work.
good,Walmart is pretty cool I would have stayed if it was just a little closer people are very friendly and cool I enjoyed my time at Walmart not bad at all it's always work to do
good,"A typical day at work with Walmart is very routine. I stock the shelves, clean up when I am finished and provide customer service as needed. I have learned that as long as you do what's expected, you'll be okay. Workplace culture is pretty healthy, most managers seem to have a positive attitude. The hardest part of the job is on the nights when there is a lot of freight and not much help. The most enjoyable part is when I am finished with my work."
good,High stress environment. Dealing with over a thousand different type of customers a day. Managing a lot of money. preparing for major holidays like black Friday.
good,"Management sucked but, I worked in the bakery and I was tucked away. I was also pregnant and management pushed me so hard that it through me into early labor."
good,"Everyday at walmart was unique in its own way. I worked mainly with   customers at the jewlry counter. I had regular customers that would bring their watches to be adjusted or needed new batteries put in. I also, ordered class rings and family rings and also, wedding ring orders. I was constantly busy with assisting customers and putting away new shippments as they came in. I learned that for me I loved making the customers happy. Management could be confusing at times. I would have so many people that had a certain opinion on how something should be done. The hardest part was keeping all of management happy on days like this. The most enjoyable part was seeing that smile when the customer got what they wanted at a good price too."
good,"Los días de trabajos eran tranquilo; ambiente familiar"
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work but there are many flaws that diminish the work atmosphere on a daily basis.  More communication is always need and many 'upper' management feel entitled to their own opinions rather than being open-minded and compromising.  My peers are wonderful and usually have each others' backs if necessary regarding mods, price changes or just simple freight to work.  Overall I liked working for the company but too many changes not for the best have made me venture out."
good,"I really enjoyed my job here, did leave due to lack of associates to help the long lines. Loved the people I worked with though, even still when I go in to shop it is like going to see friends."
good,Very pleasant job but you just can't please everyone. Must know how to not let people affect your emotions and moods. You have your regulars who are bound to make your day. Not every thing is bad about the company.
good,Working at walmart was fun. Never a dull moment while working there for me however even after setting myself to a certain availability due to baby sitter issues i was scheduled outside of my availibility
good,"I used to be manager in Subway at Puerto Rico for 14 years and I really like it and enjoy it! my day in Walmart  are easy for the knowledge that I got from other jobs. Its just scanning items for the costumers, I was got the CSM position which was depositing the money from the registers."
good,Well for me i unloaded trucks with all kinds of product and i liked doing that.Overall good place to work.Good benefts and discounts.  I have had bad days and have learn things that i did'nt know.
good,When I was hired by Wal-mart I was skeptical until I got to get to know my coworkers.  Very inspiring and passionate people.  The work was challenging but I worked hard and was rewarded with hard work by getting lots of promotion opportunities.
good,"I enjoyed working here, just don't agree with the attendance policy. They DO NOT accept doctor's excuses of any kind, and I have a pre-existing health condition."
good,"People that I work with are all nice and helpful; they make sure your breaks are taken"
good,All that stuff that was stated above only stressing that the amount of employees is small and it hurts the overall production in the day making night guys have to care twice the workload
good,"The company was great to work for but the ""mangers"" expected you to wear ""superhero pants"" at all times. One person can only do so much! As a Department Manager I was short staffed and was expected to have the same performance as all other managers."
good,"As much as people hate on Wal-Mart it's actually not a bad place to work, mind you the pay is on the low end, I worked in the automotive department and was either helping customers, stocking shelves or conducting oil changes."
good,"Minha rotina no trabalho era fazer o a bastecimento de produtos na área, controlando qualidade e validade do mesmo, cortes de caixa formando espelho nas glândulas e alinhamento de paletes mantendo padrão, marcação de slots para controle de estoque aéreo, limpeza e organização da área. "
good,"The job is very easy, although when you are a cashier your responsibilities are scanning product, counting your cash at the end of the day and sell sell sell that mastercard. "
good,Empresa capacita os funcionários para atendimento e trabalhar em todas as áreas e não somente na sua.
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for. Hours get cut too often. Benefits are good but cost a lot. Paid time off is great. Management isn't very good, they dont help the little guys and sometimes they slander in front of other associates and even customers."
good,I was an overnight stocker and I learned a lot about zoning and stocking items in different departments. There is a lot of teamwork and the managers were very helpful.
good,"I loved the Department I was assigned.  My background from previous jobs was a natural place to be assigned when I was hired. My previous employment was home improvement manager for Sears Home improvements.  When that office in Eugene, Oregon was closed, I started my own home improvement company and named my company Craftsman Exterior Design. When the downturn in the economy in 1997, I went to work for Walmart, and because of my knowledge in the paint, automotive and hardware departments from my previous jobs, I was perfect for that job. I was able to match color's to customer needs. Most enjoyable part of that job was the interaction with the customers.  Management was at times not understanding the time it took to provide great customer service. Walmart management was not fully aware of what the job consisted of and did not understand what the customers expected from my paint department, as I was able to solve just about anything that was of concern in my department, and because management knew very little about what was needed for my customers, I was fired for spending to much time with an elderly couple that had concern's about the ""how to do"" the project they were about to start. I still say customer service is very important to any retail job and I offer only the best service in each and every customer that my department calls for."
good,a typical day at work consist of making sure products are is the right place. greeting customers. the management is very helpful if you dont understand something. the best part of the day is when its time to go.
good,"Good company, culture, and leadership. Being flexible and learning new ways of working is extremely important. Working with IT and GBS, finding new ways to integrate technology and ways of working is a constant process. Find more efficient ways to do things and improve our associate's work"
good,Management is great. They have benefits. Whether they are good or bad I do not know. They give a 10% employee discount. Advancement is possible.Sometimes you get to see the new merchandise before the customers.
good,Love working as a team. I would work mornings and night shift either way it was great. It was a great experience.I was place there by employment express.loved working at Walmart.
good,Always thin ice and strict need to follow the rules the jobs completion was the most important thing that was to be done then all else was to be addressed.
good,so i rarely got to see my department manger so i got stuck with other mangers who didn't know a thing about the department then they get upset when things don't get done because the take department A employees and but them in department B to finish their own work load first and just leave like two employees in department A
good,It is a nice place to work at. Very friendly but steadfast. They need to provide employees with water especially during the summer because it gets hot
good,boa empresa para si trabalha segui a risca  seguranca alimenta e do trabalho sempre esta treinando seus colaboradores para esta sempre atualisado com as norma do trabalho e alimenta.
good,Walmart is a great job while going to school or just for the daily grind. I definitely wouldn't consider it a career job but not a bad job for supplemental income while going to school (college) or even a great first job while still in high school. I personally wouldn't pursue this workplace for a career but if you have a passion for providing the public with inexpensive places to shop then the Walmart stores may be the right place for you and that's not a bad thing at all. I love shopping at Wal-Mart stores still to this day and it is because they provide quality products at very reasonable prices.
good,"Easy place to work, nice people all around, job is a nice pay, I worked overnights so it was even better. I had alot of interaction with people around the store."
good,The most enjoyable part of working for walmart as a cashier is meeting new people. the hardest part is changes made to procedure with no information given on the change.
good,"Now this is back from 2014 when I did work at walmart. For the most part it was a straight forward job, especially at night, all we had to do was stock, and straighten and then go home. My only gripe is 3rd shift was often left with more to do as 1st and 2nd were allowed to go home as soon as their shift were over, we couldn't until we were absolutely done with everything."
good,"Upper management is somewhat out of touch. Managers that work closer with the hourly workers understand what we go through."
good,Wal-Mart was a good job to start out with. I just found something better and honesty who don't want to do better? I have nothing bad to say about this company.
good,"a Typical day at work in the meat and produce department would be spent most of the time stocking the sales floor, helping customers find items, and zoning.  "
good,I enjoyed working here very much. I leaned a lot of new things and got to meet some really interesting people. I would definitley work for them again.
good,"Es una empresa buena en cuanto a lo laboral."
good,"great place to make new friends "
good,"It was ok, but to many chiefs not enough Indians. The chiefs are to busy for the Indians sometimes and it can cause a lot of Indians to leave the tribe. Overall a good work place if you're good with people. Honestly communication is key."
good,"Es una empresa con una aomplia organizacion, mucho personal y buena cultura laboral."
good,Very stressful day at work.  Management is on your butt all the time over something. Pay is very good for a starting out type of job.  Can be a career if you want it to.
good,easy to get along with co workers bosses were fantastic. just starting out they made it easy to understand everything and werent too hard on us if we made mistakes they showed us how to do it properly and move on.
good,Days go by very quickly and there is always something to do. Customer service is number one.  I start my day by reviewing the floor and back room.  Then I work on expires or about an hour a day.  I then work on merchandising and new freight.
good,"I've learned to have patience with customers. They say the customer is always right. Although I may not agree with that 100%, I still smile and be the best that i can while at work."
good,"Working at Walmart is an interesting experience. The hardest and more enjoyable part of working at Walmart at the same thin in my book- the people that you talk too, both your coworkers and the people who are shopping there. For the most part you cannot let what they say get to you personal. Its a fast-paced place that is always different day to day."
good,"working at Walmart had its ups and downs. but overall it is a good place for students who are starting off working and elder people. also, help workers interact with guests if not already used to it."
good,When it came to working at walmart we came to work with a smile for me not only was it the rule but I loved the idea of being around people and helping.
good,I really didn't like working at Walmart but I had to to get the bills paid  so you do what you got to do as a adult. I just didn't like working nights
good,facil trabajar con los jefes de area y buen compañerismo
good,"Proposta  para crescimento "
good,"Good,job and people,for the,most part Some,managers have problems in relation to jobs needed by seniors. Good benefits with some,favoritism,in regard to filling of store job openings"
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Walmart these past 3 years, but it is time to move on. I have learned quite a bit with the heavy machines and the technology part of it. Since working there I have gained an extensive amount of knowledge on cell phones."
good,"It had a good work environment and it was quite enjoyable"
good,"I learned in the department I work in that anyone could be a shoplifter. It was important to understand the protocol and listen to the daily reports. Each day had its challenges communicating with your team, exploring the store for any suspicious activity, safety meeting, etc. The work place culture was fast pace everything continual and management gathered information with clarity before making decisions. My job became more enjoyable when I was able to help a customer either find something, answer a question, or make sure they had a good shopping experience."
good,"Desenvolvi atividades como: empacotamento, reposição de produtos e organização de prateleiras."
good,"Being a lead pharmacy tech is a rewarding job and there is never a dull moment. However, the level of stress is high. I personally enjoy the work I do and the people I work with. Be ready to work and constantly chasing goals that are always being increased."
good,No one wanted to help anyone and it was a horrible experience but I did learn a lot from being a cashier and I learned how to not be so shy around people I didn't know. I made plenty of friends but most of the other employees weren't very friendly. They hardest part was dealing with the mean customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to help the customers that need help.
good,"Working a Wall mart wasn't the best experience, but it was a great learning point. Wall mart is a busy business so if one group is behind we are all behind. I enjoyed light days when me and co-workers would relax and find any and every way to help out around the store."
good,A typical day starts with restocking shelves you may need 3 items of one thing and 8 of anotherspend alot of time in the freezer collecting these items tag use by stickers.I frosted and decorated cakes of frgerated shelves. I took orders for cakes and decorated them per customers request sometimes 10 a day. There was alot of cleanup at end of day. In my opiinion the management and associates over worked most days due to not enough help  the hardest part was trying to get all job duties finished  and I'm  a pretty fast worker. The most enjoyable  part of the job was pleases the customers.I worked in 3 different departments day and night shift worked with a lot of nice people some not so nice some hard workers some lazy. For the most part Wal-mart  treated me good.you would have your difficult  customers also especially  about cakes not being perfect .I worked in meat department for about a year and I really enjoyed working there with some good people hard workers like myself..the only thing my hours would change alot one day I worked 7-4 and the next 1-10 then next 7-4 again I mostly kept theshelves stocked and customer service. There was alot o heavy lifting involved in that department that's why I left and went to bakery
good,"Some members of management are AWESOME, while others had absolutely NO business being in those positions."
good,"i learned how to use palet jacks,stock merchandise,loading/unload truck,zoning merchandise."
good,It is a great place to work. The employees are good people to work with but the managers are a little bit on the hypocritical side with rules and regulations. Cliental can be different at times but overall nice people shop there. A typical day at Walmart would be running freight that has come off of the truck and assisting customers. The hardest part of the job is the constant demand of the customers and the managers needing everything to get done in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part is being able to talk to some of these customers and get to know them and help build your people skills.
good,At Walmart Pharmacy Tech's are treated badly by incompetent management at times. Pay is lower than to be expected but the breaks are evenly spaced from one another.
good,It was an okay place to work. A very fast paced enviroment. A wonderful entry level position with a lot of advancement opportunities. Good benefits and an great management team
good,It was a nice place to work the people were very friendly. The schedule was just off a Lil bit it was hard to balance as the years progress.. I worked there for 4 years..
good,I like the atmosphere there it was really welcoming at times. I enjoy working its a good job to have.  Dont really have to much more to say it was a very good place to work
good,"Stocking of freezers and coolers, clearing and stocking of shelve spaces. Set up of cookware and hot case, food prep and rotation. Cleaning all equipment and utensils for closings."
good,"Walmart is a great company for someone looking for his or her first job. The benefits are good, the pay is all right and the work is fulfilling (helping and meeting new people)."
good,"The job itself is good, the pay is great, the benefits are decent. The main issue lies with management and how they deal with hostility in the work environment."
good,On a Typical day at work I stock products on the shelves and also help customers find what they are looking for. Management are flexible with my school schedule and help me out when I need it throughout the day. The most hardest part of the job is satisfying every customer I come in contact with. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers I work with; when I need help something on the job they are willing to stop and help.
good,i was a cashier and for a short period but in that time i had no issues with walmart. they have so many employees that they dont play favorites and plenty of manager which make it nice for any help or question you may have.
good,Cultura prestaciones de ley muy poco crecimiento laboral rotacion de personal
good,"as a cartpusher you're required to take care of many things including gathering the carts in the parking lot and pushing them in the store as well as helping customers carry things out, managers were not friendly and they were a bit biased as well as hypocritical. its a good job and pay as long as you stay at work and dont upset any managers because they will hold a grudge."
good,I was an unloader on the meat and produce side of the D.C.   I would unload the truck and break down or separate the product so it would fit in the warehouse racking system
good,They were flexible with your schedule and gave you a good amount of hours. I also liked that an employe was able to be cross trained so it would be fair l.
good,"Good place to work if you do not mind staying an hourly associate. Most people working with the company are fair, but to move up within the company, one has to become a part of a clique."
good,"It's a typical retail job and you get all the pitfalls that come with that, including customers who will not be happy in any way with anything you do. "
good,"working at walmart I gained alot of work experience with this company from dealing with difficult customers ,to meeting new people and dealing with new associates."
good,"Es buena la empresa, hay buen ambiente laboral, sin embargo mi trabajo no era fijo."
good,I really didn't enjoy this job because they only offered 3rd shift and it started to interfere with my performance in school. The culture of the workplace was relaxed but very unorganized.
good,I work only for a few days because I had to moved to another state but in a short time I was able to learn and work in my English. Good place to work while in school.
good,Jobs are not easy and sometimes things may not be where it need to be. i got hired on before the opening of this walmart and was there three months after the grand opening then got laid off
good,Una buena empresa donde puedes empezar a trabajar.
good,"I really enjoyed meeting new people and having a good time on those accident free days, however I feel as if management treated me differently when I took workman's comp."
good,"Very Orangized Company, This company overlooks your hard works.Walmart has their picks and chose n who they wants to move up in the company, its very hard to get a raise and move up in this company if you do not know anyone."
good,"For the most part it was an easy job, I learned a lot and grew as a person. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with, however the ones who didn't work weren't held accountable so the ones that did work had to work that much harder. Management didn't communicate and after a while the job got too stressful and I needed a change and I also finally had a career focus. The hardest part of the job was when we had a lot of freight to work, but not enough coverage to help customers and help with freight. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the people I worked with and strategizing the work we needed to do and seeing progress as we worked efficiently."
good,Always be sure to be in a good mood. Always be on time. Everyone is nice to you as long as you have a good attitude. They will give you as many hours as you want most of the time as long as you do what your supposed to.
good,"Decent pay, decent workload. Not too challenging, other than the occasional customer or manager in a bad mood. Overall, not a bad place to work (depending on your department)."
good,El empleo está bien solo que como es por producción (según) siempre te ponen a realizar otras tareas y a permanecer muchas horas dentro de la empresa sin producción y obvió sin sueldo que cobrar por ello. Y a hora su nuevo sistema de pago por venta pues se complica mas la jornada laboral así.
good,"I would definitely recommend working at Wal-mart at least once in someone's life. As it does teach good work ethic and skills that will stick with you."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, tem bom benefício para funcionários."
good,"Overall, none of the jobs I have had were bad. Generally the other associates were nice. Main issue was being told different things by different managers that conflicted when it came to work."
good,"The job was very hard, but I did it, me being a women, I would have liked to move in to something lighter, I did learn how to drive different forklifts, start up meetings, run doors, slot, unload trucks"
good,Empresa lider en tiendas de autoservicio con reconocimiento internacional
good,"The company itself was really good to work for. It was the managers that were running the store that gave the employees a difficult time. We were to always make eye contact with the customers and greet them, but management did just the opposite to the employees that they saw almost everyday. "
good,"As standard as employment at Walmart may seem, there are ins and outs that must be learned, procedures to be followed, and relationships that must be maintained when working in the public.  Walmart offers opportunity for advancement, though the health insurance is costly and has an exorbitant deductible."
good,"Has it's ups and downs fast paced, sometimes it is pretty slow friendly people . Has some friendly management personnel and some unfriendly management personnel pretty easy going there laid back has some good benefits sometimes I work well with your schedule and sometimes they don't"
good,"The job is menial. You come in and do your work for the day and go home. For those who take the initiative to get to learn from your fellow co workers and work hard, there are many opportunities to advance yourself within the company."
good,I really like  working at Walmart  but I had baby and no one to keep her when it was time for me to go back so I resigned   at Wal-Mart I was a cashier  in the front end I loved my job
good,"I worked third shift, so I worked every Friday through Sunday. I enjoyed this job a lot because of all my friendly coworkers and all the spare time I had. Unfortunately life had other plans and I had to move on from this line of work."
good,when night first start we fine out what department we will be working until all the work are done. we sometime help unload the trucks before we head for the department we are sign to.
good,"wonderful place to work at, wonderful advancement available. great pay rate also. everyone is fun to work with and the days always went by quick. managers and h.r. was great with all the employees and always met our needs whenever brought to their attention."
good,I learned how to pick merchandise from receiving to replenish the floor. A very select few of management cared about the employees and did their best to help resolve issues. the coworkers were great very helpful. The hardest part of the job was not being allowed to clock out at the end of my shift. Most enjoyable part was coworkers and customers.
good,"i loved the place, except for the fact that i was being targeted and when i tried to tell management they acted like i never was, eventually i got fired from that situation. i know multiple people who dislike management  due to their lack of responsibilities."
good,Plainfield walmart in particular gave me good retail sales associate experiences. It taught me how to really work and give great customer service. with this experience I hope to carry it into the health care profession
good,"Generally a nice place to work, sometimes we were shorthanded, but made the most of the technian  team members who were dedicated to customer service.  Working on more than one vehicle simultaneously is not uncommon. I learned a lot from the short time I was employed. Many associates at the Tire and Lube Express, also known as T.L.E. , are students at UNOH."
good,Organized Chaos-- In competition with Amazon seemed far fetched to most employees but of course they complied.  The environment does not promote speaking freely.  Still operates in an antiquated environment of fear and keeping opinions/ new ideas to oneself.  Very intense.
good,"A typical day at work can be easy or hard, depending on the size of the trucks every night. I learned that it is important to help customers and to keep a positive attitude. The workplace culture is diverse. It feels a lot like being in high school again, which is my least favorite. The hardest part of my job was keeping my departments zoned and doing go-backs. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers and forming relationships with other co-workers."
good,"Overnight Makes good moeny BUT it's a lot of labor at a high pace. If you don't like to be rushed, I don't recommend it. Lots of heavy pallets that need to be pulled that could take a toll on  your body. But if you;re willing to do all of that, got for it."
good,"If you want to move up, you'll move up, but if you're not motivated to do something you're going to get bored and it'll be incredibly stagnant. It's not a bad place, but being a cashier got incredibly boring for me and sometimes management can really screw over some people. It could just be me who got bored of it however, and that shouldn't stop anyone."
good,"As a previous manager who worked and witnessed all the behind the scenes encounters, the company has some things to work on. They are good for the benefits and thats mostly it."
good,Se tiene buen ambiente de trabajo solo que el salario es algo malo
good,"The job can be rough. Alot of very lazy people working there which you will have to pick up slack for. Difficult to get raises. There is a max pay for hourly associates. Moving up will creat a great deal of stress for you, and lower your days and hours off."
good,There are always bad apples in the bunch. Walmart is full of people who want to accomplish something. Many work hard for families with two jobs and many more responsibilities.
good,Walmart had its good days and bad days. The managers I worked under tried their best to work with your life schedule but were very strict when it came down to working. I'd go back but there would have to be changes.
good,"I loved working for Walmart when I was an associate there. The atmosphere can get a little rambunctious, depending on the store, but ultimately a great place."
good,Wal-Mart is a company that is moving forward quickly.  There is teaching and training going on non stop in facilities. Great benefits. You have to be able to adapt to your surroundings very quickly.  Every day is a new adventure.
good,Good job!  Just don't like how they go about absence and leave of absence especially when your really sick and can't perform your job duties! But other great job to have.
good,"The environment of Walmart is very settle and co-workers are easy to get along with."
good,They were not very understanding about my health limitations... and they made it hard for me to continue working there. The management could be more empathetic.
good,I enjoy working here. Sometimes it's overwhelming. The schedule sometimes isn't fair. Sometimes hours get cut other than that I can't really complain.
good,"It's an okay place to work but i don't see it as a career. Management is as friendly as management can be and co-workers are all nice."
good,A typical day at walmart is really fun and entertaining depending on who you work with. But for me every day was pretty good my co workers were friendly. And management though a bit dense at time were very nice for the most part.
good,The people throughout the store were great to work with and everone seemed to have the same goal for the store itself. The managers also treated each of the employees with respect.
good,"I came in and got ready for my day, taking inventory in my department, stocking any leftover stock. Building displays , resets, taking ongoing computer classes."
good,"If you are not depending on income and are looking for a secondary job, this is the job for you. The hours may sway from week to week. You will be in control of your breaks in conjunction with your other associates"
good,"Walmart provided many opportunities for advancement into management. My typical day was to support any collectables of information by store, provide district P&L reports. When customer or associates had a grievance, their call to district office was fielded by me. I listened with intent, in order to discern issue. These calls were delicate & confidential in nature. Callers knew I would show respect and follow up with store management or HR department."
good,teamwork makes great work. coworkers are excellent. orientation was great. made your warm welcoming and happy to be apart of the team. night time manager most shows no concern for their coworkers
good,"Walmart Was the very first job that I had in my life, I was going to school during the day to finish and get my diploma, and working 3rd shift cleaning the store. I Cleaned the restrooms, floors, back area, etc. to make the store look perfect for the following days. You would be surprised how dirty a Walmart super center gets in 12 hrs!"
good,"Work life balance very imbalanced."
good,"Management wasn't the best but other than that, the job was pretty good. The breaks are short and the work is very intense on most days. It's rare that you'll get a vacation day off."
good,"Walmart was a difficult job for me because I Didn't like lifting heavy items everyday. What i learned from Walmart is that you have to be ready to work everyday you come in. i feel like Walmart was my first real job, it helped me really manage my time and helped me become a more helpful person."
good,"A typical day at work would be going in, Greeting the many workers before moving to my position. I worked in the liqour Store, So i always had to be on survellience. Going threw facing bottles, As well as dusting them so they didnt look to be old. Sweeping the floor 4 times a day or more, Especially during the summer days, Then mopping on the rainy days to keep mud tracking low. My store wasnt the best, But the co-workers were very friendly, As well as management. Even the customers since we had many regulars who would come in just to chat, Or ask about any new Items."
good,Walmart was a great place to work. I actually had a car accident and had to take a leave of absence. I liked the people I worked with. Management was very good.
good,"I was a deli clerk, which was nice because the deli is separate from the rest of the store. Where just off by ourselves, which meant the managers never trolled the area."
good,Management and staff are truely great! Working as a Customer Service Manager always keeps you on your toes from running a register to giving cashiers breaks and lunches to fixing all sorts of fixtures and displays. This company teaches you a lot if your willing to learn.
good,"A typical day included cashiering. I enjoyed being able to get in and immediately get my day's assignment. I didn't enjoy my hours varying from week to week, drastically."
good,"i worked in the pharmacy. it was a good pharmacy to work in. some management was good, some wasn't. had to comply with walmart policies and also pharmacy ones. you got to do several different things while working there. filling meds, working input at the drop off window, answering phones, and checking out customers at the register."
good,The hardest part about working at Walmart is stocking and trying to get certain numbers to match with the right product (without devices). Its also sometimes hard trying to find where everything go with Walmart being such a big retail store.
good,At first i was getting nice hours but after a couple of months my hours where cut and i couldn't afford to work there. some associates that work there where very unfriendly and made work stressful
good,The work environment is wonderful. There was never management there when needed. I started seasonal and became a full time employee. They pay well and offer a lot of overtime.
good,"It was a nice place to work, but they got to the place they wasn't paying me for all of my hours and I worked to hard for not getting pay what I worked."
good,"Walmart was my second job. My coworkers were amazing people, as well as some of my managers. Majority of the time the cashiers would never get their breaks on time. We'd often take our own breaks. Along with running the register, we had to keep up with our pathways. We rarely ever had time to do that. For me, that was the bad part. Overall, it was good if you can make the best of things. The thing that I loved the most was that I had the opportunity to make someone smile."
good,"I worked overnight from 10pm to 7am I learned how to stock, organize, and greet customers. I learned how to do price changes, all the basic retail etc"
good,The work is not very difficult at Walmart.  The only difficulty comes when upper management gets in the way of the workers.  The upper management in general has no idea what they are doing.  The lower management runs the store and gets paid almost nothing in comparison.
good,"My typical day at work begins in the cash office where I make sure all the registers are balanced. If any of the registers are short on cash I research it. I am also responsible for customer service. While working as a customer service associate I issue money orders, do returns/ exchanges and cash checks. Working at Walmart has helped me come out of my shell and deal with unexpected situations. Workplace at Walmart is very diverse. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes you have to cover for associates who call off. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with associates and being part of a team ."
good,It's a fun place to work when you have motivated associates willing to give 110%.When you have a management team that works together to get things done. When instead if going to work your associates and management makes it feel like a family affair.
good,"The work was very consistent. My personal responsibilities were mentally challenging, and a little physically demanding. It was rare that hours were changed without prior notice."
good,good job if your able to move up and good for kids going to school long hours is offer up and fast pace evorment i think its good place to stay at untill you find a better job
good,it was a good company to work for the pay was good the onlhy thing i would change is the way associates are taken care of they deserve more from such a big company.
good,If you keep to yourself and get your work done its a good place to work..But probably wont get recognized by any managers considering they are all either drama or just plain rude..you will find very few managers who are actually good managers and even then those are the managers that get pulled around by the bad ones.
good,Meeting different people constantly. Close to home. Took this job to be close to husband through his medical issues. Low pay. Good management. Very understanding of my situation.
good,We were a Walmart family at one time but as so many managers change in the past 9 years I have been through 5 store managers the best one they sent away. They have lost track to team work and leadership. If your not apart of their click of people then they don't welcome you. So that makes it hard to advancement.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cashing out customers. Management was okay, but I felt as if my manager did not listen to me. The most enjoyable part of my day was holding short conversations with the customers. I learned how to cash customers out in a timely manner."
good,my job was very challenging from the moment I got to work. I enjoyed working with numbers so balancing was very important.  Honesty was all important. I encountered a lot of dishonesty when tracking shortages. I was making $20 an hour with a lot of perks. Good company to work for but unfortunately the job was phased out.
good,Good job overall. Managers treated you well. Good standards. Point system for attendance. Allow 9 min late without penalty. Only thing is the hours you have to take an hour break everyday 9 hour shift and only 32 hours a week so they can keep you part time
good,It was a great place to work! Everyone was super Friedly and my boss was a fair person. The hours were long but making more than minimum wage was nice. 10/10 would recommend!
good,I really liked it there are relogistics the envoirment was cool basically drove lifts all day the management could have been better the job was  a run itself type of job management just over thought a lot
good,"Muy buena empresa, tiene muchos beneficios, puedes seguir estudiando. Tiene un mejor salario."
good,"I was a cashier at this job. Of course it was very fast paced, but I did not like how much it took out of me. They did not seem to care when you had family issues going on. I was there for 3 years and I was honestly glad when I left. Many people don't know, but it is a very stressful job in any position you hold there."
good,"I learned a lot while I have been at Walmart, especially when it comes to money handling. Learning about money transfers both domestic and international has been very interesting. There are so many countries that I have never heard of.  I have had many repeat and regular customers that helped make the days enjoyable!"
good,"My workplace was too friendly ,but i was current with the savings.Trying to get discounts while to robb me.Taking write ups for ms.lethas indesenceny."
good,Typical day at work was fast paced environment. I liked the structure of my job.  I knew exactly what I was going to be doing each night.  The only negative input I have is there were other employees who didn't want to actually work.  I worked overnight as a stocker as well in receiving.  There was a lot to do and a lot more could have been accomplished if there was a more of a teamwork outlook on everyone's behalf.
good,Me encanto laborar ahi pero sinceramente prefieren darle los puestos mejores a personas con mas antiguedad que conocimientos lo cual me decepciono bastante ante  lo cual no me senti conforme. lo mas dificil del trabajo era que aparte de pues dedicarme a la venta de mis productos apoyamos piso y pues es carga de cosas pesadas y bastante cansado pero lo hice sin queja alguna y lo que mas me gustaba es que los socios en el caso de sams club que los socios valoren tus conocimientos y te agradezcan y se sientan conformes con lo que les explicaste y vendiste y despues regresen contigo cuando necesiten comprar otras cosas
good,"for the beginning they will give you a hint what kind of job what are you doing . They have safe place and trained before you start.they alway show how to work safety and easily."
good,Worked as a cashier; benefits were good; salary was good; typical day involved standing and checking out customers when making purchases; overall culture of the workplace was friendly; hardest part was dealing with attitudinal customers; most enjoyable part was learning to work together as a team with co-workers
good,"Buena experiencia laboral , en la que pude desarrollarme como vendedor y aprender tecnicas de ventas , aprender del sistema y desarrollar una cultura financiera"
good,"steady work"
good,"I didn't get to stay long here, which I loved the place and the people higher up. sucks to have lost the job, but no understanding of health issues. unless you have close connections."
good,I enjoyed Walmart as my 1st job. It was fun and a nice environment. I met and learned a lot of people but I was only there until I turnt 21 to get my cdl's
good,The management team were wonderful they always helped when u needed it. The other staff were mostly college kids but nice and very friendly. They would always work with u to try and make the store better. And always gave opportunities to advance.
good,fast paced understaffed no equality for same level positions experience doesn't matter given pto time but unable to use it pay raises not on performance
good,"got along well with management, requires a lot of walking and standing on feet, but it kept me in shape. Upward mobility is fair, but it can be hard to move up as in any job"
good,"Friendly managers and great associates."
good,"I overall liked working for Walmart, however i was asked to do many things that wasn't in my job title. I learned a lot about management as I was able to assist the customer service manager with her nightly duties."
good,"Wal-Mart was always flexible with my school hours, and the pay allowed me to go to school part-time and stay debt free. I would recommend to anyone who is going to school part time and needs flexible hours while being provided with a decent hourly wage."
good,i enjoyed this job i learned my full potential in a fast working environment i also learned how to keep track of my paid and unpaid hours. if the leaders were more into acknowledging their employess it would make things a lot easier on all conditions
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo apoyoen equipo y buenos horarios"
good,The customers and employees were great not so much of the management I think they could do a lot better with helping people out Walmart is a great company to work for
good,Great work environment to meet new and interesting people. Its laid back productive work that can teach you many different skills. You have the chance to advance in numerous different departments.
good,"An Overnight Support Manager assists with leading the overnight team; distributing and coordinating duties, responding to problems and inquires, and teaching/training stockers, and processes freight, participates in Zone Defense offering Customer Service."
good,"Trabajar bajo presión y superar día con día, aprender a manejar al personal y hacer qe todo fluya en tiempo y forma."
good,When i worked there there was just know room for career advancement. So i left. I loved working there however I was looking for a job with more room for advancement.
good,"Working for walmart wasn't too bad. They push you to do work that can seem impossible at times. But it can be fun with some of the customers walking through the store. Those customers can have great stories for you and you can learn a lot about what you are selling from those customers. For example those customers can give you reviews about the products and tell you how much the liked the product or didn't like the product. Management is also very helpful and kind. You can walk up to a manager and talk to them in confidence about almost anything. The workplace is very diversified in many ways. The company is full of people from around the world, both young and old. I'd have to say that the hardest part of the job can be all the tasks they would want you to do in one shift, Sometimes it seems impossible. Another hard part of the job is they don't really train you for your department that you are in. You have to guess or do your best to figure it out. The most enjoyable part of the job is the many people you are able to meet."
good,"Very fast pace environment with people of all cultures and background.  After working as a greeter and cashier, many of the regular customers will greet me by name and stop to chat for a minute or two, which is very welcomed and makes for a nicer day."
good,The job is ok and you keep busy all day and you get a hour lunch break its just that every one is not on the same page from management to associates k
good,"Typical day for me would include people development, interacting with business partners on VMO analytical needs, developing actionable KPIs, interacting with offshore associates"
good,"Overall the job was okay , they just showed favoritism with some of the workers and not treating everyone equally . Some of the managers were messy and always kept up stuff so you had to be just there to do your job and not be friendly"
good,They didn't communicate and messed with my schedule but I did get a lot of experience to work with and made new friends and it was enjoyable except for stress.
good,"enjoy"
good,Walmart is not a bad company to work for. They just need to get somethings straightened out. For example their management needs to be a little bit easier on some of their employees and treat them with more respect.
good,Work was structured where flexibility should exist.  Typical day at work was at one place without change and at times could become monotonous.  Co-workers varied and management was different all the time.  Little conformity.
good,They taught u correctly. Took time to make sure you were able to do your job. Gave you breaks when needed. Managers were easy to get along with. I would go back
good,Learned customer service skills well and co-workers all get along overall. Management is nice and will work with you with issues you may have. Work is not typically strenuous.
good,A good place to work for. Especially starting into the work force. Pay is okay. You get lunches and breaks. Hardest part of the job is sometimes dealing with upset individuals. Best part of job is meeting different people.
good,"Working at Walmart was very fun, other than being on your feet all day. Customer Service is a very challenging job, in a way it tests your ability to be able to work with all kinds of customers."
good,"Make sure front end of store was zone properly, make sure all cashier were dressed in the proper work attire, make sure that the outside of the store was clean and carts were available for the customer. I learned how to use several inventory devices, how to count down each register and proper way to collect each cashiers moneys. Management could've used more classes on how to approach others but  overall good staff. Hardest part of the job was counting on other employees to show up for work, while the most enjoyable part was helping customers with issues."
good,They have friendly co-workers and they management is cool. They work with your scheduling and they are understandable. They also have a diverse company.
good,"Walmart is what it is, but you can get some great deals. It is physically demanding and requires lots of patience dealing with the public who shops there."
good,"Consisted of making sure cashiers remain at a high pace for scanning individual items and also get change for all cashiers in a timely manner."
good,"I review blueprints on special projects that walmart corp has planned for the year.  i balance a work load of approx 250 projects corresponding with field associates, suppliers and program managers to insure the right items get ordered for the project."
good,Es una empresa la cual te capacita adecuadamente donde puedes crecer la parte difícil es el clima laboral con algunos compañeros
good,typical work day was pretty calm and collected there were some days were it was a little crazy but that is part of working for a huge company/store like walmart
good,"Fast pace job keeps your on ur toes "
good,"A typical day at work, clock in and go to my assigned register at that time. working for Walmart i have learned how to be swift on my feet to get the job done. The hardest part about my job was, when i had an angry costumer who started to throw things because he was unhappy, management had to escort the costumer out. the most enjoy able part of the job was helping our costumers and seeing them leave happily."
good,Los horarios eran muy flexibles y un ambiente laboral respetuoso. Ademas la igualdad de oportunidades me parecía na buena opción de crecimiento en la empresa.
good,My workplace can sometimes become very stressful but when you gain patience you learn how to deal with certain situations. Overall Walmart is a nice place of business and they offer great benefits as well as good pay for associates.
good,"I loved working their... Everyone gets along... I worked in the frozen/dairy department. Stocking. Stood long time in freezer, organizing, palletizing."
good,"habiente de trabajo bueno, carga de trabajo minima"
good,"* Aprendí al uso y manejo de dinero "
good,"Working for Wal-Mart there will be great opportunities in career. Hours are great, and the pay is acceptable. Wal-Mart also has great benefits for you and family."
good,Management could use more training. More hours for employees and more incentives. Higher pay for skills done outside of work duties. Company needs more education opportunities for employees.
good,Just work your behind off and you will like it.  They pay you good so you can never say they don't pay you enough for what you do. The benefits are reall good as w
good,"A typical day at work involved checking your emails as well your BPM's (Business Process Management) which is a way we communicated with the store. It also include processing invoices, mtr's, upc's and meeting your production for the day. What I learned from management was that our customers are what matters. The workplace culture has died. The most enjoyable part was having a job, interacting with new people and helping one another out"
good,I do enjoy working for Walmart...but the hours are all over the place...feel like there is no family time. They pay very well. We do fun events for our associates  which they seem to enjoy. Walmart use to be all about family...not so much any more...very sad.
good,I think the hardest part was the customers who would blame us for certain things that were out of our control. Scheduling tried to be flexible but sometimes they were flexible with certain people. Overall the experience wasn't that bad
good,Great company to work for. Associates worked well together to get things accomplished. My time there was exceptional. Would do it again if asked. Thank you.
good,"I would preform oil changes, tire and battery installation on customer vehicles. Skills I have gained are keeping the work area clean, organized and safe place to work."
good,I would unload the trailers by hand ranging from 1000 to 3000 boxes in a set time. Boxes would be placed on pallets by other workers then after truck was unloaded we would take merchandise to the sales floor for night crew and stock
good,Good work place at night  for people that have lots of things to do in the morning or evening time the 3rd shift is the best. Not really busy at night during the week but the weeked can get a little crazy.
good,"I enjoyed my employment at Walmart, because it gave me the opportunity to learn many different skills. I learned to mix paint, cut keys, and I was a customer service supervisor."
good,"My job as assembler was never boring, they always kept me busy building anything from bikes to displays. And when i wasn't doing that i was unloading/loading trucks. When i work there it was a great place to work at as far as the managers and staff"
good,Loved working for this company as everyday the amount of customers made for a very diverse and rewarding experience. The only thing the company itself needs to work on is it's evaluation process! I think an evaluator should axtually work one on one with an employee and/or shadow the person before a proper evalyation can be given!
good,"Otima empresa, tem um olhar respeitoso sobre todos os seus profissionais e clientes."
good,"Walmart provided me so many opportunities, from merchandising to  benefits. I was fortunate to have great leadership that embraced the Walmart culture, endless learning opportunities, great benefits, and a strong 401(k). "
good,"Each day has variation. There (to me) is not a thing such as ""a typical day"". One day, you may be tasks with doing the job of others along with yours. On another day, you may be able to focus on your specific routine. At times, expectations are unrealistic and the home office is very out of touch with daily store operations. Overall, the potential the company has is promising, however, there are several people in the wrong positions."
good,"Room for advancement. Always something different happening. Training while on the job. Worked in cell phone department, so no late shifts. Able to get time and days off when needed."
good,"the job is really good, loved first shift, very friendly coworkers.  Fast paced, advancement is based on if you can get to the computer in the back to watch training videos which is never because they never have enough workers to allow you time so you never really advance.  Third shift was good but you basically have no choice but to be a stocker, freer dress codes on 3rds."
good,"I had first chose Wal-mart because I used to work there in high school and saw that the Pharmacist didn't seem to be very stressed there.  I had a good manager there who cared about me as a person and did what he could to help.  Weeks after I started, the began the $4 program and the quality of the job really took a turn for the worse."
good,"Wal-Mart the actually company is a good place to work for. I actually enjoy working for the company. However though, while there is a wide variety of job advancements there, I find it hard for me to advance my position. Wal-Mart has something that's called Cap Team 2, and I am a part of that team. Cap Team 2 is considered to be the heart of Wal-Mart because the team is responsible for setting up the GM Receiving Room, unloading the trucks, and clearing the GM Receiving Room after each use. We're also responsible for cleaning of the truck's trailer and going out to the sales floor to stock grocery items to it's proper place on shelves. Wal-Mart offer the team 38-40 hours a week with no benefits at all! We're part-time workers, and I find it impossible to move up the ladder because Managers love the production their getting from the team. They don't want anybody to move from off the team. It's either you work as a part of Cap 2 Team, or you're out the door. I have been with the company for almost 2 years, and I strongly wish to seek a future with any company I shall work for if I'm going to stay long with them."
good,Overall decent place to work. Worked with a lot of different types of people over the years I was there that kept the job interesting. Never had nothing to do.
good,"Working for Walmart was like working for any other entry-level job. As a cashier, a typical day at work is pretty much ringing up customers and processing payment methods, then giving back any change necessary. During the lulls, Customer Service Supervisors (CSS), while working the front end to balance the lines, would give us other jobs to do until it picked up again. These extra jobs usually entailed running go-backs back to their shelves, collecting go-backs from registers and then sorting them into their subsequent bins, or collecting trash and hangers from the registers and disposing of them. More often then not, I enjoyed working for Walmart, but management could do a little better not only typing up schedules, but just all around do a better job of not playing favorites with their employees. The most fun I've had on the job was all the inside jokes my fellow cashiers and I had, and how well we all got along."
good,i liked interacting with the customers and showing new products and helping them understand it. i also liked working in the claims department and the customer service desk
good,"Walmart is a good place if you apply yourself. "
good,"It was a real good place to work for get there at night do your job and the coworkers was cool.i learned how to stock food on shelves different ways,i was already good at maintenance.the management wasgood people I respected them.the culture was cool everyone got alone.when we got a lot of inventory it was difficult sometimes but got job done.getting ready to go home."
good,The job is very simple. like any job dealing with people is the hardest part. I did not enjoy having to work with some of the management but the job itself made it all worth my time. The pay is good for the type of work that is done.
good,"A typical day at Walmart was assisting customers as well as doing truck and placing product where it needed to be. I learned how to manage my time more efficiently because at times there was a high demand for customer assistance and at other times there weren't many customers at all. I would say management was okay. At times it was hard to get in contact with a manager. The workplace culture was great. I worked with very many different types of people. Hardest part of the job I would have to say was knowing where to locate product in the back, it did not always match what inventory said we had. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with different kinds of people and new people each day."
good,Advancement isn't the easiest and management picks favorites. It's a really easy job for most departments. Lower management is fantastic. It's upper management that's gives more problems.
good,It a good place to work at it have great benefits. To make a customers day and to see a smile on they face. The  co- worker work together to make it a better place.
good,Walmart was a great place to work everyone in there are team players. the managers are great people the work with your schedule. you have room to move up in the company.
good,"I enjoy working for Walmart, lot a work most of the time because of customers, but after all I enjoy my job in Customer Services Desk and Layaway, working as a cashier was fun you get to meet a lot of people."
good,"Avalio como uma empresa boa, mas o plano e carreira é muito lento, e o salário fica no piso comercial."
good,"Great place with opportunities to be promoted from within, however management was inconsistent and expectations weren't always achievable. Learned a lot about the back ends of product distribution."
good,This was an average job for someone without many skills. I left fairly quickly as I had many skills and was able to be better utilized elsewhere.  This was great while I was in college.
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers but the mangers were horrible and training was horrible. Your shifts was ALWAYS different. Your typical day at work depended on the day of the week and who was working that day but for the most part it was easy going.
good,Walmart has been a productive and fun workplace to be in. I learned alot about sales and working under pressure. managers were reasonable. the most enjoyable part of my day while working at walmart is helping customers
good,Fun place to work really easy job. Work around my schedule plus raises. Very good ppl in the workplace  from management to coworkers. Moved out of state found a better job.
good,"A typical day at work included cleaning and prepping machines for use. "
good,"Typical day began with opening procedures, greeting customers, and preparing orders. I was taught many new skills well I was there. The hardest part of the job was having to be understaffed due to non hiring and callouts."
good,I loved working here! I was only there for a temporary job though. we always had fun working no matter what it was. everybody was great! would love to go back to work at another Walmart.
good,good place management was very good very helpful and nice learned a lot about computer stuff the manager was very understanding on anything home or work related was a good place to work
good,"I started working at the Hurricane, UT DC. First off, this is southern Utah and it gets VERY hot down here. There were multiple days that were well over 100 degrees. The building doesn't have any AC in the working areas at all. There are break rooms and offices that do have AC but you're limited to breaks to utilize them. You are hounded for accuracy here. It is very easy to miscount and make small mistakes that you get in trouble for EVERY single time. It is very easy for these mistakes to add up which leads to being fired very quickly. You will work hard here, they pay great, but you're definitely going to earn it. Go for a job that involves power equipment all day here or you will hate it. Management is ok, they try to help you out but like I said, it is very easy to get fired for literally the smallest mistakes."
good,the job security is fine. Some of the employers are good to work with here. communication between employees and management can be improved. Also management can do a better job at fixing employment issues.
good,"Always an associate meeting before the shift got going to let us know what we were in store for. Most of the time it seemed like we were under staffed for our stores size, but that helped save the company money."
good,I like the way Walmart operated as far as scheduling. They always did and allowed shift changes to adjust to what someone had going on outside of the work place and the point system was fair. Very strict on maintaining good skills with customers which is always good
good,"Walmart warehouse was a easy place to work, very many caring people at the work place. Very rewarding on service pins, the place makes you feel important."
good,a typical day consisted of unloading freight from trucks. loading freight onto pallets. then taking the pallets to the appropriate departments throughout the store
good,"A typical day at work consists of hauling over pallets from our designated bulk areas to our shipping dock. After we've hauled over all of the daily pallets we have to upstack the pallets that we can. Example: using our RC lifts to stack a lighter pallet on top of a heavier pallet to reduce the amount of space taken up in a trailer. After we finish upstacking we have to load each pallet into the assigned trailer. Each pallet has at least once label on it which designates the store and batch number the pallet is for. When we go to load each pallet we must double scan each label and mark it with a crayon to show we verified that the pallet does go to that store. At the end of each shift we check our reports to ensure we loaded all of the pallets. Before clocking out we must do our daily housekeeping with includes sweeping and emptying our trashcans into a compactor."
good,"This is a wonderful place for a first job. It's easy, and hardly stressful. I find the pay rewarding and if you want a easy career path to take, I would suggest giving it a try."
good,"Be sure to be on time and don't call in sick a lot. Be available when ever they need you. It is a good company to work for they have benefits bonuses, they give you lots of trading in whatever department you work in."
good,"WalMart is a good company overall to work for. There are great people to work with, there are a lot of different departments to work in.  It is one of the largest retailers in the world and it can be hard to not have Thanksgivings off ever."
good,The hardest part of being a cashier at Walmart was that you always got pulled from dept to dept me being a cashier only made it difficult because I knew very little about other departments.
good,"Excelentes colegas pero poco tiempo para almorzar."
good,"I have worked there 2 years and my experience has been ok. I do not think I could make a career out of it, because the labor is tough but its not impossible to do."
good,Walmart is a great job to have . The pay is good . The managers are nice. They give out free breakfast on Thursdays morning .The associates are kind..
good,Walmart is a pretty  decent place to work at.  Customers can be rude sometimes. But overall it's smooth. We stay busy as a company  especially on holidays.
good,I have been with Walmart for 9 years and this store is by far the most chaotic store I have ever worked at. The upper management doesn't have a clue what they're doing and associate morale is down.
good,"mi trabajo me gustaba, lo unico malo era el salario y en ocasiones el ambiente de trabajo no era el adecuado"
good,"It is a very upbeat, social and great place to work. Very busy and fast pace. i got along with customers and employees very well and provided customer service to the best of my ability"
good,"Great workers and customers i enjoyed the experience and i love my coworkers but i didn't like the organization with the mangers management was bad ,otherwise i liked it"
good,- Permet de développer des aptitudes de travailler dans une grande entreprise
good,Working with a company who strives to have their employees work as a team.  Enjoyed working night shifts where there was a feeling of  getting along and working together.
good,"Walmart is a great job to have if your just starting to work and need something to do to kinda get back on your feet, I wouldn't suggest trying to turn this job into a career but it is a great stepping stone for other options."
good,"Show enough work ethic and consistency and you can move up high, and fast. Benefits should probably be offered to more associates-and hours, but they do try to take care  of their own while at the same time making enough to keep people hired! Good Job Walmart!"
good,I was set up to fail! I was given my supervisor position with no training. After that my ZMS and my ASM go on leave around Xmas time and I had no idea what i was doing. My store manger did nothing for me 5038 was a good store but its not no more.
good,I have worked for Walmart for over a year. I have had more downs than ups. The store manager is a complete jerk. He talks down on his employees. He is not just or fair. If you don't agree with him you lose your job.
good,I enjoy this store. I've grown a lot with them since 2013 when it opened. I've came from bottom level to department manager and never looked back. Is it a struggle? Yes. But any major retailer is going to. It's not perfect but its the best job I've had!
good,"Management was understanding and really helped with schedules. Enjoyed helping customers and assisting them alongside coworkers. After working a few months, I got promoted and up went my pay."
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work. Interacting with customers and employees are a plus. Makes doing your job easier. They teach great customer service skills that you can use anywhere. Management are great they help get the job done rather than sit and tell.
good,"One if the hardest things were when we had to transfer a call to the store, the store wouldn't pick up because they were too busy. So that meant we would have to hear the negative remarks due to not being able to contact them"
good,Working at Wal-Mart was most definitely an experience being that it was such a major cooperation & large store you'll for the most part always have something to. With the management you'll rarely if ever catch them not busy so it was difficult at times to try & speak with them about work related issues I've recently was informed that they did increase the pay which was one of my concerns at the time of being employed there because not only me but a lot of employees felt over worked & under payed. But besides that my experience there was good for the most part.
good,"ability to to be able to try out new job duties is great, most of mngmt. is helpful and sincere. store discounts are better than some worse than other. getting hrs to coincide with family life is the hardest part to get control of, but other than that they are worth looking into for employment if you do not need or want a full time job.."
good,"My experience at walmart was okay, I worked in electronics. In walmart, if you care about your job, you'll be happy. There's always room to improve and you can move up or change your job within walmart if youre unhappy with it."
good,A typical day at work is checking in customers and helping them get through line ups quickly and helping them if they have ant issues. Management is very nice and friendly and very approachable from my experience at the two stores I worked at. The hardest part of the job would probably be dealing with upset customers and trying to figure out how to satisfy them better/faster and the most enjoyable part is interacting with customers and making them happy and the employees also make it a lot better.
good,"Working at Walmart was an interesting experience to say the least just based on the odd groups of people I ran into everyday at work."
good,I had fun working there as a manager and cashier when i started. The only thing is they do not pay enough for the work you do and the managers take no appreciation of your work with customers or other employees. I got 3 people promotions while i was there.
good,"long hours, multi delivery cargo, dispatched, no designated vehicle must constantly change to whatever vehicle available. difficult working night shift at being able to meet with management."
good,Es accesible a todo tipo de persona cómodos horarios
good,"A typical day at work would be a custom that needs assistance with finding an item, or a custom returning an item. Most days it's usually full of people and the holidays are the busiest. We have more trucks to come in and more hours to work. It's usually a very stressful time of year, but through teamwork, we pull together to get through the holidays very smoothly. I enjoyed working at Walmart."
good,"Answering emails and working on processing invoices"
good,Excelente grupo de trabajo compañeros y equipo para cumplir los objetivos
good,I would come in and clock in. Around that time i would see alot of procrastinating. On the other hand most of the time the job was easy bassed on if previous shift completed thier duties. All in all i would love to work for the company again.
good,it is a decent place to work. not the best but not the worst. something to help you get by with until you can locate a better job.  easy to get through school with.
good,I have learned to be able to work with people very well. I perform many different tasks in the Deli and deal with a lot of customers. I like to work hard but would like to be paid fairly for what I do.
good,It's a great start for a college student wanting to get in the job field and start working. Walmart is a good job that could eventually lead into a career.
good,Hay estabilidad pero excesivos horarios de trabajo y fines de semana.
good,unload trucks and organize backroom and break down grocery truck stock shelves mostly all the heavy stuff and help push cart when needed cause most coworkers are lazy
good,Wal-mart is the nice company to start up but the wages is low to continue to work for long period of time unless you choose to be the higher level managers.
good,"As far as jobs go, it was a good way to gain experience in a work place. I had decent coworkers and attentive management teams. I was glad to learn from them."
good,"Walmart can be a great place to work, it really all depends on who your manager is! But the starting pay is pretty great, if you are full time, you will receive vacation time after the first year. If you are part time, you will receive vacation time after two years. They will usually start you out at $9 an hour, and after you finish your pathways you will move up to $10 an hour.. "
good,"The people are friendly, the environment is nice , the pay and hours are good. The schedules are flexible , the workload isn't too much, and then bonuses are , a bonus"
good,"Ótimo lugar para novas aprendizagem!"
good,Ideal for a person like me who strives to make every customer as pleased as possible. Lacks a little management intervention and workplace tension arises because of it.
good,"It was a good company with lots of opportunity but was hard to be ""found"" to be able to climb the ranks. At the store I was at there was lots of drama and coworker friendliness which I didn't approve of. But other than that it was great. I learned what all Wal-Mart workers have to do to be able to keep Wal-Mart running. I worked on nights and I believe the hardest part of the job was being able to keep up. There is a lot that one person has to do each and every night and it's a lot even for one that has been there a long time. I enjoyed the fast paced work and the environment."
good,"I work at Walmart full-time"
good,i enjoy been a service writer at wal mart. the automotive staff is amazing. the job can become overwhelming at times but with the right training you will be able to overcome workloads.
good,"buen ambiente laboral, politicas accesibles, buenas prestaciones."
good,"once you know what your duties are and you get into a routine you get a lot accomplished and sometimes finish your work early so they move you to another area to help out, which gives you a break and you learn another area"
good,"Over all not a bad place to work to bring in SOMETHING. Always something to do, not too difficult to advance. Hardest part was getting everything done on time when given a long list. But was enjoyable to talk with the customers and hear their stories. Staff is usually always friendly and welcoming as well."
good,"High customer service demand."
good,I liked working in AZ stores. The management team was like one big family. We all still communicate to this day. You do work a lot of hours during the holidays and inventory season. The hardest part is losing good associates obviously.
good,The people are great! I enjoy working for this company and feel if you put 100% into your work you will advance in your career in no time. The culture of the company has changed since the days of Mr.Sam but I believe the company has to change with the changing times.
good,I worked at walmart and started out as s frozen dairy associate. I was crossed trained immediately and enjoyed doing diffrent task on a day basis..
good,"Over all a pretty decent job, you learn a lot and deal with a lot of one on one customer service. You have a set amount of responsibilities you have to get taken care of each shift, you get sick days if needed. Pay is bi-weekly, over time available in moderation if needed. Friendly crew and management."
good,Mi evaluación es positiva. si bien no se puede desarrollar uno laboral mente la oportunidad se agradece y la experiencia es positiva y enrrequesedora..
good,There are customers that are very degrading but there are also customers that are uplifting. The management is more worried about themselves rather than their employees and the customers. The people you work with will it everything a whole lot easier because they work as a team rather than individuals and by doing my part for the team we are able to keep the sales floor up and running and able to increase our sales.
good,"This is a place where your always busy.  There is room to move up in the company. Wal-Mart has benefits for the employee. If your short on hours, just ask if there's extra work. They will give you hours, if there is any."
good,"Walmart is a professional company. The management team is very professional, they handle every situation in a very mannerly way without disclosing any personal information."
good,"Working at Wal-mart have help to improve and broading my knowledge about the retail industry."
good,"Upon arrival, I would be assigned a cashier terminal.  I was responsible for maintaining a balanced cash drawer.  The hardest part of the job was being pleasant and upbeat with persons who were foul mouthed and not pleased with their day.  I learned to be sympathetic and resourceful in finding something positive to say.  The most enjoyable part of the day was having a balanced register, proof that no errors were made during my shift."
good,"too anyone working 3rd shift, I commend you. The hardest thing too do is go too bed when your family wakes up, and only being awake too eat dinner, and leave again at night."
good,Time management skills are a necessity and supervising roles are extremely important. Integrity is a hard quality to find among regular associates.
good,Sueldo bajo ..exceso de trabajo horas extras pagadas con tiempo
good,"Es una buena empresa grande, pero con un salario bajo"
good,"Great place to work for advancement, sometimes a good environment . I would recommend this job for anyone that loves dealing with customers and questions on an every day basis"
good,"Customer Service Associate"
good,"Bit messy at times and working overnight is way better then working the day shifts, walmart provides engaging work with good pay and benefits"
good,During the time that I worked there somehow our wires crossed and we had some miscommunication. Two weeks after I took a week off of work to go on vacation with my father they let me go because I did not return on the day they had me scheduled to return despite me providing my itinerary.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work.. to shop, the people are amazing . The employees are amazing very friendly. Cap 2 is great to work with, friendly Co workers fast paced environment."
good,"Working for Walmart Gatesville was great. People the were very down to earth. Get to meet so many different cultures. Army Based area. I loved the friendly work mates, everyone was very helpful. never negative always very positive vibe. Management always on the floor seeing if we were all ok. Always free lunches in the lunch room. Hardest part was cleaning up but to be expected, just like Kmart here in Auckland, you have good customer and you have hard ones. The most enjoyable part of Warmart, is the workers, Management and especially the customers. Always making sure they say Hi and just making sure were are all ok. Miss them all dearly."
good,its a good place to work if you don't try to move up management can be a hassle and some upper management do not deserve their position watch the managers you work with some know what they`re doing some don't
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is coming in to work knowing that I get to interact with different people every day because I am a people person
good,"A typical day at work starts off really well, until it came to your lunch time. The CSM's would forget to let you go to lunch which would cause you to get flagged. When you get flagged, it can actually cause you to lose your job. I learned how to handle difficult customers, bag items properly, work in a very fast paced environment, and how to make people happy. Management was hard to deal with at times, when you needed them the most, they weren't around to help you. The workplace culture was pretty good, everyone was lenient on tattoos, piercings, and colored hair in the workplace. The hardest part was dealing with very difficult customers, it's not the fact it was hard, it was the fact that no matter what you tried to do they weren't satisfied. The most enjoyable part was making people happy, even if they were having a bad day, I would strike up a conversation with them."
good,"There is a new challenge every day and you learn how to change with different business demands. There are many associates that can be utilized in many different ways, but assembling a well functioning team to accomplish goals is the best feeling."
good,I liked working for Wal-Mart for the benefits and flexible scheduling. They worked wih me in so many ways. If you are not afraid of a little hard work its a great first job.
good,"Interacted with the customers the most, some of the managers were great managers, other managers were disrespectful. Their was no hard part to this job it was a good job, and friendly people to be around."
good,Very easy going. Alot of customers involvement and being on your toes.  Good job a lot of paying attention and following instructions but it is worth it
good,It wasn't a bad place to work. I think the real problem was that there wasn't a lot of communication between the different managers and then filtering to the workers.
good,program driven workplace with emphasis placed on achieving financial targets while satisfying all customer needs.  In a small town this is especially rewarding as you are very involved in the community as well.
good,Wal-Mart cares about their customers being number 1 and being happy in the end. Customer service is a major deal when dealing with certain situations.
good,"mi labor era reponer la mercaderia en sala, mantener ordenado, atender vitrina, ayudar a clientes. me gustaba el trabajo, pero no el trato entre jefe y colaborador."
good,"A very good place to work, people and staff are friendly. The pay isnt as good as it should be but overall acceptable. Hours are pretty flexiable"
good,"Es una empresa que te da todas las facilidades de aprender , este es un local escuela  y la cultura de trabajo es apoyar, se funciona como equipo."
good,Not a bad place to work.  The pay and benefits are pretty decent if you actually work to advance yourself.  If you keep going up to management you can be pretty comfortable
good,Traveling is a major part of the job and it can interfear with the family life. Supervision is a problem because it changes from one day to the next. The best part is the peolpe.
good,"When working at Walmart, it was always busy. Since it wasn't a grocery store, but a supercentre, there were a lot more complications occurring, and a lot more work being done. Working at Walmart has taught me how to handle situations better, take great responsibility for my mistakes, become a more hardworking individual and work well with a team. When it came to management, there were issues that needed to be fixed, but unfortunately weren't. Working at Walmart encourages you to develop the mentality that customers are always right and Integrity is key. The hardest part about the job was handling some customers seeing as a lot of them put up fights for a variety of different reasons. Now, I have learned how to professionally overcome those obstacles. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with outgoing customers, and making great friends in the workplace."
good,Walmart is a great place to work and learn new departments and skills. Pay scale was readjust end which I didn't agree with. They are now trying to keep employees on part time basis
good,"cashier, to Head-Cashier, sold over 10,000 dollars worth of products every week. When it wasn't business, I would ask to stock shelves. "
good,"Good job to have just very sporadic hours that did not fit my lifestyle with my family in mind, and the management is very rude at times and lack understanding"
good,Walmart is a good place to work for they have excellent benefits just too many managers in your ears at one time. Management has poor communication skills at times but there are a few good ones in the company they have policies that are a little outrageous but the people you work with are fun and easy going
good,"A typical day at work."
good,"Running the front end of the store, everything from the cashiers to the cart pushers. scheduling them properly for lunches and breaks . Audits of the registers ( 5 a day ) key carrier to register overrides, cash/management office, alcohol cabinet and other locked areas of the store to general public. handle frustrating situations and defuse irate customers. train new employees, handle lines in the front of store, open and close the store duties."
good,Enjoyable place to work a lot of interaction with the customer. After you do the work in your department for a while you can always transfer to another so you never get board of the same stuff. Overall great interaction and enjoyable place to work.
good,All around good place to work and gain experience with very diverse backgrounds and job opportunities that anyone can benefit from.
good,Going in and getting everything required done. I have learned how to work hard and to be responsible. I have no problem with anything and i am willing to do anything that needs to be done. I love everything about my work.
good,"Loved the job, just didn't get very many hours.  It was during seasonal.  It would be a good job for someone young and doesn't have to depend on a job."
good,"My review may be different from all other Wal-Mart's super-center or otherwise, "
good,walmart employees are great people but they never seem to give their best because they are under paid and under appreciated.
good,"es un día movido, se aprende muchas cosas en la empresa, es cosa de involucrarse en el área de trabajo, la gerencia es accesible."
good,This company offers lots of opportunities for advancement in so many different areas around the world.  Plus the contacts that you can make and learn from are not offered anywhere.
good,"Every day at work was pretty busy all the time, we had to be ready to help the customers. When I had to work in the cash office was some how a better day for me, but at the same time I had more responsibility. I learned several things, accounting is different than working as a receptionist. It requires more abilities from your part, more attention to detail, agility to think faster, a better concentration, math abilities, etc. "
good,"My day at work are excellent "
good,Days went by fast. learned to be a more social person. Management was great.Very happy place to work for .The hardest part was being in a freezer.
good,"Nice work environment, but sometimes get flak from other employees. I wasn't there for long but I didn't really feel motivated to stay."
good,"I worked as a stocker and now I'm a cashier. The managers work with your schedule if you're a hard worker and show effort, they will work with any event happening in your personal life."
good,They were a good company to work for. They paid extra to work on Sunday and paid holiday pay. They would try to accommodate your schedule.
good,"Walmart is a very tedious job. They kept me on my feet from clock in to clock out. I like that, it makes me enjoy work because it fly's by quick. I dealt with custumers everyday from simple questions to helping load there vehicle. I left there due to me not getting enough hours. Some weeks i would work 35 hour's and other's 7 hours. I started doing under the table jobs and had a better cash flow."
good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar, onde tive a oportunidade na área administrativa e gostei da experiência. Consegui me dedicar e obter novos conhecimentos."
good,"Routine schedule, steady hours. Training was very thorough, typically your first full week will be completing computer modules and safety training.Work benefits were great, excellent vision and dental plans."
good,Sometimes are overworked for the pay that they give you.  The hard labor makes it worth it though and you leave work knowing you put in an honest days work.
good,job is a decent job for someone beginning. there's sometimes a possibility to move up. you just have to stick with what youre doing and what you want to do. time will tell.
good,"fast pace job, seasonal changes months in advance so we have to be sure were keeping up with it, management is great & willing to work with your schedule"
good,"wal-mart is a great place to develop a person work and communication skills with people. Understaffing issues negatively affects all parts of their business. However, Walmart has increased their minimum hourly rate with hopes to attract more committed employees, and retain better employees."
good,The pay was better than most Walmart stores ($12.00 for cashiers.) Management was knowledgeable and cared about the employees. The hardest part of the job was making the schedule work with my other job.
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, Y el trato walmart es una compania multinacional q cumple con las expectativas tanto del cliente como la de los asociados"
good,I like working to Walmart it's just to much jealousy & messy managers that don't wanna see the next person doing good. And when you take it higher up nothing is done about it. It's sad but true .I do like the fact that we're close at 12am this store is not a 24 hr running store . You can get your work done & go home on time.
good,"most positions are great for unskilled workers, low level supervisory positions can be stressful during holiday seasons due to lack of support from management. movement in the company is relatively easy."
good,"Working as a team to accomplish a goal is so rewarding, never feel like I am stuck in one place always have opportunity to advance in the company. So thankful for all that I have been taught through my years with the company."
good,The oppurtunity to work in veriouse work environments with diverse working conditions. I learned to keep my leading style flexible to aid in growin the team. I had to be a strong leader due to the fact that the job changed locatoins and teams every three months. I felt the job was challengin but truly rewarding.
good,"Started working with company and seemed great to start with but soon realized that management doesn't really care about the employees, Amazing benefits though"
good,"worked on schedules, yearly reviews, merchandised the store.Helped at the tills when needed. worked in the backroom organized it . hired my own staff was with the company 10 years"
good,Apollo de mis jefatura directa en los requerimientos que solicite.
good,I always tried to stay busy. Learned how to do my job at that time. the job was not hard and management was okay. Helping my customers was the best part of my day when I worked at Wal-mart.
good,"A typical day? Clock in, do your department work. "
good,They were very good people.They looked out for everyone. They also had good benefit's for us as the workers.They also gave us free lunch.We were paid good every 2 weeks.Everyone got along with each other and also we had short breaks. We worked as a team like we were supposed to do.
good,they don't pay you the work you do. Different manger will tell you to do things differently. management is kind of messed up it took more than a month to change the availability. there policy is to hire more people and give lesser hours.
good,"Great place to work depending on the department. Management team could be a whole lot better. Overall it's a good place to work, just make sure you have plenty of patience."
good,"Work is generally easy and coworkers are very friendly. "
good,"The starting wage has gone ups bit in the past few years and the company does a good job managing a team oriented staff. However, unless you're willing to give all of your time and energy the work place it will not be a fun experience. They only hire workers with open availability and schedule them all over the spectrum and the management is careless and not disciplined well."
good,Colegas de trabalho auxiliam uns aos outros mas a gerencia totalmente desencontrada e sem autoridade.
good,"Supervisor works with me for the hours that are right for me."
good,"I liked working there, but not really on 3rd shift. Wasn't a whole lot to do in the maintenance area on overnights. Everyone was nice though and showed lots of team work whichever helped alot"
good,"The work at Walmart is interesting.  If you are a self starter and can keep on task, this is the place for you.  There are many opportunities and room for advancement."
good,Muito bom o respeito profissional . Ambiente agradavel.E o átrio bom
good,"You definitely stay busy working here. "
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, de porte grande, oportunidades para desenvolver um bom trabalho em equipe."
good,Always on the move and loved my customers and my co-workers. Very good company to work for but not a idea life long employer. Management could have been more professional.
good,"loved it , pays in not very good its was really great pay was not very good but the people are nice to work with. I would work again . nice place , good lighting"
good,I learned time management along with inventory control in a fast paced environment. I also learned how to assist customers and also complete my task for the day simultaneously.
good,It's an OK place to work but very limited opportunity for advancement! I love the people that work there and the money is OK but would like an opportunity to go up in the company.
good,My experience working at Walmart was rewarding. I was given the opportunity to move up with the company. My first line supervisors were very helpful with training. The only set back was when my transfer had been approved but not honored leaving me unemployed
good,"Outside of inept upper management (promoting kids with no knowledge or work ethic), the job is steady and quite enjoyable. The coworkers really make a difference."
good,"Easy but worked at a fast pace. Never really time to stand around, and if you had time you are to stock the shelves, pull forward the merch. Assist the customer in any way you could. Quick learning Point of Sale system. Some times the customer's would be worth dealing with."
good,Job is a great opportunity. Fairly easy to receive an advancement. Your associates is what is going to make or break your opinion of the job. work/life balance in my store is fairly poor.
good,"A empresa possui ampla condição para promoção, o acesso a gerência é livre, ambiente saudável para se trabalhar."
good,"entrei na empresa sem muita experiencia,mas ao longo dos anos em que trabalhei aprendi muita coisa boa que levarei para outras empresas com certeza."
good,The employees are required to deliver the 10 foot rule before providing customer service. Busy environment with people coming in and out of the store therefore employees are aware of dangerous situations that might cause accidents.
good,Excelente en mi periodo de trabajo desenpeñe mis conocimientos y habilidades y aprendí mucho como otros aprendieron de mi así mismo trabajar en equipo
good,"Wal-Mart was my first job, and in my opinion, it is pretty enjoyable, it is very befitting to my schedule and most important my personal needs. If I needed to be off on a specific day, I mostly got the day off. The best part of working at Wal-Mart was meeting great people, coworkers and customers, that you will always remember for a lifetime,"
good,"Una empresa con todas las prestaciones de ley, pero con un mal salario."
good,"good entry level or second job.  loose management oversite. you hear from them once every six months. strict work schedule.  good people, a lot of free lunches"
good,"Aprendi a boa comunicação com os fornecedores , e trabalhar em equipe."
good,I wasn't there very long. Life happened. however management was understanding. there where very slow times and very busy times i was a cashier. i enjoyed meeting new people and realizing how different people can really be.
good,"learned about binning and picking freight unloading trucks "
good,I enjoyed my workplace and the jobs that were assigned to me were good as well. There are some issues with their employees being young and irresponsible. This is why a lot of people loose their jobs because of the immaturity and the way management do not take charge of different situations. They also switch up hours.
good,"Walmart is a pretty secure job as long as you do everything they ask you to. Some managers, ones with a much higher position within the company often use store managers and assistant managers to run personal errands. Such as ordering and picking up Milk Of Magnesia at the Walmart pharmacy's because they didn't have time to themselves. They have higher expectations than what the stores can handle and fire people for certain things when they leave the store on ""auto pilot"". Some managers are really lazy and depend on the associates to run the store and make decisions that they should."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for however, recent events and shifts within the company makes one feel as if job security is very uncertain."
good,It was a good company to work for really had good times there but my opinion the management team could be a lil more supportive towards the crew maybe work a lil harder
good,"When I worked, there was a lot of drama in the front of the store. Many workers acted like middle schoolers and nothing was done about it. It was easy and the scheduling was nice."
good,"I enjoy working with my co- workers everyday the team work made the the day go by smoothly.I had the best co-workers,we enjoyed working with each other and getting the job done."
good,"I was employed by Walmart for 3 years.  In that 3 years I applied for numerous advancement with no luck! "
good,Was a good experience and fun job. learned a lot that i will be able to use in my career growth. I would recommend going back to walmart because is a fun place to work.
good,"Enjoyed working with Nurse Practitoners and assistan with the clinical and administrative duties "
good,"I was a good worker, I would come in on my off days, I would work anywhere and I cushioned new employees, I would work early or late, my experience was a good one"
good,"Walmart has a current reputation for drastically underpaying its skilled employees I.E pharmacy Techs. However i learned its not always the case, really its all about location. I work in a walmart market place in utah and a licensed tech makes at least 15 hourly there. Not really any benefits and its always crazy busy but the pay is not horrible and my boss if pretty cool."
good,This is a good job if you are starting out or are in between jobs. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement. And the pay is good for a first job.
good,"good place to work, great customer service and good hours and pay and i worked around my normal life and schedule, easy and simple work. not a lot of action or physical work other than bagging and stocking"
good,"Spent almost four years there.  Loved customer contact.  Built friendly relationships with customers and employees. Come in daily and keep busy. Just work to your potential you look good in eyes of important figures. Hardest part of job was constant change of authority,"
good,"Management seems to not care about anything but numbers "
good,"It is a good place to work, they just didn't let me work the hours I needed to make the kind of money I needed. Advancements for upper positions was very slow."
good,"Siempre tuve buena comunicación y trato con mis compañeros y con mi jefa que era la Gerente del área, nos apoyábamos en cuanto a trabajo, la capacitación que me dieron para aprender el manejo del área de farmacia fue muy flexible, aprendí a elaborar pólizas en macros, manejo de sap, cartera de clientes, trato con el cliente y en la parte mas difícil cuando se empiezan a hacer los cierres de mes, trabajas bajo mucha presión."
good,"Good company for advancement and growth, loyal customers and Stable management. Tuition reimbursement, Health insurance, Medical dental."
good,"Worked here for about 3 years loved the job and loved what i did their"
good,"Easy"
good,"Overall WalMart is a great company to work for, they offer a 401k plan and also the opportunity for associates to buy WalMart stock directly though paychecks."
good,great first job for a teen. Most employees were nice and customers were easy to get along with. There were quarterly bonuses for employees who were employed for longer than an year. Working schedule was inconsistent.
good,"order and inventory management, seasonal features, finish third shift stocking and cleanup freezer. account for all inventory by insuring counts and binned in with handheld. need to be able to work alone and get the job finisthed. hardest part of job is zero degree tempature to 80 degree."
good,A typical day at work would be to greet customers and give amazing customer service. I've learned how to work with all types of customers as well as associates. What I love about the job is its really nice to meet new people.
good,I enjoyed it till I got 7 months pregnant then i started to swell and i felt like I was working all the time. my manager was awesome and so was the other the associates they helped me and looked out for me all the time
good,"Un muy buen ambiente laboral! "
good,Started as apart time and was able to advance to management . Company wanted more relocation which I was not able to do. great training programs . Highly enjoyed.
good,"I've learned a lot from them. They have a good starter training. Management is good. My co-workers are fine, they are friendly too. I enjoy helping customers. Same level coworkers sometimes acted like they are my bosses though they're not. The busiest days are Fridays and Saturdays. The hardest part of my job is to deal with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part is when I make people happy and satisfied with my service offered."
good,"the job may be challenging at times as all retail is. however the staff in the store i work in is very close. The hardiest part of walmart would have to be the under staffing and cut backs that take place, also the massive mess that we spend all day trying to clean."
good,"The work is good, the pay and benefits are very good. The management left a lot to be desired - they will push you until "
good,"Retail work may not be the best answer, but for me personal, I do believe it's given me the appreciation that is of a desire to further my education. Wal-Mart has helped me financially through school, and continues to help me progress through the new program that the company has implemented only in select stores."
good,Cuenta con una cultura extraordinaria y procesos administrativos que apoyan el desarrollo de su gente.
good,"Great experience working with custoners most are generally nice, and working outside gives a nice flow to the day. Computer program designed to take customer information, was very easy and fast."
good,"The End Of Breakfast and Lunch Rush On Weekends, depends on the crew members and management team that are there that are willing to show great teamwork and effort"
good,"This wasn't my first job but it gave me an entirely knew outlook on customer service and employee appreciation."
good,"Walmart was one of those jobs that it is what you make of it. If you work with your managers and get your job done it can be a decent place to work, with positions available for advancement. Ever store is very different as this will change your managers and coworkers. Your experience will as be very dependent upon what department you work in. The hardest part is dealing with the customers who expect the world to be handed to them."
good,I was working long time in that company my relations with the coworkers was exelents  I leavethat job because i move to Florida
good,No comment I have don't have a life with Walmart retail!!!  Every holiday is spent in Walmart and you never get to spend anytime with your family.
good,"Walmart, like many places had its problems between the employee's like many places across Canada. They mostly had small communication errors and the occasional mistake in orders that slowed down the work load quite a lot. For the most part it was a well working place and if you asked someone for help they may or may not help you depending on the condition their department was. I always tried to help out whoever asked for it if I was available."
good,Not a high skilled job relative to others. It requires alot of patience and focus on time. You'll often be performing much more than what you're hired for.
good,"Good environment, great managers, fun work. Working full time and not being able to cut hours or switch departments for 90 day probate period was a little rough but the co-workers make it easier."
good,I was hired to perform my daily duties and I am a true team player that gives more than 100%.  They hired me for to do a good job and I have proven on many occasions why I was a good fit in the company.
good,My short time at Wal-Mart has been a great experience. Many managers have come along side me to help and develop me as an associate and it has made a tremendous difference. Store morale is great but the holidays can be very stressful especially in a large retail setting. Management will do anything that they can to accommodate to personal matters outside of work as long as it is not ongoing.
good,"Day at work is all labor"
good,"Walmart was good place to work it just wasn't the job that I was satisfied with it just needed something better that will benefit me and my future, it was a good job just wasn't for me."
good,"Motivarte al llegar y activar a mi equipo de trabajo desde las 6 de la mañana."
good,"A typical day involves helping customers, putting merchandise out, using a multi-line phone, correcting counts of product inventory, and tidying my area. The hardest part of the job is completing all the tasks an assistant or co-manager asks of you. This is because you also have to help customers find what they need. There is also a set time when every associate in the store must stop what they are doing and go help straighten up grocery for at least one hour. Management is usually kind and understands if it is not possible to complete all of your tasks, so long as you communicate with them. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out the customers."
good,Worked here 11 months and I must say it was the best opportunity to be around coworkers that felt like family . Mangers was also great help when you need them
good,"An easy job that was nothing but lifting boxes up to 50 pounds and putting them on pallets. Allowed to listen to music while working. Most of the management was nice with one exception, who had pushed us to go faster, despite the fact we were going as fast as we could. Did not help that most of us were still new to unloading trucks and we're unsure as to where everything was supposed to go."
good,"I worked as a Customer Service Manager while going to school full-time.  Very good with my schedule, though it was tough to get days off for tests and such.  I enjoyed most of the job.  I took it at as a means that wasn't terrible.  One area that needs major improvement is scheduling."
good,"Providing services to people is a rewarding job. I worked in the photo lab and as a cashier. Although the job at times could be challenging and tiring I learned social skills, team work, time management and customer service skills."
good,Typical day started in the afternoon and into the evening. Lots of slicing and temperature gauging. I even got the opportunity to be a temporary supervisor. I really enjoyed working with my original supervisor; he made work feel like nothing at all.
good,You would just sit at a computer all day and type in prescriptions all day and about 2 hours into you would not have any thing to do for about 3 hours I really did not learn anything because I have experience in retail and as I see they taught me everything that I need to know. My co-workers were cool and they where just fun people to be around. I guess the hardest part of the job for me was the typing you had to type a prescriptions every 2 minutes and that was just impossible because everything that you had to do. the most enjoyable part of the job was that you got a prescription from all over the united states and not just Texas.
good,"I worked at 1101 under a great female manager. I might work for her again in the future. My store had great employees easy to get along with, managers pretended they *had*to toe the company line but usually let you slide when they absolutely could, as long as you worked hard and kept your nose clean"
good,"A typical day at work would be punctual arrival, receiving daily objective and tasks from the manager, observing the condition of my work space and  and completing tasks as well as daily up keep of the fresh produce section of the store. "
good,"A typical work day at Walmart is face paced and most time stressful. Being able to have patience and hard working ethic is a must. I have learned a lot at Walmart in the past 3 and a half years i have worked there. learning to control my patience and learning to be a fast efficient worker were the main things. Management at Walmart really depends on the manger themselves some are very hard working respectable people and then there are some that are the opposite and don""t have the personalities or code of ethics to have the manager position they do. The benefits of working at Walmart is the breaks and profit sharing bonus. Walmart gives more breaks then most places do and profit sharing is a really nice thing for them to do for their employees at the end of the year. I really do enjoy my coworkers, a lot of them are like family to me and we get along very well."
good,i worked there for 2 years i enjoy it i worked with alot of people and learn alot of this this job help me grow as a individual i learn how to do alot of things i learn how to never give up
good,walmart was a typical deadend job. The pay was minimum wage and required you to work holidays and you will not be recognized for your hard work and effort. The other employees will differ from people nice people to people who hate their job
good,"Friendly staff, nice location, and management is nice. Base pay plus commission on sale of warranties and membership sales. Very customer service oriented environment;"
good,Work day consist of long standing hours but great co workers. The pay wasn't all that great and management was just okay.
good,"I've held various positions at WM. I enjoyed working in the pet department the most. Most of the managers were good to work with, you're always going to have someone you don't see eye-to-eye with no matter where you go. I liked my fellow employees and worked well with them. There really wasn't a ""hardest part"" of my job; just trying to get everything done they wanted you to do in your allotted time."
good,"People say Walmart must suck, but I love the fast pace and the workers are among they where friendly and helpful it felt like family working with them ."
good,I learned teamwork and management. my co-workers are nice but do their work and stay focused. I have fun meeting new customers and helping them find whatever they need. making the store perfect and cleaning.
good,"The company is great but the managers that was over me didn't treat me with respect. My son was born three months early and they never let me have anytime for him, after I put in so much hard work with working over night and being a day time employee. My experience with them was horrible. But I learned to work and do your job because no one cares about the next person problem."
good,"I worked there for almost three years, I loved the benefits and guaranteed hours but management was a major downfall of the company. Too many people want to tell you what to do and how to do it but the managers never really converse amongst themselves to give a better answer. So sometimes their instructions will collide with one another making it hard for you to do your job properly."
good,"Al llegar te indican a que area vas "
good,I help customers fill prescriptions data entry answer the phones and assist the pharmacists with patient help with getting orders out correctly with no errors.
good,"I took the Walmart job to put myself through college.  I worked overnights and studied during the day.  It was tough but I made it.  Certain mangers were better than others.  Many of my coworkers were to rough around the edges for my taste but still most were kind. "
good,"the work at Walmart wasn't at all hard in my eyes, what did it for me was the rude managers. not only are the people with power rude but they also give slack to those who barely work then turn around and write up the hard workers. other than that it was fun and ive met a lot of cool people."
good,"Working in Walmart was fast place and very productive. It was busy but all my co workers was so helpful to the customers, getting them in and out finding everything they need."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work. I recently just relocated  to Indianapolis,IN and would love to join a store here. I love that it is  a place where I can advance."
good,a typical day consists of customer service and stocking shelves. the hardest part of the job is working with the public it can be very difficult at times.
good,I had to stock whatever merchandise came from the trucks from that day. Cleaned after myself and also my work area was kept clean.
good,Wal-Mart needs to focus on management work life balance.  Great company to work for allowing you to run mulitple departments
good,People didint really care about any problems or anything you would be on your own most of the time and nobody really cared the managers there didnt really do anything to help you
good,"My experience of working at Walmart has been a very good one being its my first job. A typical day at work for me is going to the podium to clock in and receive an assignment from the Customer Service Manager. This can be one of a few things, from cashiering, door greeting, to bagging. I know allof the cashiers in the afternoon and theyre all friendly people. My job is most enjoyable when customers are nice and i am focused at what I am doing instead of distracted. The hardest part of my job is when customers complain or I mess up a transaction once every blue moon. I've learned how to operate a register, and about interacting with people."
good,"Très bon service à la clientèle ,de pouvoir interagir avec le client"
good,"empresa de grande valor, respeito ao individuo, mas com pouquissimas oportuniades de crescimento"
good,"I've been an associate with Walmart for ten years. While with the company, I was able to go to college and get a degree while I worked full time. I really enjoy my coworkers and many of my bosses, but advancement in the company is somewhat limited. The hardest part of the job is the endless grind, as each few months presents a new ""season"". There isn't a down period and it is a yearly rush and production quotas are unrealistically high in most areas of the company."
good,"I was an orderfiller at the walmart distribution center. It was a very physical job, fast paced. The job required a lot of concentration, as well as  an ability to stack various sizes and strengths of freight securely together on a skid."
good,"I think Walmart is an excellent place to shop  for family.  Walmart had everything  you could  ever nee for a family. I  have shopp9ay Walmart for years  for my family. I could spend hours in Walmart, because they have everything Icould ever ask for."
good,"En un día normal llegaba, hacía limpieza rápida de la bodega, posteriormente comenzaba a sacar las tarimas de mercancía necesarias en piso de venta, las restantes se acomodan en los racks del almacén, acomodaba la mercancía de electrónicos, en ocasiones iba de asistencia a otros departmentos (abarrotes, perecederos)"
good,A typical day at work would start off cool but it's a lot of complaints  from works and bad attitude   it has it cool day but other than that I'm looking for more mind challenging job
good,The job was great they are a very good company to work for they have a lot of room for advancement. My only thing was I got hired for seasonal work I wish it could have been longer I loved the company.
good,"I have worked here for 2 years and have seen the best and worst, Walmart has to offer, in my experience here at Walmart I have a few things to say. "
good,This was my first job and the pay is really not too bad. Being a cashier can be difficult as you stand in the same spot for hours and have to handle working with CSM's. Most of the CSM's were great to work with and it was easy to make friends in the workplace!
good,"A typical day is clocking going to the podium making she the money in there is all counted for, checking the schedule for the day and making sure the cashiers go to break on time,  making sure there are no big lines.... Aduitiding the registers.cleaning up after yourself . The hardest part is making sure the breaks are takin on time because u don't want all ur cashiers in break at the same time"
good,"The most enjoyable thing about working for Walmart is the experiences and hour lunch ! "
good,"Empresa de grande porte que seguramente representa uma escola, abrangendo todos os tramites e processos logísticos. Como a filosofia da CIA ditava no seu perfil ético: ""política de portas abertas"". Toda e qualquer liderança abraçava esta semântica de pensamento. As demandas em auto giro, representavam desafios diários, principalmente nos períodos sazonais. O aprendizado, a corroboração e a integração dos setores para atingir as metas, pois em um centro de distribuição todos os processos estão amarrados e vinculados a um único proposito; o resultado final."
good,"Fun working for Walmart , getting to see & help people daily makes you feel good. If you enjoy helping others this is the job for youu"
good,"walmart does not hire on as full time everyone starts at part time or so i was told,the work is not that hard but it is better paying jobs out here that's no secret."
good,"Most days at Walmart during my experience was mostly enjoyable, not very slow or to fast. You get to meet new people every day and the environment is awesome and fill with energetic individuals."
good,Ok to work for I suppose it's Walmart some managers are hateful don't know what to say omg let it go through already I know that this is dumb
good,"Aprendi muitas coisas na empresa anterior, fiz bastante amizade e conquistei meus objetivos.´"
good,"Empresa para se trabalhar.."
good,Highly customer service oriented.  Safety and loss prevention very important.  Quality controls in place and followed.  Left the company to pursue better job opportunities.
good,"The staff is, for the most part, all great people. most of the management are awesome too, but the night shift staff is always short so there's always the daunting task of trying to balance job responsibilities with making sure that employees under me stayed on task as well."
good,"A typical day at work is inputting prescriptions into the system. Counting, mixing medications and stocking the shelves.The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my customers."
good,"-clock in"
good,Great place to work. Good management. Low pay. Hardly room for advancement. Higher positions eliminated. Hardest part of the job is 6 jobs for 1 person. Store should hire more people especially to replace those who leave the job in each department especially that the busiest time of the year is approaching.
good,trabajo dinamico entretenido con posibilidades de aprender cada dia mas buen apoyo de la gerencia para procedimientos
good,"Walmart has alot to offer from benefits to pay rate. I also really like the way you get a bonus every 6 months, depending on the stores performance. What's unsettling about this work place is the expectations of certain departments of the store are VERY high. For example: I, a Maintenance associate was pulling merchandise to the sales floor and unloading "
good,I was very fortunate to work with this company. They helped me in many ways with opportunities in life and I got to learn many different departments. The pay was well and I wish that I got to continue working with them
good,Walmart's work place was very constructive. We had 2 15 minute breaks with a hour lunch in between. Every one was very nice to new people and it was a family environment. I learned how to deal with different types people very quickly. My co-workers helped me very often because there was a lot of stuff that is very confusing working behind the register which was the hardest part next to zoning the candy wall. Overall I enjoyed working overnight the most cause there are less people and its not as hectic as during the day.
good,Walmart is a fast paced environment and very culturally diverse. The company is thoroughly organized and has great policies.  Breaks and lunches are provided. Benefits are good. Sometimes middle management does not enforce the good policies that are designed by upper management would be the only drawback.
good,"-Flexibilidad horaria entre trabajo y vida cotidiana,posibilidad de crecimiento y aprendizaje(pase por varias áreas del sector de cajas)."
good,"Overall good stable job. My co workers were understanding and very helpful. Supervisors were always there to help. Didn't like the schedules though, was always high labor would send people home. But overall pay was average, would go back as a second job."
good,Tiene buen ambiente de trabajo pero pagan muy poco es esa empresa
good,The best part about working for Walmart is the people you get to work with. mangement is prety great they could have a little more postive feed back for the employees.
good,"It's a good place to work for. The management is always changing but have some well respected managers there. You would get to work, have your daily meeting with your managers, get your needed supplies, and head to your assigned areas, stock your areas, clean areas up  and leave areas at designated times"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo respetaban tus horas trabajadas, No crecimiento laboral, muy bajo sueldo."
good,I worked in the bakery and it was a very fun experience. I made everything from bread to cookies etc. the management there was a group of really great people who were always wanting to hear any concerns you may have no matter the time or day. I really liked working here.
good,Walmart is what you make of it.  There is next to no room for advancement.  The pay is as good as you'll get in this area.  You've got to be willing to work.
good,"Uma otima empressa a se trabalhar.otimos encarregados, gerentes,funcionarios."
good,doing my job was easy for me because I enjoy doing physical labor like unloading the truck mostly by hand. Sometimes it would be a boring day if you don't get a truck.
good,"Working for Walmart has it's ups and downs, I enjoyed the people that I worked with on my team, but the management was never on the same page with each other or us as a work team."
good,At Walmart all the associates and managers are willing to help each other and are very well mannered with each other. If some one needs help no one will say no and will jump right in to help the person in need.
good,"Greeting the customer and helping them to find what they are looking for."
good,get there set up the computer and line up where the crew  going to work.set up the store. How to do labor for 20 to 30 employee to do deposits for the shifts. learn how to do all the paperwork needed to do as a manager. learn how discipline when needed. they always fun to be around. To run the store when we were short staff Learn new thing
good,Steady paycheck with steady hours. Employees get along together. everyone works together to get the job done and satisfy customers to the greatest degree.
good,"formamos parte de un equipo  de trabajo colectivo q a su vez los logros son también individuales por  rendimiento ,  procesábamos mercadería , armábamos pedidos para distintos supermercados de diferentes provincias ."
good,What I liked about Walmart was that you got to meet different types of people and experience a variety of customer behavior.
good,Managers are not on the same page with each other meaning you will get one task from one manager and another from another manager and then you will get talked to about not doing one or the other.
good,Over not a bad company to work for depends which store you go too. Sometimes you if your salary you can work any where from 50 to 70 hours a week starting pay for assistant is not to bad.
good,The co-workers are great to work with. They come to work with a true desire to make the customers experience a very good one and this type of attitude is very contagious.
good,"the managment was horrible, the pay was horrible for what we had to deal with. The customer service was ok, but it could have been better. They never had enough registers open when it was busy. i enjoyed helping out all the customers."
good,"Really can't complain too much. There's so many different co-workers and management around you everyday which is bliss. Customers literally lose brain cells as soon as they walk though the doors. Honestly though, a monkey could do the work."
good,"My time at Walmart was very enjoyable. I worked in the Deli, coming into contact with all different types of people and having to meet their  demand. I was able to gain more customer service skills while also being introduced to food service skills."
good,"the emopoyees that i worked with were all very friendly, all the staff members. i enjoyed working for the customers as well, made my shifts more enjoyable helping out the kind outgoing community"
good,"Working for this company varies from time to time, however, after 8 years of working with the same company it has become clear that advancement is not easy to do."
good,"Pharmacy=cool"
good,"It wasn't a fun environment all about business maybe because I was was working overnight, I barely seen the store manager it wasnt a company where we was like family and have fun while working it was very dual"
good,i just can say that i voluntarily quit and good experiences work there. i learned just new experiences. nice environment. whoever looking for part time or seasonal job  it  is good to work. it is fun place to work.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of cleaning and maintaining areas, stocking shelves with freight from the trucks. Learned how to do oil changes and how to remove, install, rotate, and balance tires.Co-workers were fun and enjoyable people to be with. Constant work to do but always had fun."
good,"É uma empresa muito boa, fiquei 23 anos com eles,a prendi a ser líder de equipe, trabalhei no recursos humanos,"
good,"Aprendí a trabajar bajo presión y dar soluciones efectivas, trabajar en equipo."
good,"Would recommend to anyone, overall a good company to work for"
good,Walmart is a very fast-paced environment of constant change.  It is a great place to work for those who are excited about change and want to be a part of it.  It is a great place to grow your career for the highly driven individual.
good,I typically would sign in ever day then get to work immediately on my   assigned isle. I am very thankful for the time I spent at this job it helped improve my people skills for dealing with even the most difficult customers. The management was for the most part efficient although occasionally their communication could be off they were for the most part good at their jobs. My coworkers were very friendly and I got along with all of them. The hardest part by far would be getting a very irritable customer. As for the most enjoyable part it was making friends with my customers and coworkers alike.
good,"I really enjoy working for Walmart. I love my co workers and serving the public. My only concerns with my current job is not having a set schedule, hours nor off days. Walmart put me in a position to be a leader and role model for all groups of people."
good,"-Kept a safe work environment"
good,"A typical workday at Walmart was a typical and basic work place. Come in everyday, clock in and do my duties as an employee. The only issue was that often there was times where I needed a manager or supervisor for an override for a customer and they weren't available."
good,Walmart was a good company to work for. The human resources really cared about each employee and worked to help make sure your questions and concerns were met in a timely maner
good,Walmart has a wide range of customers all looking for something . As an employee there I enjoyed helping those people find any and everything they were looking for .Sometimes I even suggested some products that they didn't even think of. There was never a dull moment and even when customers became upset I knew they could be calmed down. By simply being understanding and sympathetic to their needs I ensured that they wanted to return. I believe you should never let someone leave upset.
good,"I learned a lot of new things in that company,that was the first time i worked in walmart and it was a great experience. I was a cashier and i learnt how to use cash register and how to treat customers nicely."
good,"Enjoyed coming to work each day, fair pay. Difficult and complex hierarchy of management, made it hard to get help. Fast moving, working alongside fun teammates"
good,"Working at Walmart overnight is a positive experience ,the work is great the co-workers are friendly and approachable. Staying overnight is a good experience because you learn how too stock and zone departments and you learn different ways of working through pallets full of freight that has too be stocked. The management wasn't really what I expected ,The Managers in charge of working in the office are great but the managers staying with you overnight are the most negative to be around. I had an incident were one of the managers that i worked constantly with would embarrass me in front of my co-workers. Two of the overnight managers would always pressure me and would make me feel less of myself. Constantly rushing me and always criticizing my work and the way i work. They are not professional at all choosing favorites between all of the night crew. I know a lot of my coworkers felt the same way. Getting treated bad and getting ""coachings""another word for warnings more then usual for the littlest thing overall the night managers aren't positive and should be trained in working with associates too make them feel positive about themselves.Co workers are great all friendly and hardworking. The hardest part of the night is the last four hours,we have too finish our work before the store opens with hardly any help.They send help when the store is one hour before opening.The most enjoyable part is when we go on break it is an hour long and is good if you wanna enjoy your meal outside in your car or inside the break room watching the companies tv."
good,"Typical day would be to clock into work, start my day by printing out mod sheets and job assignments, start working on my to do list until its time to clock out."
good,"Working at Walmart is great!  I love my job.  However,  management and other employees can be very unprofessional and rude to each other or customers. I do not like the behavior at all."
good,training position. I worked in the meat department for two weeks.I enjoyed this position. they did not have an opening at this time
good,Great place to work! Store manager was great and work conditions were awesome. The hours are okay and I enjoyed working with customers.
good,"Un día típico de trabajo era levantarse a las 04:00 am para llegar siempre a horario y empezar a hacer las devoluciones de los productos, mantener la limpieza de los pasillo y la mercadería siempre frenteada."
good,"I was pleased to have a job. However; I am  very glad I am in another position. Loss prevention can be very dangerous and the only thing these stores supply is a radio. Very dangerous job, recommend this for only the young and high speed."
good,es una empresa en la cual obtienes desarrollo en corto plazo
good,One of the greatest things I learned from my experience working for Walmart was how to become a better manager. A better manager isn't about numbers and how you perform but rather how you develop your team. To be able to grow together for the better of the employee and the business. Great customer service isn't always just for the customers but also your members working side by side you. I was taught to never delegate something that you wouldn't be willing to do yourself and to work together to get the job done.
good,Walmart has helped me to grow and to become a better person.They are very precise on point with there task and everybody works as a team.
good,"""10% discount on all items in the store"""
good,It's not bad. But you have to be borderline flawless in every position. I've definitely had more good days than bad. Works really easy but you have to be very detailed oriented.
good,"Fast paced customer service environment."
good,"A empresa lhe dá condições de crescimento profissional, onde cada associado é motivado para evoluir. Ali me desenvolvi, eu trabalhava como repositor e participei no processo seletivo para vendedor. Passei e trabalhei por dois anos nesta função. Sai da empresa com a convicção de ter aprendido um excelente atendimento. Dificuldade eu tive como negociar preços, entender e auxiliar o cliente em suas dúvidas sobre determinados produtos, mas no fim deu tudo certo, pois a experiência é um bem que nunca deixa de ser útil em qualquer profissão."
good,Good benefits some good employees a few inexperienced mangers won't let you keep the overtime you were asked to work. So many employees few get the recognition they deserve.
good,"It was an a good company to work for. Need more flexable hours for single parents. Need to work more on there customer service, and the way they treat there employee"
good,There generally nothing wrong with working for this company. The two reasons I left was because (1) you would have different managers telling you what to do and then expect you to get your done and (2) I left because I needed to find another place to work that was within the same organization but is a lot closer to home because I was making a one hour round trip almost everyday. That was just simply ludacris.
good,A typical day at work required you to be a self starter. I always stayed on top of my tasks and I eventually received an offer to take over the deli department as manager. Most of my co-workers were amazing to work with and some were difficult but we had a mutual understanding that completing our set goals for the day was the main focus and we always executed them with high marks. The hardest part of the job was sometimes having a heavy work load due to co-workers slacking or calling off for the day often leaving the team one to two men short. The most enjoyable part of the day was talking to a diverse group of customers and making them smile as I completed their orders.
good,"Walmart is a good paying job, but the management doesn't really care about you. They are decent about trying to get you the days off that you desire.."
good,Walmart is a good place to work.  There are many opportunities for advancement and the benefits are decent.  I would recommend as a starter job. I liked it.
good,Ok place to work at for the money. Training of new associates could be better. Difficult to move jobs or get promoted up the ranks in this company. Some managers like to micro manage every thing.
good,Good work environment with ability to advance in company. The company promotes from within which is a plus . The only downside is they don't give enuff work hours to qualify for full time employment.
good,Walmart is good company to work if someone wants to pursue career in retail sector. Assistant Manager and co-workers are supportive and friendly
good,Enjoyed providing customer service and sales to customers as well as photo lab daily descriptions. Moderate difficulty with management and lack of promotional opportunities. Most enjoyable part of this job was engaging with customers and providing information to enhance sales.
good,I enjoyed my experience working there. The convenient location was helpful for my travel to and from. I personally would recommend to any other borderline associate.
good,This is a great place to work. The associate and the management team are very family oriented. Its a good environment to grow and to work. They are always looking for ways to help the community especially veterans.
good,"the work environment is okay. management needs improvement. management is only fair to selective employees."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job being outside interacting with customers seeing people you know co workers were pretty cool
good,"Working at Walmart is rewarding.  Always learning something new.  The hardest part about my job would probably be the under staffing, one day a week I work completely by myself, it can be challenging but I always go above and beyond to make sure my work is accurate and prompt!"
good,long nights constant moving up and down kneeling stepping heavy lifting thru out the night going back and fourth constantly to trying to keep a level head thru the night
good,"A typical day at work would be nothing too exciting but getting our work done in stocking items on shelves. I learned how to stock in a timely manner. The management was not great but there were a couple managers that looked out for everyone's interest and my co-workers were all nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job would sometimes, they would expect a little to much out of you giving you excessive amount of items to stock on shelves in a matter of time and sometimes would give you no help. The most enjoyable part of the job was I got to meet a lot of cool people."
good,Employees were nice and friendly. Everyone worked together.  Sometimes there was confusion about what needed to be done and who was supposed to do it. Overall it was a good place to work.
good,"I enjoy working there all my co-workers are very nice, I get a discount for working there. Everyone is very helping and willing to help you while you learn your job."
good,"Too much gossip, every manager has there favorites, if your not a favorite then they run you or coach you out the door. There favorites dont get coached. Only the mature and ethical managers treat everyone fairly, but they are always the managers who get screwed over by there associates or get screamed and yelled at by higher management. Yeah, pay is prob better, but its not worth it, now that they've drastically cut back the benefits, no more sunday premiums, no more night shift pay differential, healthcare benefits suck and are costly, you are tasked to complete work capable for two or three people, but are required to do it yourself."
good,"*A typical day at work would be arriving at the distribution center in the middle of the night, drinking a lot of coffee before clocking in and then stretching my body after clocking in. After that, you spend about 10 hours lifting light and heavy packages with 2 breaks consisting of 15 minutes and 20 minutes."
good,"A empresa possui uma forte cultura, ética e de valores bem definidos."
good,somewhat typical large retail organization. wide range of various personalities amongst co-workers both good and bad. quality of managers varies from poor to excellent.
good,"Wal Mart is a good place to start out or to retire to. Not so much a place for you to make a career out of unless retail is where you want to be your whole life. Store management is great, but once you get past that, it becomes less about the customers and more about lining their pockets."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy. Some days were a little neutral and other days were busier than normal. Some days were good and some days were bad. I learned to look over the negative attitudes of customers and still respect their wishes. I learned that the customer is always right. The management was ok. We had many customers complain about the management. We was always short or staff all the time and we had long waits. My co-workers were excellent people. I worked really well with them. I got alone great with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was doing inventory and dealing with angry patients. The most enjoyable part of the job was counting and filling prescriptions, customer service, answering the telephone, and working the cash register."
good,"It was a good place to work with good people. I learned how to manage a store, delegate jobs to certain people, make sure everyone was working safe. Hardest part of the job was being short staffed some nights and still trying to make sure the same amount of work got done as it would on a full staff night."
good,"Great company to learn and get a feel for how retail can be fast paced, competitive and process driven. I was able to obtain skills in business plan development, budgeting, great people skills working with all walks of life and cultures. With so many different avenues of business operations with other companies I was able to create a lot of great working relationships with vendors and merchandisers."
good,Pretty standard job. lots of work to do and plenty of stress. But the pay was always steady. Management was tiresome at best. hardest part of my job was staying on top of everything I was delegated to do.
good,Walmart is a very great company to work for and i would recommend it to anyone. I like that the staff is so hands on and they are helpful.The ability to interact with the customers and meet their needs is one of the most satisfying experience of being apart of such an amazing company like Walmart.
good,"I enjoyed my job here and most of my co-workers but some managers were rude here.  The managers were not very understanding with family and scheduling."
good,"I loved this job, but I cannot work with them if they cannot work with my schedule. But other than that its not bad place to work."
good,"While Walmart is often criticized for unfair treatment of employees, unrealistic expectations for workload and notoriously low compensation, I must say that this is the only retail job where I came close to making ends meet. The work environment can be somewhat toxic and filled with frustration but they pay an almost livable wage and the in-store management is friendly, professional and, in my experience, concerned for associate welfare. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing friendships with coworkers and customers."
good,It was a fast pace type of job great place to work as long as all employees has respect for the individual. The productivity was good a majority of the times and a few times we didn't do so good with sales for the company.
good,"Overall the mngmnt was friendly and fair, but there was so much time and employee manpower waisted completing tasks only to tear them down and change the entire floor plan"
good,"for the first store i worked in a typical day would start with a meeting then start on are first sweep after that i would go outside to get propane for the buffer then hooked up the propane and whent to break. after 15 minutes had passed i got up and then started buffing by the registers then worked my way to hba, sporting goods, tle,toys,electronics, photo lab, then grocery.after the store was buffed i would go do the bathrooms/break room and then help with the last sweep"
good,"I would check on people's tires, check them out along with their tire checkout."
good,"I had a blast working at Walmart, but employees health and family life greatly suffer in more ways than one."
good,I liked the people I've work with its always fun and different everyday.  I'm looking for something different to do with my life it's time for me to leave Walmart.
good,Nice place to work for a temporary job. Doesn't give workers enough hours. if you want a part time job this would be great. They don't work with your schedule too well either. but it would be a great part time job.
good,"helped customers, rang them up, cashed checks, money orders paid bills and returned items. "
good,Would always be early or on time for work. I learned it is a fast paced job. Management was easy to talk to. Co-workers were nice to work with. Hardest part of the job was to leave your children to return to work after being a stay at home mom.
good,"Great work environment. Managers work with you and try to help as best as they can. My days usually went pretty fast, vary few bad days. reasonable work hours."
good,It's alright place to work too hard to get any holiday time with family pay is decent for retail but if you are good at what you do they do not want to help you move up in the comoany
good,Nice staff that where willing to help. Front end head cashiers where efficient . Made some friends and alway had regulars that came into my line each one of them sweet.
good,"I had a wonderful boss who was always kind and understanding. He always made time to teach me product knowledge whenever I asked. The hours were very flexible around my full time job, staff discount was great."
good,Great place to work but management sucks. I loved this job but my manager constantly rode my back about not being fast enough.
good,"Overnight shift, so set schedule, your duties are set and you know what is expected of you. Sleep schedule will not be the same if you aren't used to being up late and sleeping through the morning until early afternoon."
good,"This is a more serious job than it makes itself out to be. Wal-mart is a very large corporation that has a lot to back. If you do your job and don't go out of your way to be obnoxious, you'll find this to be a very fun and relaxed job with lots of potential to turn into a career."
good,There were many task but once you get the flow of how the company works it becomes a walk in the park. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we have team huddles and everyone voice gets heard.
good,"A typical day at work it's busy and fast, I've learn more about working with people and helping people out. Being friendly, the management is very helpful and kind I can go to them about any thing. My co workers we work together help each other get the job done. The hardest part of my job is really not in quick and fast on everything fast learner. The most enjoyable part is the coustomer I love to make them happy and see them smiling."
good,u will unload anywhere from 1 to 2 trucks a day with anywhere from 1500 to 3000 pieces pull pallets to sales floor stock shelves. people you work with are great to be around management loves u as long as u do your job and show up every day
good,Company provides for advancement if associate desires. Have very high end computer and inventory systems. Most tasks are able to be completed via internal systems and internet.
good,"I worked with a great group of people.  We worked hard at keeping our area clean, safe and zoned correctly.  I learned Walmart's policies for zoning and safety procedures.  The management was a group of helpful people."
good,"Fun and productive people to work with except management, coworkers sharing information and knowledge with one and another."
good,Work load average. I learned how to work in a public environment on a sales floor to be friendly and curtsey. Managers are honorable. Suitable co-workers. Hardest part of the job running a 200 degree propane buffer 6 to 7 hrs. a night.
good,"I loved working at walmart as a Department Manager, the work was rewarding and never boring. On the other hand it is a labor intensive job with unrealistic expectations many times, and for college students the Department Manager position is doable but the work will wear on your body ."
good,"Was an excellent place to work. I took on extra shifts all the times. Then due to illness in the family.... they stated that it was the final straw and let me go. Huh, I was working everything day and every time they asked for additional help."
good,"This Wal-Mart is a great place to find an introduction into the workplace setting! They have very seasonal waves of customers and are willing to hire extra help to handle the extra workload. However, you do still feel the workload at these different times of the year which I feel makes it a great place to start working. Most employees seem to be hired during these times, so you jump into a fast-paced job with lots of other employees learning like you. After the initial rush, things will seem to slow and you can find a comfortable pace for your work days."
good,The managers are very helpful to you as the sales associates. They helped me really well in my training. Costumers were easy to handle.  My work was easy to do.
good,"I used to live down the block from my job. It was a very short commute to work but as soon as i clocked in, it was straight to business. My co-workers were very fun to work with and I didn't have any problems with my managers."
good,"I delivered papers around the local surveys,only worked with my family. The hardest part was when we actually had to prepare the papers, instead of sending ready to be delivered to the houses."
good,"Walmart can be a great place to work if you're self motivating and hard working. Though there are always a few managers who will always expect more than is humanly possible. Some will step in and help or train others in order to improve the team, but those are far and few between. i have learned good skills as far as dealing with a stressful environment. as well as how to work with customers and coworkers to achieve a goal."
good,"A typical day at work is a lot of labor but fun. Ive learned how to interact with different people great customer service. The management at my work place was ok I barely knew most of them. My co-workers were the best good team work. The hardest part of my job was clocking out , I could'nt wait for the next work day. The most enjoyable part was my customer the different personalities and making sure they was satisfied with my performance and puting smiles on their faces."
good,"Muito bom, trabalhei tanto na portaria principal como na área de carga e descarga, aprendi a ser muito mais observador ,a conferir as cargas e notas fiscais"
good,The company is strong and growing. I learned a great deal from my fellow managers at the location in Auburn. Over all my time with the company was a great learning experience.
good,"Everyday at work was meeting new people and assisting them. There is nothing better than having a smile on another person's face. Every coworker gets along and there are so many warm and caring people there that love everybody."
good,Sometimes you may feel that the managers have favorites or move those more because of race/ethnic background. You have to take in customers attitudes but try to help them adjust their attitudes if they seem to get a little out of control. Just doing our best to please and help customers and maintain what the store needs and stuff.
good,i like working at walmart. great experience just want a better job and more money. walmart managers at not as nice as they should be. they don't treat everyone equal.
good,"A typical day at work at Walmart as a Department Manager would be, working freight, scanning inventory for items that were out of stock, ordering those items, finding out if the Inventory was accurate, filling the out of stock items, checking the schedules, assigning tasks to associates below me. Management is alright as long as they're doing their job. They tend to form ""clicks"" with each other, and when they do, it just gets worse. Also, their communication skills to all of the employees, are awful. But there are, however, a few managers who were AWESOME! Always did their job, always were available to help whoever was in need. My coworkers were awesome, very easy to work with. The hardest part of the job, was getting all of what needed to be done on time, it was doable, but they never gave us enough time. The most enjoyable part of my day, was working with other department managers to complete tasks, it's awesome working as a team!"
good,This is where I honed my skills and attributes as an assistant store manager in a retail setting. The take a ways I gained from Walmart are very beneficial.
good,"A typical day at work involves sorting products, stocking shelves, unloading merchandise from trucks, and pulling out products."
good,A typical day at walmart consists of stocking freight and dealing with customer needs. I learned how to bin and how to communicate as a team. The management was helpful depending on who the manager was. Most of the co workers got along with each other but had problems with the managers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the people working there. The most enjoyable part was feeling like being apart of a family while working there.
good,I like working at Walmart. You get to meet all kinds of people. Hours were good and flexible. Made a lot of friends there. The hardest part of the job was keeping the registers clean. I worked the U scan.
good,I loved working there. The work being physical is what i like i even liked the technical stuff its just the employee attitude that i disliked. they didn't care about there job almost like they thought of it as just a paycheck i wish i could have stayed but my medical problems created a problem with attendance. I learned a lot from working there and i am currently fixing my medical disability to the best of my abilities.
good,"For the most part, Walmart is a good place to work. You can set what times you are available to work, and you are paid fairly well starting out at $10. In general, managers are willing to work with you, as long as there is no chance they could get in trouble for helping you. You know what is expected of you each day, and never have to stay later than scheduled (in fact, you aren't allowed to stay later). The customers are the only fall-back, as they are usually rude and condescending."
good,"A typical day at work would be to clock in a few minutes before or after 10:00pm(the time I should clock in). Make it to the back in the break room for the meeting at 10:04pm. The management takes attendence to see who is here, then assigns the associates their areas for the night, talks about the previous night or any news that has come up. You should finish your freight in an timely manner, clean your area, and then proceed onto the next zone. First 15 minute break is at 12:00pm, then 2:00am is lunch (3:00am for others), lastly the last 15 minute break is at 5:00am. Before and after the last 15 minute break most associates should either be finishing up their last bit of freight or zoning; organzing their section and the store in order for it to be presentable for the morning. Once 6:51am hits you are free to clock out without losing any minutes on your hour  review or if you are still finishing a minor task you can clock out at 7:00am."
good,"Cashiering, managing front line employees, insurance front end is fully staffed inside and outside the building. My job consisted of employee scheduling, distribution of money needed throughout the store,"
good,"I learned what is was like to run the front end of a 100 million dollar store. Stressful, 2 many chiefs and not enough indians. You would do something your told then the next person would say that was wrong."
good,Negative... high turnover. High pressure due to lack of competent assiciates. No positive feedback from management.
good,Lo que aprendí fue nuevas formas de trabajo y poder hacer mi trabajo mas rápido.
good,"I enjoyed my time at walmart, the management staff was very understanding about my personal situation at the time and why I was no longer able to work there."
good,"Working at Walmart for 4 years, I learned about about the store, especially moving departments as frequently as i did."
good,"Good company to work for, give or take that every company has its pros and cons! Just felt that sometimes there was no room to prestige for certain people. Other than that pretty good working atmosphere!"
good,It's a 9 hour day job 4 days a week.Not very demanding but very strict on attendance and the management says that they are always there to talk but at my WalMart that is not true.
good,Its a good job to have as well as to make a career out of it. Keep your head up when you have a rough day cause sometimes the customers can be pretty rude or mean. You can learn so many new things
good,Walmart is overall an great job as long as you got to work to do what you are required to do and be there as you are supposed to you will be fine.
good,It was a pretty relaxed work environment. I worked in the freezer section and if I needed a break I was allowed to have one. Plus they didn't make a huge fuss when I had to be absent because of all the workers.
good,The job entailed stocking and restocking product.  Learned the department and how to operate a UPC Reader.  My position also allowed me to interface with the customer when they asked for assistance.
good,"Everyone thinks this is such a bad place to work.  I found it physically demanding, but it was never overbearing.  I enjoyed working there.  The people were great."
good,"Ive learn to go fight for what I want & you have to wait for it you go out there & you fight for it, Amazing co workers. I could never get them to fully provide benifets or medical."
good,I enjoyed working for walmart as a cashier because it wasn't all about pricing the groceries I talked to them and asked them how there day was going and was a friendly cashier to all the customer's that I had. I got along well with most of the coworker's that I worked with at the time while working for Walmart.
good,"learned how to relate to customers. learned how to calm angry customers down . zoning, checking out. Receives returns."
good,Walmart was a fun and relaxed work environment and it was a very good job to gain experience and knowledge for the future. The management were good and friendly and the sales staff were all very helpful.
good,"It is a fast paced retail environment."
good,"It was alright, not bad at all. Other coworkers make it fun. Usually short staffed but you'll get the work done fast. You'll always do other job titles."
good,"Working at Walmart was a very physically demanding job, as well as people oriented. Everyday we stocked shelves, straightened up the isles, rearranged the merchandise while helping customers with anything they needed with a smile on our face.I learned a lot about how the inventory is counted, and how the isles are set up in the computers.I even learned how to price items based on whe they arrived in the store. The hardest part of this job was the physical aspects of stocking shelves, and the most enjoyable part was the friends I made in the customers, and in the staff at Walmart."
good,It was a really nice place to work. The co-workers are nice. I wouldn't  recommend this job to a student in full time college because of the hours. Other than that it's nice.
good,"Great job atmosphere, The work was steady with a learning plus. I truly enjoyed helping the customers. Loading sod or bricks gave me the chance to speak with the customer about  their day."
good,This was a good company to have had a pleasure working for.The management was as understanding at times as allowed to be I guess.The work was repetitive as I may have spoken on before but this was a good thing at times only because I stayed busy so the days would just fly bye so fast at times.If I could I would do it all over again except for I would apply to a higher paying position in the chain of command only to be able to acknowledge all if any Growth.
good,"Overall good place to work in order to keep physically fit, as well as interact with, and help customers.  Learned to work as a coherent work group."
good,Oferece muitas oportunidades de aprendizado e crescimento interno.
good,"Can be a great place to work, Employees usually stay long term and even have family members who work there also.I learned everything I know about retail from WalMart. All the was from stocking to ordering to recieving"
good,"a typical day at work is usually us unloading about 2 trucks,"
good,"Empresa de grande porte, pressão diária na realização das tarefas, sendo isso exigindo de seus profissionais maior conhecimentos. Possui processos de desenvolvimento de pessoas muito bons, na identificações dos pontos a serem desenvolvidos, trabalha em busca do crescimento profissional de seus funcionários. Processos internos bem desenhados e dinâmicos, metas bem demonstradas. Gestão diária de processos, bem como apresentação de resultados, e trabalho em busca no atingimento dos mesmos. Devido a rotina corrida por se tratar de empresa de varejo, ao qual existe uma jornada de trabalho puxada, exigia de sua liderança um trabalho contínuo com seus liderados, fazendo ocorrer uma proximidade da equipe com seus líderes. Desenhei meu crescimento profissional e identifiquei qual ramo de negócio gostaria de trabalhar, ao qual lá me tornei uma profissional de logística."
good,Good place to work and get experience.  They tend to take care of their associates and allow them ability to work as they require for work-life balance.
good,"Making sure everything is running smoothly, cashiers have the proper equipment needed to complete their job, ensuring customer satisfaction, handling problems. I have learned the retail business in and out, management is fantastic. The hardest part of my job is difficult customers and returns. The most enjoyable part of my day is meeting new people and helping customers with disabilities."
good,"Typical day of work starts with a meeting."
good,A strongly busy Company.  Working with the customers and associates was a great pleasure. Allowing me to be the Head of the Safety team and Childrens Miracle Network Program was wonderful.
good,I liked working with different people and learning different areas of the business.  It could have been a long term position.
good,"Check how store looks from 3rd shift. Make some floor changes and then Look at paper work. Control staffing, sales and inventory flow. At Walmart you have to be prepared for change. Your team can make you or break you. I enjoy working with my fellow associates as well as my customers."
good,"I did like the hours, and they had worked with me ;hours,and schedule times.  My paperwork and training was read and taught by the manual and computer"
good,"a typical day at work was stressful but my team exceeded our daily goals."
good,"As a part time associate, with just a high school diploma, I make $10.50 an hour. They offer part time associate who average 32 hours a week, benefits, and they are pretty good at working around you schedule if need be. You do know your schedule typically three weeks out."
good,"Walmart is easy to work for and as long as you show up and do your job you'll never have to worry about being laid off.  Unfortunately, there never seems to be enough staff due to associates not showing up for work or just quitting."
good,"I learned a lot during my time working at Walmart. Although I worked in the Electronics, Photo, and Wireless departments, I was frequently asked to cover or assist in other areas such as Hardware, Sporting Goods, Lawn and Garden, Toys, and even the back room unloading the truck occasionally. I was also asked to cashier from time to time when the lines were too long. There is a lot of thing to learn working at Walmart, and although the customers can be a bit of a handful, the experience is very rewarding."
good,You are always moving so if you don't like a fast pace work environment this is not the place for you. But the pay is nice so if your a hard worker I recommend them.
good,I liked my co-workers very much. I enjoyed helping the customers. I have learned one more way to process prescription. I did enjoy working with the assistant pharmacy manager very much.
good,Some managers just seem like they don't know what they are doing but it is definitely a good place to work at if you are a college student or senior citizen because they make your hours work for you.
good,"pleasant team environment, with well trained management for the most part. workload is very challenging."
good,"Though I helped in every department,  and where needed, I did not get the chance to advance, though costantly inquired about moving to another department or position."
good,Its fun working for Walmart and the people are amazing and they are willing to work with your schedule if you are a student cant complain.
good,"Empresa demandante exigente, ambiente de trabajo regular en el formato Supercenter, excelente en el formato SAM´S, no reconoce mucho a los subalternos. Una empresa seria, honesta que ha fallado en llevar a la realidad lo que promulga."
good,"The people who worked with you were awesome. The work day was fast paced and busy, the hardest part of the job was long hours standing. the most enjoyable part of the job was making people happy and seeing a smile on their face."
good,"I arrive to work 30 minutes prior to work shift to meet the requirements for the day.  I am always busy by conducting meetings with staff, taking care of the patients, reviewing patients' profiles with pharmacy staffs and physicians for the implementation of MTM."
good,"A decent company to work for. Fair pay, usually 30 - 32 hours a week. Each day would start off the same usually downstack the freight off the pallets and separate them according to isle. Then we would stock shelves. Management was great and always helpful. I really enjoy working with all my co-workers we usually have a lot of fun working together. Everyone is so nice."
good,It was a good job that let me gain job experinces. They let me work a schedule that let me go to school. the management staff was well organized.
good,"The Walmart work day begins with assessing your assigned department and ensuring that merchandise is in stock on the sales floor for customer availability. Walmart has afforded me the opportunity to work with and grow with team members; to value to the customer experience as one's own; and learn the standard operating procedures for the store and other departments. My co-workers take pride in team work and offering insight to daily operations. Walmart's management team would gain competitive edge through welcomed open communication and executing fair practices across the bottom-line. The hardest part of the job is the lack of time allotted to perform teaching moments with associates to demonstrate proper use of tools and resources for assignments, daily procedures, and training and development. The most enjoyable part of the job is hearing my customer say, ""Thank you. You have been very helpful!""."
good,Walmart was my first job while in high school. This was my first stop in employment and was a good experience for the most part. I loved assisting costumers and being a valuable help to the team. Management did not bother me much and were helping for the most part.
good,"Salarios bajas  y metas muy altas para comisiones"
good,Walmart gets a bad rap for a lot of things but overall my experience for the 11 years that I was there was good.  The management that I worked with was very good and never had any problems. The work life balance is a challenge because it is retail and the customer expects them to be open 24/7 so they need management there 24/7.
good,"cashier, from front to back of store "
good,typical day at work is talking with customers making sure the shopping experience is good. making sure cashiers are trained correctly an making sure work flow is great for everyone
good,Management was willing to work with the employees about scheduling to fit our needs.  Salary wasn't terrible & company goals were usually met = bonuses to the employees.  I enjoyed working there.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at Wal-Mart. The customers were awesome, the management were friendly and welcoming. I loved to help customers with there problems. I worked very well with my co-workers. Overall Wal-Mart is a good place to work!"
good,"Overall not a bad place to work,they are very willing to work with a college students schedule. Staff is very friendly and helpful."
good,I really loved my co-workers. This place of employment was close to where I lived. It was a fast-pace working environment. The only complaint I have it wasn't enough working hours.
good,"Learned a great deal about Walmart grocery distribution practices."
good,Walmart is an okay place. The hours aren't very consistent but a good atmosphere. Managers are willing to work with you but you also don't advance very fast there.
good,"In the time that I have worked at Wal-Mart, I have noticed that there is plenty of promotional opportunities as well as flexibility. It is a universal environment with a lot of opportunity to grow and expand your horizons. In addition to that, it is a great place to start out  when you are fresh out of school in order to gain experience in different areas of the work field."
good,Overall it was a great place to work. Everyone worked with one another to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was to deal with people with negative attitudes.
good,"I enjoy working for the Walmart Company it is the only job that i don't stay in one place, I made friends with people I work with, and a typical day at work is unloading truck and stocking grocery.  The hardest part of the job is a two truck night."
good,"On a typical day, I would unload the incoming products on to pallets and then place products on the sales floor. I would also be asked to use powered lifting equipment in order to move products around the store. What I learned is how to approach leadership problems, to guide a team, how to seek optimal efficiency in the team members I have, and the skills I would need in order to become a better team leader for future positions. Management would typically ask for me to handle more complex tasks and to teach others what should be done. My co-workers came with a variety of work ethics, so I learned how to optimize each of their skill sets in order to help build the team up. The hardest part of the job was picking up the slack of others, as it was expected that the team finish their work before heading home but typically was not the result. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the ability to learn and grow in a position surrounded by the friends I made and the future references I knew I could use in other positions."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, but found very little support for single parents.  The rules and regulations left little room for single parents with ill children who have little to no outside help when children become ill."
good,"It is a very smooth easygoing work place. There is not a lot of trouble, just in certain areas. Coworkers are decent. Management is ok."
good,"I started from a dish washer, moved to prep cook, then up to line cook. I learned a lot about communication and making use of your time. The management was laid back and always on top of things. My co-workers were friendly and assisted as much as possible. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the rush. I really enjoyed when a server came back to tell me the someone complimented my cooking."
good,"This was a wonderful first job. Taught patience and customer service. Somewhat flexible. Advancement Opportunities Endless. Management is hit and miss, depends on the department and the store. High turnover rate."
good,"The job was a seasonal job. however, my fellow temporary staff members did not work as well as me and the permanent Walmart staff insisted that I stay on the job because their sales went up and i took a great load off of the older associates. i did most of the stocking myself and organized the products fast which left most of us with nothing major to do except assist customers which was the primary goal."
good,The atmosphere is always vibrant. Your able to meet new people of different culture and background. The coworkers for the most are people in your own community.
good,Good place to work while you are still in school. This is a good first job for students. You get a good break. Management team could use work.
good,"A typical day will be simple to show up on time clock in, and get moving, along with learning what customers service require, Follow management flow of services demands and work as a team player. With the most hardest part of the job being to have to work alone with a lot to complete, and the most enjoyable aspect is having lunching's."
good,"Co-workers are very nice and extremely  fun to work with."
good,"I worked as a produce supervisor."
good,"la empresa maneja un buen ambiente laboral, sin embargo el salario en esa empresa es un poco bajo para las actividades que se elaboran en ella."
good,"good job .nevertheless wasnt good a training. a job that you have to pick up your duties . i your looking or in class training your , not this job"
good,"The hardest part of my job is getting the deposit done before brinks comes because it varies when they come.  Also, the deposit is different from day to day to being easy to harder or more complicated.  I have learned how to be faster to complete the deposit.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting my work done meaning completing the deposit in time for brinks to get it and get all the reports and resets done for the day.   A typical day is doing journal entries, balancing the cash in the room, the deposit, finalizing the business day, resets, more journal entries, competing the current days reports, rebalancing the cash in the room, and putting the previous reports away."
good,"Good Benefits, great teams, good management. If you like to help others whether its co-workers or customers and like to keep busy this is a good place to work. It can be fun if you let it. The only negatives would have been having to schedule time off 3 weeks in advance, and still not being guaranteed to get that desired time off."
good,Working in the photo lab was fun ad exciting. Seeing new people everyday and the life events they have captured on film. I enjoyed my job until another associate started causing conflict when department manager went on vacation.
good,A physically challenging place to work. Job includes long hours and heavy lifting until one has been there for a certain time period in which they can move to something slightly less challenging.
good,Working at Wal-Mart is an experience. The greatest thing about working for Wal-Mart is how easy it is to move up in careers.
good,"good hours you will get between 34-39 hrs a week "
good,Really enjoyed my job at walmart but just be careful about making complains cause it would be the end of your career. Everyone is out for themselves in certain stores. Overall a great place to work
good,"I enjoy the people, I went into this job knowing a lot about cars, its more about the repetition of procedures and a lot of physical labor. most cars that come in are no where near maintained like they should be. I go home with my hands torn up on a daily basis."
good,"Day starts @ 5AM-2PM.Schedule can change within 24 hrs."
good,"Customer service first and foremost, work fast, clean and be friendly to all.. Give all and go beyond. Integrity is everything."
good,"Learner how to operate pallet jacks. "
good,Easy work; friendly people (co-workers). Recommend for a first time job or part-time job for someone who already works.
good,"Overall, it has been a great experience.  In any corporate environment, you have to be coachable and adjust to change.  At Walmart, change is constant."
good,"Fortunately I was able to work while some of the greater good was for the employees.  Sam Walton built a strong company that worked with employees in order to pay them well and let them enjoy the careers they were able to earn through hard work. His belief that everyone wants to work someplace where they feel needed and their efforts were rewarded worked better for the company.  I watched after his wife passed away the small snowball at the top of the hill start rolling down hill as it got bigger it rolled faster.  As more corporate decisions were made on profit rather than what the company was built on which was the loyal employees.  The same employees, as they felt less appreciated they have stepped down taking on less demanding jobs or even walked out due to the corporate decisions to get 1/2 the people to do twice the work.  Working along with personnel associates I got to see first hand where people were hired for positions they were not qualified for only because there wasn't anyone that was qualified that would apply for them.  Careers become Jobs and loyalty was punished.  Anyone looking for a job WalMart is the place to be, I personally would like a career, where hard work is appreciated not stepped on."
good,i work in apparel and its a great job but the managers have fired so many people and now we have to go up to the front and work at the registers and it looks horrible in apparel because were having to do the front
good,Good first job. Big and busy. Good co-workers most of time. Reasonable pay for type of job. Benefits okay could be better.
good,"A typical day of work at Walmart is very busy but as while as time consuming which is a good thing."
good,"The experience was positive.  I was able to move up quickly, but became harder the further I moved up. Will be around forever."
good,typical day at work was to stock and restock items in area and load and unload trucks pretty easy job just never had a set schedule
good,Its a great company to work for. The benefits are good if you use them correctly. In this location of WalMart gained the knowledge I needed to enjoy my job and working with different employees.
good,"La operacion solía variar mucho súbitamente, esta empresa representa muchos retos y mucho aprendizaje, la gerencia era cambiante pero en general suele apoyar a sus subalternos. Lo mas difícil eran los días pesados de operación y lo que mas me gustó fue el reconocimiento y la promoción que otorgaban por los méritos."
good,"Walmart is a very excellent place to work because they put in so much effort to make sure that you are successful. It is not a hard job at all, all they want to see is you get your job done. My coworkers were very nice and comforting, they made sure that I knew what I was doing and it made me like that job very much."
good,I enjoy walmart but feel as if it has very little job security. The management is alright but sometimes it feels as if they do not have time to listen to your needs and concerns
good,"I was a cashier and it was an okay experience. There was a lot of drama, the co-workers did not respect others. All they would do is bad mouth them."
good,"There is always plenty of work responsibilities, in which I enjoy staying busy. I have learned how to multi task and have excellent customer service skills. The management team is fair. The most difficult part of the job is having to rely on other co-workers who do not have the best work ethics."
good,"A typical day at work is ringing out patients for their prescriptions, billing insurances, ordering medications, and ensuring that patients receive the correct information."
good,"Work stated as stocking and restocking produce on the sales floor. Co-workers were good, and as long as they did their work things went smoothly. Clear chain of Command in the company,"
good,Walmart took care of it's people.  Sometimes the managers would be a little cocky and unrealistic and yet others would be perfect.  Breaks were very reasonable and the workload was always finished.  The managers knew how to rearrange personnel to get stuff done.  The hardest part was getting help since Walmart did not want to hire anyone.  The enjoyable part was getting work done.
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, solo le falta mas capacitacion y motivacion al empleado (incentivos) "
good,I really enjoyed working with my the co-works I worked with. My  typical day is going to work with positive outlook. I really enjoyed working for the company.
good,"Locations all over the world, easy to move up and around.  Just show up and do your job and its easy to be notices a an employee with potential"
good,"Working at Walmart was really challenging , because of all the different people you come in contact with. Those challenges made my job most enjoyable."
good,"j'aimais bien ce travail, car je suis une fille tres sociable et j'aime etre entourer de gens. j'ai appris a comment compter un caisse mais jai aussi appris comment classer les affaires dans les allées. j'ai bien aimé mon expérience et j'aimerais bien y retourner"
good,"foi meu primeiro emprego aprendi muito fiz muita amizade, agerencia era boa"
good,"Typically a normal day consisted of a morning meeting, and then just go about our job duties. I learned how to be patient while setting up a department like the home office wants it. My co-workers are like they are at any job. You become close to some, have your differences with others, and just acquaintances with others. The hardest part of the job was making sure ""counts"" were done on time and making sure the correct orders were sent."
good,"good place to work, the employees are very nice to work with"
good,A typical night at walmart was to start by making sure that the trucks were getting unloaded. then i would figure out my tmat and assign all associates to the designated work area for the night. at 10 pm when all my associates arrived we would have a short meeting to talk about sales and to direct them to where they would work that night. After the meeting I would ensure that the freight was getting to the floor and that the associates were working it. I would then build my features that i had planned out. on Tuesdays I would write my schedules. If there were any coachings that needed to get taken care of I would get another member of management and get those taken care of. also write and take care of annual evals as they were due. after lunch I would ensure that all the backstock was getting to the  backroom so it could be put in its designated place. I learned how to properly merchandise product in order to have a good sell through for the season. I enjoyed working with most of all my coworkers and i tried to make there job as enjoyable as possible. The most difficult part of my job was ensuring all work had been complete no matter how short staffed we were. I enjoyed working with my associates and my customers a happy customer and associate always makes you happy.
good,"Job usually seasonal. Work load lighten up after the first of the year. responsibilities include checking out customers, stocking shelves in area, and clean work area. The atmosphere is fun and upbeat."
good,I was a cashier but was umped to different departments during the day.  I learned patience and flexability. Management was decent but normally busy. There is a decent amount of turnover.
good,"Walmart isn't a bad play to work, unlike what the media and others what to make you think. The Hayden, ID store raised the minimum wage to $10 p/h for everyone. $10 p/h is a a decent wage for the area. The issue I have is the reluctancy to move employees to full time status. Management seemed to spin its wheels on a number of occasions. When explaining a policy change, I never heard the same thing. They were willing to help me out on for getting days specific days I needed/wanted off. But the lack of a set schedule was an issue for me. Overall I'd grade Walmart a 'B'."
good,There are many things that you can achieved here but sometimes the politics and people's willingness to look beyond what they are doing and think longer term is a major issue that needs the correct management to improve.
good,During my duration of employment it was a nice establishment. Just super cheap when it comes to overall satisfaction of employees.
good,Es un trabajo el cual no te deja progresar fuera de la empresa debido a los horarios rotativos y contratos temporales.
good,"It was a great work experience, I learned how to do everything in the store basically. Management was ok sometimes I guess that would've been depending on how their day was going. Great co-workers I knew almost everybody by name. There was no hard part to the job everything was easy I enjoyed the job all around and I would still be there if my car hadn't messed up on me."
good,Wonderful co-workers that would help you with anything you might need.  I learned a lot about my personal growth in this position.
good,"I was originally hired to work at Wal-Mart temporarily to help with the remodeling project. I performed work task well above average to ensure that the remodeling of the building would be completed before the ideal finish date arrived.  "
good,This job had no room for advancement at all and management was not inclined to acknowledge I could be trained for a management position even though I have an associates in business and pursuing my degree in business administration.
good,"Most of my skills come from Walmart. Some are just common sense."
good,"Wal-mart was definitely understanding. I got fired for absences due to early pregnancy problems but they did everything to keep me and ran out of options. I am rehireable. The managers and my co workers were wonderful and very helpful. The hardest part of my job was having to be away from my son every night, not being about to put him to bed at night. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with all the customers."
good,Sometimes the work would be up and down but I loved the job. I had great time with some of the employees working their. The supervisors their loved me and the hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and rude customers just because they were customers they thought they could say or do anything they wanted.
good,"They work you hard, especially overnight. During the day a lot of things are left undone so overnight has to clean up whats left as well as their trucks for the night. If overnight didn't do their job the backroom would be too crowded."
good,"There is a lot of opportunity for advancement,if you are willing to work hard and learn the business.  If you don't have much education or training, they will train you.  Lots of opportunity for continuing education.  Hours can be long, and it can be hard to get a full-time position.  It is easy to transfer from state to state, if you need to move."
good,I learned so much from my employment in this company and I grew a lot in the field of management as well. I started out at the jewelry department and ended up the manager over the deli department. The training possibilities are unlimited and I encourage anyone looking for a company that you can grow in to give this company a try.
good,nice place to work fast pace enviornment not very perfessional and sometimes hard to work with usual life unexpected problems
good,"A typical day at work was baking or making donuts or filling the floor, a typical day is busy and full of work."
good,Routine work day would include clocking in on time afterwards entire team meets with supervisor once daily agendas are addressed team would proceed to unload truck of general merchandise within 2 hour minimum once truck is unloaded we sort an stack the freight after freight is stacked properly onto pallets we pull pallets too the sales floor using pallet jacks once entire backroom is clear we assist overnights with stocking until time to clock out.Job was fairly easy just needed to be on time and productive most co-workers are willing to help if you just ask the management was always open to ideas and was very approachable most enjoyable part of the job was some of the people you would meet customer wise as well as business wise
good,walmart was a pretty good place to work because they have you all over the store learning more thann one thing which makes it better for your work history
good,"same as last the only difference is this one is in Easton, Maryland instead of Denton, Maryland I get along with everyone I try to have fun everywhere I go"
good,Worked 8 hour shifts. Learned how to better develop customer service skills. Learned how to develop Good people and communication skills. Management is OK if you stay on their good side. Have great co worker. Never really had a hardest part. I just enjoyed putting a smile on the customers faces.

good,"I was the only woman in my position but the men i worked with were all fun and reliable. It was a monday to friday 9 - 5 job, and was hard work but my co-workers made it very enjoyable."
good,"On night shift stock for a super store, Groceries is a relatively simple and dull task. most of the other staff avoid each other, unless they already knew each other prior to their hiring by the company, and the shift design is nearly militaristic."
good,"Every morning pulling out tires, greeting people, making sales, learned how to service write install tires and batteries and do oil changes and also lights as well, management is okay needs work, hardest part of job installing tires, most enjoyable part of work was socializing while working"
good,"I have to thanks Walmart for the opportunity they gave me when I started working with them. This company gave me the first chance to grow as a customer service expert with their training and classes to become one of their Store Assistant Manager.  Started as an Inventory Specialist and become a Manager in 2003. Learned all the tricks in marketing, management, customer services and other ways to become a good customer service assistant."
good,Working at Walmart was great.  For me if any major issues came up not flexible. Because I used all my sick time. But thats  policies
good,"J'étais gérante adjointe responsable du service à la clientèle et des départements de la mode."
good,"Walmart has great job opportunities with flexible scheduling for family's and students, as well as good management. When you are able to learn you job and be a viable part of a team, everyone on the team should share in the responsibility of working some of the holidays so no one team member should have to work every holiday."
good,Helping customer doing a return in a respectful and kind way and maken sure that they have all the right item and we have to manage how many customer we sis return for
good,Working for Wal-Mart has been a learning experience. There is opportunity for advancement. The front end managers are helpful and caring.
good,"typical night in electronics was 2 pallets of tv.s n stereos and other electronic equipment. "
good,"I worked third shift at Walmart, it wasn't bad. I met a lot of good friends there and it was a really productive work place. both of my managers were just great people, and easy to work for. hardest part of the job would have to be the chemicals, when stripping the floors, it was so potent that it would eat the glue from the souls of your shoes, and had a really horrible odor. most enjoyable part was that I made some good friends and like  I said it was really productive, great team work everything got done, every single night."
good,"Enjoyed coming to work, everyday was a challenge, people were nice and fun to be around, Insurance could use a upgrade, pay was average."
good,"I loved being a CSM, I loved the associates that worked under me, and of course the customers. Everyday was a busy day which made time fly which was a great thing. I managed every register throughout the store so i was always running back and forth. The responsibility did become overwhelming at times but i didn't let that consume me."
good,"apreendi a gerenciar equipe de vendas , tendo responsabilidade total pelo seu atos e resultados atingidos, sobre os direitos do consumidor e como lidar com eles respeitando ao consumidor final , situação mais difícil a carga horaria feita pelo menos 14: 00 horas por dia a mais agradável a amizades feitas ."
good,"I work in the pharmacy so my experience differs slightly. For the most part it is a steady job with pretty decent health insurance. As with any job if you make sure you come to work on time and keep your absences low, you won't have much to worry about. If you are not a people person or become easily irritated, this is not the job for you. Due to it being retail, it does require quite a but of patience and temper control. It is a very diverse work environment, which is refreshing. The hardest part of the job is being short staffed and super busy at the same time. You feel pulled in multiple directions. Also patients that do not understand their co-pays or insurance and become verbally abusive. The most enjoyable part is getting appreciation for helping a patient with something they were having trouble with and the socialization. You do have many laughs with the co-workers and staff. I have learned not to sweat the bad days.They will happen and you can't control it. When a patient snaps at you, it isn't always because they are just mean and bitter. Most patients are in pain so you must try to be understanding. The most important part is for YOU to stay calm and keep a professional composure."
good,Working at Walmart I learn the custom are important. I would love to stay at this store but I want to move on to something new.
good,Walmart isn't a bad place to work.  It's probably not for people needing to support a family as when I worked there the pay was very low.  I have and Electronics Engineering degree and worked here in electronics on my days off for extra cash so my wife could be a stay at home mother.  In that time I saw people with far less skill/knowledge about electronics get hired on making more than myself.  Those same people needed my help assisting customers with various technical questions.  If pay were based more closely upon experience and education the pay scale may have been a bit more fair.
good,"Working with other staff and management is very efficient. The goals of the day are clear and precise and the job you are meant to be doing is very organized. Working at Walmart I've learned great customer service experience, techniques in being outgoing and approachable, effective in resolving issues, the ability to think on the spot, and work with other people in being an overall great team. The hardest part of the job is satisfying the customer when we are out of certain items when the policy is satisfaction guaranteed. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work along side great co workers and being able to satisfy the customers."
good,"Despite the difficulty, I enjoyed this job because of the constant support that I was given by the employees and management. I learned a lot when It came to simply helping customers and providing excellent service. My worst days happen to be my best days. Hardest part of the job was removing bottle bins in the recycle room and making new ones. the most enjoyable part of the job was receiving constant thanks from customers. Even though I had a conflict with one or two co-workers, we all worked our butts off. A typical day for me was coming in to work, saying good morning, clocking in and starting work as usual."
good,"fun worked as a cashier all day. Helped people find what they needed. Learned where everything is in the store, Also did some work at the customer service. Everyone was there is very friendly and fun to work with they do joke around."
good,Empresa com grande estrutura organizacional e possibilidades de crescimento onde parendi diversas funções que até hoje me são importantes.
good,Walmart is a company that is horrible to work for they do not care about their workers and if a member of management does not like a person they will find a reason to get rid of them. THey expect everyone to do the work of two people and do not care if something changes in your day for example if you are helping a customer you will get in trouble for not getting your work done in the unrealistic time frames they give you
good,its time consuming and it keeps you busy and ocupied. keeps you a woke when you are slpy.also keeps you out of trouble. you have to communicate.
good,"A pretty laid back job, management is friendly."
good,"It was a very nice experience to start working on cash, serve nice people, clean the place, help the boss, talk to people and help them if they have any needs"
good,"Prendre connaissance des taches de la journée, voir a ce que tous soit mis en place pour servir adéquatement la clientèle, s'assurer de la sécurité des employés, faire les rapports quotidiens, faire les horaires informatisées, voir aux changement d'horaires quotidien, faire évaluation d'employés, faire la formation pour les caissiers/ères,"
good,"uma enpresa otima, mas dificio para quem tem uma vida social ou familiar, com desenpenho é possivel um crecimento."
good,I worked each day in the produce department. I had to make sure there was fresh product on the shelves and make sure there was no bad food on shelves for the public
good,I loved working for Wal-Mart. Nice environment and they are very good about working with your schedule. I honestly felt like I could invest my career there if that was what I wanted to do.
good,"If you enjoy staying busy then this is a job for you. "
good,"My experience with Walmart is by no means a bad one, the people were friendly they work as a group on the associate and department manager level. and I do feel appreciated, however when upper management offers you a new position be aware they don't prepare you for the job, it was an entirely sink or swim exercise with my experience. and with now explanation of how to do a job properly I found my self learning through trial and error. and with too many errors I found my self starting to sink."
good,"a typical day at Walmart was full of surprises ,you would never know what to expect or all the great people you would meet. Great dependable co workers who made time go by pretty fast . Management was really understanding and they were also good folks as well ,hardest task about the job was that you're on your feet all-day  so that could cause back pains here and there but overall I loved that I had the chance to work for Walmart"
good,The people i work with are great. its just management that is terrible and there is no advancement opportunities. Low paying. They do a good job of training there new people though. a typical day at Walmart would be talking too some friends but generally just doing your job.
good,Management was questionable but the security of my job kept me there. I got to meet a lot of great people there and I still keep in touch with a few of them still to this day. Overall I would say if you need a job that will keep you around then work for Walmart. But the management will make you want to pull your hair out.
good,"custumer service , work with all kinds off people.see all kinds but still remain perfessional.wal amat is good place to work"
good,Unload the truck that came in and putting the freight in the right location in the warehouse. Getting pick tickets and picking them in a timely manner so that we did not get behind in orders that the consumer was ordering.
good,"Very energetic staff and managers. Its great to invest into a company and many people did. There is one downside to working with so many friendly faces, sometimes bringing issues up go unresolved because of friendships."
good,"the most enjoyable part of working at Walmart on cap team1 was working with my co-workers. I loved my co-workers we all got along and worked together very well. The hardest part of the job was trying to get our back room process don't in a certain time frame while understaff,and while other shifts didn't do their job correctly,that was the hardest part of the job.The support managers taught me a lot of incase I ever wanted to move up in the retail world. They taught me how to build features/displays,how to keep up with the counts of freight,and how to change on hands and other helpful skills to help me perform my job better. How ever the retail/marketing world isn't for me. A typical day at work was basically fast pace and non stop moving to get our backroom process and getting our shelves stocked for or customers.Some management honestly some were rude and acted like because they were over us they didn't have to show us respect and talk to us any way. Their is a difference between talking to me as my manager and talking to me as if I as a person or in my positon doesn't matter. I feel as if I am a humanbeing it doesn't matter how much schooling you have over me or how tall the ladder is you had to climb to get where you are,  still treat me and talk to me with respect. if I get disrespected or get talk to with disrespect you will get disrespected right back. I will not sit in a office and let management talk to me how ever they want in a rude manner just because they are over me. I am currently a student, I am a mother, my husband is a sargant in  the national guard he has"
good,"It was a friendly environment, people were nice to work with, management was fair. Some days were fast past and some days were slow. The enjoy able part of the job was the people and getting to learn new things."
good,"typical day, show up and begin with our customer service with helping people with their purchases. Whatever other associates was not able to put away from the nights truck, other associates take care off."
good,"Delivered remarkable customer service in all sections of the store and products within each department - Operated a cash register "
good,Working on contract  for Wal-Mart I found their managers treated the CR England employees with more respect and confidence than did the company we were being paid by.
good,"el trabajo en si era muy divertido, el compañerismo que me toco eran muy agradables, obviamente en lo que es producción es mucha presión por debido a que son alimentos y  como es super vale mucho sacar todo el producto a tiempo por ello que algunos días hay ofertas."
good,"Like to work outside and to work on vehicles"
good,I enjoyed working  at Walmart. I learned how work at a fast pace and remain calm. It also was my first job working as a cashier.
good,A typical day consisted of operating a cash register for 8 hours. I learned how to treat customers in retail to develop good customer service skills. My perception of management differed depending on the personality of the person. Some were less professional and less knowledgeable as others. The hardest part of the job was working to diminish lanes that were long during the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking an hour lunch when most employers offer 30 min meals.
good,This job was main focused around customer service and stocking. i learned how to become a very effective associate. Coworkers were easy to get along with and very helpful in my learning as well as management.
good,"my typical day at work for Walmart Corporation was to get up early in the morning, make it on time and to clock in on time to start your day. What I learned in this company was basically retail and everything that goes with retail. Management in the other hand had his problems by like everything else in life it's normal. My coworkers and Walmart at the time were very helpful and I made a lot of friends while I was there. There was really no hard part of the job at all just you have to be flexible when it comes to customers. I would have to say the most until the part of my job at Walmart was that if I help the customer that they that customer would be happy."
good,"Wal-Mart is a technology driver retailer.  There are limitless amounts of new technologies (always growing) to learn.  If you are highly motivated and desire to be on the bleeding edge of Retail and Security Technology, this is a great place for you to gain valuable experience."
good,day to day oversight of complete store operations.  Learned goal setting and accomplishment.  Managing large groups of associates. Walmart has some great people working for it who care about the customers.  Long hours.  Sense of accomplishment.
good,"A typical day at work would include dealing with customers, management and associates working aside you. "
good,"As a long-time Walmart employee, I learned you must be adaptable to change.  Policies, leadership and procedures change regularly.  Walmart has a high turnover rate among employees as it is not seen as a career path."
good,"Was a decent place to work for, everyone is nice there. This job is not a hard place to work they want the applicant to dependable."
good,"It was an ""okay"" job. In all honesty management was horrible. They were never around when you needed them and they were extremely rude to customers."
good,Each day at work we stocked the shelves on certain time frame. We would often times have to help customers locate items when necessary.
good,"Walmart is very secure place to work at,it also has a very good working environment.The employees and the store-management are very understanding as well."
good,Les conditions deTravail dans les magasins de Walmart sont difficiles. Il y a souvent peu d'employés disponibles pour accomplir de choses à la fois.
good,"This was my first long term job, and I started out as an unloader. The hours of 4pm to 1 am were not the best but I worked hard and it paid off later. Management was happy to rehire me at a later date, but the unloader job was not the best."
good,"Walmart can be a great place to work depending on the store management. The store management will make or break your experience here. "
good,Enjoy helping customers. Found the managers to be sensitive and understanding when I had to miss work due to illness. I have missed a lot of work due to illness and they  were understanding about my not being able to work.
good,"Typically stocking shelves was what I did daily, I learned how to talk to customers, the management wasn't that friendly when it came to teaching me things. They failed to teach me a lot of what I needed to know. I enjoyed organizing the shelves though."
good,"The routine is awesome. Work from 5 am to 2 pm on a rotation with one other associate. Balance loans to the money accumulated in the registers from the previous day. Reset the money for the registers for the next day. Do research if there are questionable transactions. Send and receive money from the bank. Print paperwork and highlight inconsistencies. Take phone calls and in person complaints with wrong charges. I learned how to process a lot of money at once and multi task with other things I need to do. The hardest part would be figuring out transactions and charges if they registers act up and I cannot pull up information on the computer. The most enjoyable part is working with associates I am comfortable with and being able to ask them questions if I need their input. I also enjoy working in the morning, and having a routine."
good,"Forman mucha cultura laboral hacia los empleados, pero algunos jefes no la llevan a cabo. El ambiente de compañerismo es agradable y se involucran todos los empleados para las tareas a realizar."
good,"en el area en la que me desarrolle aprendi a detectar mas a las personas a no confiar, actuar de manera honorable y ser mas analitico"
good,"Very good working environment, where my co-workers, managers and supervisors are all very nice. Teamwork is very impressive, but the management system is very confusing. You do not know whose orders you have to follow."
good,Good place to gain experience and develop customer service skills. It was a good learning opportunity for me from which I learned a lot.
good,"A day at work consist of full car maintenance, preparing and cleaning shop. I gained basic maintenance skills in maintaining a vehicle. Management was very assertive. Coworkers mostly young. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers and working in the shop at the same time, while cars where backed up. Most enjoyable part of the job was driving the cars."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo era agradable, en lo personal mi jefa directa era muy buena persona, y comprensiva con uno. "
good,"Aprendes muchas cosas que otras empresas tal vez no están dispuestas a enseñarte, por políticas."
good,a typical day at walmmart consists of getting to work clocking in working on a register 2 hours at a time with 15 minute breaks and one half hour break you have to take the breaks by law. the hardest part of the job is not knowing who to got o for management they seem to not really care if your there or not
good,"on holidays , they had dinners in the break room.  always got your breaks. "
good,"I would clock in and go straight to the back and handle freight"
good,"Working at a fast paced pharmacy such as Walmart has definitely provided me with many skills and given me knowledge that I am grateful for. I was able to quickly learn how to trouble shoot and resolve Third Party Claims, work with doctor offices and patients to provide excellent care for our Patients. The most enjoyable part of the the job is definitely being able to resolve for success, meaning, being able to have an issue, and being able to take to resolve the issue for the patient, to continue with the best care possible. The hardest part of the job is not having the support needed to run the pharmacy optimally."
good,"hard work, short staffed. all the staff get on well have a laugh but get on with the job. as long as you do the job properly the managers are great."
good,"A typical day involves unloading trucks, using forklift as required, stocking items as requested by Assistant Managers. The most enjoyable part of job is helping customers when they need help."
good,"*typically I would go into work get my register up and running and make sure I had enough money in my drawer. Next I would turn my light on and starting cashing out customers and assisting them with their purchasing and if they had any other questions and concerns. I would also in form them on the credit card that we (Wal-mart) offered to our customers and if they were interested I would do the application process for the credit card for that customer. about 15 minute before the time for me to leave I would turn my light of and finish with the customers in my line. Then I would clean my register and the area around me. Took out the trash under register, took back any go backs under my register, wipe down register and line belt, sweep my area. once everything was done I clocked out."
good,"a typical day is interesting, I enjoy everything I do as a CSR. Management, and my coworkers are like family. The hardest part is having to deal with difficult customers, and trying to keep them calm.  Professionalism is always key."
good,"Cuando a las personas les das algo en que creer, como una empresa de valores y crecimiento laboral, las personas responden con compromiso, estabilidad, y trabajo."
good,"Ordered, stocked, inventory, cashiering, customer svc and fitting room. Needed more pay but advanced fast through the company."
good,"I worked hard every day in receiving, checking in and out vendors."
good,I worked in the Jewelry dept as an sales associate. I would come in and finish checking in any freight that needed to be done. Help customers with and orders for jewelry and make sure the paper work was done appropriately. If we weren't busy at the counter i would have to go help out in other depts. I  did learn how to do a lot through out the store and different depts. As always I got along with all of the  people I worked with.
good,"I hear horror stories about people who have worked at Walmart but my experience really wasn't that bad. It was busy and I really learned how to develop a very good work ethic there. There was not excuse to be lazy, there was always something to do. I really liked the people I worked with, we had a good time working together."
good,I worked hard and fast while getting my job done right. I enjoyed the customers and it was a pretty good job overall. I learned a lot about cash registers and how to operate one. The management was good and understanding my shift availability work hours. All of my co-workers except one were great and that is just because that one co worker went to school with my sister and she hated her so she hated me. The hardest part of this job was working so late. The most enjoyable part of this job was talking to people and the customers.
good,Empresa com bom clima organizacional. Mas com baixo salário e beneficios também nada atrativos.
good,me agradaba que cuando entraba al horario de la apertura habia una junta de comunicacion en la cual podias tomas un cafe y un pan el cual proporcionaba la empresa se formaba un muy buen ambiente de convivencia que te alentaba a dar lo mejor de ti dia a dia la gerencia general era una persona que sabia mucho y si nesecitaba ayuda no dudaba en brindartela por otro lado asi como hay gente muy capaz en la empresa hay otra que no lo era tanto
good,"Liked my job had to quit because moved out of state,liked most of the people i worked with,liked working with the public and helping people"
good,If you're okay with hard work then IMS is for you. It's not a cake walk kind of job. You have to bust your butt. Management never really bothers you because you're too busy unloaded the trailers. You really get to know the guys you're working with. Typical day would entail unloading 2500 to 5000 items per trailer normally pushing about 3 trailers a day.
good,There are some really talented people working within this company but they are held back by poor upper management. Promoting the wrong people is horrible here and they are paying for it.
good,"Worked in all departments except fashion with many different responsibilities.  Duties included customer support, mew product displays, zoning and cash."
good,"Walmart has a family atmosphere. My day usually start off by surveying the produce floor to see what produce need to put out for the customer,culling all produce. My department manger is one of a kind I enjoy being one of his produce sales associate.I help out my coworkers that have trouble getting their task done for the day."
good,es un lugar bueno para trabajar lo unico incobeniente es rolar turnos
good,"Each day was different, with a new project. You get to express your creative ideas, and they are always considered. It was great learning how to manage inventory, to ensure loss prevention. Management was great with helping you understand each assignment. Not to much coverage when you have to tend to personal matters, or help to provide coverage for emergencies. The best part was satisfying the customers, considering we are all customers."
good,Very exciting place to work for. The management team is very helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job is being up in sales.
good,I am happy with the pay it is good to have. the employees are fun to work with and I enjoy working with them. The management team listen to the employees suggestions and take care of any problems.
good,"Customers were a handful at times, associates overworked into other departments then didn't apply for. everyone worked everywhere. Some managers worked together to rid of others. Working with colleagues was the best part."
good,"Overall, Walmart is a great place to gain experience with interacting with coworkers and customers. It's a great environment to sharpen your customer service skills. Coworkers in general are diverse ranging from all ages. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers who possess a great sense of humor. During a transaction as cashier it's a privilege for me to be able to smile back to a customers joke or compliment. I would say the hardest part of the job is transitioning from a completely different environment which is outdoors as a back up cart attendant. So from tending the cash register I have to switch and adapt to the outside nature when I'm collecting and pushing carts. Overall, I learned how to deal with all sorts of customers as well as the nature of a retail environment."
good,The most enjoyable thing I had with this company was managing a great team of Associates and working for a well know company that provided products and services that the public needed and appreciated.
good,"It was great working with the other folks in my department.  We had fun and the customers were generally great to talk to.  It was hard, dirty, greasy work, but it felt good at the end of the day to know I did a good day's work.  The worst was the management who didn't seem interested in adjusting my schedule due to personal situations on the home front.  It was frustrating having different managers at different times of the year and and adjusting to the various personalities which led to my departure because the first manager was sympathetic to my situation and the next wasn't. Just to clarify, I was dealing with a deployed spouse situation and needed to make adjustments so I could be home at certain times with my 4 children; the first manager was very understanding and the second wasn't."
good,"It is good to work. "
good,"Typical day is an eight hour shift. Fair break times."
good,Its very fast paced and routine. Good work environment unless you cant deal with customers from time to time. Requires lifting and pulling a lot of weight.
good,"Working for Walmart has given me a great deal of knowledge in retail. Being responsible for inventory is a very physical and tiring job. There is a lot of lifting, going up and down ladders and using machinery such as fork lifts and walkie stackers. You MUST have a sense of mathematics to successfully accomplish the job. The productivity timing is a bit outrageous. There is never enough time within the eight hour work day to complete the tasks given. The co-workers I have are wonderful and much more helpful than management. There is very bad communication between management and hourly employees. Walmart does not accept doctors notes regardless of the situation you will be required to take a medical leave of absence. If your LOA is denied for any reason you will be given a ""coaching"" depending on how many days you were absent. Putting in for days off in advance is also very difficult because management rarely gets a chance to look at the requests."
good,"At Walmart, each and every associates tries their best to work hard and go over and  and beyond what is expected. The holidays and unavailable weekends is the hardest part of the job. Associates want more ""family"" time or flexible schedules."
good,"stock and help customers,benefits were ok, management not all on the same page.I like the people I work with.did always have the stuff to do your job with."
good,"i enjoy being fast paced and keep moving and helping people, i enjoy the people i work with and the pharmacist,  wish the pharmacy was included in more store activities"
good,There is always an opportunity to learn new things daily and to advance within the company if you are the right person. The most enjoyable part of working with this company was helping customers that genuinely needed help.
good,A typical day at work would include clocking in and then going to find out which register I would be on for the first part of the day. Assisting customers with the check out process and making sure they found everything they were looking for was my job. I learned how to deal with different types of people. Management was okay
good,I have held several positions and done many duties. Personally I think the best position would be claims or DSD Those are jobs that are easy higher paid less stress and decent schedules
good,"This use to be a wonderful company to work for. Anyone can grow there with their career. However, over the years the focus on customer service declined. The management atleast at the store I worked at was not about their employees. I believe that everyone represents a company."
good,THey make sure you have the training to do the job. I have learn so much from the managers and associates have had the pleasure to work with that it has put where I am Today.
good,Good stable work around a friendly and cooperative team. Very accommodating schedule as well as a supportive management team. The best part of the job is working with people I consider my friends.
good,"my co-workers are nice and they help out with alot....."
good,"Working at Walmart was 'ok' , needed a second job so it wasn't bad.. Typical I start by getting all my equipment a scanner and printer for the items I had to inventory and or send out to be put on the floor . also while doing my usual task I also helped those who needed help and always clean as I work ."
good,"Good job if you like customer service and merchandising. The positions available at Walmart are varied, specific and demanding.  Flexibility is required as the business changes frequently.  Personal development and advancement is dependent on personal motivation and availability of management to mentor."
good,Lugar muito bom de trabalhar mas salario muito pouco para muito tempo de trabalho
good,"It was hard to get days off because turn over is so high. Missed a lot of family events requested off months in advance. Its an easy job, very repetitive and easy to follow. the training goes in depth and you're prepared when you start. The management tends not to be too helpful with a lot of situations, you mostly have to deal with people and customers on youre own. The co workers are very friendly. They're the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Positive atmosphere, friendly, hardworking, teamwork, good training. I've enjoyed being out among people, and serving the customers."
good,ok place to work. hours were all over the place. not paid enough for job performed. management nice but time off hard to get
good,"Good Benefits, good hours and most often the team functioned well together."
good,"great place for getting good pay., doesnt care about no one but $.... expect u to work your balls off doing something your not gonna make production on. production rates through the roof and hard to reach will result in termination because u cant reach production goals"
good,"Each customer need is uniquely different. Therefore assessment, identifying the need, and providing the product with sufficient inventory is most important."
good,"Very great job and good benefits cons  you get paid every 15 days."
good,"Refreshing workplace meeting new people every day. Doesn't have the best management. All the co-workings are greatly supportive and it was great working along side them. Each day I greeted with a smile, everyday was a chance to meet new people and interact with the customers and feel the protectiveness. I grew in my abilities everyday with the computer management and with my effectiveness to scan items at an appropriate speed."
good,"Enjoyed the partnership within the company, the ability to learn sereval areas within the store. have some great managemnt teams that were willing to teach."
good,"Working as a stocker all you did was stock all day/night. Take your trash back when you are finished and helped whoever still had some freight left over. I learned how to get things done in a manageable time and learned about the store. I wasnt very fond of management. They didnt seem to always have it together. I really liked all my co-workers. I worked with really nice and great workers. Hardest thing about stocking is getting completely done with everything even with large freight. You really had to move. Overall, i really enjoyed the job itself."
good,"muito bom trabalha com clientes é meu mundo."
good,Great work place a amazing supportive manager. All about the numbers and with no room for messing up. Office was neat and organized
good,"A typical day is checking out customers. cashing checks, paying bills. The most enjoyable part is working with your friends and meeting nice people and having the customers that come in on the regular get to know you personal by name."
good,"Walmart is a well structured company that offers advancement, good training program and friendly employees. Management is always willing to help and guide employees to accomplish their end goals."
good,"The only real complaint is I was let go, but no one told me until after I went to get my paycheck for that week. I'm not sure which part of management was to blame, but I do not approve of lack of communication on this level."
good,"This job is very repetitious, but a nice steady job for students in high school or otherwise. Sometimes you can get overloaded on tasks but communication with management is necessary."
good,"Mgr at Walmart are not people friendly. They really don't care about the employees just what they can get out of them. Quick throw you under the bus if they're putting in jam. No teaching and training of associates just put you out there and tell you to go for."
good,they are frendly and nice people. good benefis . good break . Every month made Workers' Activities .nice work for people who like the relaxed atmosphere
good,"My day starts, generally, at 0400. From the time I clock in to the time I clock out, I am moving almost constantly. On a slow day, I walk about five miles. The exercise is great. I am often times on a ladder, and lift items up to 50 lbs. My co-workers are younger, for the most part, and make the job fun. My direct Supervisor is ideal...a hard worker, and always willing to stand up for all she oversees, as are those managers on her level. Management above her are sometimes unapproachable which is in direct contrast to the Sam Walton philosophy."
good,My time at Walmart was short but fullfilling. I enjoyed the challenge of tasks and deadlines. I however had to move out of state to be with family and was not there long enough to transfer.
good,If you are going to work in retail this is the place to go. I have enjoyed my time a Wal-Mart and feel that they provide all the necessary tools that are needed to be successful in this setting.
good,"Walmart was a my first department store job, everyone was great cool supervisors and overall a good pay hourly."
good,"Empresa com um bom treinamento, ótima para ganhar experiência, porém um pouco lenta em resolução de problemas devido a burocracia no gerenciamento da empresa em geral."
good,"Usually busy, extended my knowledge of costumer service, cash handling, supervisor based responsibilities. Co-workers and management were friendly, the most enjoyable part was building relationships with costumers and learning about their needs."
good,"Overall walmart is a fun place to work. I met many interesting people who came through on a daily basis. However the pay was not as well as i needed it to be, and the benefits don't start until you've worked there year. I applied for many higher positions while working there, but the competition was high. Higher paid job were given on time worked at the store, not by experience. Hardest part of the job was working late hours, and holidays. Also, never got above 20 hours a week, so paychecks did not pay the bills."
good,"tálves o melhor da empresa, o relacionamento com os colegas. por ser uma empresa com muitos funcionários ha uma relação muito próxima de todos, tanto dentro da empresa, quanto fora dela."
good,the workers were friendly and management was nice and considerate.the workers always had great teamwork.fun work place supportive management
good,"If you want a job that is flexible around school, but works you just as hard, Walmart is the place for you. The challenging aspects of this job come down to one basic skill: how well you can handle people. If you master that, the rest of the job is easy."
good,"I loved the interaction with the customers. I enjoyed the job as cashier. We didn't get paid enough for the work we had to do, we did more then the actual managers."
good,It's an okay place to work at for part time while going to school.  They sometimes don't follow their own rules that the force upon you.  The managers can be overwhelming at times and co-workers can and will call managers to tattletale on you for doing your job.
good,"Great Compensation, poor work life balance. Enjoyed the associates and customers. Plenty of training and development.."
good,easy but challenging at the same  time excellent people to work with. Also the manager was very fair and understanding. the easiest day of the job was leaving but the hardest was to deliver furniture in tight places in certain parts of the house.
good,Working for Walmart DC 6084 was quite an experience. Getting trained to drive various equipment to meet my expectionation of my job.  Team workers good to work with. always busy never dull.
good,"Good company to work for, but the pay wasn't that great at the time. I liked my position, but wasn't getting enough hours."
good,muitas vezes o trabalho de outros acaba caidno sobre suas costas e vc trabalha mais sem receber um extra por fazer um trabalho q nem é do seu setor porem tirando isso o trabalho é bom e facil de exercer.
good,"There are so many opportunities here and you can find a job doing just about anything you would like to do.  At times it is hard to move around within the company and the budgets are cut however, that is part of the retail environment."
good,"A decent place to work, can work for some schedules depending on the department you work in and the department I worked in and the shift, I couldn't really attend college and stay focused."
good,Helping customers with items.  Learned how to run a pallet truck. Management was adequate and understanding.  My co-workers were  energetic and hard working.  The hardest part of my job was lifting heavy items into customers vehicles.  The most enjoyable part of my day was in the generation of a good feeling while helping customers with any assistance needed.
good,Walmart was a part time job I took while I was also working with Ryder.  I needed extra money in my household and it seem the perfect fit.  They did give me the hours  I needed because I worked a forty plus week at Ryder.  I basically worked 7 days a week.   It was exhausting at times.  I meet a lot of wonderful people both co workers and customers.  I like the fact that it was a fast paced environment.
good,"Wal Mart helped me develop customer service skill at an even higher level than I had before. The fast paced, challenging work setting was a thrill."
good,"Wal Mart de México es una empresa con una excelente cultura organizacional, opciones de crecimiento y desarrollo. "
good,Martinsburg Walmart has a lot of great people working there. It is a fun place to work and you can meet a lot of new friends. Everyone is friendly and the hardest part of the job is the nasty customers but its a delight when you have the friendly customers to talk to. I learned how to count money and that most people are very friendly and willing to talk if you give them your ear to listen.
good,"Llegar a walmart y saber que en menos de una hora estarás congelándote con la temperatura de AA d la tienda, muy buen ambiente de trabajo y buen lugar para estar, lo único tedioso era el  atender seguido clientes furiosos por no haber encontrado tortilla o arena para gato o que su producto haya pasado un peso mas caro que al precio que estaba publicado, pero al final en la noche puedes salir tranquilo rápido y sin problema alguno y si quieres comerte un pan o un pastel adelante disfrútalo."
good,"this job is fun and challenging .its just hard to get promoted,it seems like you need to know someone to get any where in the company."
good,This is no doubt my favorite job I ever worked I enjoyed helping customers and the fast pace. The only downside was it was hard to get help in your area and you had to work numerous areas and their was rarely any compliments on a job well done.
good,Walmart is a great place to work.  It is no different than other places of employment.  You are expected to show up for you shift on time. If you are willing to work very hard and have an extremely flexible schedule you will do very well there.  I have improved my customer service skills immensely in the last 2 years.
good,"Working at walmart was an enjoyable experience. It wasnt too demanding, although it is very busy on weekends and around the holidays, its still a nice place to work"
good,not really busy since I worked overnight  Learned many different task such as cutting keys and mixing paint most of all I learned the meaning of Diversity from working at Walmart.
good,"Cool place to work, keeps you busy at times and taught me how to remain calm in busy situations. makes time go fast when your teamed up with people who do their part in a department. the hardest part of my job was communicating with the managers with different situations sometime my group had to figure somethings out on our own and that made the customers mad. my enjoyable part is having the moments to help the customers to smile and know help is here for them."
good,"A typical day at work involves cashiering, ringing up customers, cleaning my area, and making sure that things are tidy and zoned properly. So far I've learned how to use their cash registers and many of the functions they can perform. Management is scaled based upon pay, it's not very straightforward, so trying to get anywhere seems difficult. My co-workers are generally very nice people, they tend to be easy to get along with, and most don't seem to dislike their job terribly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with boredom and tiredness, such as when you've done everything you can, and you still need to be busy, or when there's no end to the lines of people, for 2 hours straight. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning more about people and listening to their stories, as well as figuring out why they buy ingredients for cooking."
good,"A typical day is always packed and never enough registers open, sometimes I'm left up there alone. I learned that some customer service managers don't really know what they're doing half the time and some have their favorites. The management I feel needs to calm down a little and I feel like they're stressing everybody out. Recently they started selling credit cards which I personally think is ridiculous because nobody wants a credit card. Most of my co-workers are okay really nice and friendly. I don't think 9.40 is enough money to live on, especially when I want to get a car in my name and move out on my own."
good,"I worked overnight as a cashier. I loved the people I worked with because they were always willing to help you out- even the managers were helpful. Some days were better than others, but that's just like every company. The benefits you get could use some improvements but better to have it than to go without."
good,As I continue to work at Walmart vision center I have learn and meet so many people. I enjoy working there. It's fun working there. everybody becomes as family once you been there for so long.
good,"Adquiri novos conhecimentos quando comecei a trabalhar no Walmart, na loja em que eu trabalhava, meu gerente e encarregados me tratavam super bem, sempre se preocupado comigo, quando eu fazia meu serviço bem feito me elogiavam, os relacionamentos com meus colegas foram bem, não tive nenhuma briga nem discussão, sempre os respeitando de forma igual, independente do cargo que exercia. Gostava também do curso, eram excelentes profissionais. Ou seja, não tenho o que reclamar desta empresa, me acolheu e pode estar me ensinando no que eu precisava."
good,"When you work at Walmart they become like a family we help each other the best we can. We work hard to help each other and take care of our customers. The hardest part is keeping your temper when being yelled at, but our mangers are always there to take the angry customer head on."
good,It can be entertaining to work at walmart sometimes because of the variety of customers that come into the store. Good place to move up into management positions since the minimum time to work in one position is 1 to 6 months based on the walmart you apply.
good,"I loved being a cashier at Walmart.  My personal goal was to try to make sure that each customer was smiling as they walked away from my register with their merchandise."
good,I enjoyed the people. Good people make for a great place to work.  I found there training program very good.  I enjoy the fact you where left to do your job and didn't have someone breathing down your neck.
good,I worked there in the 90's. they no longer cut meat there. My views on this company are out dated and not useful. it was a great time to work there. The growth of the company meant lots of chances to move up..
good,Being a customer of Wal-Mart and dealing with the frustration of being in a hurry and having to wait in line to get checked out gives you that empathy as an employee for that customer because you know how that feels. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers who have had a bad day because it can bring your mood down and give you a bad day. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that after a certain amount of time you can advance in your position.
good,Very fast pace and always an incentive for advancement within. Consist interaction with the community. But very low managment skills.
good,"Working at Walmart was good. When I started at Walmart in 2000 felt comfortable having a stable and secure job."
good,"I liked working there and would go back I liked working in the deli dept and miss it"
good,It's a great stepping stone but not forever. They are an ok company to work for. I love alot of the customers and my co workers.
good,The hardest part of working there was not having a regular schedule. I liked working there.  I learned how different people are very quickly.
good,Overall The work environment is good was nice. I enjoyed the people I worked with. We all got along and we kind of like our own little family.
good,my department manager was amazing and always inspiring. Most of the staff in the  store was friendly and we seemed to work well together.
good,"working at Walmart was fine. the breaks were spaces evenly, the coworkers were tolerable, the management was helpful."
good,there were always tasks to be accomplished and to keep workers busy. i liked that even though i was overnight I was able to finish my shift in the morning assisting customers.
good,"I work early mornings 5 A.M until @P.M. I enjoy working with the vendors and ensuring that they have the right merchandise. This job has been a bit challenging for me, but I have learned a lot in this short period of time. I have to have good time management because vendors do not have one set time to check in and unexpected things happen all the time."
good,aprendes a trabajar bajo precion el compañerismo esbueno me gusto todo loque acia salias de la rutina diariamente acias cosas diferntes todos los dias
good,assemble bikes and whatever else they needed to be assembled. helped out in other areas as needed. drove forklift to unload trucks when needed
good,Every day is different for the most par.t I don't know if will have a smooth day or a very hatcheck day. Customers can be very disrespectful however I deal with it and move on. I defiantly have my good and bad days like most jobs.
good,I worked at Walmart part time while I was trying to get full time. After 7 months and no chance of getting full time my husband asked me to quite and look for a full time job. It was a fun place to work but I just could not stay any longer without in chance of getting full time. I am  and independent person and I wanted a job I could count on in case there was in major life changes.
good,"I enjoy my job at Walmart as a Customer Service Supervisor. I really enjoy the people that I work with and the diversity of the customers. I can say that this job allows my leadership, communication and multitasking skills to shine."
good,structured work place. someone always willing to lend a hand. I learned how to work with more hands on with customers. my co-workers made me feel like we were family. hardest part was leaving the job.
good,"Working at Walmart is a great job, however I will be starting school and will not be able to get the right hours to make good money, and concentrate on school work. Being a cashier is easy, except dealing with some customers, but you get that anywhere!"
good,enjoy work very much always everyday a fast work pace enviorment. supervisors are ready to help. to much to grasp of learning experience in a short amount of time
good,The workplace was fine as so was the coworkers.Management could of been better.Overall it was a very nice place to work as long as you can see different views on how to complete a job.
good,I am lucky enough to have a great manager and co-workers in my department.  The hardest part of my day is pleasing everyone.
good,I enjoy working here. I love interacting with the public. Its a fun place to work. I like the atmosphere in the store. The employees are nice. Management is very nice and helpful in making your work day a pleasant and easy experience.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking freight, working pick carts, zoning product, building new counters and shelves, and setting new modulars. The remodel managers were very unorganized and often did not know where the needed materials were located. My co-workers often worked hard along with myself. The hardest part of the job was getting all the correct shelving and other materials that we needed to complete our task."
good,"I enjoyed my work at Wal-Mart 0508. I assisted customers and associates retrieve products and information in a timely manner."
good,I loved the group of people that I get to work with and work a little bit with the customers. The only thing that I didn't like was the glasses and I know its part of policy and I respect that.
good,Walmart is a pretty great job after all as a cashier I could potentially affect how a persons day was as well as give them a basis as to what to expect of the rest of the store.
good,"It is a  good place to work they do  try to "
good,"Nice place to work , easy, also very different people you get to meet. Also can be very difficult days you have to push throught."
good,"Walmart was a very productive workplace, great associates."
good,"Customer services to me is what it is all about, helping people find what they need, or giving them another option.  People are excited to buy and spend money, and I like to have a good time with the customers and make them happy."
good,"Management could be supportive at times, then sometimes could be very snappy. Co workers were always nice and exciting to work with. Wal-Mart is big company and since we worked overnight we always had to make sure the store was stocked perfectly for the morning commute."
good,Dealing with freight and helping customers. I learned how a company makes profits and loss. Management would help us out with issues we had. Co-workers was a good group of people. We worked as a team to get things done. Dealing with anger customers and some co-workers. Helping out customers in their shopping needs and meeting other people. I enjoy working with people.
good,"Managing cashiers, helping customers and solving customers issues. Maintaining front end supplies and performing register audits. Management were not the greatest, but co-workers were all a great team. I enjoyed working with a great front end tem. It was difficult when under staffed and busy."
good,A typical day at work i would ring up roughly 100 to 150 customers with a friendly attitude and smile. I learned how to stay calm when someone was Irritated and help them find what they were looking for with a calm attitude. Management would be at your side in a moments notice if they were needed or answer any questions that you couldn't answer(for example if the store was currently hiring or if Management could look an item up for the customer. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the codes for all the fruits and vegetables. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people and helping someone out with finding a certain item.
good,"The managers I dealt with directly were amazing. The job was rewarding and the days passed incredibly fast. The only issue was each manager had their own idea of what they wanted. Since the managers worked 3 on and 3 off, one would come back and be upset you did something the way the previous manager had told you to do it. It was cyclical, not know what one manager wanted to the other was quite stressfull."
good,I worked in almost every department and rarely worked in the same 2 consecutively each night. I also usually got stuck doing the tasks no one else wanted to.
good,worked keeping the store clean.  organized maintenance storage area to make it easier to locate items needed to clean store.  co-workers were great.  on the go once clocked in.  management was insistent on worker taking breaks.
good,Walmart provided me with a lot of hands on experiences. They gave me the opportunity to grow in different areas and contribute my personal work experience.
good,Good Company and haves great benefits.  It is a lot of perks and also very diverse.  Management is treated good.  Working at this company I had a great experiences.
good,"Great fast-paced, friendly environment. Growth within the company also great benefits! Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers and make sure they receive the best service!"
good,"My experience at Walmart is fun, yet challenging. I look forward to spending my day at a job were I can learn, and teach to others as well."
good,"En esta empresa casi todos los días se trabaja bajo presión por la cantidad de clientes que tiene, aprendí a trabajar el sistema smart, también a buscar distintas opciones para poder dar soluciones a los clientes, la gerencia estaba en disposición de apollar cuando era necesario, considero que con mis colegas nos hizo falta organización, hubo falta de comunicación y retroalimentación,lo que menos me gusto era tener que desarrollar trabajos pesados de limpieza y la rotación de gente ya que esto implicaba una carga extra de trabajo, lo que mas me gusto fue todo lo que pude aprender ademas de tratar con mucha gente."
good,"A typical day at work is busy, everyone are picking items for a order and everyone is playing their part."
good,i really got along great with all of my coworkers including management with the exception of one. no one got along with her and everyone felt like she was attacking them but with the exception of her working for walmart was not a bad experiance and i really enjoyed working for them.
good,"Not enough options to enable associates to move forward and promote healthy life style, especially from a multi-billion dollar company."
good,I enjoyed the job very very much. My co-workers and managers were very social. Good experiences wit all the customers. Contact me for more information.
good,"Had to get products ready to out onto the sales floor. Had to do picks which means every product I pulled of the shelf was counted as a pick. Other people I worked with were doing over 150 picks in 1 day, and I was lucky if I got over 50 a day. I worked slower than everyone else cause I didn't want to break products or get hurt. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, they made working there fun."
good,"Always a fun place to work. There are advancement options, but like any other company, it is up to you get there. I learned alot of skills that I can pretty take anywhere with any other company. Some co workers are ok, but others are just there because they have to work. Typically, you are super busy at all times of the day, but its a good thing. The best part is that everyone in the building has a sense of humor, so there was always laughter in the building."
good,"some managers are excellent and some are rude and non supportive. you start out with a lot of hours but then they get cut. you're allotted and extra 14 minutes to clock in if you're not clocked in by your exact time, but then that could be used against you. they dont accept doctor's notes so if you have to miss work becuase of a doctor's appointment then that could count against you as well. its typically a good place to work if you just do your job and stay out of trouble. walmart does a lot of fundraising for the children's miracle network."
good,"Fun place to work,Managers some of them are fair and a pleasure to work for. Co workers are fun learning about different cultures, there is no hard part of the job for me , cause I get along with everyone.Making my customers smile and happy with their experience with Walmart."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for because there is advancement in the company. I was extremely blessed to have the opportunity to work for this company.
good,"This job wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst either, Lunch breaks are an hour and management could be a bit better but it wasn't horrible."
good,"Walmart is really ordinary to me because i did it or worked there. I enjoyed this job not only because it was different from what i would normally do but also because i met alot of diverse and interesting people there,i also found that a few people that i went to high school with worked there as well. Thank God for the job but im ready to do something else."
good,"I think Walmart is a good place to work at, with a nice compensation plan and benefits. I do not think this is a great career job but as a part-time job it could be a good place."
good,the workers where team players they heped the new emplyoyees with job training and get the hang of the job discritions as well as feel conterble in the work enviorment
good,"Wal-Mart could be a Good Place to work for, their Human resources is Kind and professional. also its a place that teaches to interact with different types of personalities, I would work at walmart again if I have to,"
good,Working here gave me more than enough experience I needed with working the register and being able to receive knowledge I'm the different departments.
good,"I have learned how much I enjoy helping people. I really enjoy seeing what a difference I can make in people's lives. "
good,"Typical day is always different. Sometimes would work maintenance, or IMS or stocker."
good,"management was good very supportive! loved helping customers, learned new skills how to run front end, how to multi-task,"
good,Walmart had a lot of false promises most of the time management went back on there word and would careless about there associates even though the management was hard the job was very easy time would always fly by while i worked there it was quite enjoyable
good,I enjoy working for walmart. Its like any other retail store. The company is ok to its employees. They could pay more. I have learned a lot about the retail business and learned more customer service basics. I was used to customer service on the phone and this is more hands on which is nice.
good,"Everyday customer service made this job much better, that would be the most enjoyable part.Opportunity to meet new people from every walk of life. Keeping inventory stocked and up-to-date. Making daily fresh salads, sandwiches, as well as rotisserie chicken with many more. The hardest part of this job would be not enough equipment to get the job done in a timely manner."
good,"Very strict guidelines"
good,A typical day at work is to get your assigned department then restock the merchandise. Co-workers are for the most part great. Would be a much better job if the pay was a little better.
good,"No flexibility in management. This would lead to either too many people at one job, or too few. Often decisions made by management didn't fit the actual situation."
good,"There was rarely anything typical about any particular day.  Each day was something new.  Over the course of employment I was able to advance from a crew member to Assistant Manager and learned many things along the way, including food safety, for which I was awarded a ServSafe certificate by the State of Wisconsin.  The GM had slowly become lax over the years causing many differences between us.  The co-workers were generally friendly and accepting of me.  The hardest part of my job was trying to get things done that needed to be, while the GM continually showed degraded performance.  The best part of my job was that I made friends with a majority of the employees, of which many of those friendships exist still today."
good,"I was taught how to operate every single department in the store. I enjoyed completing different tasks because it made my day go by faster. I was constantly busy with returns, helping customers, taking phone calls, or organizing my department. The hardest part of the job was the same reason why I grew to enjoy it, there was not enough employees for each department so at times the work load would be heavy but I always managed to complete all tasks on time. I enjoyed helping customers and answering their questions about products. I felt good after helping a customer find what they were looking for."
good,"very good job to have, I was a sales associate in the dry food section so I did was stock the shelves up whenever they got low. Great company to rise up in"
good,Wal-part customer call service was a great place for a summer job and to make some quick cash.  The hours were great and plentiful.  The only true drawback was the backlash received sometimes by unhappy customers.
good,"Was a liively experience working with the public, develobettercustomer service skills. I personally chose the job because it kept me active."
good,"Great training programs ,Great leadership and accountability.Clean working enviroment..You are given all the tools and support needed to flourish and be a asset to the company."
good,Getting set up in order to open doors @ 6A.M..  I learned to be self conscience of what is said and how it is said.  The management team and co-workers are all individuals whom come together to help each other out in difficult moments that help is needed.   Hardest part of job is when company policies change and not every one is on same page.  Meeting new employees.
good,"Wal-Mart was a ok place to work at as far as the people i came in contact with there......Great hrs. and was located right down the street from me which made it better for me.....Management was ok even though I had a few problems with a few Support Managers out there that didn't know how to talk to people right....Other than that, I really enjoyed every night I went in to work...."
good,"J'ai toujours aimé magasiner chez Wal-Mart, bon qualité et prix, de bon spéciaux, diversité de choix et bien accueillie par les vendeurs et service à la clientèle,  un entreprise que je vais faire des courses sans aller à 3 magasins.  Je le recommande à tous. "
good,"This place of employment has given me the opportunity to expand on my organizational skills, multitasking ability, and to develop the ability to work in a stressful environment where l keep customer service a priority and complete any responsibilities of the day to the best of my ability."
good,"Pros"
good,"The benefits are wonderful, it is so much fun working with lift equipment. The job is great but the management needs to come back down to earth with those who are in the position that they were once in."
good,"Like any place of work management can make or break a job, There are far to many members of management overall at any store. There are of course good and bad, but there is alot of miss communication and crossed direction to employees. Overall a good place to work, just not a long term solution for me."
good,A typical day consist of misdirection and uncertainty due to lack of leadership. Management could be better by hiring qualified applicants. The jobs is easy but the co-workers around you make it bearable. The hardest part of the job is dealing with lack of leadership.
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with different type of people and different attitudes. Staying positive and a good vibe, I enjoy my  job working in the money center I enjoy my customers that i see on a normal bases I love when my customers recognize and ask for me personally."
good,"I worked graveyard shift for a few years. It was quiet and easy to focus to get work needed done. Physical job, but pleasant. I enjoyed helping other Sales Associates and Supervisors in other departments in the store. Customers I worked with was interesting, based on their response to finding out of my hearing loss. Some were great, and some were rude. Overall, I enjoyed working at a fast paced workplace."
good,Its very fun and productive working here. There is nothing i love more then to come in and see everyone's smiling faces. Everyone is nice and helping when ever you need them.
good,"Un dia típico en el trabajo que siempre había mucha presión  ya que ser el cajero gral. es un carga ya que se maneja mucho dinero."
good,happy to work with the people around me. good envirenment. just unfair management. Great work experience.hardest part about working was experience.
good,"Taking care of customers needs. Processing returns, money orders, cashing checks, money transfers, running registers."
good,"Wal-Mart is an interesting to work due to the variety of people that come through the store. It is productive because of the amount of product that we sell. Some days it is extremely busy other days it is not that busy. There is an opportunity to grow with in the company sometimes it takes a little while but it is there. I like working there because you stay very busy all the time, between the customers and the work we do every day. I work third shift and it fits me better than mornings. The managers are good to work for and they will work with you if you have a problem. They try to help as much as they can. My co-workers are great to work with too. The hardest part of the job is some of the lifting we have to do some of which is the reaching. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and seeing familiar faces that go through the check out lanes."
good,"There were hour lunches and plenty of opportunities to move up. There was almost too much management, but that also meant that there was always someone to bring questions to. Wal-Mart is restructuring as I type this, removing one of the mid-management levels. The people were friendly too."
good,"When I first began at Wal-Mart, it had a supportive management team, decent pay, and good hours. However, as the store environment changed, there was not any room for growth and advancement"
good,"Pay and benefits are good. Hours are long but expected especially with members of management. Depending on your store location, workload varies. Some stores get shopped hard, some not too much."
good,"Half decent place to work. Management can be trouble, but generally helps you out. If you have questions for your job you can ask but they generally like people to know what they are doing and can get annoyed easily."
good,"This is not a bad place to start out, there is the potential for advancement and the management team at my store is fairly supportive with things like training and assistance.The benefits are decent and include things like annual raises and paid vacation time, healthcare, 401K, stock purchase options, as well as a myriad of discounts on things you wouldn't expect."
good,"Overall Walmart is a great place to work very friendly seems to want to help you in anyway they can. A place you can learn a lot of new skills and utilize them right away. Its a place that you feel like you could advance really quickly with all the new skills you will learn on a weekly basis."
good,"Es una buena empresa hay un buen ambiente de trabajo y tal vez hasta tenga buenas prestaciones aunque no muy buenos sueldos, también cuenta con lideres para mi gusto unos capaces y otros no tanto."
good,"The Walmart method is to take minimal labor and try to make the departments function with very low labor costs.  In my opinion, this does not work for this type of business."
good,had alot of fun working for walmart until they wrongfully firing me and become more stricter when working.when working day shift it wasnt as busy as i thought it would be alot of the time your schedule would be getting cut but being overnight you stayed busy which i love and got to learn alot of new things and see as different lifestyle at night.
good,"Learned the job quickly and was training new employee within a month. Most difficult part of this job was the dis-connectivity between different teams and company for example working money gram, networking, hardware then software."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Wal-mart, but I just wish they would have kept all part timers the opportunity to continue to have health and vision insurance."
good,It's a great place to work for only If you suck up to management or you work your butt off and watch what you do or say in Walmart cause your job is at risk even if your full time or not
good,"High level of expectation. Stress is high,one is always in demand. The customers expect perfection. Co-workers are great. I gained a great deal of knowledge."
good,"It would have been better had they not cut hours and make me drive 45 minutes for 20 hours a week and expect me to be able to live off of that. That's slavery, not employment. Had to find new employment. Other than that, the company was good with benefits, just takes way too long to get them, and advancing in the company is easy. That is one thing I really like."
good,"I enjoy working with the public and meeting all types of people. I enjoyed my co workers and supervisors. They always showed concern for the individual. Ive learned to be patient and have understanding for every situation. This job taught me many skills, from assisting customers needs to helping coworkers complete task. I was taught how to work alone and on a team."
good,Well my work day was very difficult. My job was to get the bakery department ready with fresh donuts and breads and muffins ready by 7:am every morning.There was always a very good team work from my co-workers at all times.I did so well I recieved awards on many occasions.
good,I loved working for Walmart as an automotive technician I learned a lot and had fun and enjoyed the work I was doing knowing it was helping others.
good,"Management was hard working and allowed for student life to be a priority while in school."
good,"The company is a good company to work for, The benefits could be better but overall the co-workers are what holds the company together. The atmosphere can be exciting at times, and others non enthused."
good,For the most part walmart  gave good benefits my schedule stay the same I had a very hard time trying to move up in the company I was with them for five years
good,"Thorough SOPs, lunch premiums given for pharmacists, recipe for overall success. However, changing upper management (3x in a year) did not help establish a pharmacy with good clients and 90% new pharmacy employees."
good,"Working at WAL-MART taught me a lot about team work. Everyday our team of unloaders would work together to unload the trucks full of merchandise.  Some days were more physically demanding than others, depending on the amount of items on the trucks.  I met some very nice people who I had the privilege of working with. Some managers were more easy-going than others. Sometimes there were conflicts between us, but thankfully we had an excellent team leader who was very respectful and helped us to resolve the issues we had."
good,I always have fun working there with my friend I always get calls from them for working overtime because they know I work hard for this company.
good,"My typical work night would start with me stocking grocery products for the first hour and a half then, I would be sent the registers to give them there break.  After that I would start stocking clothing item and if someone would need fabric cut I would stop what I was working and take care of that customer then return to my previous and quite often I would have to help another customer in electronic or some other locations in the store.  When the registers would back up I jump on a register to get the customers out more efficiently or help someone with a return if no one else was available."
good,"Co-workers are the greatest, I enjoyed stocking and being able to make a difference with the customers. The hardest part was putting up with the management and their unfair demands."
good,I worked here for 3 and a 1/2 years and the hardest part of the job was not having enough help to complete the job correctly.
good,I did basically the same thing everyday I worked it got boring after awhile. I learned inventory management and placement.
good,"Breaking down pallets for distribution to aisle's, rotating and stocking aisle's, moving from aisle to aisle as needed per night.  placing stock into backstock and pulling out as needed"
good,"Most day you start out by working pick carts, helping people find what they are looking for. Co-worker are good about helping each other out and management are on the floor so if you have any question they are there to help. The company every few months will order pizza, or do hot dog and burgers for the employees just as a way to say thank you for all your work."
good,"This Walmart reflects the heart of our city, in both it's worker but in the environment.  The co-workers I had the fortunate time to be with are diligent and hard working."
good,I am constantly moving and busy. Management is super nice and appreciates the staff. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Hardest part is heavy lifting. Most enjoyable is Customer Interaction.
good,"Overall, a typical day at Walmart on the overnight shift, was fast paced with a lot of work. Between the freight and the customers, I was busy all shift. Because of this, I learned to pace myself so that I could handle my department(s) and assist customers. The hardest part of the job was nothing, the job was easy to me in every aspect. Management was helpful and approachable. My co-workers were wonderful."
good,"Overall working for Wal-Mart was ok. There were very few times that I had a problem while working there with the management or my crew."
good,"Foi minha primeira experiencia profissional, aprendi várias coisas pois cada mês tinha um relatório para mudar o setor , a direção da empresa é ótima, os colégas de trabalho era da turma do senac onde faziamos curso todas as segundas e terças, a parte mais dificil não era o trabalho e sim o horário dos dias de cursos não conseguia consiliar com os horários dos meus estudos. A parte mais agradavel, era o atendimento ao publico estar sempre disponivel para atender o cliente."
good,good company but needs assistance on trying to get everybody motivated to do things. Work always falls on certain people while other loaf around the whole day trying to do as little as possible.
good,It was overall a cool place to work. Some people worked well together others didn't. Management bumped heads a few times. To me they were cool though. Everybody just wanted things to run smoothly. This is for the one I worked at. We got along for the most part and got things done accordingly.
good,"I started as an overnight stocker.  Primarily responsible for the cereal isle."
good,"Overall it's a nice place to work that doesn't have any higher education requirements. It is hard work, a lot of physical labor. I work part time on the weekend shift which is Saturday and Sunday 5am-5:30pm. At my warehouse, the load would often be heavy to where we stayed until 6:30pm very often. Good pay and insurance. They also have other benefits like scholarships and discounts."
good,This job has its ups and downs but it can get stressful at time but its overall a great company. I was taught great customer service skills. Its a fairly easy job and I love my coworkers. Now as for Management they need some improvement
good,Walmart is a very fast-paced environment with lots of prospect for career advancement.  On the job training is provided to ensure that employees succeed at what they do
good,I arrived early everyday and started work on my work according to priority. I have learned to be flexible to change and to work harmoniously. My co-workers and myself worked well together. I found sometimes the stress level high but I had good work hours..
good,"As an employee worker at Walmart it has been quite a learning experience. In attending this occupation was my first retail store job. I had many duties from the beginning of my shift to the end. A typical day on the job would be properly storing the clothes in their proper places. In the same time assisting customers with their personal questions and any issues of finding things located in the store. During the work hours I enjoy the company and assistance from other co-workers. It helps get the job duties done faster and more adequately. The hardest part of the job is keeping clothing areas clean and approachable for shoppers. The most enjoyable part is seeing the aftermath of good zone and organizing. It makes me feel good to know that I know how to do the job I applied. I've learned that in situations being flexible worker helps the whole team. The management supervises sporadically and  let's workers work independently. Overall management manages well in the store, and sets high goals. As an worker at Walmart the job prepares you for cooperate jobs and for any careers you have in the future."
good,the job was ok help was not so great and you could not move up as one would hope. a day at work was mostly me by myself doing a ton of work in lil time with almost lil to no help at all. Management was good but then again only if they liked you. the hard part was you never got noticed for the job you have done and more like helping others or just doing more than needed. i enjoyed the fact i learned new skills
good,When you look forward to coming to work for the customers knowing they always entertain you or being trained in everything in three months of being on the job you cant wait to see where they're going to place you today.I learned that you sometimes have to humble yourself when you may be having a bad day or the customer you have to know how to pick up on attitudes also so you know how to handle your customer. Making sure that if you handled that customer that you left such a great impact that they want to return!Knowing when to back down and get help if you need it is OK we all learn daily so getting help is not a down fall it takes an adult to know when to back up ans stand aside.Every job i ever did i make it fun most times you have to so you can look forward to doing it and fun doesn't mean not doing  your job or goofing off but it means to make the best out of every task you receive to the best of your ability so that when you go home you can say MY JOB IS COMPLETE.

good,"Enjoyed working with Wal-Mart for almost 22 years, had great experience in working in a fast paced environment with customers within the office and also at store level."
good,"people come and go but its not that bad of community. Customer service, managing stock, plugging in orders. I wish they cared about there employees a little more."
good,"Excellent swithces on coworking. Advances in work, familiar people and awesome days to work. Prudent workers and customers, needs more techincal advances."
good,"i had great co workers and made some amazing friends. I found the managment to be cold and un-caring, would have been much more enjoyable if it seemed as though the managment cared about the employees"
good,If you had to go to the washroom you had to put a reason code in the the register so someone could come n relieve u and could wait 20 minutes.  Part-timers should have weekends off too.  Not very family orientated.
good,"The people at this location made working there fun"
good,"The hardest part about working for Wal-Mart DC was the heat and cold. Order-filling required a lot of physical activity and endurance. The pay is really great, as well as the hours. The only downfall is that it is really hard to advance."
good,"Across the 19 years at the Walmart Canada Home Office I grew professionally. In particular my 'soft' skills when operating not only within a department setting but with other departments, satellite offices, store teams, vendors,  government bodies and the public. The main lesson I took away that, whatever your position is professionally, you have a customer. The key to success is realizing that customer and placing your focus on meeting their needs. Also required is an ability to react to, re-prioritize and address multiple tasks on a frequent, often emergency basis. I believe these skills are transferable to the Credit Valley Hospital environment."
good,"Clock in go straight to the deli, check notes left by manager, assists customers if any, clean up, and prep for the next shift, and also work freight."
good,"Good Company to work for and enjoy working with my co-workers but not very good hours and always part-time, and no benefits for part-time."
good,"Order fill and process outbound .dotcom orders"
good,"Had fun experience working here, got to cross train in a few different departments . Not bad place to work just doesn't pay that great."
good,"it is not the best job but it is not the worst either. Walmart offered flexible schedules and the managers were mostly reasonable,"
good,The constant changing pace of the work day allowed me to experience many adapting moments with various customers.You can gain pay raises every year according to performance. There are good learning opportunities and chances to move up throughout the store.
good,"- Los días en el trabajo son tranquilos. La gente es amable y amigable."
good,"I have been working Walmart for three month as pusher and typical day was great. I had a freedom of movement and i really enjoyed working other partners. The hardest part of this job is during snow or rainy days, because your jobs is organize this carts and move back and forth with cold."
good,This was a fast pasted job. But I learned to work and think fast on my feet. Management was helpful and always willing to educate the employee that need a little extra help. I worked with a wonderful group of people at this job. when I had to leave due to personnel family issues. The people I worked with and helping people that need some assistance was awsome.
good,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo constistia en hacer una junta de 10 minutos, conocer que es lo que vendiamos, saber que teniamos que mejorar y dar oportunidad a los integrantes de la empresa de expresar su sentir."
good,"I learned how to manage my time better working there, how to deal with customers on  daily bases. A typical day would be checking out customers, changing tires or unloading the truck when there is not enough workers in that day."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart would consist of none thing but face pase while keeping a smile on your face. The job enviornment especially with being a cashier was amazing. During holidays of course it would get a little busy and frustrating but every expierence was worth it. You learned how to deal with the situations better every time you would encounter a bad or good situation."
good,"Working with Wal-Mart, has definitely been an learning experience for me. I am an Electronics Sales Associate, however we have multiple other responsibilities. Working in retail has taught me how to be more versatile and valuable employee to the company. Not only do I work in the Electronics department, I also work in Wireless,  the Photo Lab, Site-to-Store/Pick Up Today, Cashier (when needed) etc My co-workers made me feel like I was important, and working with Wal-Mart is like working with a big family. The hardest part of the job would be making sure that every customer get the same amount of attention, it can be challenging when its busy; which is a majority of the time. The most enjoyable part of working with Wal-Mart is when customers are satisfied with the service we provided."
good,Customer Service. Handle request for merchandise from the Inventory System. Binned items into the Inventory System.
good,"fast moving 15 plus employees to oversee, enjoyed the merchandising aspect of my days. definately learned to multitask, my list that i would make forr myself for a day usually involed atleast 20 items to be done for my shift. i trained my associates to think ahead for the next step and the next person so i was easier."
good,"Em resumo o dia de trabalho se baseava em rotinas de conferir preços e produtos em estoque, limpeza e decoração do setor, abordagens criativas aos clientes para aumentar as vendas e confecção de produtos."
good,It's typical customer service work dealing the general public at large. It's pretty cut and dry customer service work.
good,"Working for Walmart is like building a family.  I see a lot of the same people everyday, we all work toward the same goal each day, Customer Service.  My typical day is to arrange people greater breaks, bring loans, and assist cashiers with questions.  The hardest part of my job is holding my cashiers accountable and having to tell honest customers that I can not help them.  The most enjoyable part of my day is getting compliments on my cashiers and delivering the messages to them and upper management.  I love working with my fellow CSMs and my direct supervisor, Assistant.  However working with upper management is very difficult. They are very condesending and dregrading.  Constantly disrespectful."
good,"Wal-Mart is slow, boring, and not very productive. I feel as if I am simply a cog in the machine that can be replaced at any time, and the managers do not hesitate to let you know that."
good,"A typical day on the job would be making cash,check, debit, and wic transactions on the register. Assuring the best customer service. I would sometimes help blind customers shop. I learned alot from working retail that happened to be near the deaf and blind school. I learned how to help the ones with blindness shop. I learned how to run a register, do refunds, and the procedures it takes to close the store up. I loved all of my coworkers they was all very nice and helpful. Management could have been better, they seemed to not care to much about employess that needed certain availability changed. I really enjoyed helping others, and working with all of the nice coworkers and customers. Nothing was hard about the job."
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy is a very fast pace productive work place with an ever changing subject matter at hand.  At times can be very stressful but very rewarding in the fact that you can be very much a help to your patients by educating them with medicinal and insurance knowledge. I have enjoyed learning all about medicines,and how to help patient with product knowledge. I have made many personal friendships with my customers and enjoy serving them.  The hardest part of my job is standing all day."
good,I enjoyed the years I worked with Walmart. they treated me with respect and caring. Walmart has a good employee environment and the customer comes first attitude. Management treats associates with respect and consideration.
good,Wal-Mart is a fun place to work if you have the right managers. Some of the managers have no personable skills and can be very rude. Overall you stay busy and have fun while doing it.
good,the thing about walmart that I don't like is that no one likes to take initiative and get things done. everything seems to be pushed off onto someone else. if you are trying to take initiative its difficult to find someone willing to help you with things you don't know how to do. this issue is not within the pharmacy itself. it comes from backroom management.
good,"working for Walmart is not for everyone. management wasn't the best, but there were a few good managers. everyone is typically friendly. very flexible hours."
good,Productive and fun place to work with awesome co-workers. The enjoyable part of the job is if you do it for fun you will enjoy it.
good,"I probably jumped into this position without the proper knowledge to conduct the position.  I learned that I have a different style of managing people, and need to adapt to management expectations."
good,I have enjoyed my career at Walmart.  The company relies heavily on their Associates and compensates them accordingly.
good,"I have moved around departments learning each one very fast. frozen/dairy was mainly stocking. produce a lot of heavy lifting and cleaning. pharmacy was needing to know what is what, where its at, and how to help the customers.  the hardest thing working there is they expect to much from one person in one day, say you have pallets of freight to work, well you still need to scan depts. help customers, do the notes. I understand when they are good fast workers but when help or the tools are needed they should be presented. the most enjoyable part is definitely seeing the satisfaction on someone's face when you know exactly where something they're looking for is, or just tell them have a great day!"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was very fast paced and busy. There was always something new we had to learn. There was  always new customers. It was a learning experience, having to learn how to deal with many different types of customers. The worst part about this job was management. They where not well organized."
good,"At Walmart I scanned customer's items efficiently, while providing entertaining conversation. I sold credit cards and encouraged customers to sign up for the savings catcher program."
good,At Wal-Mart you are kept busy in so many ways for it being the number one retail company. You will meet a lot of people in your community that you will help and serve.
good,i worked long horrible hours and never got full time status or benefits. the benefits i did have were expensive. best thing about the job was the stock purchase plan
good,Never have the same type of day with the wide variety of customers and scenarios. We have a wide variety of customers so everyday is different. Having a great group of co-workers makes the days enjoyable.
good,I love working at Walmart helping all people look for things answering question and having fun. I really enjoy working on the truck and working the pallets.
good,Great people to work with. Friendly store. Poor upper and lower management. I learned how to multi-task and solve customer issues. Hardest part of the job is handling difficult customers. The most enjoyable part is being able to help a customer when they are unsatisfied with a product.
good,it was an ok job while it lasted with hardly any room to move up. unfourtantly i wanted to be a supervisor and wasnt even being considered
good,"I liked walmart, although the scheduling was a little bit wild management did a good job of making sure everyone had proper hours."
good,walmart wants you to live at there business. you dont have a lifeworking for them. you dont really make any money unless your n magement
good,"It was a good place to work, everybody was nice and people friendly. We are always on our feet assisting customers, restocking the shelves and coning the shelves. Each day it was something   new for use to do... we were either getting trained to run the register or learning how to run electronics."
good,Walmart is always busy. There is always costumers and you never get bored. Sometimes customers are harsh but you have to keep a smile on your face to make their shopping experience better.
good,alot is expected in a typical 8 hr shift to include possibly doing others jobs. benefits are ok pay stinks management is terrible to their employees at times customers
good,WalMart is a huge company-- their hours are pretty flexible and I would recommend them to anyone searching for part time hours or first time employment to go through them.
good,"I was only here for about two months, but I enjoyed being around products I knew a lot about and helping explain to customers more about said products."
good,"I liked the variety of the scope of my job - from being by myself in the office to being in the midst of chaos in the back room.  Built great relationships, and learned a lot as a first-timer in claims.  Willing to step in and help others.  Loved the family atmosphere when the store first opened."
good,"A typical day at work consists of a few dozen automotive oil changes, Also consists of a handful of tire changes, rotations, mounting and the occasional flat repair.  While employed there i learned how to perform headlight restorations on vehicles and numerous other helpful tricks. Working here was a fun experience because everyone had a good sense of humor even the shop managers as well. The hardest part of this job is keeping the shop from getting messy throughout the day from being around all the oil and grease. Being able to work with people you get along with and work productively with them and still be able to"
good,A goal driven and ambitious workplace. A good workplace culture with all people on a singular goal in mind.  The customer.
good,A typical day was very fast paced and demanding. The location i worked at had a lot of foot traffic at all hours. I learned to work at a fast pace and to do so efficiently. management cared about their employees and customers. For the most part everyone worked well with each other and contributed to help others when it was needed. What i enjoyed most was customer interaction and leaving the customer feeling satisfied and happy at the end of their experience.
good,"The day is always though provoking. Management was excellent, and co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the day is typically the hour when things get busy and there may not be enough coverage. The most enjoyable is how willing everyone is to assist and make the job that you were assigned easier."
good,"The company is a great place to work for people in the right positions -- as I'm sure is true with any organization. However, it's easy to get siloed into  specific areas and those are usually the least enjoyable ones. "
good,"enjoyed serving the customers, helping them in anyway. management was not always understanding of situations. didn't seem very concerned with the employees more with the customers. didn't agree with that ideal."
good,A great place to work management is very helpful and fast to help you. Most enjoyable part would have to be helping customers.
good,"As a department manager first priority is to count the outs, then make manual picks for any product that is completely out , if in the back room ,make the pick. if not make sure you order it. Then as the department manager you go and get your own manual picks and restock them on the sales floor. Throughout the rest of the day make sure your end caps and all displays are up to par. and make sure your BAM screen is complete"
good,I had a wonderful experience working for walmart. I would do it again. It was only seasonal and was so devistated when my turn was gone
good,"Walmart es una empresa mundial, pero se aprende mucho ahí desde como empacar los alimentos asta como es que llegan a las manos de los clientes, muy buen ambiente de trabajo con personal altamente calificado para todos los puestos desde el carnicero asta los de aba rotes, muy buenos asesores de como poder ayudar mas rápido a los clientes para que sus regresos sean mas frecuentes por la velocidad y calidad de los precios"
good,"Overall wal-mart is a decent place to work. The benefits are ok if your a full time employee, if you're part time they are no so great. You have to be able to multi task."
good,Walmart had great benefits but the management there was rude and unhelpful. I loved the work I did and the hours I worked but sometimes the job could be quite stressful.
good,Wal-mart was busy almost everyday so there was never really a dull moment. I learned different ways to display customer service. Most of the managers were helpful when needed. My co-workers and I usually worked in teams when possible so I approved of that. The  hardest part of the job was surely the harsh weather days. the best part was meeting new people and being able to work outside.
good,"I worked 3rd shift from 10pm-7am. I never got the weekends off unless I requested it off. They never hired enough people to work on 3rd shift maintenance. The management at the store, on a select few managers knew what they were doing while the other managers didnt have a clue on walmart policies or culture. The hardest part of the job was when the floor scrubbers would break and they wouldnt fix them for 6 months at a time. The only positives out of wal-mart is my co-workers I got along with, and the few managers i got along with and the benefits that i got through the company."
good,"My typical day at Wal-Mart involved contact with the public.  Scanning goods for purchase and helping them to find items they were interested in purchasing."
good,"Good stepping stone to career focusing."
good,Enjoyable thing in this job is: it is challenging and rewarding.   There is a lot to learn and know for this job.  Coworkers are good.  They enjoy working there for the most part.  Management is good.
good,This job was good to have when you want to constantly keep busy since there was always something to do. The customers were many and the workers were fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was the high number of people with a management title. Which made it harder for workers to do their jobs. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking and helping the random customers that come in daily.
good,A typical day at work for me is organing the cooler and stocking merchandise along with opperating a forklift. The hardest part of the job is time mangement because we are short of workers.
good,"A typical day at work was an enjoyable experience for the most part. It was easy to make friends, everyone there is very nice. I learnt how to deal with people and broaden my retail and work experience. Management was decent. Most of my coworkers were amazing! Very friendly and willing to help with anything. The hardest part of the job was dealing with costumers that weren't satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to do new things."
good,"Different from store to store."
good,It's an ok place to work though sometimes the higher-ups seem to think that one person can do the job of three people for some reason.
good,"While working at Walmart, I was treated fairly and received wages that were above that of many other positions at similar places of businesses. The work took its toll physically, but I worked the same hours everyday."
good,"Loved working here, didn't get many hours. Had a lot of friendly co-workers and always delivered great customer service."
good,"A typical day at work was usually chaos for me. Being able to perform so many jobs there i would often do the jobs of 5 different employees in order to help the store run smoothly. Including but not limited to: cashiering during busy times, Slicing meat when there was either a call out in deli or a break/lunch was needed to be given, Down stacking when a lot of freight had arrived in store, Stocking during down time to help keep the shelves filled with the product customers needed, Cleaning the bathroom when ANY kind of mess was made, keeping the break room clean and usable, Pushing carts when we either had no cart pusher scheduled or the cart pusher was on break in order to make sure customers had carts available to them and  fixing broken/damaged/vandalized store property through out the day."
good,"Wal-Mart was my first real job, and it was a great first job. I know many people have negative things to say about the way Wal-Mart treats their employees, maybe I just got lucky with the store I worked at. My management was fantastic, I absolutely loved them. My co-workers were great as well. I worked as a customer service team member and that was the worst part about working for Wal-Mart. I always got rude customers or people who were just trying to get some money by returning things they had never purchased. I may not have always had the best customers but it taught be how to have amazing customer service skills and how to handle difficult customers, and for that I will always be happy I worked at Wal-Mart."
good,"Follow daily routine, I learned a lot working with this company it has given me the tools that I need for my career with Asset Protection."
good,"empresa boa de trabalhar ,salários em dia,benefícios para o associado,aprendir muito proficionalmente"
good,"A typical day at pharmacy is busy with patients dropping-off prescriptions, enter all the information into Kroll system, process it and fill the prescriptions. "
good,"i loved working here. if it wasnt for being part time and no benefits i would stay here no doubt. sometimes theyre rude customers, but the job is laid back and very comfortable."
good,The job was not bad but the workplace was a bit negative. I learned how to lead by example by not following the crowd. The hardest thing was that management caused the most drama. The most enjoyable part of my job was working inventory.
good,"During my time working at Walmart I have picked up on many skills such as organization with stalking shelves on the floor and in the freezer. Time management, by making sure all the bread is baked in the morning before the store opens and also making sure my tasks are done before I leave to go home. Customer service, by answering the phone to take bread or cake orders, also assisting any customers out on the floor. I also learned about Leadership by training any new employees and making sure everything is done before everyone goes home for the day. I have enjoyed working at Walmart because I have met allot of friendly people however I felt that I was pushed more to be the Manager of my department and it was very stressful but I learned quickly how to handle it to make it work out in the end."
good,I was a cart collector so that pretty much explains it all there wasn't much help when someone called out but I enjoyed the hours they gave me along with the pay and ability to work overtime
good,"Working at walmart i gained a lot of experience in all different areas. i worked stocking groceries, shipping and handling electronics, basically anywhere they needed me they knew they could place me, knowing im a fast learner and i have a lot of useful skills. i enjoyed working here it tought me a lot."
good,"Average day was always with a high-functioning system adapting to employees and customers and all treated as equal and like individuals. Upon orientation, I had learned what it meant to be an individual of a workplace that demands its customers always be served with satisfaction no matter how that it is to be done.  I had not much in management except to get a feel of a managers position by performing duties that were more of a rendezvous of higher responsibilities and what being a manager of a super retailer meant to the community.  In addition to my job duties, my co-workers were not as attentive or seemingly interested in their position so I tended to take over and be doing more than one's work to show my initiative and that I deserved the job more than they did being abundant with my performance apertures.  Truthfully after all is finished, being so hard working, I would say the hardest part was going home because I loved being there more than home due to how sociable people were in comparison and how I was treated also.  Finally, the most enjoyable thing about the job was simply being able to make a difference in the lives of both customers and my manager(s), supervisor(s) with a sense of humor and fulfillment as an individual working in a place of a great shopping experience."
good,"Wal-mart of course is the place where you go if your just starting to work and you need the potential experience to move on with other jobs. Wal-mart does not pay their employees well, but pays them minimum wage. Working their gave me customer service skills that I would have not gotten anywhere else."
good,My experience with this company is that it was very flexible and I met some very nice people. Some of the nicest managers.
good,"I enjoy my position at Walmart.  The stress level is minimal and management has been very willing to work with me to meet my life's challenges.  I would recommend working at Walmart to anyone who can physically deal with the stress on the body.  All positions required standing on your feet.  However, they were more than willing to provide me a stool as a Cashier."
good,It was a great place to work but the scheduling was not always beneficial. Management was ok. The typical day was always different and the hardest part was when you had two managers tell you different things they wanted done at the same time. Meeting people was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I've always believed the success of a store is controlled by the management team.  I've worked in several Wal-Mart stores with various types of managers.  There are the ""Hand On"", ""Dictator"", ""Doer"" and ""Passive"" to name a few."
good,"-friendly people"
good,Wal-Mart has been a good company to work for but the management is poor. It seems like the management doesn't really care about what there employees have to say.
good,"I started off as an overnight remodel tempy worker. I worked so hard they decided to keep me. I worked at Wal-Mart for a year and two months. A typical day as an overnight stocker was great. I made sure the area I was in was neatly, and in order. I've learned  always put your best foot forward because you never know whose watching you. The management team was great, they made sure we were comfortable, secure in the area we stocked. My co-workers and I worked as a team. Once I was finish working my area I made sure I helped another co-worker. The hardest about the job was dealing with attitude sometimes. The most enjoyable about the job was working as a team mate to stock."
good,I liked the culture of Wal-Mart very nice. Hours weren't bad at all I enjoyed my time there. I worked with almost every department and every one I was in I noticed they shared the same values wal mart is a very honorable company
good,"Walmart offers a place of employment when most other company's are unwilling to hire, they offer benefits while not the greatest coverage but they offer the three main insurances medical,dental, visual. the employment there is well looked into coworkers are friendly and helpful at most times. however where they strive in benefits and employees their management team suffers i have never been employed by such and unhelpful, lazy, non-understanding, team of mangers in my entire career. mangers would spend most of their days locked in an office socializing with each other and playing games on their cell phones not giving a single care for the employees or the loyal customers at Walmart. if it weren't for the number of dedicated employees who i may add are extremely underpaid for their services and the fact that they offer very competitive prices for their merchandise, i feel that this company would have fallen victim to bankruptcy many years ago."
good,"My job was anything but boring at Walmart, I worked with a lot of people. Both customers, fellow associates and managers. I was responsible of a wide variety of areas and expected to know a great deal of each of them. I was also tasked with training our new associates with how to complete their own tasks and make the sale and provide quality customer service. This was not an officially appointed task, but one passed onto me due to lacking quality of the current designated 'trainer' for my area. That wasn't the issue, I loved the busy work life, training new associates how I want them to get things done. Though there were things that were out of my control, associates who had been there longer who were just lazy. Skeleton shifts the entire week, with mounds of work to get done, and really only just myself to work it. I was given very little time to actually train my associates, once or twice a week with each individual and I don't feel as if that's a sufficient time. Especially when my senior associates would train them themselves, it was counter productive to what I wanted to do. Over all, I love the work load Walmart can offer me. Though the lack of management and organization was plain and I didn't have the job title to really do much about it."
good,"Handling customers. Helping customers. Selling to customers. Smiling, providing custermer service is number one at walmart, stocker, cashier, sales floor"
good,"I liked being a Cashier, I enjoy talking to customers and help them with their purchase requirements. Our department manager was very supportive, always ready to offer valuable advise whenever I need one."
good,I worked as a part time cashier for two years. I loved it! I got regular evaluations on my work performance. You make your schedule. I had to wait two years to get benefits. I would go back in a heart beat.
good,The hardest part of the job is when your order filling and the roll rack is stuck a the back of the rail and your not allowed to clime in and pick off of the pallet
good,"Great coworkers.i had long lunches and breakes, my team of managers were always there to help and i kept busy. i loved my shift because i always had time after work to get things done."
good,Hours and pay vary for every associate.  Need to be better pay structure for associates as a group not so biased.  Company has changed in large amount since i left.
good,I work overnight at walmart store and i work at backroom we normally do what we call picks for the shockers for them to pack it on floor and when they have done they bring their over stock back to us at the backroom for us to also bin it back.
good,"Every day is something new, which makes the job, never boring. Co workers are great, Management is great too i've never had an issue with any of them. It's a great place for students, and people trying to get back in the work force."
good,"Wal-Mart benefits were good.  Would still be there if it was not for my family problem.  Loved the people, culture and working conditions."
good,I learned how to change tires. Good co-workers.I really enjoyed changing oil. I had one manager I really loved working for.
good,"Got decent hours, were flexible about policies and management was cooperative. I would recommend this to anyone looking for temporary employment. The community was very warm and welcoming."
good,"A typical day is tiring but of course fun. You get to meet new people and help them with their problems when needed. As well as interact with amazing coworkers who are willing to help you learn, lift you up on rough days, and advance in the store. Management was not the best. But they were tolerable."
good,"I Enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart, because i never knew what i would be doing each day. I learned how to do a variety of things from unloading trucks and doing oil changes to prices changes and binning. I liked the managers at Wal-Mart personally, but as an whole i felt like they could have been more organized. My favorite part about working for Wal-Mart was meeting new people and customers everyday."
good,"Foi uma experiência empregatícia diferente. Foi a primeira vez que trabalhei em um supermercado. A empresa nos proporciona vários benefícios e não havia acumulo de trabalho, mas especificamente no meu setor havia uma dificuldade de diálogo com o gerente. No geral é uma empresa com grandes oportunidades, mas com dificuldades nas gerências."
good,"Working at Walmart is a nice place to work when it comes to the employees being able to talk and laughs while working . I learned a lot there( customer services skills, sorting items how to ring customer up). When it come to the management team they have employer that would get treated special. The hardest part about working in Walmart is not knowing where you will be doing that day meaning if you was hired as a cashier you might be working in another department. Being able to help customers as well as employees."
good,"Wal-Mart provided me a job when I had just moved to Oklahoma, and the economy was down.  My coworkers were very nice, and it was a fun work environment.  There were also opportunities for advancement.  I enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical day at work, was usually stocking and helping customers. I learned how to handle a lot of customer service at Wal-Mart."
good,"The people that I worked with were fantastic. The home office, however, left a lot to be desired, as they constantly cut hours and left us with inadequate help."
good,"Over worked, management is bitter, no responses of requests, favortism, politics....Its hard not dreading to come in. Only a few months in and Im already telling other associates what to do.Everyone is unethical or either unmotivated.Everyones constantly complaing, hard to stay positive sometimes"
good,"° Uma troca de turno sem alterações."
good,"Working in the portrait Studio for which I am currently still with, has been a great learning experience.  Meeting all sorts of people with different request as to what they would like to see in their photos of whether its just their kids, or the whole family.  Ranging from rather traditional poses to more modern and fun.  I learned at lot about how to capture those moments that you would want to hold for a lifetime allowing for them to capture that through printed photos or a CD."
good,"I worked in multiple stores, in multiple states as well for over 10 years. I learned a lot working there in how to deal with difficult customers. As a department manager I am good at maintaining a department and following guidelines and understanding how to build customers' loyalty."
good,"A typical day of work consist of maintaining a fish aquarium and stocking. I learned how to properly stock and bin in merchandise.The management crew does their job accordingly but most of the time they are relaxed and non-communicative. Walmart employees tend to think they  are in higher positions, and doesn't like to keep their mouths and eyes out of other co-workers business. The hardest part of the job i would say would have to be is dealing with the management and staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is catering to all the customers and complying to their needs."
good,"every day was the same, clock in and go to some other department than your own. could not help but be cross-trained. great way to learn the store and other areas for advancement though."
good,A typical day at Walmart is very busy. Working at Walmart I have learned that not everyone appreciate what you do. The Management treats you will no respect. The co-workers are nice people and overall fun people to work with. The hardest part of this job was getting the managers to treat you the way they want to be treated. The most enjoyable part was staying on your feet constantly moving around and the customers you see on a regular.
good,"A Typical day at work"
good,We worked long hours and overtime seemed as though it would never stop. Your family became second priority and the pay wasn't worth it.
good,"rotina de trabalho corrida,mas muito enriquecedora nas atividades desempenhadas, pois assim obtive confiança e aprendi a trabalha em equipe e sob pressão. parte difícil era o cansaço e a agradável era as pessoas e o aprendizado pra vida"
good,"I worked for Walmart for over seven years. I saw a huge number of other associates come and go, and a few stay. I worked several different jobs within the company. Most of those whom complain about Walmart are those who have an ""I showed up, so I should be paid"" attitude."
good,"This was an enjoyable workplace with people that worked well together. There was a team feel to the organization. The job benefits were good and appropriate. I would have stayed, but I had a chance to buy a home in Spencer Iowa close to where my son, his wife and my three granddaughters live."
good,I knew it was temperary  I thought it would last longer than it did
good,"un dia tipico llegada al trabajo temprano en la mañana o tarde segun tu turno revisar  la sala con el jefe de turno para levantar los detalles antes de la apertura del local y efectuar el 4*1 ,imprimir informes para hacer los cambios de precio al alza o a la baja ,informe de inventario y inventarios ciclicos y efectuar todos los informes antes de la 13 hrs"
good,A fast paced environment with tremendous growth and exciting new direction
good,They are very helpful management is also good as well they come when you need help. The co-workers I had were great with stocking merchandise. Mostly the hardest part of the job was picking up televisions and moving the doors to get games out of the case for customers who wanted to purchase the item. Also the enjoyable part of the job was getting to know people you work with who were helpful and making it fun. What I have learn on the job is hard work pays off.
good,"I possess more than seven years of progressive experience in the retail field because of Wal-Mart. My history includes positions such as a Sales Associate, Supervisor, Manager and finally, promoted to Assistant Manager at Wal-Mart. I am very busy all day and constantly striving to do and learn more. The other associates are dedicated team players as well. The hardest part of the job are the hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I contribute in a positive and successful way."
good,"Assisting customers with direction of departments"
good,"Loved the work atmosphere, management needs to be reevaluated, need to hire more employees, supervisors under paid"
good,"A typical day at work would be a busy day of ringing up consumer products and making general, small conversation to insure satisfaction of customer."
good,A great place to work at with room to grow. Wouldn't mind working there again. Fast pace and great people. Get to meet all types of people as well as help them find what they need for whatever their needs are.
good,"The hours could have been a little better, but mostly it was ok"
good,Most of the people who work there are very nice but the pay is not very good.
good,"great quarterly bonuses, not great hourly wage. i worked in the freezer so extrememly cold conditons."
good,You come to work and u get free water outside for the work you do. i learned to grow a tolerance for extreme weather and muscles for all day work. the managers do care for your health but really don't associate with u. the hardest part of the job is the weather and dangerous of drivers in a parking lot. i enjoyed meeting new people and getting the skills and expericance.
good,"Advancement was rough, and seemingly somewhat forced. The store employees were all rather friendly and ince you get your foot in the door, so many possibilities open."
good,"Wal-mart is not the worst job you can have. If you make full time (which is hard to do in some cases) you have good benefits. Even if you are part time you get benefits after 1 year. My main problems with Wal-Mart are 1.) their point system, 2.) management. "
good,Although not with the company for long I felt my training was very good. I was given the freedom to work on my own early on but never left to flounder. I could always get my questions answered when needed. I was always expected to have very open availability but that came expected. I always felt I worked in a friendly environment in the cashier position.
good,"Typical day at work not stressful very laid back work environment "
good,A typical day at work was unloading trucks an product placement on the floor an shelves. Handled the drivers with their work load orders. Directed other employees on what to do delegated daily task. cleaned work area usually before an after the work day. helped other departments also.
good,"unload delivery trucks, stock freight, inventory control, customer service."
good,Walmart is an easy job. Only problem was management wasn't very helpful or friendly and the pay isn't worth having customers yell at you.
good,Typical day was enjoyable and different from hour to hour.  Never a dull moment.
good,"Wal-Mart is an awesome place to work, the only downfall is that they don't offer benefits for part time positions."
good,"managed a department, stocked shelves, ordered merchandise, did inventory, built displays, the management is great, always willing to listen and cared about employees, co-works were always fun, joking, acting silly, uplifting, the hardest part of the job was keeping up with stocking it seemed like there was never enough time to get it done, the best part of the job was the customers"
good,Knowledgeable friendly professional staff that has guided me through the world of optometry to become an essential part of the vision center team. They taught me how to properly handle sensitive personal information in accordance with State and Federal laws.
good,"- um dia de trabalho: estressante, mas ao final do dia totalmente gratificante"
good,"The place is good pay and ok hours, the management could be better, there are a great number of employs that real make it ok to work at Wal-Mart."
good,"verify and fill prescriptions. counsel patients, do yearly inventory. manage invoices and ordering"
good,"I enjoyed my job at Walmart. A typical night was pulling your inventory to be stocked on the shelves, floors, displays. I enjoyed doing the seasonal displays. The hardest part about the job was making sure that all merchandise was stocked properly."
good,"A typical day at Walmart as a jewelry coordinator, I will always come and check to see if there is any  merchandise I need to send off. I would check my counts on merchandise/place orders/set modulars/answer phones/file paperwork/customer service....etc.. I'm very friendly when it comes to making customers happy with the service that I give them. I enjoyed working at Walmart with the supervisors that I worked with. They always gave me good advice  working with Walmart to become a better person with working with customers. I'm always multi-tasking. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,I clocked in and got straight to work. Management was sometimes hard to find when clocking in and needing to know what register you need to go to.
good,i worked at Wallmart for two summers in my first summer i held a position in the Lawn and Garden department as a sales associate i worked as a cashier as well in my second summer at wallmart . I learned how to deal with all different types of customers there are a lot of different characteristics of people you will see in a typical day of work there . it was a great experience working for this company
good,"I have learned a lot from my job.People skills,management skills.How to treat associates.Management is awesome they treat everyone equal.I have the best coworkers.Its like one big family.The hardest part of my job is not being able to make holiday plans because we never close except for Christmas day.My favorite part is my coworkers and some of the customers I've grown to know over the years."
good,A typical day at work is learning ways to teach newer staff members how to work more effectively.The  managers are always alert and open for helping staffing members.
good,"Relatively easy work, nothing took much comprehending. Management wasn't the best at the store I worked at and it showed with their turnover rate. In terms of difficulty, none. My favorite portion of the job was definitely the people interaction I got."
good,I enjoy working with the public. I learn something  knew everyday. The only downfall would be slow times.
good,Teaches us a lot of patience while doing customer service which also motivates us to be more productive as there are timeframes within which a task has to be completed. Still each store gives it's employees scope for creativity in their respective departments and respects ideas and thoughts.
good,"I started in wal-mart part time as a stocker. When I went full time, I became a maintenance personel for 2 years. I went back to being an overnight stocker for the next 3 years. During that time I was able to become forklift qualified,cut keys, mixed paint and cut fabric."
good,"Working in the Electronics department you learn so much and there is always more to learn. We have to set mods, work freight, complete prices changes. The most important part is Customer Service and making sure they are buying what they need and understand how it works."
good,"fitting room, folding/hanging clothes, stocking frieght, cashiering"
good,"team work is necessary to empty the truck and to down stack all the items and also bring them to the sales floor.     "
good,Extremely busy as a cashier but fun speaking with a variety of customers.  Accurate handling of currency while maintaining excellent customer service.  Enjoyed having repeat customers and having the opportunity of working with a variety of managers.
good,"A typical day would be first going out grabbing carts, placing them near freezer section. Unload diesel using pellet jack. Unstack box and organize freezer products into baskets by row. This alows you to be more productive than congested with work. After products have been in place in freezer. I scan and tag my leftover product. Next i bin them in the freezer, this would be the hardest part of the job, standing in the freezer for 2+ hours.  My co worker that taught me was excellent and thorough. Most enjoyable was the envirement. Big open store. Nobody inside, keep in mind i worked overnight shift. New faces, old faces. love being around people."
good,Fun work enviorment and I enjoyed interacting with customers
good,"Resolve customer complaints via phone, email, mail, or social media."
good,"I enjoyed i would go back to working overnights , I went to work to do my job and nothing else. anything else I Couldn't tell you"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is teamwork.Chain retailer with a vast selection including groceries, apparel, home goods & electronics."
good,A typical day included dealing with happy and upset customers. I learned how to communicate with people without being too shy. My co-workers were nice but sometimes late. The hardest part of the job was dealing with complicated customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was I liked my supervisors.
good,"Wal-mart is really a great company to work for! The hardest part about working here is the people you have to deal with, Keep in mind, It is Walmart! Co-workers are generally friendly, but you can't rule out one bad apple! Having expirence at walmart is great, because employers see it as having A LOT of patience."
good,i moved up in the ranks and got to see some interesting stuff.  in the end it just wasnt for me but i do miss it sometimes
good,"A typical day? There is no typical day at Wal-Mart. Everyday is different, but basically you just have to adapt to being friendly to customers. It is only as hard as you make it, if you have a positive mindset the job should be fairly easy. It is exhausting, because of the constant activity and irregular schedule. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers. The management is not very good, they Sam Walton said, ""Listen to your associates."" Well, they never do. Every man for itself. They don't really treat us as a team. The harder you work, the less they appreciate it."
good,I learned how to multi task and also do more than one project through out my scheduled hours.
good,"I worked overnight on the maintenance team. Swept and moped the floors. Striped and rewaxed the floor when needed. Buffed scrubbed the floor for a shine. I learned how to do the waxing and cleaning of the floor. The female manager had a problem with male employees. Always gave us a harder time than the females. Coworkers were great to be around. My problem other than management was being told by the maintenance manager that I was pushing the dirt and dust the wrong way when I was sweeping the floor. I know this might be wrong but, I always liked to get the collectables I collected before anyone else had a chance to get them."
good,The hardest part of this job was trying to fit 8 hours of work into 12 hours worth of work that they expected you to have done.
good,This was a company I enjoyed working for. Friendly and helpful employees.  Excellent customer interaction.
good,"A typical day at work would be, clocking in walking to the back room setting the back up to unload the truck, after the unload of the truck, we pull what we unloaded to the floor, then finllaly, we clean the back and head home."
good,stayed busy most days   learned how to deal with difficult customers  management was ok loved my co-workers the different hours you were required to work no set schedule the most enjoyable part of the job was the people
good,"A typical day at work consists mostly of returning products for costumers, doing western union and helping costumers with whatever questions or complaints they might have. Working at Walmart really teaches how to be patient and how to stay calm and professional  no matter what costumers say to you or throw at you. Management is pretty great for the most part, they take good care of the store and the employees. My co-workers were the best part about working at Walmart, everyone got along great and it felt like a big family. The hardest part of working in costumer service is definitely dealing with difficult costumers. It can be very difficult to stay professional when faced with a costumer who is yelling and swearing at you about something that is not your fault. As I've mentioned before, the highlight of my job was always my co-workers, we were really like a family."
good,I liked working here but to get full time is like breaking thur a steel wall and then when u do get full time its not just certain days or hours and they cut hours all the time.
good,"It will get you by for a while, not enough hours and they only want to offer part time work."
good,I loved meeting new people and helping them with whatever they needed. However I did not like management that acted very childish and caused me not to get all my tasks done.
good,"Wal-mart is good company to gain knowledge on a vast majority of electric equipment and knowledge on different departments. I could have a set schedule how I wanted and lots of resources. Its was easy to get hired on and had a raise every year, that being said they started me off at a low wage and it takes a year to gain what other companies offer starting off. This created a high turn over rate. Also this made it hard to advance to other positions because if you are a valuable worker they will keep you there."
good,"The best part of my job was that I was always busy and I love inventory control.  When I left for the day I felt as if I had accomplished something."
good,"A typical day would include, directing the associates reporting to me to meet the stocking goals and deadlines; oversight of all front line customer service areas, including cashiering, returns, financial services, problem resolution. I would conduct drawer audits, close out all cash drawers from day shift. Duties included overseeing all register transactions throughout the store. Ensure all front end tasks were completed to start the new day and compliance with all corporate policies. Every day I also had to oversee the greeters, make sure the grocery carts were filled and continuous inventory control."
good,A great overall place to work for your average people-person. Offered a great experience in customer service and a free working enviornment.
good,"Was Handling different customers, with their problems, and mood swings lol.   I learned extra patience. With management they let me handle the customer unless it was something that need to be brought to there attention. Was fun working with my co workers as a team."
good,This company is easy to grow with.  It is a sum-what stressful career and because it is retail this makes it hard to have a balanced home life because you work crazy hours and don't really have the opportunity to plan things with your family.  Most store managers have unrealistic expectations and you feel like your pulled in a million place at once.  This is very stressful.
good,"I worked in different departments and worked my way up to department manager, I was also an CSM over the front registers. The most enjoyable part was you could meet alot of people."
good,"Walmart was an interesting work environment that was constantly changing.  Different customers constantly.  The tasks remained mainly the same.  I enjoyed my co-workers and most of the management I interacted with.  The hardest part of the job was doing the Computer Based Learning for the tasks that applied to my job, then having them conflict with what some management would ask me to do.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people, I enjoyed meeting new people constantly.  I also enjoyed being able to get the customers in and out in a timely manner."
good,Their are some very cool people. Some mangers are nice and understanding .
good,Dependable hours. Good Compensation. Employees are quick to help others with large loads. Managers look out for employees when it comes to having proper equipment. It is alot of heavy and repetative lifting.
good,Great company to work for with a high turnover rate for promotions.
good,"This was a part time job -- but exactly what I wanted at the time."
good,walmart was a good place to work for the people were respectful and nice the work was fun and i really enjoyed working for them and it was my fault in a way im not there but i still have a lot of respect for the walmart brand and i did my job to the fullest and i learned a lot in stock work and how to manage and keep things in order and at good pace and management was good people  and my coworkers who i considered family and the hardest part was going home at times it was so much fun and love
good,"A typical day at work as a truck unloader/stocker has more ups than downs. Despite it being physically demanding, it also tested your sorting and multitasking skills required by my managers. I was able to learn about my physical limits on the job and how to also deal with certain situations involving difficult customers and demanding time schedules when it came to unloading certain sized truck loads. Management would be very strict and on occasion very overwhelming on specific times in order to unload our truck deliveries. An example of this is when they expect the unloaders to unload a 3200 piece truck in the same time as an 1800 piece truck. Management at night tended to be more lenient and much more understanding when it came to different sized quotas and other tasks asked of their employees. My coworkers came with several unique backgrounds, one being an employee for over 15 years and others being in my age group. Most were very hard working while others tended to be lazy simply because they believed the newer employees should do more work than them. "
good,"I love working for Wal Mart. I work at a great store, everyone is friendly and happy to assist the customer."
good,Each day would be a different challenge which gave you a variety of different things to over come. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency in job responsibilities from week to week.
good,"While working for Wal-Mart it was easy to adapt to the fast pace environment. I had the ability to learn how to work in every department, including hardware, housewares, soft lines, and was cashier trained."
good,good environment to work in meet a lot of people fun place to be
good,"lots of work, learn how to organize and keep safe, management willing to work with, co-workers are helpful with lots of knowledge of job, hardest part of the job is pulling 3,000 lb. pallets. most enjoyable is when you finish a lot of work before your time is up"
good,"I found working at walmart to be a good job, not an awesome over the top, but not a down in the dirt either. my one big complaint about walmart is how they like a lot of other big retail companies do the whole hire you for three months then let you go."
good,There are many things that can be said about working there. It's definitely what you make it.
good,"I enjoyed working with the people at first until I started working outside in the parking lot gathering up shopping cart and returning them to the store for people to reuse. I learned not trust the manager of any store because they are trained to lie to your face and do well, because my manager told me that she would never fire me and that what happened on Oct. 24, 2007. I no problems with my co-workers at all they all love the way I did my job. There wasn't anything hard about job unless you didn't collect all the carts out of the parking lot and you decided to walk around the and goof out most the day but with me have a father like mine where he trained me to be a hard worker at what ever it took to complete the job, I remember what I was taught by my father and did what I knew had to done to complete my task as a cart pusher at Walmart."
good,"the thing with Walmart is that while its a great company to work for, and i would go back if i wasn't a soon to be dad with bills to pay for, there are some things about this company that is inconsistent with what they tell you in orientation. while it is sometimes true that your success depends on your work ethic, its also true that who you  ""buddy buddy"" up to depends on how far you go in this company. while some store honor their elderly employees, some stores work on getting their elderly employees out and replace them with  younger people with worse work ethics and inferior attitudes. as far as the pay goes its depending on your job. but, at least in Illinois, with the cost of living ; you'd have to live with your parents or a room mate."
good,"Associates form a family, however micromanagement ensues more so than not, which creates problems between different levels of management in performing tasks effectively to operate individual departments."
good,You meet a lot of people and learn very important social skills
good,"Enjoy the job, but I am looking for something where I can offer more of my skills and abilities."
good,Overall a good place to work.  The company direction is difficult to keep up with as a pharmacy manager though.  There were constantly new responsibilities being added on top of current responsibilities when nobody was able to keep up with the current responsibilities.
good,Great company to work for. I stock/load boxes on trucks for deliver.
good,"open store , i learned how to do customer service desk,western union,management was always changing,co workers were ok.working long hours and not being appreciated.best part of the job was dealing with daily customers and regular daily customers to the store"
good,"tras laboras por casi dos años en esta empresa creo he desarrollado cualidades de liderazgo, amabilidad y creatividad pues sabemos que las ventas de una empresa se basa 100 % en la experiencia de compra del cliente si el cliente no esta cómodo o no es bien atendido no volverá a comprar en dicha empresa. confieso que la administración de la empresa es eficiente y completa pues existe el sentido humano hacia los trabajadores. la parte mas complicada de mi trabajo como considero lo es en toda empresa es el trato con personal es decir el manejo de personal pues debes hacer que se sientan importantes y con un sentido de pertenencia para así lograr las metas y superar las expectativas."
good,A typical day consisted of helping customers have a pleasurable shopping experience.
good,Hot environment with some employees who are helpful and try to keep everybody spirit lifted up.
good,same as above it was a nice place to work i think it would have been better if there would have been more cashiers. because there were not enough cashiers ppl from different departments were pulled to run registers and that made that department be lacking in staff and being able to complete their tasks
good,"I liked my co-workers and management. When I was the produce department manager, the store manager took me under his wing. He taught me a lot on how to run the produce."
good,I was a 3rd shift employee at the Walmart comp. I thorough enjoyed my time doing my job. the down side to working there would probably be the fact that at when a employee has had a hard time on there shift they would make the other employees try to feel the same. besides that i did have the most enjoyment from the customers.
good,"I checked out my customers, and whenever i needed help my coworkers were always there to answer my questions."
good,"friendly people, was always something to do to keep you productive"
good,It is definitely not a lifetime position for me. I ran into some problems with other associates and found it better to leave.
good,Overnight stocking can be a challenge but it is all about patience and understanding of what is required. With hard work and motivation you can move very far.
good,"Typical day at work consist of monitoring security cameras, apprehending suspects and performing safety as well as security audits in different departments. The Wal-Mart I worked at is a high shrink store and theft was very high on a daily basis so apprehensions were vital to prevent shrink within the store. Not only externally but internally as well."
good,"a typical day at work was great i didnt want to leave, we would stock and make sure the areas in the store were up to pare. I learned that people just want to have a great day and enjoy their shopping experience without hassle. The management were very nice, supportive, friendly,helpful."
good,"It was a great place to work, very flexible, good management. co-workers were great to work the only thing that's hard is how late they are open and with it being a big retail store they don't have much to let employees be home with their families."
good,"moving carts from parking lot to store"
good,"When I would come to work, I go clock in then I would go straight to the returns put them where the belong and then I would go and zone and pick up all the departments make sure they're nice and neat. I learned a lot about customers and how to answer their questions or complaints and I deal with them. Learned how to take care of the whole entire departments of Apparel. Management would have us do a zone check every evening before we went home for the night to check and make sure the departments are how their suppose to look. My co-workers we would always do displays and projects together make new mods, new displays and zoning all the departments together to make it look really good team work. The hardest part of the day would be when the rush hour would come and we would be rushing to get the merchandise set and put where it belonged before we got off. Had to make sure we made no errors or made mistakes. What I enjoyed the most about my job was I got to work with clothes and accessories and work with the customers make them happy shopping with us."
good,"I learned how to effectively calm distraught customers whenever they were unhappy in a manner that wouldn't inconvenience the customer or my employer. I learned what it's like to work in a high paced area that actually pushed me to work hard. a typical day of work would be to come in, go to your assigned register, and serve customers via cashing them out, take your breaks, clean up your register, punch out and head home. Dealing with the management who often makes you feel unappreciated and often disliked wasn't great. There was a very distinct feeling of tension on most days. Besides management being difficult towards their employees, my fellow co-workers were fantastic people to work with every day. Hardest part of the job was standing in the same spot for several hours at a time through out the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers everyday, I had regular customers come in and say hello every time. It's amazing to greet them and know they come back because of the great experience they have with me."
good,"I loved working at walmart, simply because i love to meet new people and i like to make people feel good about their purchase to make them want to come back. I had very friendly co-workers and most of my customers were pretty nice."
good,"over night stock people  always called off"
good,"Every Day I come to work with a work hard mentality and to learn something new everyday. I provide customer service, sale electronic products, and other products throughout the store. My management at Wal-Mart is ok, some managers at Wal-Mart need to take the time to see what they can do to sale more product and to please the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to come to work, and provide great customer service, sale customer products that they can use in life.."
good,loved doing the remold of the store. worked in l&g as cashier would return
good,I enjoyed working as a cashier. It was fun to socialize with coworkers and customers. I got along with everyone and felt like my coworkers were friends. The hardest part of the job would probably be the occasional difficult customer but I always had someone to help straighten things out and resolve the issue.
good,"When I go to work I look forward to assisting customers and helping them with anything the need help with. The hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with difficult personalities and being able to remain positive. I have learned that you have to set all of your personal problems aside when going into work especially when having to deal with people.  Our management makes sure we are dong our job and doing it right, with them you never have to be afraid to go and ask for help. I absolutely love working with my co-workers. We are all like family and help each other out when needed."
good,"A typical day for me is usually very fast paced which I enjoy.  Over the past 6 and a half years I have learned so much!  Inventory control, price management, problem solving, developed excellent Customer Service skills, learned how to work in high stressed environment.  I truly believe that most of my fellow associates and I have stayed because of each other. I would have to say the hardest part of the job is not being able to make every customer happy and the best part is knowing a customer left happy."
good,We were a diverse group of people from many different places working as a team.
good,"typical day, I would clock in and go to the till that I was assigned to and then stay on cash for my whole shift other than on my breaks"
good,"Working for walmart wasn't bad, it wasn't good either. Its a pay check. They don't care about you as an employee, they don't care about anything but their bottom dollar. Pushing to get product out without ever having the amount of employees to do this safely and accurately."
good,"as pessoas com quem eu trabalhei na area de açougue, eram muito esfoeçados , trabando sempre em equipe , havia algumas discussoes como todo local de serviço , mais pessoas acolhedoras"
good,"Assist customers with what they needed. Learned customer service, downloaded merchandise in the system, sale electronic products, stock products on floor & bin in backroom. Great coworkers worked as team. Hardest part of job was the short hours & different shifts. The most enjoyable was working with customers & my co workers."
good,"I really enjoyed working at the Jewelry counter. The work was fun and exciting. I learned a great deal being that it was one of my first job experiences. I learned how to work the cash register, friendly customer service, how to pierce ears, change watch batteries, how to stock & zone my work area, & how to build displays. I really liked my manager, she was very friendly & really listened to your needs. My co-workers were very friendly & very helpful, almost like a family. The hardest part of the job for me would not be the same as it would be for others as I am not a very sociable person, so dealing with so many new people all day was new for me. The most enjoyable part was how fun it was as a whole, it was a great experience. And being around jewelry all day of course!"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart I was promoted fast but not reward for my skills, advancement is available."
good,work is not that bad scheduling not to my liking not a steady shift.
good,"Very average and poorly managed, but excellent benefits and some decent on the job training."
good,"I found that the people who work there are amazing, but the management needs inprovement."
good,"Ambiente de mucha actividad, metas por hora  y desarrollo agradable"
good,"A typical day at walmart for me started in the Deli department. I usually opened the department and i had to start the fryer, hot case, and deli case. my day was always busy cooking and or making trays."
good,"I had really great time working in walmart.I enjoyed working with my coworker Love to go back and start working for walmart."
good,A typical day at Walmart D/C is doing your job making sure there are no mistake. There are a some enjoyment here and there but it it mostly about keeping busy. The hardest moment of working here is finishing.
good,"Everyday was a challenge for me."
good,"Liked my position here, many individuals that were rockstars at their positions."
good,"La habilidad para dar a conocer un producto,mi labor era la de demostrar a los prospectos las ventajas de adquirir una membresia de negocio"
good,"A typical day at work revolves around fetching merchandise from storage bins and preparing it to be worked to the sales floor. There is some inventory counting involved on occasion. Most work is performed with a handheld terminal. I work on the first shift and am close with my co workers and get along well with management. They know what I am capable of and what to expect from my work. The hardest part of the job is getting the whole store to work together as a team. Everyone has something in the backroom, but no one wants to be responsible for it. I have learned a great deal of organization working here however, and do count the experience as a positive."
good,Wal-Mart is also another good company. one of my favorite jobs so far. Management was okay as well. Clean and happy enviorment.
good,"I start by checking restrooms then do a safety sweep. I also help out where ever needed. Learned how to help others. Management is okay. Some are moody others are fine. Cleaning up liquid spills."
