bad,"Health issues will start to plague you as soon as you start."
bad,it was stressful place to work but if i had to go back to support my family i would. i did have a few good boss and i worked with alot of good men. overall i wouldnt work there again
bad,Terrible planning and poor management. A sinking ship. since they filled for bankruptcy this company has been scrapping straw to survive. Employees are treated awful and they work you unreasonable hours.
bad,It wasn’t the best place to work my stuff got stolen and everything  they would tell you that you would have the weeken off then change it at the end of the week we u already had plans so u had to cancel and make your kids upset
bad,a VERY dangerous place to work. Only family get to advance. the least safe and lowest paying mine in the basin.
bad,"You are a number, an expendable number.  You are pushed to break the law and put your family and life on the back burner.  ICG used to own alot of the mines and was a decent personable company to work for.  Arch will lay you off, will cut your pay and will cancel your plans with your family for you and if you dont like it, ""there are thousands of guys willing to do your job right now."""
bad,The mine is big It has good pay but that's about it the days to nights could be hard on your body know what your getting into before hand but that being said there really is nothing else going for it other then that. For one the management don't have a clue and most of them don't know even know how to lead and have poor people skills and also there is no advancement out there its just who you are related to or who you know its what gets you places out there. Worst years of my life glad that chapter is over.
bad,"Please be careful working at Leer mine! Sentinel was just fine, but I was transfered to Leer. At Leer don't speak up for yourself at all...  Just show up and work you'll be fine.  I didn't think they could fire ANYONE for nothing, but I was ""long story "" and I've seen others too.  If they want you gone... You'll be gone! "
bad,"Due to the declining coal industry, the company I hired on to ICG coal Inc. whom was a great company to work for sold out to Arch Coal Inc. whom also was great to work for but they sold out to Black Hawk Minning Inc. whom has given all employers a pay cut with out any benefits & taken all bonus's and half of our vacation & personal days they we personally acuminated & earned over the years away... They have laid off over half of the employees, making the current employees work harder and longer hours, for less pay... The Current employees working for this company has no future working with this company... and the Company's future is unstable and unclear due to the fact that it is the coal industry..."
bad,"You work short handed long hours and every holiday. No one cares if you are sick, hurt or have family issues as long as the long wall can run that is all they care about. The place is a muddy mess with mud and water everywhere you go. Track is in bad shape and equipment is old and junk."
bad,"Always something different every day, there is 150 haul trucks, 40 dozers , several blades scrapers loaders . you never know what the next day will bring. might be fixing head lights or changing hydraulic hoses or repairing body damage. This place shows favoritism not something I think is right."
bad,"it had a lot of bs to go on at some of the jobsights, a lot could have been prevented but it just carried on and made the jobsight more apt for accidents instead of fixing them they let it go"
bad,The hardest part of the job is swing shift. You go underground for 8+ hours and come out at end of day. You may not get a break when the work is backed up. Harassed about injuries in an naturally unsafe and unpredictable environment.
good,"Main problem is mid to upper level management. Because there is no union and wyoming is a work at will state, you could be cut loose at any time, for any reason, without explainstion. And the boss's don't mind reminding you one bit. The pay is not adequate either, electricians and truck drivers all take home the same at the end of the pay period."
good,"the pay is good, the work is not hard but they have a long way to go on being a company for the men your just a number there not a person."
good,"the money is good, days are good, hours are long. hard to have friends outside of work. difficult to keep up on hobbies and activities."
good,"Good people skill experiences. Overall good and wish them well. It out in nature, and you have a lot of time to learn and get to know the area. And it is well paid for people that like heavy equipment."
good,The company is decent to work for. You have a set schedule you get to follow closely except for times when extra over time is neccessary. It is certainly a company where 20% of the people do 80% of the work. Management  and leadership is poor.
good,"did I say boring? "
good,Good company to work for very much about safety. They are very strict on keeping bathhouse clean. Very good safety department. They want to run coal and do it legal.
good,IT was a good place to work until they changed management and the safety went down hill. Very stressful workplace but the hourly men were fun to work with.
good,"I worked shift work, 12 hour days. Maintaining roads. Working night and day shift is hard on the body.It is an ok job, most people only remain out there for the pay and time off."
good,"Operations, Coal Loadout, Blending Coal, Delivery Management"
good,"It's definitely more about who you know than what you know. The pay is very good, and the benefits are outstanding (it is, after all, a coal mine). But management is terrible. Every single level of management thinks they need to know every detail of what is happening at all times. Given that the job is production-based, the goal is definitely more about getting the equipment back up rather than doing the job right the first time."
good,Company preaches safety but is not always committed to doing the hard work to be successful. Management has to be %100 onboard and support those who work to make the mines safer.
good,Great place to work. Decent compensation and good benefits. Challenging mining conditions. Good management team. Mine site is along way from any town and driving there in the winter can be difficult.
good,"Loved working at this company until got layed off. Loved working in this industry and would like to find another job doing what I love to do mine coal."
good,Good place to work. Good pay for around this area. The new management is family oriented. Just Between the cost of living and the short-term of the company makes it difficult because it's the only thing here that pays that well.
good,"swing shifts are hard to get used to and midnights almost always get mandated on Friday nights, pay is decent but it is a non union mine and no one has your back."
good,"Company's focus was on safety and environmental performance then production.  The work environment tends to be very stressful.  Management communication lacks at times.  However, compensation and benefits are very good."
good,"A typical day as a lube truck driver requires doing a safety inspection on your truck to make sure it is in proper working condition. then you go out into the pit fuel, check oil levels, and grease the trucks and other equipment."
good,"it was a good typical day at work, i learn to run heavy equipment, good management, like working with my co workers, they really wasnt the hardestpart of the job and the enjoyable was running heavy equipment"
good,"Maintain all aspects of a conveyor belt system , clean , repair , diagnos , under all circumstances never let the belt stop , extreme Danger on a daily basis"
good,"It is a demanding job that compensates fairly, however the industry has been in a decline and makes difficulties advancing. If jobs were more secure it would be a tough job to leave."
good,I really enjoyed working here.  The atmosphere is very relaxed.  It was low stress and great work life/balance.  I loved touring the mines and meeting the miners.
good,Arch does not believe in family time Was always told work comes first. They have a starting time but no stopping time. Arch doesn't treat there supervisors good
good,excellent co workers  shift work schedule a typical day at work consists of troubleshooting mining machinery
good,"This coal company is the most laid back company I've ever worked for and that's me coming from a union coal mine. The worse thing about this mine is their are cicks, groups of people to be in and if you are not in these clicks their work is pawned off on you. Working at this mine with that said is still a very laid back coal mine to work at but that is all possible because of the long wall."
good,Good place to work  with lots of different tools to use to complete your job. Always something coming up so you never have a dull day.
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to learn different equipment. enjoyed the people I worked with. the shift supervisor was a good guy.  hardest part of my job was switching from days to nights every few days I don't mind rotating shifts but it was ever few days. the people very fun to work with and I enjoyed running equipment.
good,"good company to work for. Bad location in wyoming. Not much to look at, but isn't that the way it is when you are a in the coal industry."
good,"good place to work, good coworkers who look out for each other safety is put first and everyone looks out for each other, typical day os pretty fast paced,"
good,"Great co-workers and management, coal industry just tanked."
good,"Didn't really get to work with them long enough, before mine closed"
good,"Production is the bottom line. Yes you get paid well and have good benefits. However, they do not care to keep you there once you’re there in a daily basis. If something needs done then you’re stuck. Everyone is out for themselves."
good,I have loved working for arch coal.I have worked here two different occasions From 1995 to 2000 and I returned here in 2010  My intention was to stay till retirement. The coal market has changed that.
good,"A good company to work for, but due to marketing any advancement is not in the future.Co-workers are a pleasure to work with. Team work was incorporated within the work area. Safety is always a must."
good,"Arch is a good place to work. You don't get much time off thought, and they'll follow the market, and shut down operations in reaction to the market."
good,Most of the time I went to a coal shovel. The hard part was trying to make sure the coal stayed clean since it was a lower quality of coal. And help the clean up machine by giving them enough room to maneuver around the shovel and power cable. And also set it up so the haul trucks could get in and out as easily as possible.
good,"I was responsible for the extraction process of coal, and delivering supplies to various places underground. The hardest part was working in a very dangerous, and explosive environment 300 feet underground. I gained a bit of mechanical experience, and actually enjoyed operating various underground mining equipment."
good,"Really good company to work for with great pay. They take the extra step to make sure everyone is in a safe coal mining environment. Always have the possibility to increase your pay rate every year (up to level 6) if you show the initiative to learn new equipment and do well at it. The only issue would be that there is a lot of favoritism there, as in any coal mine job. Which kind of lowers the quality of working there in my opinion. But you make good pay, so it kind of evens out."
good,Good place to work. They give consistent incentive bonuses. Fair benefits. It is just too bad that they were forced to lay off and I unfortunately was a casualty.
good,"loved my co workers, stayed busy, always mining coal, I am a roof bolter and miner for them and have been there under a year...want out of coal mines"
good,The Black Thunder Mine has good wages and benefits. There is shift work which proves to be difficult for some people. Currently all coal companies are experiencing tough economic times due to the current political environment in Washington.
good,Good men I dont to write on this page. They fun and feed you alot give out prizes get time off could use more they should let you have Christmas off but good place to work.
good,Fast paced work environment.  Great health and retirement benefits.  Generally a family type atmosphere with a high focus on safety and production.  Would recommend to anyone
good,"Good pay, benefits,etc...."
good,A typical day of work at Coal Creek was a meeting before everyone headed out to work. First we had to do a walk around the equipment then we set off to do whatever work we had to do to get the job at hand done. Management was fair and listened to what the employees had to say. The co-workers were great and able to answer any questions you had. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact of knowing that you contributed to the energy of the nation.
good,"As an employee for Arch I was a part of safety meetings every morning before operations. There was extensive MSHA training. Sabers was the safety program implemented which brought hazards to your attention by creating an employee driven, interactive and personal work place where teamwork and communication is essential. At Arch there are many production habits that increase productivity immensely. Double side loading, fueling before shift instead of on lunch's. Honestly the safety culture plays a big role in production as well, Avoiding mistakes, errors, and injuries makes everything quicker and smother. Very Efficient place to work. the year I was employed at Arch we put out more product than any other company in the basin with less employees."
good,great benefits and pay and work atmosphere. Friendly employees. Very good safety culture.  Good work life balance. 10 Personal days per year off.  Gift cards for safety and bonus for safety.
good,"Enjoyable place to work.  Corporate office is casual dress.  Very competitive pay and benefits schedule.  Beginning to embrace some more modern workplace norms like: working from home, work life balance focus, etc."
good,"Working as a custodian is definitely not the ideal job, but it's good for someone who can't get a job or someone who wants their first. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to attend some events and stuff."
good,"While the people who run are smart and well meaning, the industry is on life support."
good,Arch spends a lot of time and money on training management to be realistic and understanding.
good,"Arch Coal is a decently sized company, but still operates as if it was a much smaller company. Systems are archaic but there is a push to modernize and automate many of the systems and manual processes. This will be a long term initiative. Everyone knows almost all the corporate workers and the workforce is full of people who have worked there 10, 20, 30 and even more years, a testament to the very decent benefits and happiness most people have working there. The downside to that is that if you're looking for advancement or movement opportunities, there are not as many as other companies may offer. Overall, workers are good and a pleasure to work with."
good,A good company to work with for team work oriented attitude. Benefits were comparable to other companies.
good,"Arch Coal is committed to expanding into the international market as a growth area as the domestic market is past maturity and in decline, a current low commodity environment is making the expansion challenging"
good,One of the best Career moves ever made and would go back today. They give me a chance to provide for my family in a way that most careers in this area could not Compare. The family time that I’d had earned give me  plenty of time for family activity’s.
good,it was a great place to work and good people to work for no drug or alkahal  it was a safe place too work thay did not put on a show and throw safty in the wind
good,Good company but not much room for job growth.  Any job in the mining industry has a risk with safety and job security.  They have never failed to pay me And have always been fair.
good,"The workday was split between the field and the office.  I analyzed environmental data, wrote reports and performed environmental field work."
good,Good people with can do attitude.  Highly skilled and teamwork oriented. Excellent safety program.  Management emphasis is on continuous improvement.
good,Not a bad place to work.  You are underground and get paid good money.  Great benefits and bonuses.  Hard work thou and long hours
good,"Cost minded coal mining company.  You are expected to do what is ""right."""
good,"Arch has a great safety atmosphere good pay, benefits and PTO. Other than the swing shift hour. Underground coal mining is a very different life it’s like being on the moon. But with Illinois government putting the heal on the throats of coal mines I feel that (in Illinois only) coal mining is a dying industry."
good,"Great place to work, great people, great benefits, great salaries and 401k.  Work schedules vary, work hours vary.  This is a coal producing company.  I currently work at the Preparation Plant.  This produces the coal for sale on the open market.  We clean, process, and ship the coal for sale.  We produce high quality, low sulfur coal.  We conduct our own maintenance on a daily, weekly, and monthly scale."
good,Ensure the Production of coal in a safe timely manner
good,Good place to work with great benefits and the safety of the mine was outstanding. Arch makes sure that safety and production run hand in hand.   But never put production first.
good,"I learned so much with this company that there is no way to list it all. It's a great safety oriented, team oriented and goal oriented company."
good,Big on safety good pay for what little work that they expect of you. Over all nice place to work insurance is not that bad an work Conditions are pretty fair.
good,"From start to finish my day was always interesting. We would do our morning lineups and go over safety related things, then proceed to go to a bus that took us into the pit. from the pit we would do our inspections and start our days. The best part of the day was the private radio chat when supervisors or utility guys would tease fellow employees."
good,"work hard,do your job they will treat you wright.great management.great experience,work with a great crew of men.bosses treated men wright and with respect."
good,Operated on Many different types of heavy equipment. Had great co-workers and bosses. Easy to work for. 
good,"This was by far the best company that i have worked for, the coal price droped out and the company had to lay us off, they did however give us a very generous severance package"
good,"Best company I ever worked for, to bad the coal market declined so bad in my area. Arch coal took care of their workers. I highly recommend Arch to anybody wanting to go to work for them."
good,It's an extremely friendly workplace. Safety and team work are stressed on a daily basis during shift meetings. Typical days require a briefing with federal inspectors then travel to the area and a debriefing once back outside. I then write a report on my findings and submit to my safety manager. The most enjoyable part is the workplace environment. I also enjoy the continuous learning process that goes on with maintaining federal guidelines. there really isn't anything too hard. I enjoy managing the different personalities of each inspector.
good,"Excellent company to work for.  Excellent Safety and environmental compliance culture.  Generally care about their employees.  Great pay and benefits, but the coal industry is in steep decline."
good,Management is great and well focused. Will do anything to remain safe and productive.
good,This company understood when I needed the time off when my baby was born and worked with me to ensure my happiness and to ensure that I was able to be there for my wife and my child during the time of his birth. They are a place that you can grow with a job. I felt as though I learned more than my position while I worked there. Very clean and professional work environment
good,"Great company to work for, benefits and pay as well as vacation days and personal days no negativity about the company very safety forward all you have to do is show up and want to work."
good,"I loved working for Arch. Treated their employees fairly and cared about the work they done. Upon starting my job, I felt as if I was part of the family from day one and could talk to management about anything."
good,"Great company to work for, plenty of advancement opportunities, work life balance, awesome benefits, flexible hours, labor intensive however very rewarding."
good,Arch Coal is a first class coal producer and an excellent organization to be associated with. They give plenty of opportunity to grow and advance. Compensation packages are competitive. Great place to work and great people to work with.
good,"great company, great benefits, good people to work for and with, great pay with yearly raises provided you were proven to have had a safe year, would love to return"
good,The pay is good and the people there are good to work with and for. Great bunch of guys to work a long side. It's a bit of a drive for me from where I live but the pay makes up for it.
good,I enjoy my work at ARCH Coal. They have treated me fair and they take care of their work force. Very friendly work environment. Very good pay and benefits.
good,"Awesome place to work "
good,"You bust your back all day long, work in tough conditions, learned alot about live, but it was all worth it. Im a very hard worker and willing to learn anything to get me a job"
good,"Very physical and busy job, you meet and see a lot of people. It's a huge mine. The winters are the hardest part of the job, as it is all outside. Great place to work."
good,"Great Company, Great Benefits, Great co-workers. Good pay with retirement options. Great Equipment. Rotating day/night work shifts. Nothing negative to say,"
good,I would tell everyone to work for Arch Coal good company very nice coworkers  I ran all kinds of different equipment - very community oriented
good,"I rated Arch Coal 5 stars cause they where, they can;t help that the Gov. or America is where it is on mining. That is reason I'm looking for something different."
good,All listed employment are the same parent employer.  Each place was a great place to work.  Excellent people and challenging tasks.
good,"Excellent place to work.  Great people, challenging work, excellent all around.  Due to the recent downturn in the industry economy, my position was terminated.  No one likes to lose their job, but it was simple lack of positions at the end,"
good,"Arch Coal, is a very good place to work. The mangement are very family oriented which is very unusual for such a large company.The men are very skilled in their craft. Great Benefits, Excellent all around place to work."
good,A typical day at Arch was very important in the line to operate good equipment and to work with good coworkers and  great management. We all followed good safety policies and regulations. While on reclamation division I got to learn and operate new equipment in the process of restoring mined land back to the way it was before mining. All the men was like family. The most enjoyable part of my job with Arch was we was one big happy family and we did what we was asked to do and we got rewarded for it.
good,"A typical day at Arch Coal for me is starting work at 6:00 A.M., I start my day off with checking emails, equipment notifications and check excel worksheet for broken equipment. I then proceed to fix equipment that is broke. My day ends at 3:30 P.M. I learn something new everyday, meaning i have never had a day the same as another. Always something new and exciting going on at Arch Coal. My management and co-workers are very amazing people and awesome to work with. The hardest part of my job is setting up equipment perodioc maintenance schedules with three different departments. The most enjoyable part of my job is the feeling of accomplishing something everyday."
