bad,Hard job long hours 60+hrs.  one week days one week night.   dirty job hot. They were just lost a class action lawsuit. Not a good place to work.      T
bad,". "
bad,"If you like making a decent amount of money but never seeing your family or spending your money on fun stuff, then this is the place for you. Management is horrible. They don't care about their employees. They like to stab each other in the back over anything and everything."
bad,Poor management.  No one who was an hourly employee wanted to take a management job due to the fact that they took away benefits and made it difficult to speak your mind.  Main management came from plants from other countries who had different work cultures and did not or would not conform to American values.
bad,was a good place to work but they ended up closing the doors and moved south. No longer around in Canada. was only there 9 months before they closed the doors
bad,"union is just another tool for mgmt to hide behind, under paid, mandatory 64 hr week. no work life balance. seniority determines everything. no performance increases for production staff."
bad,"The company exists in the dark ages and is led by the worst management I have ever experienced.  It is a dangerous environment, made worse by an autocratic management culture which allows and supports bullying of workers and contractors alike."
bad,"The environment set by management was aggressive and stressful. I would never recommend anyone working for this company. The coworkers were constantly at each others throats and it was not healthy. The stress that was placed on employees to be perfect was horrible. The feedback was never constructive, no training ever given."
bad,"I loved my position at Alcoa, however was laid off from the company because ALCOA did not want to pay the American workers what they deserved to get paid."
bad,not enough man power to run the plant safely but it was never a management problem pay rasises never came when promised help never ther when you needed it.
bad,I don't know why the company doesn't give higher payer. People have idw to provide daycare for. They should have a daycare in the workplace which would create less call outs.
bad,"Alcoa keeps the same management thats destroying the company."
bad,ALCOA shutdown after I left to go to work for another company.  Many jobs were lost when they closed after asking for community help and support to stay open.  Community did everything to help ALCOA and they left anyways.
bad,"Most machinist knew more about the job than management. Meeting we're held every week, questions were asked about improving work quality and production but nothing would ever change,"
bad,Stressful environment and not enough breaks to to consider a harmless environment. Too many hazards that posed threats to employees. This place needs to be audited for employees fair treatment.
bad,"Days are long and never know what to expect"
bad,"This particular company was ruled by emotion and very poor management styles.  They were good with safety and practiced safety very well, but that was all."
bad,Poor and Unsafe place to start a career. mandatory forced overtime. long hours. poor management. unsafe work environment.
bad,"management doesn't care for its workers , Alcoa says its all about safety  first but then makes 2 departments work 11 straight weeks of mandatory overtime, hr dept is useless commen answer is too call 1800 Alcoa so they can help you , lies and open threats from management is a weekly thing"
bad,"I worked for two years for this company and they only gave me a 0.14 raise, despite getting certified part inspector certificates, was one of the few that could set the machines up and buy off the parts."
bad,"Former Dover, NJ Etcher. You get told to be creative and find ways to be faster and when you do they write you up. You ask too many quality questions and they gang up on you saying thats not your job. You try to follow their verbal instructions and if you deviate for faster production, you get written up . They take away your vac time only to help the plant. After all that is done, they still cant make profit? I was fired because I rocked the boat. Who can you go to for help ? No HR Department or big turnover of management. If you are not a quiet person and says yes to everything they want... YOUR FIRED and I lost 7 weeks for insubordination on my unemployment and was forced to cash out my 401k. Dont do it......they can care less about your hard work and sacrifices."
bad,"At one time ALCOA was a good job but as with time things changed for the worst, from mismanagement to constant haresment to its employees. This is an employer that I wouldn't recommed for long term employment."
bad,Sounds like other Alcoa plants are nice to work for or these other reviews were written by Alcoa managment becausethe Alcoa plant in Dover NJ sucks! Working conditions are horrible and they brought in EMCOR Services in to take over maintenance so most likely all Alocoa maintenance employees will be unemployed soon. No job security here!
bad,"They work you hard then lay you off after they make there quota ,and they make you work on holidays. They save the company money by making you take a week off without pay."
bad,No work life balance. Toxic environment to work in. They lie to you when you interview so you take the job. Awful...would not recommend applying to this company.
bad,I absolutely hated my job at Alcoa. The worst place I ever worked. It was nasty and not well maintained. Nothing ever ran correctly other than employees mouths. Management looks for reasons to fire you. Watch your back.
bad,Dirty nasty place to work. They give you fans to cool you off in the summer that are coated in oil. Much uncertainty and layoffs
bad,"bad management, bad organizational skills, too many chiefs, and not enough ""smart"" Indians. If you want to work with a bunch of lazy people who like to steal from you, and talk about you behind your back...then this is the place for you."
bad,"This is not run like the other ""Howmet"" plants, this plant is a scary world of it's own. Current Senior Managers are dictators. They rule with an iron fist by raising their voices, belittling peoples. Yes, this truly is ""the good ol' boys club"". And do not look to HR for help, their members of this club too. So many good, really good employees have gone through this and are afraid to say anything or stand up for themselves as they need their jobs. This could be such a great place and there are so many opportunities for this facility with the right management. They had someone who could have taken this plant to great heights and they let him go. He was the best thing that ever walked through the doors. They are letting really good people go for no reason. I've watched this for too long."
bad,If your not in the union they fire you just by someone saying lies. Had ok benefits. Bosses favored certain people. They treated you like a number not a person
bad,Worst manegment ever every action you make will be punished there is no communication at all the style of manegment is do because I said so but that never makes it work because they don’t know how to do the job they are supervising
bad,"They expect you to live at work. Long hours expected, very much like high school: you either belong to a clique or you don’t. Not helpful or nice to any new employees. Not family friendly, if you have kids, don’t bother to apply for a salaried position."
bad,horrible management. hostile work environment. union sucks. horrible safety practices. no advancement. virtually unnoticeable pay raises. hr department always looking for a reason to fire someone.
bad,"A empresa Alcoa em si é muito boa para se trabalhar, porém não atende a algumas leis do brasil, como por exemplo a lei do estagiário o qual deixa claro que este não pode estagiar nos fins de semana e feriados, descaracterizando o estágio, tornando-o vínculo empregatício. "
bad,"poorly managed, low level skill in management, supervisors that did not know their product line, unethical doings, lies to impress the leaders."
bad,"Alcoa Used to have good benefits. At present, Alcoa owes it's employees millions of dollars as they ripped them off by cutting break times! Although Alcoa has been Court Ordered to pay up they still have Not. Now Alcoa Used to give Great Performance Bonuses, however, since the recent court order they cut the bonus from 6% to 1.7%!!!! When I worked there I worked 7 days a week for over 10 yrs. The management is a joke. Alcoa is all about their pockets!! Contract time was most depressing as we were forced to give back more. I feel very badly for the retired folks. All those yrs wasted when I should've been home Sometimes with my family."
bad,"Alcoa Howmet in Hampton, VA. not enough opportunity to advanced your career, you'll be out looking for another job the following week, cause the company they lay-off too much, just about every 3-month..good luck to those people has less seniority."
bad,"Non-profitable, horribly run company. Management lies to the workers."
bad,"Worked at Alcoa for 21 years, had planned on 30 and out with pension. Company chose to stop supporting the 30 and out pension. Last manager was a clown and they have a new clown in place.. definitely a good ole boys mentality, they should cleanse some of the upper levels!! HR is too concerned with supporting all of the millennial kids they hire!!! Hourly workers are jaded and feel entitled, most are lazy and just want a free ride!! Local 104 is there only to keep poor performance employees in a job!!!"
bad,Wouldn't recommend the barberton location to anyone no matter how desperate. The management is absolutely terrible the pay is awful very little off days and the building is dirt and extremely hot with bad ventilation.
bad,There was no 'off' time. You were expected to work as many hours as humanly possible. Your phone rang night and day and all weekend. Stress started to cause health issues so I left.
bad,"Alcoa, as a company is a good company with good benefits but at the location I work in it is very unorganized, unprofessional and cut throat.  The Halethorpe location is on a smaller scale compared to other locations so that could be the reason.  To put it in perspective this location is a place to get a steady paycheck but not a place you would stay long term."
bad,"Poor place to work, treat everybody like they know nothing. All about big profits, want everybody to work 7 days a week at least 12 hours a day. Keep hiring vice presidents and working everybody else to death"
bad,"They're cheap on their raises. You have to actually give your notice and threaten to leave before they give you a raise. Some people had worked there for 6-7 yrs without a raise!  Sure you get a little cost of living raise but forget about any merit increases. I actually hired in at almost $2 hr more than the person that had been in that job for over 6yrs. I've worked at two different facilities, and I knew people that worked at others, One Alcoa is the same as the rest. My advice, go there, learn as much as you can about every machine and product and then take that experience someplace else where they'll be willing to pay you for it."
bad,Horrible Management!
bad,Horrible Company. The company doesn't value their employees and is only in it for the incentive pay.
bad,"You have no protection against any action outside of the union. Salaried employees are considered to be expendable in every way. In fact those employees have no protection against lay offs, (fancy way to say forced out) Stay in the union. If being hired as a salaried individual, try getting hired somewhere else."
bad,"The organization as a whole fails to train employees (hourly and salary) adequately which opens doors to unsafe work and injury. Little focus is placed on safety or quality rather production. Understand that the State of Indiana remains an ""at will"" for termination which means they can and will terminate for any reason. Tread lightly, do your job and do nothing more than what is asked of you."
bad,"Work your life away and destroy your body-  Good place to start, but not to live. Good medical but you will need it.  Use the job to try and get ahead in life and then GTFO"
bad,"Yeehaw! great job and atmosphere. Loved working here, anyone can work here. Right on the beach at cherry point with an excellent view and great crowd of people to work with"
bad,Work place is very safe and clean. Work hours are very demanding and do not have flexible starting hours. Pay is very low for output of production demanded.
bad,"Worst management company I have ever worked for all they care about is selling their product. The district manager told me the one that sells the more is the one that gets more hours. They do train you and you do learn allot in new installations, teardowns etz. If you are single have now obligations and need a job ok go for it but if you have house and kids I don't recommend."
bad,"High Turnover and antiquated management culture. Difficult place to learn. Little formal training. All OJT/Job shadowing, Difficult relationship with union and employees. Work almost every day with no time for family or life balance. Not much to like here outside of the pay."
bad,"The New York office of Alcoa is best characterized as stale and unchanging, filled with protected mediocre talent who couldn't compete elsewhere.  HR is too busy coddling incompetent staff at all levels who have no business working in business while at the same time hire young, enthusiastic agents of change who quickly learn of their mistake of accepting the offer letter."
bad,"The worst of it all is managment. They make decisions without thinking of the end result, then blame employees. Mandatory overtime with only a 24 hour notice. Managment holds no one responsible and is only concerned with their own advancement, advancement up is very rare and usually outside hires. Safety is basicly ignored for production numbers, and your told we are taking care of it but its never done unless managments butt is on the line. The pay is decent and the benifits ok, thats the only good thing to say about the company."
bad,"bom relacionamento com a gerencia,tendo participacao nas decisoes que ocorriam dentro da loja,meu grupo tinha relacoes de trabalho muito boas."
bad,The worst company I've ever worked for in my entire career. The working conditions were terrible and the hours were long and very tiring.
bad,"Due to global environment and lousy management, the Company will probably not exist within five years.  Actively laying off and divesting in a desperate attempt to continue.  My project lost all funding with no notice while every IT person over 40 was let go without announcement, transfer of knowledge or training."
bad,"The fact that this place is still open blows my mind. The hourly employees are pretty cool for the most part, but the plant manager and pot room management is a joke. Priority’s are focused in the wrong places all the time. If I was Alcoa Corp I would consider a in-depth investigation into management."
bad,"The hours were ridiculously long, the environment is not healthy, the facility is extremely dirty, management does not care about employees or their family. Management did not care about the facility up keep. Worst place to work ever!"
bad,"Don't Get Hurt There Because They Will Lie To Try Get Out Of Responsibility, Worst Company I have Every Worked For As Taking Care Of Their Employees.."
bad,The environment has changed a lot since the smelter shut down and the brought it back up again. Very poor upper level managers that are only looking out for themselves could care less about their workers. It’s all lip service when they say it’s a safety first mentality it’s dollars first.
bad,"If you are looking for hourly and don't mind the crazy schedule, I'd say apply. If you are going into a salary position like coach or area manager, don't. Board and upper management is in a complete state of disarray. They have split the company twice in two years. Have completely frozen all benefits for their salary workers IE: No raises, pension freeze, bonus eliminated etc. They will promise you the world, then demand things that can't be obtained. Safety is farthest from the priority, and upper management, especially at Davenport, are more concerned with production numbers than quality product which is causing a mass exodus of contracts."
bad,Prison-like feel at all times. Management lacking any experience in fields that they are in charge of. Try to control all of employee's time both at work and time off.
bad,"The Residents are wonderful, I loved each and every single one of them. The management are very unprofessional, verbally abusive, vindictive, which made the work environment for employees the last three months intolerable. The time spent before the new management was blessed. Couldn't ask for better. Hated having to leave."
bad,Due to having grandchildren I could no longer be on call 24-7.
bad,Management is all but non existent and very out of touch with people working here. They treat.peopleas if they were dumb and had no idea how to do the job at hand. If they invested in the people and the plant this place could be good.
bad,"A typical day involved an update from the back shifts on any engineering adjustment status and production issues.  We determine what the best course of action to address any issues.  Then we schedule the days activities trying to take into account for any production issues that may need addressed.  "
bad,This is as good job for someone that never made over 17.00 but it is not a company that I may want to make a career out of new guys walking in after 6-9 months make 1.20 less than seasoned worker
bad,"Para iniciar cada dia siempre hay algo diferente, asi que por lo regular en las mañanas hay que actulizaar los archive de entradas y salidas FIFO. Despues hay que verificar el material que vamos a recibir y preparer toda la papeleria para su flujo dentro de la planta."
bad,"Great company, move new employees too soon, Work life/home life no balance.  Scheduling not good.  Equipment outdated, and lack of professionalism."
bad,Bad place to work treat u bad work you 16hrs a day 60+ hrs a week pay is decent if you don't like to have a life and don't have a family bad management they don't care bout u try to hide injuries
bad,The location I worked for was in Texas. The production management team there doesn't care about the employees well being. If you have an idea they will claim it as their own. Zero organization of all production.
bad,"Constant machine failures, lack of employees and failure to pay suppliers on a timely basis"
bad,nothing to say...Not the most enjoyable place to make friends.
bad,i got two chances at the interview process because the guys who had been there for thirty years plus said to the hr that i was an excellent employee but the hr aparentlty didnt have the same opinion. after working for them for a year they said i was no good for the job. oxymoron. excuse my bluntness
bad,"I was able to move around and gain some experience on several machines types of machines.  There are several people who are not willing to teach you about there machines, but if you ask around you will find people that are more than happy to help."
bad,There was a lot of fun days with co workers and children. This job can be stressful when dealing with parents and children that become sick.
bad,"They don’t respect the supervisors. The employees didn’t perform their jobs. Human Resources was not for the people, theirs policy were not fair. Employees always complaining about theirs jobs."
bad,"Be union. Don't ever take a company job.  Liars liars liars liars. The entire management team is full of the good old boys clicked up and they love a yes man, do not for any reason tell them a better way to do something.  And heaven forbid if your workers like you, the company doesn't want their supervisors to be friends with workers...."
bad,"Alcoa Fastening Systems is a very old school theory ""X"" run company."
bad,"long hours, poor training, dirty working conditions. Supervisor is unqualified and makes poor decisions. Made to work overtime on short notice. I would not advise people to work there."
bad,"Dans un marché aussi porteur que l'aéronautique, dommage de maintenir une telle désorganisation et de ne pas investir sur le long terme !"
bad,"The worst managed company I ever worked for!"
bad,"•	Meet and greet visitors"
bad,I work with the Engineering Manager to manage capital improvement projects from conception to completion.  I am also the Energy Leader for the site and am responsible for all utility related issues.
bad,Ended up working many days without a day off.  Barely saw my direct Manager.  No training on how to deal with Union before being put on your own. Poor communication.
bad,Management was not very good in IT which was disappointing.  As a whole it was a good company prior to divesting. I can't speak for the current two companies since I'm not employed at either companies.
bad,After using all the resources at the plant they shut the plant down and went overseas. Left the plant to just rot. They did make a announcement this past week they were shutting down permanently.
bad,Takes advantage of their workers. Destroys self esteem. Minimal communication between coworkers creates a nightmare of a workplace. My advice to anyone thinking about working here is to look somewhere else. You will be much happier.
bad,"A lot of changes need to be made. The work environment isn't the best. The job makes you work as if that job is your life. Majority of the workers are great people. However, the higher authority system is not the best. they'll try to work everything out of you before deciding if they want to make you permanent or release you. They'll pay you minimum before giving you what you're worth."
bad,"Atmosphere of fear from the top down. Much of first level management characterized by young, ambitious, egotistical individuals with little regard for anything but their own advancement. Performance review system designed to weed out older workers. Layoff specifically targeted older workers."
bad,"Lack of training, lack of management, lack of support made this the most stressful company I had ever worked with. Benefits were excellent and the pay was very efficient, but you bust your rear to make any progress for no feedback or acknowledgement. Management is very clickish and hard to get along with."
bad,entreprise familiale aucune chance d'etre embauché si vous n'avez aucune famille ami avec les chefs en poste il font toujours passer les amis et la familles en premier temps meme si il n'ont pas forcement de compétences pour un poste
bad,decent place to work to get your experience up. Not much growth. more like a job not a career choice.
bad,"monitoring safety, making production goals, safety tool box, projob briefs, reviews, filed audits"
bad,"Alcoa values life balance and high ideals but the culture at their Power and Propulsion division does not follow that. Family time is not respected, constantly on call even on vacation. They even called me in the middle of a funeral for a family member.  "
bad,"Discuss turn overs and company business, work orders are given out.During the day you could have eight or more work orders, it could be electrical or mechanical. The worse jod is dealing with Hydrofluoric acid units."
bad,Starts with HR at the Tucson location! She rules the location with rudeness & unfairness. I left the company as many others did because of her. You cannot achieve advancement unless you are in her circle. The company ignores what has been done to good people as she somehow convinces them to see her side. I’m dumbfounded by this happening.
bad,"Great Pay for the area, but the whole atmosphere and attitude is very very poor.  Long hours.  Will let you know that you are replaceable and your job is always at risk."
bad,"No family life at all. Forced to work and on call 24/7. If you don't answer a text, voice message or your phone you get points on your attendance. No organization at all. Bad equipment."
bad,"Otherwise they would not do so many layoffs, they always have too much or too little inventory sometimes you do nothing but have to look busy and they expect you on your hands and knees scrubbing if no work to do."
bad,The 12 hour night shift (6pm-6am) is a killer. The schedule takes a lot of time away from my family. I miss a lot of their events and holiday with the entire family. I am looking for a more stable position.
bad,"This job is highly stressful because there is no training program. You are expected to learn as you go. Overtime is not mandatory, however if you do want to work, overtime designation policies are not enforced."
bad,"There is no stability or security. I enjoy my coworkers and have worked very hard, but they have decided to close down the company."
bad,"Twenty plus years ago it was a place that everyone around was trying to get into , but the last ten not so much . Upper management forgot what we did to make this place work ,and all the sacrifices that were made to help them succeed ."
bad,"A wonderful place for students  of union and management symbiosis and middle class abandonment. It's CEO is a disgraced leader of Siemens who somehow managed to land on his feet at Alcoa. His leadership has percolated throughout the system,a truly inspiring human who has done a wonderful job of spreading Alcoa values throughout their entire world wide organization, more than justifying his seven figure salary.It is a truly ringing endorsement when 80% of their employees at their bell weather plant list the biggest reason for employment with Alcoa is ""it's the best in the area""."
bad,"Exposure to various particulates, hazardous chemicals, heat, noise, stress, molten metal splatter, crushing, lifting etc."
bad,"Management is awful they have no clue as to what their doing!  Too many ""clicks"" in management.  I advanced to many departments, never got my raise i was told I would get! You work 10-12 hours a day and at the end of the month you work 16 hour shifts.  Weekends you work if needed.  Total chaos in shipping dept, (I didn't work in that dept), One guy that works in that dept can run circles around everyone else DJ the MAN! That dept would be LOST without him!!"
bad,"The benefits were affordable and great, but if you have small children this is not the place to work. You are expected to work 55-60 hours per week at a 40hr per week salary. It is almost impossible to leave for childrens' appointments and activities. The teammates were not team players and were not good back ups. Management did not care about our personal lives and we were expected to be robots."
bad,"Lay-off no job security , and union has changed culture for the worst.I do not recommend this job if you are looking for job security the management and supervision team needs more training"
bad,Contractors beware - Do not like this review so sorry I am just going to hit same key to fill count. Now is the time to for all men to come to the aid of their party.
bad,Due to lack of promotional opportunities and leadership deficiencies along with pending layoffs and pension revoked for salaried employees left the company to find something more suitable.
bad,"Company has a good business model. it is string in their market and also very innovative."
bad,Worked there for years and was laid off. Found out on the radio on my way home from work that they would lay off 600 workers.The company didn't talk to the workers before they talked to the media.
bad,"This was a very bitter and stifling work environment.  I've never encountered more complaining and back-stabbing.  The employees were not helpful with one another, nor friendly.  The compensation was generous; however, I would not stay on past the end of my contract... even if they had offered to pay me double!"
bad,Alcoa is not very interested in your personal work life balance.  They act like they care.  This company is very corporate and they continue to lie to everyone to make everyone feel comfortable.
bad,Your experience at Alcoa will depend largely on which individual team you belong to. Alcoa is so large that the top is very diconnected from the rest. Good pay and benefits. Lots of upcoming retirees that are holding on to power and status quo even if it means the company is not as technologically advanced or productive as it could be.
bad,"Aluminum extrusion, heat treat equipment, and full machine repair. Millwright work in a mill enviorrment, very hot very dirty. 12 hour days."
bad,Factory is filled with a cancerous dust that the parts put off the they are worked on. It is a aerospace industry job. inspect parts with a 10X it is a very stressful job. you are forced to put parts out that go in jets and if they are bad people can die....only a 15 min lunch and 2 10 min breaks.
bad,Very routine type enviroment and not really any challenges.
bad,Has alot flaws in management and personal and also has a high turn over rate due to managment discrimination.
bad,"This company has a dishonest and unhelpful HR department. They are not supportive of all employees but just the ones they know and like. They don't like to give direction or instructions and will throw an employee under the bus at the first opportunity. No breakroom, inclimate temperatures in the offices, dirty and not well-maintained facility. Pays well compared to some other places and has good benefits. No job security, no loyalty, biggest concern is that the union will make them hold up to their committments. Hides behind community service as positive, but always looking for a way to cut down the workforce. If you come to work here, keep your eye out for your next job at all times!"
bad,"The people who actually do the work at the plant are great.  They’re hard working, dedicated individuals.  The management is completely out of touch with the workers and have unrealistic demands.  They rarely listen and if they do listen, you’ll be labeled as a whiner,...until, of course, someone gets hurt.  They are not proactive - they are reactive!"
bad,"one week payed vacation a year you can only used state provided sick pay to take a day off or one of your 3 electives. mandatory over time of 20 hours a week. pay tops out pretty low for the area i live in."
bad,"This was a good place to work, it just did not fit my lifestyle at the time. The hours were not good because I have small children and the hours did not agree."
bad,"The work environment is unhealthy: workers are exposed to poorly handled hazardous materials; and stressful conditions created due to lack of competent managers.  ""Ownership"" is displayed primarily by hourly employees."
bad,Strong union environment was not for me.  Not much work ethic from the staff I had unless overtime was involved which is too unethical for me.  Plant was getting ready to close down.
bad,Management very Green and only care about product output. No spare parts available for a fairly new plant. Production manager tries to run maintenance dept. and has no experience in the field.
bad,You will learn in one of the most challenging and precise industries. Corporate has great ideas and goals but they are not necessarily practiced in all locations. Each location around the world is different and although they have to follow corporate ideals they function as their own entity.
bad,"This company needs to open their eyes. They Make implantable medical component's that are used to help put peoples lives back together after they have suffered some kind of trauma. What greater opportunity is there than to have a job that helps out our fellow men and woman?  The culture there refuses to recognize this.  The culture there is low, unhappy, un-proud, back stabbing, finger pointing, non-team environment. Drugs are used by some of the workers, a walk thru the parking lot at lunch and it can be smelled. I can't say l enjoyed as hard as l tried, a single day working with the staff at Remmele Medical."
bad,"when there was work it was ok. if it rained,no work.got along great with co workers,but the best part was the pay."
bad,"Empresa boa muito focada nos valores de uma corporação com 125 anos de existencia."
bad,"Paid well, under-appreciated, childish clicky culture, poor management, Union is iffy, better be good at teaching yourself (training is sub par), not hard/ poor direction,"
bad,"I found quite a few of the women in the New York office to be mean spirited and entitled. Good news no more New York office. Surprising the Executives were polite and respectful, a few of the Assistants could have followed their lead."
bad,"If you expect to leave work behind you when you go home, get another job. A large, low seniority, drug ridden work force who need constant management, there is not enough supervision to go around. Be aware, you will do the job of 3 people. And, with the union, you have a target on your back as a supervisor. It's BS, find another job."
bad,Uma equipe que não conseguia trabalhar sob pressão e uma liderança imatura.
bad,"Start at 5 am racking completed tire assemblies. Coworkers would show up late most days. I would move from the tire-racking area to the wheel line after lunch. Overall, a good, steady job."
bad,Understaffed and work load at all levels is too much and work efficiency suffers. Safety suffers because of the lack of personnel
bad,"Operating smelting apparatuses called pots. Using overhead crane to tap liquid aluminum and attend to pots' needs. Safety and efficiency were required of each employee."
bad,"If culture and work/life balance is important to you, then I'd recommend you stay away. Within the first three months you realize why everyone is so miserable; it's soul draining."
bad,"Audit and invoice driven company.  Hard to navigate."
bad,Overall a okay place to work but stressful. Great people there. Very fast paced which is okay but priorities can change in a minute which you are required to respond accordingly. You are held accountable for many things out of your control. They communicate with the employees adequately and have a sound safety and quality structure. The workload in the engineering area is endless. This is their weak point as new engineers are destined to fail with poor training and are assigned responsibilities beyond their capabilities. Expect to work 60 hours a week and weekends and be on-call 24 hours.
bad,"I worked an average of 50 hours per week, with weekends off. I learned computer programs such as Oracle and IQN while performing daily job duties. My direct manager is a very knowledgable individual and a lot of fun to work with. The most difficult part of my job was knowing all the work I was doing in reconciling contractor time, would probably never be utilized as intended when I was hired. I really enjoyed working with Alcoa, my boss and co-workers are a great bunch of people."
bad,"carico-scarico con snodati.utilizzo di cisterne,articolati,gru,pale meccaniche"
bad,"work environment was slow, recommended for somebody who wants a steady job and few headaches"
bad,"Environnement de travail malsain entre employés! Malgré mes 24 ans de service,pas de poste permanent!"
bad,They closed let 600 go just to reopen wasn't really treated fair felt like I was a number instead of a employee your almost always forced over to 16hr shift and safety is not number 1. If you get hurt your called a baby.
bad,Worked here for years and it was a great company things changed when Alcoa took over and things became very restrictive and things were micro managed.  It became increasingly more difficult to work independently..
bad,The most difficult part of the job was not knowing whether you will have a schedule from week to week.
bad,"Being a union shop there were little to no Black employees back in the day. This created a constant power struggle and Blacks were often reminded that we had no seniority. The worst time for me was right after 9-11. It seemed that even though the shop was majority White, with a few Blacks and Hispanics, there was the question of, ""who are the true Americans?"""
bad,"Corporate made us go on their software systems.  Ppl lost their jobs.  IT dept was cleaned out except for a couple"
bad,"Expect to work a lot, not get paid fairly, and layoffs without any warning, get little recognition for your work, and looked over unless you have an awesome boss like I do."
bad,"I was hired on with approx. 100 of the kind of neanderthal that beat me up in high school.  I could do the work, and do it safely, but they didn't want me there, so they did what they could to make things harder for me.  Management always liked me because I could follow directions and take initiative when directions were absent."
bad,Working confitions cold be dangerous. Safety condtions seldom met.  
bad,"Pays well but stifling environment.  Guiding principles are good, but certain management act as bullies and do not encourage open thinking or mentoring."
bad,"Load/unload semi trucks and take care of scrap building to make sure melting furnaces are supplied with scrap."
bad,"Very enjoyable and fun place to work."
bad,O horário é muito complicado a área de segurança é muito boa existem muitos treinamentos a empresa em si é boa para se trabalhar a gerência é ótima
bad,wouldn't be a bad place to work if they gave you some days off.
bad,Unless you are one of the product engineers you options are very limited.
good,Lack of communication I was promise a long term  job work me with no breaks at times . mon-Saturday 14 hours a day I went over and beyond for this company and they didn't even warn us about getting fired. Just because of budget cuts I never missed a day or ever late .
good,"This business is no longer in business, was an interesting job but did not pay much."
good,Veterans unwilling to train incoming workforce generation. Geriatric production rates due to inefficient labor and management. Apathy rapidly consuming young and old workers.
good,"The jobs are good, the culture is terrible.  There is so much red tape with everything.  They spend more time and money on Kiazens and TPMs than they do on making Aluminum.  Its just way too political.  be prepared to kiss a lot of butt."
good,"Het was tijdelijk werk "
good,"I like working there, good people and nice help chain, always something new to do .I was temp to hire through manpower and one year assignment is coming to an end."
good,Typical commodity based 24-7 operation which required 24-7 availability. Great peers that support each other and work well together.  Plant is isolated from the community.
good,"Supervisors don't care about anything but to get the work done, they get mad when you want to take a brake or lunch if the work isn't finished. If your work is done they will leave you alone. They will force you to work an extra 4 hours after a 12 hour day if work isn't finished it to clean when someone from head quarters is coming in. Great to make money but emotional tool on you and your family."
good,"mandatory 64 hour work week , working every other weekend . poor management changes every two years . before one vision is done they start a new one ."
good,First off there hasn’t been a raise in 5 years. The cost of living and rent and everything has gone up even minimum wage but Alcoa will only be giving a 60 cent raise April 2 2018. Insurance max out of pocket goes up 3-4 thousand and deductible up to $500. NOT TO MENTION THE UNION IS WORTHLESS. The union has full power over them selfs and super seniority. They make more money then all hourly except maintenance. There also are way to cozy with the company. Union is corrupt. Management is lacking and all over the place. Very hostile work place and some managers get away with a lot of harassment or hostile actions. The TURNOVER rate for employees is very very high which should tell you how this place is! All in all I would suggest going to a trade school and get a job worth your time and career. This place is a dead end trap and very sketchy when it comes to thinking it’s a career job.
good,"If you want to have opportunities to advance, this is not the place for you.  "
good,"Manage the metal check program for ALCOA.  Analyze metal from plants from all over the world and send reports to plants.  Also have experience in hydrogen tests, atmospheric tests and spectrometer and quantomoter operation."
good,I worked there for 37 years when it was called Kawneer Company of Canada and then it I couldn't stand the changes when Alcoa took over. They downsized and took all our manufacturing.  Lots of good workers lost their jobs.....so sad!
good,Long days 12 hours a day for 7 days a week. alternating hours during the week. management was good. They were seasoned employees. Co-workers were great. Helped trained and saw that you succeeded. No time for family
good,Only worked there under a year because plant was closed. People were very friendly and respectable. Culture was very laid back like most manufacturing environments.
good,Went into a very hot atmosphere and dealt with a great deal of heat and dangerous equipment.  You had to keep your eye out for your work environment and colleague.
good,not a horrible place to work for no real communication between workers and management low on quality high on production at one time lots of overtime not anymore the best part of the job was the benefits also very little training
good,"Manufacturing atmosphere, hard work. Extremely busy. Good safety habits and quality focus company. Excellent employee relations and HR open door policy."
good,poor focus on safety  very reactive management poor communication  between management and contractor
good,Pay and working conditions were good. Management was a revolving door of incompetent yes men. It's a house divided among the hourly employees.
good,"This company is poorly managed at HR level. Production increases, but staffing cuts are made to decrease production expense, which will increase the workload on remaining employees. "
good,My day consists of keeping the ameities clean.
good,"good intentions but do not possess the know how to implement the good intentions , the workforce engage to the concept of the Alcoa code of conduct , but the management do not"
good,I worked at this company 3 years ago and they have since gone large re-structuring. My opinion is no longer valid for this business as most of the upper management that caused issues are no longer present.
good,"A typical day at work, I would start the night with a Safety meeting."
good,"Need more employee activities, such as cookout, bowling, etc."
good,"Working at Alcoa has been a very big learning experience, they pay very well and offered many different types of benefits. But the lack of leadership or the knowledge our leadership had/has made work difficult. Alcoa has a rather big turnover rate for salary team members,  essentially hiring candidates from the outside. Whats really hurting the facility is the salary team members they hire aren't  knowledgeable pertaining to the job they'll supervise. Which makes it difficult for us to communicate our day to day struggles, because 9 out of 10 times they've never ran the machine and don't know what you're talking about. Most of the time when we had a problem with a machine our supervisor would grab a senior guy from our shift to figure out what to do. If they hired within from the floor, I feel the plant would flourish."
good,"A typical day involves turning, inspecting and moving rims inside a very, I reiterate VERY dirty factory. Just about every orifice if caked in oil, aluminum chips, grime and dirt. The work itself isn't hard but is repetitive and working six or seven days a week is not at all fun unless you have no life outside work as many here apparently don't."
good,"Work place is busy and interesting"
good,Great work experience.  Management bent their own rules to ensure production was met.  The corporation has a great EHS philosophy but the location was acquired and the old management was left in place and they did not have the same views.
good,Great supervisor and is a great place to work. The atmosphere is nice to work at. Very peaceful and family oriented. Overall a wonderful place to work at with nice people.
good,"You can never advance your career at Alcoa Bettendorf, plus idiots in upper management micro-manage from their big offices in bldg. 800, if you hire a Supervise they need to be supported by the upper management team."
good,"Great Benefits. Work life balance is non existent unless you are salary. The job culture is, ""production vs all else,"" contrary to the public image at least at this location. There is great management and knowledgeable leaders, and there are those who have no appreciation for human life. Co-workers are amazing to work with and keep the workplace interesting and diverse. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning the ins and outs of Alumina in the aerospace industry and qualifying as an NDT Level 1. Due to rough economic times, I was forced to fill a dead end monotonous job with no guarantee of continuing my career advancement. No rewards or recognition for hard work."
good,"Its a corporation, Overall a secure job."
good,"Good company, hard to get promoted. Very number driven."
good,The process of creating castings was amazing. Working as team to deliver a high quality product that exceeded customer requirements was very rewarding.
good,"I came to Alcoa with the expections that I would advance my career but they stuck me in a plant and this is where I will be until I find a new job. They don't care about individuals who are mid-level career, they only care about those individuals who recieve incentive pay. Very political work environment and male oriented. No work/life balance"
good,Alcoa has great pay but I had alot of bad days there. There was alot of favortisim and mean people with not justice. Their HR system did not handle situations the rite way and were very lazy.
good,"Very busy and productive workplace. Learned to monitor and calibrate many different gauges and measuring equipment. I was not under any direct supervision, which was nice. Worked at my own pace and produced sufficient results."
good,"Excellent entry-level company to become acclimated to corporate environment. Advancement is difficult. Pay is not great, but benefits are excellent."
good,"Hours are long and home/work life balance is not a concern or a priority to the leadership, Policies are always changing along with no accountability to the managers. Benefits and work environment are better than average. Could be a great Place to work if Mangers were hired based on training and ability, not just because they are the only ones to volunteer."
good,"Job and benefits were good inside maintenance "
good,"Alcoa is a very Large Company with very little personal interactions. You are a Number at Alcoa. No strategy, no focus. Pricing always way too high to win any business."
good,"Personally I love the 12 shift 3-2-2.  Was able to have days off during the week along with every other weekend,  Very unsafe place to work.  Working with 100 year old equipment that breaks down.  No money invested in the upkeep of the equipment.  Band-Aid's placed on all problems."
good,"Lots of chiefs, few Indians; Will let you work as many hours as you want and keep piling on the work.   Don't value their employees.  But the pay is good."
good,I thought the pay did not fit in with the type of work we had to do. It was fast paced so the day really did go fast. Heavy lifting was required so you did get a good work out. People there were fine to work with as well.
good,the union environment is stressful especially without management back up. supervision in this plant is very difficult and you don't have enough authority.
good,This employer closed their doors now so is not an option for anyone to apply. They did pay well and treated us decent and some times I do miss it but its a thing of the past now.
good,"There were many flaws at this particular mill in the Alcoa company. I have heard great things from other locations of the same company, but I did not have a good experience here. The management needed serious help and the mill workers couldn't win no matter how hard they tried and what they did. The mill workers were working seven days a week with rotating shifts and little to no vacation time, and any small mistake on their part could get them written up. The people who managed the mill often had no idea what was going on under their own roof, and every order that the mill got ended up leaving late."
good,"charge lourde , mauvaise équipement de levage. produits et poussière nocive."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, y aprendizaje diario en el maquinado de piezas metalicas, ademas del uso diario de intrumentos de medicion donde se aprende constantemente diferentes dipos de instrumentos los cuales se usan en base a planos y especificaciones de cada una de las piezas a maquinar."
good,"Under appreciated  and very stressful. Management overloaded with quadruple paperwork.  Management continually overloaded by constant turnover.  Was fully staffed for approximately 3 months out of three years,"
good,Good place to earn living but there was a lot of friction between workers and disrespect. Not a happy place but earned a living. Now they are closing the place down and job is in question.
good,I am a process operator and love what I do. To move up you have to be part of the chosen. There is no line of progression some one can be above you and have no clue how to do your job. On the other hand it is a fun place to work with great benefits. Not a place to work of you want to be rich
good,"Se trabaja agusto,cada area se dedica a su responsabilidad, se reparten esfuerzos para lograr metas, se tiene estabilidad y hay buenas ventajas de contrato cuando se llega a tener la planta de trabajo. Algo dificil del trabajar aqui es el tiempo que en ocasiones no se mide con prudencia y te consume de mas. cosas buenas pues es el trato de la gente, no hay niveles gerarquicos en cuanto a el personal."
good,"Rapid growth as a startup, with close teamwork when employees were empowered."
good,"Challenging workload to complete with no impact on Quality objectives, manufacturing process and requirements reviewed an d optimized. Co-workers and management silos inherent to productivity... but over all camaraderie."
good,"uma boa empresa de se trabalhar, porem devido as varias trocas de gestão administrativas nos ultimos 6 anos na unidade em trabalhei causou muita insatisfação aos funcionários pela falta de atenção em reconhecer nosso valor e os baixos salário em relação as suas competencias e compromisso com a empresa, diferente em outras unidades da mesma empresa"
good,"The typical workday I had at Alcoa started with a daily management briefing. After that, we were released to work on assigned projects. We also had a weekly group meeting to review everyone's progress in their projects and prepare a weekly update to the executives. Early in my work with Alcoa, I learned a lot because they gave me freedom to explore tasks and projects of my choosing. The hardest part of my job was to deal with 'nay-sayers' and figuring out business propositions aligned with the core business of Alcoa - aluminum smelting."
good,The conditions are horrid. The place is probably slowly giving me cancer but at least the benefits and pay are alright. Prepare for a lot of mandatory overtime.
good,"C'est dur de donner un avis qui est changeant selon les gents et les impératifs du moments"
good,"The company was a relax environment to work in.  I worked as a Receptionist.   Working with the Switchboard, Greeting Clients, mailing, accounts payable and other related office duties.  The staff was very nice to work with, the work was pretty easy, they kept me busy and the hours were also great."
good,Significant management changes recently. Alcoa was spun off from Arconic. Senior Staff is too focused on Quarterly vs long term good of the organization.
good,Alcoa is a very stressful environment and management shows a lot of favoritism. There were a lot of great people which made going to work each day more enjoyable.
good,"Had w wonderful 10 years but the plant was bought in the late 90's and it was clear that ALOCOA was not going to keep it open. I was happy with how much was invested in me as an employee. But in the end it was about the dividend,"
good,"Service maintenance bien organisé"
good,I was with this company for almost 10 years and went through two layoffs and a transfer. The company is not concerned with its employees.
good,Not much room for moving up in this career. Benefits are good. The air quality needs improvement. Management has good communication skills. I would recommend this job for people that doesnt want to move up the latter. All and all it is a good place to work.
good,As a salaried exempt employee you can expect to be working 50+ hr weeks is the norm. You will be filling multiple rolls. Management expects you to come up with cost saving measures and your performance counts on it. There are serious concerns around aging facilities and upkeep with the major capital constraints. All that said the people are amazing and put their hearts and souls into the company.
good,"Lavoro ciclo continuo ambiente molto caldo."
good,"Busy day at work."
good,management work with you ran two machines with great pay good 401 family setting work place good place to excel good safe to work
good,"bon rapport avec mon chef"
good,"Ainda que a rotina diária na produção fosse desgastante, as pessoas faziam o diferencial tornando o ambiente mais agradável. Embora não tivesse tanto contato com os gestores, alguns mostravam-se abertos a qualquer diálogo acerca  da empresa e das pessoas que dela faziam parte. Aprendi a utilizar a ferramenta 5S e evoluí bastante no âmbito pessoal/profissional. Com a grande maioria dos colegas sendo prestativos e bem extrovertidos, de fato, as melhores horas do trabalho eram as conversas que podiamos ter quando a produtividade das máquinas permitia. A parte difícil sempre era a de preparação de máquina. Uma vez que as mesmas produziam 24horas por dia ininterruptamente, qualquer parada significava trabalho redobrado, não pelo que se tinha de fazer mas pelo calor excessivo, típico de uma fundição de alumínio, que transformava qualquer esforço físico num verdadeiro sufoco, mas o costume tornava o calor, de certa forma, suportável e o uso dos EPIs disponibilizados pela empresa ajudava bastante."
good,Big Place. Dangerous place can kill you in a heart beat. Very Nice Benefits. Always on your toes watching for something unsafe.
good,To many supervisors (mid to upper level) gave the impression of only looking out for themselves. Co workers were not to bad when they stayed around.
good,"Stuck on a shift where you have no direct contact with your immediate supervisor, having no contact with engineering and never met the manager of your department.  Not being able to switch shifts, learn new skills and traits for advancement.  You feel like you are an expandable commodity, easily replaced and or unwanted by upper level management.  Money was good and so were benefits."
good,Ok place to work if you don't mind going to work 6-7 nights a week and not seeing your family at all. I learned how to use various tools and measuring equipment. They do offer awards and some incentives.
good,i had to clean machines like big saws etc.also had to sweep all areas of the factory .had to repaint any damaged paint work.management was ok but think there was a bit of favoritism my co workers was great friendly and got along well.there weren't really any hard jobs to honest bt i enjoyed the painting aspect of the job
good,"I was with my last company for a little over five years and in the same department throughout. A typical day at work for me would be to handle all daily tasks first, then move onto crucial, moment in time matters. Daily tasks included reviews on customer accounts, respond to all emails and phone messages from the evening prior, supply lien releases after researching the job to ensure it has been paid; also process credit memo's and work on claims that may arise from bad material being shipped to one of our customers. My main job was collections and I often had many job duties that had to be complete prior to reviewing past due activity to call on. On the claims, for example, if the customer had a material issue they would not be paying us and this is where I came in. Both the customer and our internal customer service team would try to let our department know."
good,The pay here is very good. And there is plenty of opportunity for overtime pay. The downside is management lacks luster. The lazy are rewarded and the good workers are taken advantage of.
good,"It was ok, Cold in winter months. Interesting work on the machines did start to repeat itself though. Quite high batches of work. Shift pattern isn’t the best if you haven’t worked 4 on 4 off before."
good,This was not a place that offered any stability.   Communication within the site was very limited and no warning given to rank and file workers about the closing of the site.
good,"You have to wear a respirator a majority of the time, and your face is still black from all the chemicals you breathe in. The schedule is four on two off switching from days to nights.  I don’t mind working my butt off but I met someone that got a long disease from working there and that’s why am looking for a new job."
good,No major complaints. Total team work required to achieve our goals. Separated between Melt Shop and Casters.  Melt shop ensured metal was hot to produce desired products and casters ensured the gauge of metal being produced.
good,Union plant and company allowed the union to run the plant at the expense of production. Rapidly moved from shift supervisor to Day supervisor. In line for next level opportunity but got married and had to look elsewhere.
good,"Culture mismatch for personal style. Stated mission not bought into by senior leadership.  "
good,I have been with Alcoa/Arconic my entire career and it has for most part been very enjoyable.  I currently wish to retire from Alcoa/Arconic and to pursue a new opportunity with future growth potential. I have been in my current role for the past 13 years and feel it is time to move on as my current position does not have room for advancement.
good,Je conseille cette boîte intérim car souriant et pas de soucis particulier
good,"Good place to work, but POOR management and very stressfull atmosphere."
good,"The typical work day was hot."
good,"I worked under a contractor, so it was a good company to work for but had to get passed the contractors to get promotions.. I like my job regardless but will always put my best into what ever position that I am in."
good,"A good place to work overall, but the break-up of the company over the last year has led to much down-sizing. Even a few years before the break-up, the company has been in a down-sizing mode. This applies to Arconic mostly, which was previously known as Alcoa, Inc."
good,"Family oriented culture, but not a lot of helpful criticism for someone learning. This is, in large part, due to how lean the company is running. Often times, I will ask for assistance, and no one will be available."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. While employed for Alcoa primary metals I was able to learn  from more experienced crew members, work together as a team, perform the task safely  and efficiently with highest regards to our safety policy,. It was a great  learning experience."
good,"The company is now changing to embrace value-added product development,  When I was there, it was strictly all about moving metal."
good,"The pay was great, you could work a lot of overtime .The worst thing about the job was the heat in the summer.Alcoa provided for my family and I good living for over 18 years."
good,Poor management and no job security.  A good addition to your resume but I wouldn't recommend making your stay there very long.
good,"Job pays well but very repetitive , the hours are long and the shifts are four days on dour days off and switch from nights to days"
good,"Being a Union environment I feel unable to excel with this employer.  All hourly (union) persons are treated the same, without regard to actual job performance."
good,"great community involvement, must be a multi-tasker, enjoy working with the people"
good,Very unpredictable and dangerous working around molten metal. 
good,Good paying job with good benefits. Could be physical at times but overall not difficult. Very hard to work this job with a family.
good,Learned different positions and developed great team work stategies.
good,Constantly changing management. Good benefits.
good,"Uma empresa que presa segurança em primeiro lugar, onde a segurança esta a cima da lucratividade. Como e uma empresa nova com equipamentos de primeira linha as manutenção são programadas, prevenindo manutenção corretiva, tem um grupo de ótimos profissionais aprendi muito com dada um deles, operador, mecânico, eletricista e demais profissionais e a importância da boa comunicação em 3 vias, o trabalho em equipe."
good,"It's a good company to work for, but I don't see myself going anywhere except continue working in sales."
good,"Easy going, good management. Days were busy, but rewarding, they recognize hard work which is very important. As an intern pay was fair, overall good place to work"
good,nothing bad to say. I only worked there for 5 months i should have stayed the only reason i left was because i was offered a straight day job with more money.
good,Overall this was a good company.  I would probably still be there.  The company moved to Mexico. I did not want to move to Mexico.  I enjoyed being there.
good,"Alcoa is a company that melts down aluminum. If you work at Alcoa you better be prepared to work, the job title might seem easy but its not, you have to take pride in your work to work for a company like Alcoa"
good,It was okay working at Alcoa. It was A job that helped me pay the bills. It has taken a toll on ones body working over 40 hour every week with out a break.
good,Part an accounting team that was assisting with an acquisition. Management staff changed 3 times. Long hours. Seemed like client was in fear of management.
good,The environment of the credit union is not really good at all. The work that you do in the credit union can be very heavy depending on what department you are in.
good,"The work is tough, and physically demanding.  The pay isn't great, and the management do not care genuinely about their employees. The will work you into the ground and not care at all.  If anything goes wrong, they are quick to blame the operators."
good,"Must know your Metrics, And what's going on in your Departments at all times, example; what's in your Department, what product is where, how fast can you get product through your department"
good,"It was a great place to work prior to the company separation.  I can't speak to what it is like to work for now as I no longer work there, I work for a different company."
good,This was a good company to learn how to be a good manager. I had strong leaders that mentored me. As time pasted the company cultured started to change.
good,"Work is cyclical.  I was hired as a department manager and tasked to man-up and train the department for upcoming work.  Just as I increased roll and got the new people qualified, the big contract fell through and I had to lay off everyone I had just hired.  Fearing the same would happen to me, I found other work before possibly being let go.  I have since learned this is a repeating pattern there. "
good,Is fun to work with the different tipes of metals 401k avalible benefits as well overtime..............................................................lear mazotrol
good,Gran oportunidad que marcó el inicio de mi carrera profesional
good,"Lack of job security and work load stress, Management was very fragmented and followed no consistent  systems. High employee turn over leading to poor working conditions"
good,"It was a good job, but the conditions were less than favorable. A typical day involved extreme heat, toxic fumes, smoke, carbon dust, alumina ore dust, loud ambient noise levels, asbestos, the potential for violent electrical discharge and long hours."
good,"safe place to work, probably still be working there if the price of aluminum was not so expensive to produce, that is why I got laid off.  wanted to retire from there."
good,management not respectful...treated just like a time card number and didn't feel valued as employee. long stressful hours. pay was great and also benefits.
good,"lavoro programmato ,carico di mansioni elevate, ottimo coordinamento in team"
good,As long as you do what your suppose to do you won't have any problems. Not a place to work if your a slacker. Definitely one thing they will not pit up with.
good,"Buenas prestaciones con bajo salario, difícil crecer"
good,Everything here was based on making money. most employees did not give much care to what went along as long as they got paid at the end of the week. Employees were reluctant to go out of their way to make a difference. it was a little discouraging.
good,Work there for a few year....Ingot debt.  They took care of me when my spouse passed....  The senior manager above me was rough around the edges and said things that were over the line-probably because of the stress he was getting/ Not his fault I'm sure just wanted to keep his position. He no longer work there.
good,"The company was very far from the city, the environment is ok. I guess it could be better if they get better managers and leaders. In my projects I had a few struggles with the people I worked with because we had different ideas."
good,"buen trato, los bonos son buenos, facilidad de cresimiento"
good,"Hard to explain.  Dangerous fast paced. Very hot and physical.  As seniority increased we could bid on better jobs.  The plant is 60 years old.  I do not seeing ever starting back up,  After 20+ years there I find that sad"
good,"Nice place to work, if you don't mind working swing shift and alot of overtime. Got to try several different jobs but never given the chance to move up in the company."
good,Improving process control systems and monitoring of manufacturing network and domain. Great to work with such talented people. Culture is growing to welcome diversity.
good,"good pay, long hours. overall good job with good benefits. very productive workplace with strict goals company wide. there is a very high turn over rate"
good,"Pros"
good,It's an ok place to work but it needs some up keeping needs some better equipment. We need a better contract..no sick days. And they are trying to stop our overtime. If that happens a lot of people will walk..let's hope that doesn't happen..i like the people i work with.
good,"Company policies support employees but management in reality have a hidden agenda. Many pro employee programs and good company policy towards the environment and community. In reality, management's political games detour my expectation and efforts towards what I though was a great company. The bad management habits trickled down and didn't sustain the policies"
good,"Alcoa Tempcraft was a decent company to work for.  Good pay, good people, however it fell victim to extreme working hours to offset very outdated / inefficient work flows and operating systems."
good,I usually did laser etching and parts locating. This company is huge so there were a lot of manufacturing skills I learned. Management could have been better.
good,good company but senior mgmt sold division  ran the company in to the ground.  nice people but  issues on how to spend on of equipment was the downfall.
good,"This site is no longer open; curtailed due to market conditions.. Alcoa, as a whole, is a very thriving and developmental company where advancement is not as challenging because of the opportunities."
good,"Arconic is a company specializing in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Arconic’s products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, etc."
good,Good place to work. Spent many years of my life. it has its up and downs as most companies do. There was some things I didn't but most companies can't make everyone happy.
good,"Most of the first line manager lack of knowledge"
good,"Alcoa is a decent place to work if you can stand 8 hours with no restrictions, and can withstand heat, cold, dirty environments,some fumes, walking.the job can be physical"
good,Fast paced and detailed job assisting accountants with sale of division. Long hours worked often on little notice. Difficult to plan your life. Very knowledgeable group.
good,Nice folks to work with. A lot of old equipment and very low budget to get anything new. This is a problem at a lot of places as the drive for the most profit is high.
good,"large company been around for years dangerous work fast pace environment your safety depends on others as well as yourself"
good,This is a good job but the hours I had to get use too and after that it was good I moved up quickly and the job was pretty easy the most fun I had at a job in a long time
good,"Big turnover with content change. Someone new steps into a power position and makes changes that don't make sense for the company. In the 16 years that I worked for the company, we were bought out 3 times and had multiple GMs. The company offers great benefits and competitive pay. HR needs to be managed better but over all, if you are looking for a good paying job in Wichita Falls, they are one of the best."
good,Career growth is the only incentive to work here in my opinion.  Salaries are not commensurate with function or responsibility.  Workplace culture can be difficult to navigate.
good,"well I cant complain about this job, the job was easy and therefore didn't pay much but I was young so didn't care much for it. just got shocked when we were informed that warehouse was shutting down"

good,Mantenimiento de las máquinas de transformación de aluminio.
good,"3-shift work, I had 37 steady employees and during early shift they were 50 employees; work tasks: supervise complete production-cycle from material supply, extrusion, heat treatment, customizing, adjusting to packing, work safety, further education of employees, personal planning such as holidays and scheduling of work tasks; the bad thing about it: a loud workplace; the best thing about it: 9 nations within my shift and an incredible good cooperation between them."
good,"une journee de travail typique"
good,Good place to work.  Good benefits but high cost. and community awareness.  Except for a few top leaders most are good. Business is primarily manufacturing fasteners.
good,Plant does pay well and the work is stable but the salary side of business can be a bit of a nightmare. I have work both and being hourly there definitely comes with way less headaches.
good,"Work days pretty easy going if we had the parts and equipment to do the jobs. A lot of union co works done little or nothing same team members doing most of the work. Poor work habits could mostly be blamed on upper management not doing their job. Co-workers was one big brother everyone work well together. Hardest part of the job was finding parts, material and equipment to do the job. Most enjoyable part was co-works you got to work with and meet.Corp. management didn't carry about workers to much just wanted the numbers to look good."
good,"Good place to work, only left to go to GTW in Georgetown. I enjoyed it there. Was there for a few years doing the same thing I do now. little room for growth."

good,good place  to work. its out side learned a lot welded stuff and fixed stuff . always worked on something different so it was nice
good,A typical day at work was to complete 8 hours of work with 2 breaks.  The hardest part of job was the late hours.  Co-workers were excellent to be around.
good,Ok company to work for. I am now redundant after only a short amount of time since being bought out so didn't really have enough time to for an opinion.
good,During my eight years that I was employed  at Alcoa Inc. I experienced good teamwork with great pay and good benefits for the valley.
good,"Like most companies it pays to work as an Ex-Pat overseas, hired locally severely limits pay and ability for advancement.  Excellent company that has a great pipeline of product but underutilizes the excellent pipeline.  Great in Aerospace Automotive and other industries.  Has amazing potential if would look into more product development"
good,over all not a bad place to work the hours are long and the management is a constant debate between employees. to each his own
good,"There is always something to learn. Every day is a different experience. Like every other job, there are those who are a joy to work with and others you have to push a bit more."
good,If you can get through the red tape on a daily basis you can do very well with ALCOA. Lots of after work activities if you have the time.
good,great coworkers and safe environment to be. managers are friendly and caring. HR is a great person and is willing to help you understand company policies.
good,I enjoyed working on the equipment. It stayed interesting because I could be working on anything from 1970's slate board relay logic to todays newest plc's and drives. I enjoyed working with my fellow maintenance and production crews and staff. I enjoyed working on new equipment installation and debugging.
good,"enjoyed 17 yrs there. enjoyed the people and friendships made. "
good,"pay is below average, lack of strong leaders with clear direction, vacation policy is terrible - 2 weeks for everyone to start - even if you are 20 years into your career, you start with 2 weeks. Technology is completely out dated (using a recruiter ATS that hasn't been updated in 10+ years). Lazy, stubborn employees who pass off work to anyone they can and don't accept responsibility when something goes wrong"
good,Alcoa doesn't seem to have a long term goal . They have a day to day plan with no Maintennce. They don't have a contingency plan for anything . This type of upper management system causes moral to be low . I really don't like that it is foreign run an they have no interests in US . I am hoping the U.S. government gets some sense and doesn't let them send in metal from foreign country  plants untaxed ..
good,"Stable job with little or no traveling.  Typical work days are long.  "
good,"the work is hard, the environment isnt for everyone.  They do pay you sufficiently for what they ask you to do on a day to day basis"
good,"A days work usually consisted of the same thing. I enjoyed working with everyone i did. This job wasn't hard to learn. I worked third shift, and there was plenty to do in order to get through the night."

good,"A Typical Day For Me as an Industrial Cleaner Was Dusting Down Rails and Machines & Cleaning Up Metal Swarf "
good,Expect to work long hours and the schedule changes nearly every week sometimes without any warning. Very hot work environment.
good,"Alcoa is busy throughout each shift, with a great problem solving that allows me to utilize my 30 years of Chemistry experience.  I have learned to operate the latest technology in Wastewater Treatment while I have been at Alcoa, that is only used in less than an estimated 10 plants in the United States."
good,"The facility of Alcoa that i worked for in Hampton VA.,was a very dangerous place to work as far as what we did, but alot of safety measures were in place to keep one as safe as possible.Jobs would have went out faster sometimes if it weren't for all the safety steps included in doing your job, but safety is and was top priority.I liked that i could count on not doing the same jobs every night so it kept it interesting."
good,"long working day , learned how different solutions react to different parts when the solution is strong or weak, management is ok, good relationship with coworkers, the hardest part of the job is breathing the chemicals particularly when the solution is new, the most enjoyable part of the day is when your hard work is shown by the way the work order comes out looking"
good,I love working there. so much opportunity you can gain from there. nice coworkers that work together .I would have love to continue working there but my short hospital stay make them no choice but replace me
good,"carregamento de matéria prima para produção,comprimento de horários na entrega de matéria prima para não parar linha de produção,ótima convivência com colegas de trabalho"
good,Alcoa was a stressful workplace where you were forced to work OT on weekends

good,all you can do is run your machines and you have to start with a temp service
good,Not a whole lot to say about this company though. But it's a good place to work for. I hate the management. they do things the way the government does things.
good,"shutdown work ,great place to work ,great team ,maintance an repair work"
good,This is a casting facility for airplane turbines. I have never worked in a plant/warehouse environment and it was definitely something that took some time getting used to.The airplane industry is a great field to work in and I enjoyed learning the different castings and how they all came together. Overall a fair experience.
good,Alcoa is a good place to work if you are a motivated person.  Multi-tasking is common place in this work environment.  There are many talented people that work in the Ingot Plant.  Great team players.
good,"Na Alcoa nos respeitados como pessoas. O clima organizacional é agradável, temos flexibilidade de horário. A gerência é muito transparente com os funcionários e sabemos sempre o que acontece em todas as unidades de negócio."
good,"Enchimento de Big Beg's, carregamentos e descarregamento de caminhões, foram seis meses até me promoverem a coordenador de equipe, atuei seis meses na coordenação direcionando e fiscalizando os colaboradores nas atividades diárias controlando saída de Epi’s e uniformes conduzindo os DDS ( diálogo diário de segurança ), tivemos que dispensar um empilhadeirista, e diante das condições da empresa não contratariam outro operador sendo assim voltei a operar e coordenar até que participei do processo seletivo para vaga de operador de utilidades na empresa Danone por ter passado pedi conta, detalhe: a empresa que eu trabalhava na área da Alcoa era terceira ( LV ), tive também proposta para passar para Alcoa más o setor não me interessava ( sala de cubas )."
good,"Follow, set up and operate machine to spec. fast paced at times."
good,they dont take care of people who give so much of there time
good,Did not stay long enough to have a real opinon about the place because I left to join the Marine Corps.
good,It's manufacturing. There are countless problems to solve and not enough hours in the day.
good,"This is a factory job and is better than other factory jobs that I have had. It is not the best place to work, but if you are working in a factory, this is a good place."
good,"Work does get routine and boring sometimes though, upper management needs more structured outline for internship program"
good,A typical day work starts with checking mails and following up with customers for any ongoing issues..

good,Gave me 8 years of experience in plant operations. meet some great people during my time and knowledge to help me better myself and family. I learned how to operate equipment
good,Alcoa was a great first job experience but room was advancement for senior engineers was challenging at the Dover facility. Not much energy was put into development by managers and many talented engineers stagnated or left due to lack of career growth opportunities.
good,"Excellent pay and benefits, but management gets flustered easy and affects shift performance. Vacation time starting out is pretty good 5 days paid but don’t get anything more than that until 3 years of service. Long shifts and depends on where you work in the plant but might be the easiest money you’ve ever made. Seniority gets favored over new employees as far as leniency in discipline and shift pick."
good,"As a whole the company is a great place to work. Most managers are great to work with though with my time here, I had five supervisors within four years. The only good one for the department was a micro-manager and made some employees miserable. The hardest part was navigating the micro-managing supervisor. The co-workers were a bright spot in everyone's day. Everyone worked as a team unless the perception of the supervisor was not seen that way."
good,"There would be a lot of big pots to wash i personally didn't like to wash them because at a certain point there was too many and my wrist would have heavy pain. But it was a nice job, free food, great co-workers. Moving around and cleaning wasn't a problem for me."
good,"If you are looking for a place to learn quick, this is it. There was a lot of old equipment that needed tender love and care or just flat out a replacement with new technology. So your rate of knowledge and growth would be exponential"
good,"The office is very small, not much interaction. There is no social aspect at all, so wouldnt really suit any younger person. Office was pleasant enough, but no advancement prospects"
good,Good place to work. Management was organized. Learned about hydraulics and high pressure systems. Hardest part of the job was troubleshooting the presses when they would break down.
good,"Una empresa que despide a un trabajador estando de baja cuando encima lo han tenido 3 años trabajando en Bilbao sin poner el ninguna traba, creo que ya dice bastante de ella."
good,"Des projets intéressants régulièrement lancés et avec des moyens qui permettent de travailler dans de bonnes conditions."
good,Alcoa/ Now Arconic is finding their way within the business world.  Our process at a local level is difficult to be managed from a corp office.  I have been fortunate enough to set many standards although credit has not been given to me.
good,"everyday is a new day, seems like the union runs the shop, team members are not motivated to work.  very sad that most team members spend more time trying not to then just to do their job"
good,"ALCOA is a Union driven plant. It is a good place to work with great Benefits. The pay at ALCOA is what you would call high middle, but what you get in Medical and 401K make up the difference."
good,"very hazardous "
good,To much micro managing top management. The people at the plant were great to work with. Equipment to small for the job at hand.
good,Long hours and working days and nights is hard on the family life. I've learned to work shift work and first time at a smelter. Management is mediocre at best. The complainers and problem employees out weigh the good employees of this company. Hardest part of my job was not being able to help my employees as this was a union environment. Best art of my job was making up work and getting caught up over the weekend.
good,É um bom local de trabalho e aprendizado mas a crise que ja dura alguns anos torna um ambiente com pouca possibilidade de investimentos e crescimento.
good,"Typical day - Adventure"
good,•	Working as Supplier Integration Engineer on GM programs for the Design and Release of Wheels.
good,"A typical day at work starts at 4 AM and ends at 12. I sample the molten aluminum and test it in the lab for impurities and content ratios. I learned a great deal, from heavy equipment to specialized computer programs for using the quantometer to test the aluminum samples. Management is, for the most part, helpful and willing to work out most issues. Co-workers are friendly and always wiling to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of my current job is enduring the heat. It is not to difficult when you work for half of your shift in 150 degrees+ to get a little drained. The enjoyable part of the job is the people. we all go through the ups and downs together and it makes for a pretty tight knit group of people."
good,"A typical day at Alcoa was loading and unloading trucks. I learned how load and unload trucks, how to pack shipments to be shipped and how to work well with others. Most of my co-workers were older so I used that as a learning experience."
good,"I was originally hired by Reynolds Metals Co. as a Cost Accountant Trainee in 1978. In 2000, Reynolds Aluminum and Alcoa merged. In 2007 Alcoa and Sapa formed a joint venture, Alcoa later left the JV. In 2013 Sapa and Hydro Aluminum merged to form a new company Sapa A S. Sapa Precision Tubing is a business unit within Sapa A S."
good,My duties included maintaining the Quality System. Writing and updating Document and Data Control. I performed Internal Audits to the ISO Standard.
good,You work like a robot. Due to Alcoa's High Standards a lot of tasks took long preparations making every task three times longer to execute and always running into overtime. I did not mind. It's a very secure work place.
good,"while it was a good place to work in terms of benefits and wages, it was not always open to new ideas. the culture of hourly vs salary was difficult and there was always a chance of layoffs. so it was kind of a tight rope when working there."
good,"Une hiérarchie difficile, un travail peu valorisant."
good,I worked hard.  I had a lot to do.  There were times I could not get things done because programs didn't work right or someone else didn't do their job.  It was frustrating.  I spent a lot of time there for those reasons.  There was excellent health care but the pay wasn't what is should have been for the work that I was doing.
good,"the working environment is good, but the company should be right place to work for most of workers. for my personal need, place did not work well. thanks."
good,Alcoa split into Arconic during my tenure there and little changed from the everyday worker level. The facility is operating 24/7/365 so certain roles require a rotation of coverage around the clock. The pay was competitive the work load was very high. Everyone competent is overworked.
good,"Not a bad place to work, but as an outsourced employee sometimes felt like there was a distinct difference between those who worked for the company and employees like myself as far as overall treatment."
good,"Empresa que presa a saúde segutanca e meio ambiente, mim senti muito bem em fazer parte da mesma, pena que tivemos s deixar a mesma e indicaria para qualquer​pessoa."
good,Alcoa allowed me to have a good income and benefits for my family. However the price I paid for being employed with Alcoa was very costly. Exposed to chemicals and materials that caused me to develop asbestosis. Today my ex-wife have the same disease.
good,alcoa was a strong widely known steel company and wasn't going any where.if u like extreme tempature conditions and steady good paying for alcoves for u.
good,I started  as a single trade instrument tech. When the electrical and instrument trades combined the company gave the opportunity to train  in a apprenticeship in the electrical trade. This opened an opportunity to be trained and train electricians in instrumentation.
good,"Very fast paced. Only full time employees receive any kind of benefits. Everyone pitches in to help each other out. The hardest part was the dish room, it could get pretty messy. The kids were fun."
good,"Good manfacturing systems in place"
good,Provided a safe place to work and generate ideas to improve the process.  Developed personnel who wanted to move up into leadership roles.  Cultivated a teaming environment and encouraged participation in problem solving.
good,very old and run down refinery. Safety standards are not up to scratch. Im looking for a cleaner environment to work in so i can go home safe to my family every day
good,Poured molds for the aerospace industry using recipes and mold sheets to meet customers requests using a vacuum furnace. Performed periodic maintenance on the furnances.
good,"A Alcoa cria várias oportunidades de aprendizado."
good,"Trabalho puxado e alto nível de aprendizagem, cadeia de funcionários separada por níveis ""grade"", cultura empresarial forte e conservadora em seus valores."
good,"Stressful work days at times other times it can be very laid back depends on how busy your day is."
good,"I have learned a lot while in this job but, am in a dead end with no further advancement. I am unsure of the stability of this job."
good,"Independent learning"
good,"Well motivated organisation, but impacted by a global reorganisation. "
good,A typical day was come in and make sure all machines were covered and start production lines then solve or fix any issues that might occure through out the day.learned the skills to problem solve and maintain the robots and machines.management very easy to work for and co-workers very easy to work with.the hardest part of the job was working seven days a week and trying to balance work and family.the most enjoyable part for me was meeting or exceeding production.
good,"A typical day at the office is to sit in a cubicle quietly and enter information into a computer.  The people I work with are very nice.  I have had multiple managers, and I liked working for most of them.  I have learned a lot working at Alcoa.  The knowledge is endless there.  The hardest part of my job is that you are expected to not make any mistakes at all, and if you do, you are required to come up with a plan to improve yourself.  The stress level can be very high."
good,Was a good place to work from the 1980s to the1990s. Bonuses were great. Employeelife was good.
good,I have no complaints on Alcoa aside from the fact they do not like to hire on their contract employees and will keep contractors on for many years but never flip them to perm.
good,"It was a new portion of the business (medical packaging).  Senior management did not have much education in this field.  Coming from the medical industry, I was very educated on this subject, but was not taken seriously.  A year later, the customers moved on and the plant had to close down.  I was only there a year.  Not much to say for the job"
good,"Internship at alcoa was great and a great place to learn"
good,Long hours. Unreasonable expectationw. If your just out to make money without family than this is job for you. I hauled metal to mill and maintained steady work pace
good,"Always busy"
good,"Só fiz um temporário."
good,"With metal prices plummeting, my future with Century (Alcoa) is very uncertain. Other than that I enjoyed the plant and people I worked for and with."
good,"we had a wide selection of people there, race and religions, which always led to little conflicts, often found myself as the conflict resolver, which I found to be interesting. a good job rotation system saw in place to prevent over confidence and boredom. Overall a fairly safety conscious and interesting place to work."
good,"Tres forte améliorations des indicateurs industriels économiques et sociaux "
good,"For someone starting out very nice place to be employed. If you have a family, the hours demanded of you will cause the loss of family touch and events. This is all explained to you in the interviews and hiring process. I believe a lot of marriage splits are due to this with either one or the other not explaining it fully to their spouse. If you want to make money and are single I believe this is the best place to work in Lafayette."
good,I worked in a fast pace environment selecting orders at a productive rate in a very cold environment. Working there taught you to work as a team to get the job done in a reasonable time. Working in temperatures below zero for 12 to 16 hours a day trying to pull production was tough. I liked working in that competitive environment because it taught you how to do what you had to do to be a top selector.
good,Grew up in the job. Worked as an hourly employee in many areas and then was promoted to supervision.
good,Good company with job security unfoftunately NAFTA played a roll in the outsourcing.Would love to be a part of the company if they ever came back and rebuild it to the competetive status it had among the other fabricas. Great benefits and opportunity for advancement to succed. Thank you !
good,"Good place to gain experience in the industry. Reasonable hours. Projects were not that exciting, mostly tasks that other engineers did not want to complete."
good,"I was a parts cleaner for the day."
good,"If you are desperate for money a PCO job at Alcoa will earn you all you need, but you will have to work your butt off for it. Its the hottest I've ever been and the hardest I've ever worked. I did get plenty of days off though. In the summer you WILL suffer from heat exhaustion and heat stress. You WILL dehydrate. You Will get burned sometimes. It is extremely dirty and sometimes it is hard to breath because of the mask you have to wear. After a year you can transfer to another job, which will be a lot easier at the cost of a few dollars per hour pay. Most co workers are very helpful at first but get impatient with you if you don't catch on. This is understandable though because since you work on a crew, the slower you are the longer everyone must suffer."
good,Worked with some wonderful people who cared for each other and wanted to help make each task easier. There were also individuals that wanted to slack-off a lot. In all it was a good place to work. The Supervisors were willing to listen to better ways or get newer equipment to do the job.
good,"Good place to work. Good benefits. More pros than cons. Enoyable co-workers, good hours, good lunch breaks. Really no hard parts about this job, it is well solid all around."
good,"Extensive background in HR generalist affairs, including experience in employee recruitment, staff development, conflict resolution, benefits and compensation and HR records management. Assist the HR link between various departments, developing teambuilding programs, job descriptions and management reports. Accomplished in personnel development, retention approaches, legal compliance issues, and managerial support."
good,Hard to do your job when Top management out out for them selves! The people in the middle are consider explainable.
good,"While there was lots to work on, the environment was very friendly.  As an intern I was treated great by many higher ups.  They gave me lots of task that  helped me feel more than just an intern."
good,Enjoyed my job at Alcoa was a very fast paced and was challenging.  Worked mostly with engineers and designers.  Took care of numerous task at Alcoa.  Learned a lot about the construction work force at Alcoa.
good,I was employed with Alcoa for a short period of time. I was a temp to hire and hoped to get hired but they ended up hiring someone in house instead. The pay is great!
good,A typical day at work is meetings and goals for the day and accomplish them effectively. Create a team to strive the goals of the company.
good,Plant 2 that I work at is a nice facility. If you like overtime ? This place you will like. 6 days a week.Up to 5 weeks vacation a year.  Co workers are great and easy to get along with. Good clean place to work.
good,worked in a clean room in charge of cnc machine making sure all product would come out clear of any damage.
good,You did get the chance for advancement.  the only problem was they made their friends supervisor the wrong people for the job.  Our company would never had relocated to Mexico if they cared about the quality of work we manufactured by the time they did it was to little to late
good,Protocole en santé sécurité tous les trois mois et rigueur au travail avec supervision accru de la qualité et du respect de l`équipe.
good,"paid bil paid bill paid bill paid bill. Pail the bills, it did pay the bills when u wanted it to pay the bills and ohhh yeea  it paid the billiososos  asd"
good,"The company uses Global Voices to determine how employees feel about their jobs, Trouble is they have data on what needs to be done to make the company and management relavant."
good,Procuro cada vez mais crescimento profissional a fim de ampliar meus conhecimentos e obter maior experiência.
good,"Alcoa is a nice place, don't get me wrong, but the department I work for is just a circus coming straight from the overall manager in which i can run a better job than her."
good,Worked well with customer management and sales team to grow sales to builders and remodeling trade groups.
good,"Working in the smelter is extremely rough heat is an understatement, the company itself do not care about employees your just a number forced to work 16hr day weekly"
good,"This was a fantastic place to learn every aspect of engineering. The plant is old and has countless opportunities for improvement. "
good,The operators ran the machines and preformed quality checks as well. I learned the basics of Industrial work and enjoyed the fast-paced environment. Management was average but I really liked the people I directly worked with. The hardest part of the job was the demanding hours (mostly the weekend hours). The most enjoyable part were the workers.
good,"It was good job , supervisor  and  the management were soon good"
good,Great Environment all around learned Many good hands on maintenance technique. The best part about the day is coming in cause you always leave the way you came
good,"I manage project, contractors, internal maintenance and processes. I develop, implement, maintain and troubleshoot control and equipment issues.  I interpret and apply production, maintenance and customer requirements into existing equipment or new installations."
good,"get a past down from other crew before us,training is low not enough trainers management is not that committed to listen to the works"
good,"I learned many skills at Alcoa, from basic computer skills to comprehensive planning, analytical tasks.  I worked in a department with many different and strong personalities."
good,"You WILL live here. If you've under 5 years your first a ""pick[ing] your poison""--overtime; and, there's lots of it. "
good,This is the ideal place to be if you want to be laid-off every other year.
good,I hired in as a furnace operator.The entire new and old employees went to classes for nearly three weeks to learn what to expect.Restartcome closer and got given casting operator position and studied on that position.The night I decided to leave we had  three explosions in one cast or drop. The dangers of of my position was not worth chance of getting hurt or possibly worse.
good,At alcoa the number of hours required to earn a livable wage were excessive. I spent so much time at work my family never saw me. It was unacceptable.
good,I worked four days on then four days off. I took in all products receive them and put the items in the computer then took the product to right department.
good,Ótima empresa em questão de benefícios e ambiente de trabalho.
good,"Travail de journée"
good,The overall culture is the typical we / they attitude. it is a union company and you have to learn quickly the ins and outs of that culture. 
good,I really liked working for alcoa. I wasn't fond of the management and the way some situations were handled. I wasn't in the position to be forced onto second shift at that time so i had to leave.
good,"Many dynamics at work, but Alcoa enabled me to keep a roof over my families heads and a few toys to play with as well.  I worked hard for my position and providing for my family."
good,"alcoa was an excellent job to support my family and I. It payed well, and I liked being able to afford to do my hobbies and keep up on bills. The people I enjoyed very much, the benefits were excellent, and i received extensive training in safety, equipment and lots of different equipment. I have had six different jobs at alcoa, each were unique. I appreciate everything that alcoa blessed me with. Management could have been much better, I believe that politics severely affected morale, production, and quality of materials through poor supervision. I believe upper management is to blame for those issues. My co-workers for the most part were all very hard working people, who did what they could to make an unpleasant job enjoyable. The extreme heat could break an individual, but could make a team much stronger. My most enjoyable part of the job was most definitely the people."
good,"O ambiente em que trabalhava era extremamente agressivo e perigoso, exigia muita atenção e cuidados de todas as pessoas envolvidas. O convívio com os colegas era muito bom. A gerencia trabalhava diretamente com os operadores e encarregados o que possibilitava o dialogo entre as partes. "
good,"últimos tempos sem estabilidade de emprego cortes de promoção "
good,"long days"
good,"recibir turno. revisar plan de orden de trabajo, revisar personal en sus puestos"
good,"Generally work was a breeze considering you had a decent relief and weren't on a A line(Where they sent the trainees after they passed the training portion),if you could handle not really being able to spend the money you earned their or dont mind being away from home for a long time its a great place that has a nice pay especially for someone who didnt have a high school diploma for starting their. Overall a really great place minus a few set backs whether it was really hot working next to molten metal in about 2-3 layers of clothing and in a respirator. To general neglect i was told we needed to change respirator cartridge's every 4 days and had mine for about 4 weeks."
good,Solo falta organizacion pero es buena empresa para estar estable
good,"Empresa sólida e agradável de se trabalhar, boa politica de salário e benefícios. Empresa valoriza a estabilidade mas as oportunidades de carreira não são equilibradas. A ambiente de trabalho é agradável porém a cultura é protecionista com os mais antigos de empresa. A empresa precisa evoluir na cultura e processos de trabalhos mais modernos."
good,Not a bad place to work but has limited ability to move up. A down fall is that it is very market driven. This is an older plant that has a lot to work on.
good,Good salary but hard to have an outside life. Hours were very up and down.  Lots of overtime if one wants it. I was at that time looking to continue forward in my personal life of a wife and family and it was hard for me to work on  with out a woman that has the same hours.
good,"This was a young man’s job with very physical 12 hour shifts.  It was satisfying work because at the end of the day I felt I had really accomplished something.  I enjoyed working with my colleagues as teamwork and communication was crucial to getting the job done, an environment in which I thrive in."
good,I worked the pot rooms and that job is extremely physically demanding until you can develop the proper techniques combined with supervisors that had no clue how to handle the workload. but there were a couple that were decent and fair
good,benefits are great.  I enjoyed working the third shift.  Need to do better on doing more for the workers and calming down on the OT.  The work and family life was not a good balance
good,"worked straight nights, 12-18 hour shifts. i started as a caster, running pressure molds, quickly learned to run and maintain moulds. I was able to also get the opportunity receive forklift licence. I also worked in the melting department were we melted down aluminum, zinc and magnesium in electrical furnaces."
good,"Stress working environment, it was hard to make change, due to managers not wanting to hold people accountable. There was a lot of good ole boy politics as well. That along with the entitlement factory that many people had, it was hard to understand how we were so profitable."
good,"The work hours are long, but the people you work with are great. They were very helpful, when it came to training me to do the job right."
good,"Good company good management love my co workers worked there as a temp, only problem temps don't receive uniforms considering the nature of the work."
good,"Not a terrible place to work. Every job has it's drawbacks. Pay and benefits are good considering some of the skills/credentials needed for the work. Salaried employees, especially management have a high turnover rate. Hourly people who are junior (less than 8 years) have very little job security. Nepotism and favoritism ran rampant for a while, but it has improved. If you expect high tech, speedy manufacturing, this place will disappoint you. I think the place would be vastly improved, if they cleaned out all levels of leadership, and started new."
good,"High paced work, making sure production does not stop, but putting productive countermeasure in place if it happens. Place operators in areas to maximize efficiency & utilization. Placing employees so they can be successful & company is also, in turn keeping customers satisfied. Above all, place SAFETY FIRST. The workers who do the work have the knowledge to come up with ideas for change to insure success & safety, so listen to them. Motivating people who really don't like their job. you can't make people care! Seeing through a successful day & helping your people feel valuable is really a rewarding, happy feeling."
good,"In a typical day I would first make my rounds to check in with previous shift employee's to see how the day was ending for them and also to check in on each production center as well."
good,I started as a QA Tech with four Quality Engineers on staff. After about three months we had only one QE left in the department. By the sixth month I was responsable for three customer accounts and in charge of the workload of at least two QE with no assistance from Quality Manager and little help from two other Senior QA Tech's. Within a year in a half an opportunity was posted for the Non- Destructive Testing department and I was granted what seemed to be apromotion. After  about five months in new position a major change in management decided to downsize the NDT department and thus  eliminating my position.
good,"Most Alcoa workers, work 12 hour rotating shifts. Daily meetings to inform employees of shifts expected tasks, duties, and safety updates. Alcoa is a place where learning could be a never ending task. Employees have the chance to move around the plant laterally and up to meet and learn new people and skills. Most co-workers are very out going, energetic, fast paced, hard working, witty people. My hardest part of my employment was Rotating shifts, because your body doesn't ever get used to sleeping during the day to sleeping at night in the same week. The best part of all my jobs was being a Pit Operator. The job is extremely dangerous, hot, and tiring, but it was just a comfortable work place that I enjoyed. Most management previously worked on the floor doing the same jobs, so they were understanding, and easy going.  Possibilities can be endless once you are an ALCOA employee."
good,"Alcoa is a worldwide company that I was proud to work for.  I met so many people and learned so much in the time I worked for them.  There were long days, but I worked the time in order to get the job done."
good,Wakeup at 2am. Go to various job sites and do fluid changes on heavy equipment. Sent fluids in to be tested.

good,"Excelente empresa para trabalhar, investe muito nos funcionários, com treinamentos e cursos."
good,"Very busy, completing multiple tasks, time management, organization and dependability is key along with great communication.  Management is predictable, and the workforce in Union oriented. The hardest part is learning and knowing  contract guidelines  you must follow."
good,"It was my favorite job I've ever worked for the first 50 weeks and 6 days. I was let go 51 weeks to the day along with every temp on site with absolutely no warning. Budget came in, temps were out. A year later, they fired the rest of the group, some of who had 15-20 years of experience. A year after that, there were job ads up for our old jobs. I had been hoping to get hired full time and spend my career there, but it didn't work out."
good,When I worked for Alcoa it was the best job I had up to that point with knowlegeable upper management and great resources for employees. The job itself proved to be too dangerous to stay with.
good,"Il était possible d'avoir de l'initiative et de s'accomplir dans son métier, les défis étaient fréquents."
good,I like this job everything is good every my supervisor is going I like the people and I missing this company I moved out yesterday why I left the job is good

good,"I had a good boss and enjoyed the job. It was a very team oriented atmosphere with a good number of intelligent personnel. But when Aloca bought out the company, many of us were let go unexpectedly."

good,SAP House that is well ingrained in the use of the tool.  Strong manufacturing and engineering expertise.  Growth mode.  Long tenured employees in many disciplines.  Strong work ethic and engagement for company mission.
good,Great Company to work for but middle management at the time was very  unprofessional and didn't care at all about the employees.
good,"Buen trabajo, me ayudo a completar mis metas personales durante mi estancia en el."
good,Management doesn't communicate effectively and doesn't approve vacation at all. Its not a quality control minded environment for manager present. Management uses breaks or lunch to communicate about tasks needed
good,During my tenure at this company I was introduced to many new challenges that my skill set could tackle.  Being a troubleshooter allowed me the freedom to resolve many tasks and prove myself a valuable asset.
good,Good money and good benefits. I got laid off after working there for eight and a half years. I never thought that they would close down their smelter and put so many people out of a job.
good,"Alcoa was a good place to work. While to operators are under paid compared to the plants in the local region, they do however have good benifits and a good 401k plan"
good,Alcoa is a very competitive business.  People today need to work well with their co-workers and management for your business unit to succeed.  Good place to work.
good,"In order to perform my job effectively, I was encourage to seek out training classes in the industry.  My manager also encouraged me to be creative to find solutions to manufacturing problems that resulted in higher sales of ""difficult to manufacture"" products."

good,I like the job and the people I work with. It is challenging and rewarding. The hours are acceptable and the work load is manageable. My supervisor accommodates my schedule.
good,Former Benchmark Company facing strong headwinds. Creates uncertainty and instability. Large corporation with multiple BU;'s and locations. Some BU's/locations stronger than others.
good,"Good company to have worked for, unfortunately became a displaced worker. Obtained many more skills that i can utilize in searching of future employment."
good,"Working long hour the pay is very good, great co workers."
good,Company relocating to Mexico for cheaper cost of production; that has created an environment which is not very conducive to employee wellbeing and morale.
good,"I have advanced quickly at Alcoa, and have had many opportunities to increase my skill-set.   I'm a certified DDI instructor, and have had numerous successful initiatives that have resulted in reduced scrap, increased productivity, and increased morale.    Ready for a change, and an opportunity to improve my career standing."

good,I enjoyed working for Alcoa for the time that I was there. I was always busy and there was always someone that was eager to help if needed. It was also a pretty flexible place to work as far as the work/life balance scenario. They took your family into consideration. I really liked working for them.
good,"great place to work."
good,the workplace was nice for the most part but the management didn't care for their employees. they would take advantage of them and throw out safety when it came to production loss
good,"Great Organization for self starting needing little to no guidance or task input.Fun place to work with supporting engineers, have to find the right clicks to really develop into position. Knowledge sharing is ""Sparse""."
good,"I have held operational and procurement functions of scheduling and working on management LEAN projects and the establishment of a master production plan."
good,This is a good company to work for. The aerospace industry is very promising which is the segment I am currently working in for this organization.
good,Clean working atmosphere with a wide variety of skills needed to perform job duties. A little too much about politics and emphasis on personal appearances.
good,I worked at ALCOA Aluminium Plant in Frederick Maryland. I really enjoyed the environment there and the employees and management were very friendly. The pay was very suitable as well.
good,Loading and uploading trucks in shipping.  I got certified on various forklifts.  Always got along with management.  The hardest part was shift work.  The best part was coworkers.
good,"le travail est difficile  car il y fait chaud, on est debout en permanence et que le lieu est sale (surtout au vu de mon ancien travail en salle blanche) mais c'est un travail  et de part ses horaires est bien rémunéré . L'encadrement est agréable moins certains collaborateurs."

good,"Regolare di una grande industria"
good,"Alcoa CSI is a very clean, safe place to work, focusing on high output using minimal resources; with a high focus on leaning out unnecessary materials and time. I learned a great deal about industrial efficiency while there. I ran my own line with several processes, which taught me to troubleshoot the entire system while being able to focus on each process individually, with an awareness of their impact on the previous  next process and line itself. At Alcoa, safety and education were top priority, and while there I participated in the safety team, and also presiding over it for a time. While at Alcoa I was invited into and completed an IT internship, and one in HR. Alcoa taught me valuable skills in safety, organization, and efficiency in manufacturing, along with the importance of good teamwork and communication."
good,"I have worked there 3 different times over the years, so I would have to say I enjoyed working there.  It was a very challenging job and there was something different every day.  The people I worked with all enjoyed working there, so that made it easy to work there.  Everyone was happy to be there because we were well paid, had great benefits, and as much overtime as you wanted.  I never dreaded going to work! Over the years the company evolved with the new technologies that developed, so we were always learning new things.  We made jet engine parts for the government, so this was also part of the downside of the job...as administrations changed, so did the requirements of our work load.  This meant reduction in work force requirements sometimes."

good,This was a good company to work for.  The people were all great to work with
good,I have learned a lot about the window industry but more importantly gained a lot of experience working in a supervisory role.

good,"Very demanding, Union enviroment, exposed to the enviroment all the time either hot or cold. Learned that there is a better job that might pay less money. Management was very easy to work with and for they focused on training and safety which was good. Hardest part of the job was the work schedule which was the 16 hour shifts just distroyed your body and life in spite of the good money. Most enjoyable part was the good money."
good,"Some emphasis on lean manufacturing but still a long way to go. Like most manufacturing facilities, Alcoa's facilities have the usual struggles with delivery and productivity."
good,"Joint venture with Fujikura in northern Mexico. Several plants. Some incentives. Regional headquarters in San Antonio, TX. I should have asked for financial support to comply with company's requirement: Master's in Environmental Engineering."

good,"Empresa multinacional, que tem seu seguimento de aluminio em geral. Boa de se trabalhar."
good,"Working on avg of 60 hours a week paid holidays. Can get a week off once a month if staffing is right. Paid sick time, vacation time earned base off of time served. 401k company matches 6%."
good,"Overall it was a decent place to work - it was a union environment that provided job security, but also hindered individuals from being able to excel.  Management regularly failed to recognize the hard working individuals who devoted themselves to bettering the facility, in turn to promote individuals based on a 30 minute oral interview - when it came to promotions, your performance didn't matter, it's all about how well you can answer their interview questions."
good,I worked for Alcoa Inc for almost 20 years and it was an awesome place to work until it became Arconic. The Alcoa Inc separation into Alcoa Corp and Arconic destroyed the company.
good,"Alcoa is a all around good place to work. As long as you would get your work done, management would be relaxed.  But if you had a weak work ethic, chances are they wouldn't put up with that."
good,"The segregation of activities and responsibilities was great. Great corporation culture"
good,People are really proud to work at Alcoa and that was clear when I worked there before the company split (pre-2016). The best part was the people.  I'm not sure what it's like there now.
good,"great experience and training on modern technology for electricians from entry-level to expert."
good,Too much favoritism. And they don't give second chances. There is no understanding of personal life issues and they don't really care for real. Only worried about revenue.

good,A falta de feedback em alguns assuntos deixa a desejar. No entanto a experiencia foi boa.

good,A fast paced production environment  with continuous production. I've learned to keep my quality team under pressure and follow correct quality standards.

good,"Uma das empresas com o melhor sistema. Todas as informações são facilmente levantadas, entretanto, o sistema engessado de gestão atrapalha um pouco no desenvolvimento do funcionário."
good,A foundry that is cleaner than most with very specialized processes. Interesting work where the pace is comfortable and stress is minimal. If not for the occasional layoff's i'd still be there.

good,Good starting point for operator work. Decent pay with great benefits but very physical work and dangerous work environment.

good,"Alcoa is a company that if you want to apply yourself and be dependable with a great attitude you will be successful with a great future."
good,"This is a 24/7 operation that requires employees to adapt from 8 to 12 hour workday schedules.  The work can be very rewarding and can be blended into a good work/life balance.  This is a primary metal (aluminum) manufacturing facility, so the work environment is not necessarily household clean.  Work clothes and onsite showers/changing rooms are provided."
good,"Place to make money and a few friends. Long hours  forced overtime. "
good,"It took me some time to adjust, but once being the new person on the block wore off it was a good place to work. My position allowed me to work on my own and allowed me to do my job without management unless they were needed. Facility was neat and clean, people were good to work with. Safety was always first"
good,"After a year of working through Kelly Services, I was hired on full time in the Coil Department. After a couple of years there, I transferred to the Ingot Department. Interesting work. Dirty atmosphere."
good,"Very good company to work for and it has many loyal employees who have spent decades with the company, Because my role was temporary,  I did not experience completely the employee experience but observed the passion and loyalty of the employees.  It is a company that keeps trying to improve as seen in its numerous employee initiatives."
good,"Alcoa was a good place to work but the environment is fairly stressful"
good,"it was a good place to work. Some of the managers were completely inadequate. They did provide vacation, and even fun days where employees could bond and take a day off work"
good,"Long hours are the only downside. 56/week, 10/day. Hard to move up the latter in such a large company where so many people have worked for many years. I worked in a tooling facility which was climate controlled, very clean and organized, quiet, and moderate paced. The hardest part here is the hours. The best part of working here was the experience of being able to use as many machines as you feel comfortable with and being able to work in teams to accomplish goals."
good,"out of most of my jobs, Arconic is probably my 4th favorite job. My job included a lot of time spent at a computer. Unfortunately, most of the people i was surrounded by were relatively rude and crude. However, other parts of the plant have a really nice atmosphere."
good,Bad schedule for families. Poor supervision. Good benefits thanks to the union. Many employees are over dramatic. They aren't as big on safety as they should be.
good,"Alcoa is a good company to work for they are very hands off allowing you to do your job with very little interference, pretty good pay for employees which makes it easier to find quality staff."

good,"I started out as a Temp-to-hire Packet/Inspector when I was hired for this job. After I was hired full time I was promoted as a Extrusion Operator, to actually make the vinyl products. I was blessed to work a lot of hours to provide a good living for my family."
good,Great pay and benefits show up for work don't do drugs and you will never get fired. Management is terrible but starting to realize that is everywhere

good,A good place to work. Plenty of opportunity for overtime. Good working environment. The hardest part of the job is getting a pump that has failed under control and doing a pump swap.
good,The management team does a great job of recognizing and rewarding top talent! Highly ethical environment that fosters respect for fellow Alcoans!
good,"Manage workload, manage manpower, and make sure we have coverage for open slots including overtime. Perform daily audits on job performance. Fill out shift report at the end of every day and send out to managers. Complete manpower needs for the on coming shift and prepare needs for the next day. Summer time is very challenging for manpower coverage. I have learned to make several decisions without any notice filling manpower slots or come up with different plans to complete production. I have been through countless safety classes, safety kaizen's, and PSSC meeting to help improve safe job procedures. All of these i enjoy very much!"

good,"working at Alcoa gave me to skills to communicate with different people from different parts of the world learning to speak different "
good,"I enjoyed working for the steel workers union at the Alcoa facility. It was a good paying job with enjoyable coworkers. It was a team oriented when it came to job tasks and must be capable of operating many job positions in the facility. I learned task organizations and safety to a high level of awareness. I was able to complete training of all job positions within a year, allowing me to be fully optimized as an employee. I wanted to relocate is the only reason for leaving the job. One of the better work environments available in the town of Danville, IL. I wanted to seek better opportunities for myself and raise expectations of future advancements."

good,"Everyday is a very busy day performing production planning and customer service works to meet daily and monthly goals of the department. I have learned to how to better deal with managers, supervisors, machine lead man and workers to get your work done quickly and on time for the customers due dates.

At the end of the day when you have performed and done all your daily activities at work, I feel so relieved and have enjoyed the day work."
good,"Great learning environment, My co-workers, hardest part of job is based on economy. The people and the culture at Alcoa is more like a family and I was sad to be layed off."

good,"Bons gestores, ótimos companheiros de trabalho, trocamos bastante ""figurinhas"" (experiências), as vezes faltava recursos para uma boa manutenção devido à dificuldade que a empresa vinha passando era a maior dificuldade e o que mais me agradava na empresa era ver alguns companheiros que ali atuavam comigo mesmo com 20 ou 30 anos de usina sentirem ""tesão"" por um boa produção com se tivessem começado ontem. É também o meu sentimento amor por trabalhar em usina, tesão pela profissão."

good,I would be expected to do a lot and I did so. I moved parts and materials to different departments and also inspected them. My overall experience there was pretty good.
good,It was a great job while I had it. I had never worked in a place like that before so I enjoyed learning something new. I was sorry to see it close. It helped me provide for my family.
good,"I do not like many things of Intalco however you can not argue with success! This is by far the oldest technology in the industry and one of the oldest smelter yet they continue to operate, at the same time many newer and modern smelter owned by the same corporation closed as well as other smelter's in the US & across the world. If you are one of the Cherished people you are treated like God's."

good,buena empresa en general con muy buenos valores y muy buenas oportunidades de crecimiento
good,"Always challenging but great. each day I learned  something new internally or with customers.  Management was great.  Work place was enjoyable and pleasant.  Hardest part was when we need to collect a customer, but I do enjoy what I do."
good,"Great place to start your career, good benefits, good company, provides a quality wage for an honest days work, requires a lot of personal commitment to be successful"
good,Alcoa is a large corporation with locations all over the world.  There are a lot of opportunities for people with various degrees.  The company has a detailed management hierarchy which provides opportunities for individuals that wish to gain management experiences.
good,"Good company to work for, laid back, work a lot of hours and days. Its a union shop and the local union do a lot to protect the membership, the paid is fair..."
good,Great benefits a good workplace . The workplace culture is very bad. The right hand never knew what the left hand was doing. The company lied to us every chance they got. The company made us to work 12 hour days on a rotating work time frame.  The shifts were to long.
good,"Una gran empresa con un gran personal a cargo, donde se aprendí varios aspectos de mi carrera laboral y se me dio la oportunidad de crecimiento desde practicas profesionales en Importaciones y Exportaciones, un puesto como contratista en una vacante de Logística Internacional, y despues trabajo de planta como Manager Customer Service."
good,Good company to work for with really good benefits and fair compensation. Management is fair and very flexible with work hours and personal needs.
good,This is a great job if you like being inside all the time. It got pretty boring for me eventually. The people were great and friendly but I was on second shift so I didn't see them all that often.
good,"very satisfied with all aspects of my job, this is how I felt before being laid off due to plant closing. There isn't anything more to say."
good,The workload was well balanced and mostly everybody was a pleasure to work with. Always a couple bad apples in the bunch. Tour immediate supervisors always tried to help you out. HR department and Medical always tried to screw you over. That's the only bad part of Alcoa.
good,Lots of good opportunity and people. The business has a bright future with light weight transportation and new high value engineered products. Migration
good,". Doors opened management;"
good,"Great job work/life balance. People are friendly, willing to share knowledge.  It allows you to be creative and run with projects on your own. Hard work pays off."
good,"Reviewing what has occurred on the shift before me and resolving any problems that might arise on my own shift because of this. Setting the team their tasks for the shift. Resolving any problems that might arise with the team or with machinery. Making sure that my team are happy and deal with any issues that they might have. I work closely with the management dealing with everyday issues such as health and safety, quality control and production, as well as personnel issues. Working along side my team is one of the most enjoyable parts of my job. The hardest part of my job is being the only technical support on the shift, leaving me to deal with a lot of varied issues across the shift. Within this role I have learned tonot take to much on myself and to delegate to others."
good,It was in interesting place to work.  I enjoyed the experiences at different postions.  They seem to have care for the employee.
good,Alcoa Howmet has been a great place to work. I've learned some new skills while at Howmet. Due to recent management changes I was laid off as the company decided to downsize on a pretty large scale. My immediate supervisors were great to work with and made me feel appreciated immeditately. My co-workers were very helpful in getting me acquainted with the new shop and teaching me about the different types of dies I was now working with. I learned how to operate a CNC as well as a wire EDM.
good,"challenging and rewarding career"
good,"At present the business is going through a number of restructures due to being bought out by a larger concern so morale right now isn't great but generally it's been a happy time for me. I've worked with and for some great people and have learnt a lot."
good,"Worked with great people who made the job seem easy and the time fly by "
good,A great place to learn how to operate out in the field and solve real-time process issues. The frequency of problems resurfacing time and time again can be frustrating. Shifting priorities are difficult to manage which is exacerbated by a lack of clear communication and documentation.
good,"I worked for Alcoa as a contractor so I did not enjoy the opportunities that the permanent employees did but, I enjoyed the culture, my coworkers, and any of the clients I had the pleasure of working with."

good,"I would use various methods to test the aluminum to see if it would meet various customer specifications."
good,"Community involvement is great."
good,"extruded aluminum: mostly construction products and window framing. was my first real factory job out of high school I really enjoyed it and the people were my family we all worked really well together. I learned alot how to drive fork lift, run press, put together dies tear them apart, run industrial automatic saws and manual saws learned various computer programs, put production reports in computer and 3 years of running my own crew of about 21 people and was in charge of night shift production i'm a people person I like to have fun and joke around and they were some of the funnest people ive ever known"
good,Great company.  Too bad the procurement group had to relocate to PA.
good,I rotated to many different jobs.Never knew what I was going to be doing.
good,"Empresa estável no mercado de trabalho que acredita muito em seus valores."
good,"Great pay and benefits I was able to walk in as a production worker."
good,"É grande o desafio proposto para a região (extremo oeste do Para), Devido a sua localizaçao geografica e acessos, diante de um governo omisso quanto aos aspectos sociais, tem-se uma grande dificuldade em vivencia na regiao."
good,"Long hours, lots of training, and learning. The work force is season and very traditional, so implementing change can be a little creative."
good,Howmet has to potential to be a good place to work. There are many good hard working people there. I enjoyed most of my time there.
good,"Alcoa is a great company to work for. My old boss was a hard and dedicated individual. When he was let go they rushed into hiring a new guy who had never managed a company. He shows up late, yells at his workers, & does nothing to help things run smoother here. The other admin and I are just exhausted from picking up all the slack and feel we would rather work for someone who appreciates all we do."
good,"Monitoring daily processes and daily/weekly/monthly backups on different systems from, HP, Novell, IBM's iSeries, Unix systems. Management was very good about keeping us informed with new training opportunities and safty education. The people I worked with were very good on passing along information from one shift to the next. The hardest part of the job was not being able to get a hold of DBA, or network admin for issues ocurring after hours. The best and enjoyable part of the job was that I was a stand-alone Operator, worked alone and enjoyed solving issues on my own."
good,"Working at Alcoa has been good for my family, overall. Management and communication could use a great deal of improvement. Pay and benefits are great."
good,"Worked as a contractor in their lab. Most of the employees are union. Union comes with plenty of benefits and issues, which salary and contractors have to deal with by proxy. Some organizational issues, but nothing as bad as some other factories."
good,"Alcoa is a good company to work for but my experience is that project management is not considered to be a core competence, and as such, does hinder those in PM from advancement."
good,"We work half a month and are paid well.  Our benefits are nonexistent due to our contractor status. I hope to be here for a very long time. Unfortunately,  politicians play a role in our longevity."
good,12 hour days sometimes. middle of the road salary. great bosses and people. Very diverse environment with mentor-ships and other programs available. Hard work is rewarded
good,"A company that allowed flexible working hours and had a great workplace environment.  People were smart, hard-working, and easy to get along with for the most part.  I was able to have great managers who helped me succeed and move up the ladder.  The hardest part was trying to find the work/life balance, but being able to work from home a day or two a week helped the balance."
good,Enquanto funcionário aprende muito nessa empresa fiz muitas amizades e fui muito bem tratado enquanto estive lá.
good,"money is good work hours are good, but they have regular layoffs. The company is fond of meetings. Daily shift meeting, weekly  department meeting, monthly general meeting. I attend one monthly meeting where we discussed, how to schedule special meetings."
good,In maintenance there are no typical days. Day starts at 5 am meeting vary day to day training is includes on a quarterly basis. Work with production to coordinate the completion of preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance (i.e.. breakdowns).  Supervise the crew working that day.
good,Alcoa let me provide for my family for many years. Hours are demanding but great if you like earning more money through overtime. They did there best with climate control using swamp coolers.
good,"Started at 7 am. After reviewing what was done yesterday, "
good,My work day at Alcoa was setting up CNC Mills and touching off tools. I also was in charge daily inspections and keeping my area clean. Other duties i had were working in the QC Department and machining on a mazak mill using conversational programming. I usually worked a 12 hour day 3 days on and 4 off. Six sigma training and five S was also in my daily routine.
good,"Good working place but the commodity environment does not make it the best industry to work for today.   If you are a materials engineer, it is a great place to get a start career"
good,"Typical day consists of striving to hitting production metrics, while working in a 24/7 atmosphere.    The equipment you are working with, is old by today standards, and labor intensive.   When walking out the gate after a days work, you feel like you have made a difference.  It is a hard core union environment, that can present challenges as there can be an us vs them atmosphere, vs a team concept working for a common goal.  The compensation is better than average, and the benefits are also better than average."
good,"We typically start with a safety meeting and then we review maintenance pass downs from the previous shift, followed by job assignments.Throughout the shift we help each other if someone gets backed up. our management group does their best to provide us with the tools we need for the job.we have a great group of skilled trades people who make the day at work."
good,allows opportuntity for advancement if you move every 2 years. benefits are great. solid 40 hour work week. no overtime required. paid higher than other plants.
good,"My time working at this company was a great learning experience.  My responsibilities centered around accounts payable using the purchase order system which was new to me.  They were trying to build an A/P & A/R team and this was being accomplished, but was bought out by the Japanese partner and  the office was dissolved."
good,"It's a great place to work with good culture, but I'm looking at other options right now."
good,"Alcoa has a strong set of programs that are generally well established at the locations.  However, management is sometimes not understanding of the time it will take to fully implement all of the complicated programs that are expected.  This is especially true when a site failed to implement the program for many years.  While the programs are there, the time and help to implement them isn't always there."
good,All was well. I just wanted to return to being an administrator and adult education. Also I wanted to persue my Doctorate degree dissertation topic on recidivism and educational achievement.
good,Meu maior aprendizado na empresa foi relacionado principalmente a gestão de pessoas. A empresa sempre teve por parte da direção estrategias bem definidas para alcançar suas metas a cultura esta ligada diretamente ao bem estar das pessoas dos clientes e da  comunidade. Apresenta um ambiente de trabalho que facilita a comunicação entre todos os níveis da empresa. A parte mais difícil viver com as incertezas do mercado que atua e a parte mais agradável é o ambiente de trabalho.
good,Our plant was shut down. Employees had pride working there. The company is missed. Maybe one day Alcoa will decide to re-open in Point Comfort. They have been part of that community for two generations....shame.
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar, vários beneficios e plano de carreira."
good,This was a division of Alcoa Inc.  I enjoyed my job and the people while working this job.  The management was excellent and treated employees with respect.
good,I enjoyed my years working for Alcoa.  I would still be with them today if the company had not split into two separate entities.  I was given opportunities to advance.  They were very generous in paying for both my bachelors and master degrees with a 2 year continue employment commitment after graduation.  Benefits are at the top of the scale and are designed to meet most individual and family needs that are affordable.
good,"Alcoa was a good place to work besides the supervisor and manager, but Alcoa has replaced the supervisor and manager.  The new supervisor and manager will hopefully turn the machine shop around."
good,"thoroughly enjoyed working in the Alcoa/Arconix culture for many years.  newly promoted individuals coming in to show what they can do often trampled those who enabled the excellent EHS performance and culture.  the newly purchased and integrated companies into the Alcoa culture often accepted and implemented the EHS processes better than the ""old"" core Alcoa businesses. Alcoa was a strong EHS practitioner."
good,"Une entreprise dynamique dans le secteur de l'aluminium. Pour ma part, j'ai participé à la migration windows NT3.51 vers windows NT 4. J'ai aussi géré Y2K et l'installation d'office et de la messagerie."
good,"Alcoa was a dynamic and exciting place to work. Its corporate culture was one of assistance and fostering growth. They are a large company, but operate like a family."
good,"60 hours of work mandatory overtime. open 365 days per year dirty working conditions that required mandatory showers at work, the people were great to work with."
good,"I enjoy working for Alcoa. The people are great to work for, but the hours aren't that great. Rotating shifts 4 days on, 4 days off is hard when starting a family."
good,"Apesar do pouco tempo na empresa, tenho ótimas recordações. Uma empresa que me abriu as portas e me tratou como colaboradora e não como resultados."
good,great people and always had fun. hours could get long and stressful but schedule was well worth it. managment sometimes seemed unprepared and scattered.
good,Alcoa is a company that produces an efficient amount of products and provides a welcoming atmosphere. Their workers are well compensated and have many benefits. I would highly recommend this company to others.
good,Alcoa offers great benefits and is in the Aerospace division creating Turbine Blades.  Operators are required to take a test to get hired in as the work is quite involved and skill sets are required.
good,"Emphasis on performance and safety."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy sano, buena gente. "
good,É uma empresa que proporciona desenvolvimento profissional.
good,"same as Alcoa.I continued habits and ways, it works because its what you needed in the work place.Attitude and great enviroment make wheels turn smoothly."
good,"3rd shift Ti analyst. Friendly staff, good benefits, wish the pay was higher but don't we all.. Great environment. if I wasn't on 3rds id be happier but then again, who wouldn't.. Nothing bad to say about the company."
good,"Need to stay focused and on top of problems as they arise. "
good,Great technical job. A lot to learn but well worth it. Always something to do. Some nights are slow and some nights are balls to the wall
good,"A typical work day is 12 hours where I was, you learn forklift, team work and pride. Your coworkers are there to work, safety is prominent on the minds of all along with getting the loads built out and shipped on time. The management will work along side of you if you need their help. The hardest part of the job is the cold of winter and the heat of the summer, you need to be in good shape to do this job, If you make it through the first few months you will be in good shape."
good,"Excellent people, Excellent job"
good,"daily and periodically mechanical inspection of industrial equipment, repair if necessary. respond to break downs throughout the shift. take on PMs or other projects when time permitted it."
good,"Worked directly with molten aliminium across the whole process of the Ingot Mill as a senior operator.  Every day was different due to production demands and skill sets.  I was the only female operator on a crew of approx 20 and my crew are like my family and we still catch up regularly.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with the extreme heat that radiated from the molten aluminium.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Alcoa and loved working in a team environment, loved shift work and enjoyed working closely with my crew and management to safely meet production targets."
good,"Loved working for Alcoa, I had several positions that pushed my abilities and expanded my knowledge  The compensation was fair and benefits were good."
good,"Uma  empresa ótima de se trabalhar, o funcionário tem oportunidades de crescimento pessoal e profissional."
good,"Alcoa, like any other factory job is hot and dirty, the management tends to lack in practical knowledge of the tools and machinery and the hours are long. Besides those negatives i found Alcoa a great place to work. The benefits cannot be beat as well as the pay checks. Most of the people i had the pleasure of working with were very helpful and helped me out a lot when i was starting out. There is a family atmosphere throughout the plant as far as the co workers go. Management is another story. But this job is a union job and they really help and protect you when you need it. They aren't perfect but they really did give me a sense of security. I was laid off unfortunately but i will be returning there if at all possible.."
good,"A empresa proporciona a participação em projetos complexos."
good,"Typical day at work would be 9.5 hours with a 30 minute lunch. 2 more breaks through out the day. I learned a lot of things about the aerospace industry, and the use of industry tools to measure efficiency and problem solve. Every department has their own manager, each with their own style of management, but all follow the same QAS system. My coworkers in the department are really nice and polite to everyone. The hardest part about my job is the long hours and overtime. They make you work at least 9.5 hours a day Monday through Friday, and then make you work 6-8 hours on Saturday. You can request to not work on Saturday if you really need to take it off, but management always looks at you like your are a terrible employee for not wanting to work every Saturday. What I do love most about my job is that our location likes to treat us well. This includes a few company outings a year along with monthly meetings with lunches included for our department. Overall its a good place to work."
good,"Great company, vision, value, and transparency"
good,"I am a TAS for the Alcoa Barberton Casthouse, TAS is a lead type position meaning I can fill in for the Supervisor as well as do all of the jobs in the plant including quality/quantative analysis."
good,Wonderful experience in a very challenging environment.  Alcoa maintains a highly driven and professonal employment setting.
good,"The job is excellant but the travel is too much. The co-workers are ok. The benefits is good, the hardest part is traveling."
good,"This job taught me a lot of what it means to work at a chemical plant. It was a highly regulated work environment. I gained new skills while in this position as I was creating entirely new material for the company and many ideas had to come from myself, not others. I was sad to have to leave due to no available advancement in the company."
good,"Mornings: resitration of incoming-outgoing mails, "
good,"O trabalho era basicamente antender o cliente interno,que era a extrusao(prensa)"
good,"Started with HC Recruitment placing,initially doing basic production line tasks,like deburring boilers,or trimming them,basically any where where you were needed."

good,Grading car parts working as a part of a team with a good management structure.
good,"Being a worldwide aluminum producer in today's economy has challenges. As a production facility you are always looking for ways to cut cost and show profits. At my current facility, our biggest responsibility is making sure the power going to the aluminum smelter is at the lowest cost possible and I think our current management does a great job. The company and union work very well together to achieve budget goals to stay in business and employed. Most days are routine and the generation units are producing maximum generation, smelter pot lines are in full operation and all is good. Some days generation units trip offline and its pretty chaotic. We have to switch pot lines from the 15KV switch yard to the 138KV switch yard, report all problems to our transmission operators and our generation trader to comply with MISO, NERC and FERC Standards. Those are the hard days, but having those days teaches me how maximum generation and the production process works and why it is so important to do my job with discipline and attention to detail because every action I make is critical to Warrick Operations. Knowing that what I do makes a huge impact on the entire operation, gives me personal enjoyment and pride to work for Alcoa INC."
good,Self motivated/ Time management - projects are self worked. 
good,"Set scheduals, allocate manning, run mill, deal with quality and safety issues, run rates, break downs, and shift pass overs. Learned how to deal with and manage people. Co- workers were good to work with, we did outside activities together. Hardest part would be job security, best part would be the people l worked with."
good,"Fast paced job, you could count on several changes in a day.Meeting, charts and graphs. Stay ahead by always knowing what your next job coming up is and making sure everything is available I have learned that we all make the foundation to a good company. It takes all of the employees to make it a sucess. It is a diverse place to work. There are a good group of people working there. The hardest part was trying to get the senior employees to understand and agree with the lean manufacturing culture. Working smarter not harder. Most enjoyable part was the feeling that we all are apart of making the company what it is."
good,"Na Alcoa se aprende muito, durante os praticamente 10 anos que trabalhei lá, o meu progresso profissional e pessoal foi nítido. Cresci muito, aprendi muito, tive muitos desafios, fui auto didata, precisei aprender na marra (os funcionários que já estão lá geralmente não possuem tempo para ensinar minuciosamente, é necessário ser pró-ativa. Fiz muitos cursos, a empresa investiu em mim (idiomas, término de graduação, pós graduação). Como toda empresa, existem colegas de trabalho que nos identificamos mais e outros menos, porém nunca tive problemas com relacionamento interpessoal, sempre tive bom relacionamento com as áreas de apoio e com o departamento comercial em si. A parte mais difícil é procurar inovar sempre, fazer diferente, dar produtividade, somos instigados a fazer isto, não que não seja bom, mas é desafiador."
good,"My present job is interesting and my boss is satisfied with my work, but my brother had a serious trauma and he needs the family help. He lives in Bishop’s Stortford since 2005. So I have to go there to help him, but my family needs my help too and if I live in England I have to go to work in order to earn money."

good,Worked with heavy equipment operators and craneman in all aspects of work.had to wear respirators hard hats and fire retardent clothes. most coworkers were good guys. raking the 1900 degree bath was the worst. most enjoyable part was just working in a very respected field
good,constantly going
good,"As a general mechanic, work was always challenging yet satisfying. Usually had more overtime than wanted but work stayed well balanced, you know, busy one day and not so much the next, Great benefits and pay is very competitive and bonuses are usually very good. I felt safety was very important to ALCOA. Most importantly they allow people to do there best and it was always appriciated. I would work there again if I had the opportunity."
good,Laid back work environment. Employees were great to work with.

The contract for our plant is prepared for our plant and other plants at the same time. Only problem is that some plants are ""iffy"" on voting down a contract in fear of their plant being closed. Our plant was a money maker, ""hand over fist"". Most contracts were voted down by our local plant but ended up getting voted in by the other plants. All in all a decent place and has security when its not contract time. The union doesnt have a very good relationship with the company, so lots of grievences get filed. Some are won and some are lost. Probably some deals getting cut, who knows? Its decent pay, could be better if the benefits wern't eating your pay."

Every acquisition demanded a specific multimodal transport project well arranged in order to delivery equipment perfect and on time. Savings during this period: US$ 6.300 millions."
good,"I've learned a great deal while working at Alcoa.Alcoa's top leadership is trustful, experienced and advancing each generation. I have a better understanding of the importance manufacturing plays in the American workforce. Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Alcoa but don't care for the culture at my particular location. Alcoa's facility is nearly 80 years old and their legacy equipment is showing its age. Equipment is ran to exhaustion with absolutely no preventive maintenance. The rank and file at my location is Union and they have sapped the entire workforce of its initiative, ingenuity and positive mental attitude. I was offered a promotion with Alcoa and am looking elsewhere when I graduate due to the culture of the salaried employees. Alcoa will never become dissatisfied with the status quo and therefore has a hard time of changing. It's all about production credits and ship dates. I truly enjoy working at Alcoa but the culture is just volatile at times. My chief complaint at the end of the day from a supervision standpoint is that they want robots to just manage people and don't want someone who wants to learn the technical aspect of producing high quality aluminum goods. I have met supervisors who have worked at Alcoa for 10+ years who can tell you the flow path of the products but don't have a clue about the actual process. I love making a tangible object that are going to be used in an aircraft, but don't think I could justify making a career out of it due to the workforce's culture."

good,"I started at Alcoa as production a production employee, but with just a few weeks into the job I was able to move into a more responsible role. In this new position I was able to improve my skills with numerous computer programs which are powerful tools toward the organizational, manufacturing, maintenance, clerical, and managerial segments of the company. I was in charge of inventory of goods used in all sectors of the maufacturing process, including, engineering, maintenance, process, shipping, etc. In addition, I handled the ordering & procurement of new items, such as tools, devices, components, and PPE. I was also responsible for tracking production of goods in all depertments from start to finish. Working with management mostly, I considered the process very professional and respectful. It was sometimes a tedious process to get all records recorded, parts ordered, and shipments met when trying to meet certain deadlines. After perrforming all tasks, mostly in secure areas throughout the organization, I was left with an immense feeling of accomplishment in knowing I was given such a great deal of responsibility, and I was able to keep all coworkers and upper management happy with my work."
