rating,review
bad,Celgene used to have a innovative and collaborative culture where everyone worked together to make the company successful. Now with an influx of new people and a very poorly run HR department the culture has shifted to one where everyone is watching their back and many people are jumping ship to go to better run companies where you don't need to put in 60 hours per week.
bad,"You'll find yourself surrounded by the same old drama and office politics here.  There are too many people who have been stuck in the same position for too long and feel trapped under the glass ceiling.  Lots of cynicism, backstabbing, and no teamwork.  Their values are weak and their idea of a positive culture is just smoke and mirrors.  Don't waste your time or energy here because there are way better opportunities now in other organizations."
bad,Je Déteste leur politique de recrutement d'emplois . Une grande entreprise comme-t-elle  ne recrute même pas les enfants du pays Neuchâtelois.
bad,"call on Rheumatologists, management and culture were very negative"
bad,"It is a great company that has medicine works. Since it grows so fast, no directions all the time. Employees need to figure out a lot to do without any support."
bad,"Lack of clarity from management, unable to provide resources in time to meet deadlines. There was not a great balance of work/life balance. Management was not always receptive to feedback and there were times that they would not follow procedures and would deviate from compliance."
bad,"A decent place to work; however, they tend to promote people into positions with no prior experience. I guess some people are considered to show potential while others, who demonstrate superior skills and experience, get left behind."
bad,Leadership cares very little about their team members and they frequently use the good pay and benefits as an excuse to not take care of employee needs.
bad,I was a compounder at the Phoenix plant. They put the carriage in front of the horse with no production. The managment was the worst I have ever worked for! Not to mention the H.R. rep was a joke. I would not recomend this company to anyone who is looking for long term employment(with all the layoffs they had and name changes who knows how much longer they will be around). Thumbs down all around.
bad,One of the best companies I have ever worked.  Great people to work with.  I also love the technology that we implemented.  Very successful company and still is.
bad,"Management is never on the same page and hardly knows whats going on. Job itself is not stressful, work environment is a little stressful. Not very professional. Work from home option is nice after  6 months of employment."
bad,"On a typical day at work can be a relaxed day if management did not watching your every moved.  its very uncomfortable. Not the entire company like this.  When you are  a contract person, you feel uncomfortable and not treated the same as the permanent employees."
bad,"The only good thing about Celgene is how other departments are nice to you except your own team. I advice, do not work here, rather work at the summit"
bad,"General overall comment is that many departments do not strive to raise the bar for performance and/or efficiencies.  Management often takes the path of least resistance.  If you are looking for advancement or to put your strengths to work,  you may want to look at another company."
bad,"For many years I greatly enjoyed coming to work everyday at Celgene. I started to notice some changes like a manager who did not know what she was doing along with her side kick who she got hired. I spent many hours fixing mistakes just so everything was correct only to get bashed by the very person I was helping. If you are not a favorite then you are treated unfairly. The workload is always stong and you are expected to be perfect. Many of my co workers were a joy to work with. The company itself is doing amazing things. It is a good company to work for but you do need to keep to yourslef and be a perfect employee. You do have unlimited amount of sick days but don't dare use them or you will be scolded, doctor's note or not."
bad,Company is doing well but culture is little to be desired.  Not much flexibility in terms of work/life balance.  Would not recommend them unless you just want to stay 1-2 years.
bad,"Nice place, fair benefits, but overall strategy - do not hire, if possible to find temporary contractor or offshore company. Hard to grow inside the company."
bad,"The worst position I have in 13 years in the industry.  Culture is poor, people do not communicate.  Tremendous amount of work is expected for low pay.  It is basically a glorified sweat shop."
bad,"Organizational changes happy daily, it is extremely hard to identify the right people to complete tasks. Everything is people based and not role based. Lacking fundamentals."
bad,"During my time I noticed although we ensured security was at its best. You can tell the employees aren't fond of security. There are many times where I was told to ignore security protocols because the company has a certain ""culture""."
bad,Personnel are quite petty and nitpicking.  Senior Management is absolutely clueless about how processes and procedures should be executed.  They don't see the forest through the tress here.
good,"Great company...not so great management. Could improve on diversity and inclusion.  Management needs to improve communication, people management skills, and interaction with staff."
good,This is a fast paced organization that is in the process of growing. Don't come to this company if you are expecting a work/life balance. Your work-life really depends on your level within the organization.
good,People are nice here. It's a professional environment with hard working people.  Similar environment to most biotechs.
good,"High productivity and quality expected but was able to perform job functions well.  Worked overtime to complete amount of work expected.  Overall satisfied with job, salary, and benefits."
good,Celgene can be a good place to work if you know the right people.Otherwise I would not bother getting comfortable there. That's all I have to say about it.
good,"although the company is good, the compensation and job security are certainly not the priority. The manager sometimes is a hit or miss depending on your department"
good,Management are not on the same page with their employees and do not take into consideration of new ideas given to them to help make our job easier and less stressful.
good,"Great responsibilities, exceeding my job description.  Heavy event management role which lead me to start my own business"
good,"This company is very good in compensation and tangible qualities such as the campus is huge, a lot of parking space and cafe/lunch area is what you would see in a mall. "
good,Serious lack of upper management. Was a consultant for over two years with no chance of a permanent position.
good,"Great competitive wages, Awesome benefit package, Stock options, and a decent amount of paid time off. I would recommend to people who can work in a stressful work enviorment."
good,"From the start of the day to the end it was work, they keep you busy which is good but they used to Micromanage you which I didn't like that."
good,Very busy with little to no credit given for amount of work performed. Fun culture/work environment
good,Great company to work for if you find the right department with the right manager. I had a flaky manager who was unable to make informed decisions. Constantly changing tasks. You didn't know whether you're coming or going. Very chaotic and very stressful environment.
good,"Celgene is a great company to work for.  However, as in most corporate jobs, remember not to get lost in the administrative shuffle.  People will have you training your next manager or director, while you stay at the bottom rungs of the ladder."
good,"This was the first time working for a pharmaceutical company and it was a good experience overall. The enjoyed the challenge's of working with patients, prescribers and pharmacists. ."
good,Growing company with good benefits but managed poorly.  Finance dept is cut-throat and very back-stabbing.  The Finance dept was a very stressful place to work.
good,"Fast pace and stressful environment;  No time for breaks;"
good,"Very nice people to work with, a lot of opportunities for learning. "
good,"The science is cutting edge and most of the people are great! Extra learning is encouraged, but promotion is not based on hard work and years of experience. It's who you know and your degree."
good,"no comment.  Friendly atmosphere.  Good balance between family and work.  Flexible hours and working remotely is a bonus. "
good,It was very good experience working with the company . The work culture is amazing. It helped me a lot for my professional growth and learning. Learned new applications.
good,Overall positive experience amongst peers. Facilities were okay but in need of renovation.  Food options were limited and rather bland but more options could be found if willing to travel to main cafeteria.
good,It is a very metrics driven job. I have learned to multitask on several platforms to complete my case load. Time management is very challenging and imperative.
good,"The company was a good place to work, but I was never given a chance for promotion. Pay was what I would expect for a pharma company. Management seemed"
good,"Working at Celgene provides great experience. They provide excellent training for their employees. The workplace culture was also fun, the most enjoyable part of the part are your coworkers."
good,I only worked for Celgene on a temporary HR Generalist contract and cannot provide a review of the company. I supported the sales organization for a new drug launch.
good,"A typical day involved seeing Oncologists and nurses in the Birmingham and Huntsville Market.Very competitive market but had great rapport and achieved objectives. Management was good and enjoyed working with my team.The hardest part was just having patience that MDs would make the right decision with our products."
good,Good company to work for. Great people with good work ethic. Work is interesting and exciting. Many great positives in working here.
good,"Celgene is a very fair diverse employer. At Celgene I learned a great deal about risk and mitigation. The most enjoyable part about the job was providing help to patients, physicians, and pharmacies."
good,"Great pay and benefits.  Few opportunities for professional growth and development.  If you enjoy being an individual contributor and have no particular ambition or desire to advance and progress upward, Celgene may be a good fit.  Otherwise, not a great organization."
good,Great oncology division. Immunology has growing pains with poor division leader. Hopefully one day it will mirror the Oncology division.
good,Overall great company to work for with excellent benefits and salary.  You will learn a lot working for this company.  Excellent oncology drugs.
good,Its a pretty ok place to work. The environment is cool and the co workers are nice.
good,"Nice company to work for , enjoyed working on various projects over the period of 4 years"
good,"Fun and sociable coworkers, management was a little inconsistent.  Job was very laid back, working at a desk and computer, but the pay was good.  "
good,8 years is a long time to work at a place don't you think?  I would like to work at a new position for another 8 years.  Lets hope that Indeed will help!
good,"After an intense training where I feel they don't cover everything, you would be thrown to wolves. The calls are sometimes out there and you are scrutinized by things you didn't or could have done better. The reviews from management are very inconsistent and subjective. It's a steep learning curve but stable once you get the hang of it. You learn to work with different departments and how to talk to all kinds of customers. Another issue that I find is the inconsistent hours, there are days you work until 5 or days you work until 8, you can work 12 hours or 8 hours. It's tough to have a stable work life balance when your schedule shifts constantly. The most enjoyable part for me is talking to the customers, especially those who really appreciate the help."
good,"Very fast-paced company. While the pay and benefits are competitive, the hours were extremely long. There is a lack of female representation on the IT Leadership Team."
good,"Discussing clinical data with HCPs."
good,Well balanced company. A typical day consist of fast paced environment. One must be detailed oriented and focused at all times. Co workers are loving and kind
good,"Leadership is very experienced, savvy, and will always push you to do your best. The staff is equally as bright and also a great team to work with."
good,"Learned the contract process management "
good,Great Team concepts. I really appreciate the work life balance here. The focus toward the future is very creative. Learning the creative side of the pharma world.
good,"Many smart people, good pipeline, many interesting roles, good reputation of company, good benefits, however difficult to get new job opportunities in other departments unless you are one of the chosen few - highly political and does not do good job supporting development of new employees"
good,"Everyone there is nice, but there isn't much to do. The workers are all nice, there's free coffee, but there really isn't much to do."
good,The management is horrible specially in the customer care or Rems specialist department. The actual company is great but this particular department has a very toxic environment.
good,"Creative and innovative company. Heavy workload, but very rewarding work. Company is willing to take new chances and commit to innovative projects. Opportunities exist for the self driven."
good,Celgene is an excellent company for cancer research. I find working with various medical directors and scientists extremely rewarding.
good,"fast growing company"
good,"Spent 2.5 in the same role as a contractor, after constantly being reassured that I’d be made permanent.  No career growth in my role and I didn’t learn much at all about clinical operations until I left for a new role"
good,Company is being acquired and being a contract employee in these uncertain times is unsettling. Working environment is pleasant with strong tem support in each department.
good,If you enjoy a fast-paced environment where the direction from upper management is always changing then you would enjoy working here. There is not much of a work-life balance. There is also little room for upward advancement. The people are nice.
good,"I work as a contractor, in fact almost everyone below the level of senior manager appears to be a contractor.  Unfortunately the contract agencies are concerned solely with their own profit to the exclusion of providing the best possible service to their customer."
good,"Not interested in writing review at this time.  Good Benefits/ stock / bonus - no work life balance - weekends, night BB 24/7 - culture is changing lots of downsizing, letting of great employees."
good,"Very busy"
good,Celgene Corporation as a company is great for patient and innovations.Fantastic benefits but management can be slightly better.
good,ambiente joven y distendido. empresa en pleno crecimiento
good,"Very little provisions for maternity care for this type of company"
good,"Certain Managers love to micro manage.  If you can put up with this, then it should be no problem. You just need alot of patience. Do you job to the best of your ability and don't take anything personal."
good,I recommend working here because the company is generous with compensation. The drug discovery projects are well staffed and financed. Money is not an issue for this company.
good,Celgene is a very good company to work for and they really care about their employees.  It has been a very positive experience.
good,Working for Celgene is a great experience. It always feels good to work for a environment with a group of people that care for our customers well being
good,Productive and eductional work environment. Processing and mailing of daily invoices. Daily Cash Application. Maintaining collections on past due accounts. Providing account statements on a weekly and/or monthly basis to customers.
good,Every day could be different which is something enjoyable.
good,I enjoy working for Celgene. It is a very well-organized company that cares for the community and it's employees.
good,Awesome place to work. Great benefits! Many opportunites for career advancing.
good,"Celgene is a pretty balanced place to work. It offers a beautiful building, wonderful gym with classes for free and exciting science with most up to date lab equipment. The culture is group and manager dependent, just like most companies. Some groups are cut throat and stressful while others are challenging yet balanced. I enjoyed my co-workers, the work I was doing and the gym most."
good,I have grown into a senior business analyst and project leader here.   I have been able to work on my communication and written skills
good,"Great organization for growth at junior to middle level management. Solid fundamentals research and development, great leadership taking to next level!"
good,A typical day would consist of writing UAT scripts and executing UAT. I learned some about writing UAT scripts. The workplace culture is  positive. Not being assigned to a team and working in isolation. The snacks.
good,"My experience with Celgene was mostly positive. I was consistently very busy, which I like. The work culture seemed positive for the FTEs, while the culture for the consultants and contractors was a bit different."
good,"I like Mondays typically because the day flies by quickly.  On any given day, you will find me responding to emails, speaking with clients and organizing my weekly schedule."
good,"Celgene est un laboratoire pharmaceutique innovant et qui tend à apporter une offre différenciante."
good,"Supportive management teams and diverse culture.  The days are not typical they are very different with understanding US customs trade laws and trade programs, C-TPAT and ISA certifications, auditing, training and managing pilot programs."
good,"Celgene is a great company to work with. "
good,"Great culture. Loved the immediate people that I worked with."
good,The commitment for improving the lives of the patients.  There health benefits for the employees and there Employee stock option program was very good.
good,"I had the greatest opportunities in my career at Celgene.  I am fortunate to have been able to join at a time when the company was just growing.  I was able to learn from some of the best mentors."
good,"Respectful employees who value hard work and innovation. There are down times and also busy moments of the day. Pay rate is decent. It is a corporate environment, so one must adopt the corporate culture."
good,"Celgene is a great company and provided its employees with wonderful benefits, compensation and positive work place environment."
good,I loved my time at this growing company as well as the energy that was instilled from management.  Numerous chances to learn and interact with other groups. Great experience altogether.
good,Celgene Corporation is a great company overall. To see the advancement from when I started and departed is phenomenal.
good,"Growing business with good people. Quality does not wield the influence necessary to be more effective, but it does get the job done"
good,"Well, for the most part, working with Celgene is one of the most genuine decisions I ever made to engaged with.In fact, it's a lot to say, but to make words short I enjoy working with this drug company like every other company I have worked with, but what makes it exceptional is because of it enormous benefits and standards which make it more lucrative than others.For instance, a typical workday would involve strenuous patrolling which include both interior and exterior checks around the premises to check for suspicious debris. Staying prolong due to heavy load of work could be another point .However, it isn't that much difficult to get along with the job.Literally I have learnt a lot working with Celgene.One of the most predominant aspect I attain while working there is Patience.I very much appreciate them for making me comprehend how to work with diverse people,as well as how to be time conscious.They made me comprehend that time is very valuable which has helped me a lot in many of life circumstances.Also not forgetting the ultimate relationship developed between me and my coworkers which makes almost look like a family.The only difficult part of the job is feet patrolling which makes your ankle hurt a lot especially if you have to work a 12hours shift like I do,apart from that the job is pretty much easier.Left to me I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is getting along with others,understanding who people are at what they are composed of.Its all about comprehension with others."
good,"I think Celgene is a great company.  I did not have a supportive, good manager.  I blame that for my being laid off.  I still want to work there."
good,Good company but high productivity expected for complex cases for pharmaceutical company in drug safety which was oncology and involved a lot of medical records.
good,"A motivated, results- oriented professional with excellent communication skills and leadership ability seeks a Product/Project Manager position. I enjoy the task of taking on new challenges that delivers great results. I believe this comes from having great leadership that is open to new ideas to help strengthen the individual and a team for superior growth."
good,It was a good learning experience.Learned new skills and gained experience
good,"This job has me helping blood cancer patients enroll in a pill-based chemotherapy program with side effects that are less debilitating. This is personal because I had lost a spouse to a blood cancer, and I feel fulfilled in helping others who are in the same boat to survive. I help prevent the risk of embryo-fetal exposure to the company's REMS products, and I inform prescribers, patients, and pharmacies on the serious risks and safe-use conditions for those REMS products."
good,Celgene had a small company feel but as they grew they lost that feeling. The management restructured into smaller project groups and really deflated the culture. A lot of the people who work there are not happy but they are afraid to leave because they are getting rich off the stock.
good,"Globally Celgene is definitely a good company in the region, but not as much a some may think. Basically for all collaborators they ""only"" offer health insurance as a plus. Vacations are 25 days for everybody with no bonus of age or seniority. Basic Salary is ""normal"". Stock options at management level is a good plus."
good,I enjoyed my time at Celgene. The management was very knowledgeable of the work involved and very appreciative of any extra work done.
good,"On a day to day basis I would take Helpdesk calls and desktop support calls. I learned a great deal with networking and IT troubleshooting. The work environment was very good along with the co-workers and management. the hardest part of the job was taking on challenges that I have not seen before, but that was also the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Haven't been here in years my input would not matter since they have had turn over since my departure. Company has just recently went through a purchase so under new ownership as well.
good,"Company has grown tremendously since I've joined.  Very fast paced environment with a heavy workload, but plenty of opportunity to learn and grow.  Management is excellent and supportive."
good,"A place full of opportunities to learn and growth"
good,He crecido muchísimo como profesional trabajando en Celgene
good,Great company to work for - awesome benefits and pay. The training is very good and the sales meetings aren’t boring. Company takes care of its sales reps.
good,"perfect Job environment"
good,"I noticed extremely high travel costs on incoming expense reports and realiZed that there had to be less expensive options. After meeting with my Vice President, he agreed and asked me to head up a project to investigate such. I saved the Department tens of thousands of dollars by negotiating with hotels for cheaper rates and cut down on limo use."
good,Indeed is good job portal where we can find number of positions to apply for job. Its very easy and beneficial for the candidates to surf for the positions in different locations.
good,"Great place to work at with a big corporate environment, excellent benefits. Work and life balance can be challenging depending on what area of Research and Development you are working and company priority of projects."
good,I like working here because of the diverse environment. There are many opportunities to advance in your career and management helps with steering you into the perfect role.
good,Busy and enjoyed working with staff. Friendly environment.
good,"My current position at Celgene includes working with the statistical programmers and mangers in the Data Operations & Programming Department. I keep records for them, handle meeting requests and inquiries about travel/expense reports. I have also set up interviews with contractors/permanent employees when needed and have worked with HR and vendors to coordinate set up."
good,Great group of clinical experts with the drive to fill the unmet needs of oncology patients. The biologic pharmaceuticals provide added challenges that demand well-thought out strategic plans with back-ups. The global reach allows for international involvement with regulators as well as physicians world-wide.
good,The work is important and help patients with therapeutic needs. Patients often times share their health journey with the company and how important the work we provided help save their lives.
good,"good place to work at but when i worked there they were in the process of going under an acquisition so it was very hectic . also it was a contract position that didnt go perm, but overall nice place and good people"
good,"I worked a normal 8am-5pm week, and assisted the regional director as well as the Specialty Sales Representatives.  The management was excellent and also supported their employees.  The hardest part of the job was managing six sales reps.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people all over the country, including surgeons that all had a commitment to our mission which was helping patients live a more comfortable life while going through cancer."
good,"Management is aware of company mission and focuses on accomplishing it. "
good,The workplace culture is friendly and this company offers good benefits and incentives.  I would recommend working here for anyone interested in joining the company.
good,"Reviewing emails, making travel arrangements or editing existing travel. Arranging meetings, events and lunches. Submitting expense reports. Working on contracts and purchasing documents. Creating reports. Responding to communications on behalf of executives. Typical EA responsibilities."
good,"Celgene is a fast growing company and experiencing growing pains in its processes, as it continuous to grow and scale it will quickly need to adapt in a faster way."
good,Celgene is a fast growing biotech company with excellent benefits.  The company has an excellent culture but is slowly changing to a more larger company feel.
good,Admire the work culture and management over there. Great place for  those who begin their career. Job security is really good.
good,A good place for advancement and co-worker communicate well together. Management also give its employees the information about how company is progressing.
good,"An international oncology group with several therapeutics within their portfolio, the Celgene Corporation offers a tremendous opportunity for individuals who want to learn in a large pharmaceutical setting."

good,"Great work, wonderful people. I was hoping to start working there permanently."

good,"Team work, Productive and workplace and culture is very good. Testing of stability samples for Assay, RI, Dissolution, Moisture,Chiral purity to be analysed."
good,Celgene was an amazing place to work for many years.  The company has been acquired by BMS recently and it remains to be seen how the two companies will integrate.
good,"company provide variety kinds of personal development training and give opportunity to grow within company."
good,"Nice place to learn new technologies."
good,It was a great learning experience as the company is working in the field of Big Data and Amazon Web Services. Absolutely wonderful people to work with!

good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Celgene. Although I was a contractor with no real promise of employment, I thought I proved myself enough to warrant consideration..."
good,"Every day is a new adventure at Celgene's LifeBank USA. Because we work with human placentas and cord blood, we have to be prepared for anything and everything. What LifeBank has to offer is an excellent program where we process placentas and cord blood for stem cell banking for donations and private clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that we process today could make a difference in the families' futures."
good,"While the average day of work usually spanned from eight in the morning to four or five in the afternoon, that time was typically spent on improving the company and doing so for the sake of the customers: the patients who relied on the pharmaceuticals that Celgene provided. That being said, while we were to be extremely dedicated towards them over the course of the day, that same dedication takes its toll and can hollow out someone for a good cause; while this is not a bad thing, this atmosphere can really drag employees down rather than build them up. This is the high rope that Celgene walks though- who matters more, the employee or the patient?"
good,"A typical day at work would be for me to attend meetings about the Biologics Processes, specific to the project I was assigned to be a part of. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I was able to visually experience and participate in discussions in meetings and share my ideas/visions to the team."
good,"Celgene is a fast growing company and offers great benefits to their employees.  Friendly atmosphere, huge campus and healthy food options in the cafeteria."
good,Loved the whole work environment and felt I was part of a well oiled machine.  They had a great work life balance.  Everyone was willing to help each other when needed.

good,"This was a contacted position. Day to day accounts payable duties.. One on one with any / all issues that needed to be resolved. data-entry, coding, all calls and reseaching,"
good,"Great company, harmony, people, place and everyone is very spoiled.  Management is respectful and kind.  Those that lack these traits are awkward and do not fit in making them more awkward."
good,I do not wish to add anything in the review of this company. I don't want to add anything in the review of this company. The start rating should be suffice
good,"Gran ambiente de trabajo, rodeado de personas con un talento increíble"
good,"Training and compensation at Celgene, are strong highlight of working for the company. Experience there, would vary greatly depending on what division you work for, but overall, it is a well regimented professional environment. In my experience, it was a great company to work for."

good,"The company as a whole is wonderful. They are very dedicated to providing for their employees, knowing a strong employee will make product to get to patients. There are some management situations at manufacturing sites where the waters are muddy on how they move through problems. But for the most part, couldn't ask for better place to work."
good,Great place to work.  A lot of knowledge and expertise to learn and grow from.  Room for cross training.  Hard working coworkers that you want to be around on and off of work.  They have a coed softball team and a bowling team.
good,"Balance with challenge and fun, friendly work environment, effective and productive management, helpful colleagues, enjoyable to work at Celgene, convenient gym allowed employee to balance health and work productivity."
good,"Very good relationships with coworkers and management. Not a stressful environment with people being cooperative and understanding. Great training programs. Sometimes it is hard staying focused when I faced negativity, but it is hot happening to often,otherwise I am enjoying  every day at my work."
good,"good to work here in this client"
good,"excellent compensation, large territory (most of VA). Looking for smaller territory or comparable compensation. worked with specialty pharmacies, prior auths, office staff, etc."
good,Management often offers flexibility with schedules when needed. There is much opportunity for growth and advancement. Management ensures Project Managers do not have too many projects to manage. I enjoy the people I work with with
good,Productive and collaborative workplace. Open door policy with plenty of access and support from senior management. Blend of traditional work space and open floor plan with a plethora of huddle rooms to get work done in.
good,"I enjoyed my experience at Celgene. If it weren't for my supervisor leaving the company, I would still be there. I loved the people, the environment and everything about my job."
good,"Communication skills, more transparency between managers and subordinates.  More Community volunteer work.  Mandatory Training for admins.  Working from home opportunities for all employees.  Christmas week closures."
good,My typical day is working on site contracts.  I have learned that no sites are the same when negotiating.  I think the hardest part of my job is that I wear different hats.  I can be doing a CDA for outsourcing and then be negotiating a contract for a site.
good,"Celgene is a great company to work for. I have been here for 5 years and every person I have worked with has been so kind, respectful, and good at what they do. The management is fair and supportive. They were always flexible with my schedule and provided so many benefits. This company genuinely cares about its employees and it's mission to make the lives of patients better. The hardest part about this job is leaving.
