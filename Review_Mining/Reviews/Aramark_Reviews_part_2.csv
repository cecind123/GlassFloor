good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.
good,Good place to work. Work could be made harder by employees not performing their job. Management doesn't do a very good job of holding low performers accountable. Hours are inconsistent. One week you get 28 hours and the next you get 38 hours.
good,"I began working in the park during the summer, when tourism is extremely high. this meant long work weeks, but the community of employees is very carefree, adventurous, and positive. everyone quickly becomes friends and supports eachother. the workplace was very fun, considering you get to meet tourists from all over the world and learn a little bit about them and create a better experience for them in the park! the most difficult part of this job is working with frustrated customers and customers that did not speak English."

good,"Great experience for running a large P&L.  The company went public, so I got IPO exposure as a senior executive leader.  Company does not leverage installed base for growth in other related segments.  Strong CEO, very inspiring."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral,siempre con disponibilodad para atender"
good,Good place to work if it wasn't so hot. Had team work. Great people to work with enjoyed working there. The pay is great. But not enough room to grow in company.
good,My working experience was very good. They had employees from many country who were the international student. The management of Aramark was always flexible and on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was after the closing every employee eat together including Chef and worker.
good,"Everyday working for Amarak is a new experience for me. I get to enjoy both facets of the job, cooking and serving students. It is a music program school so the energy there is very nice and postitve The management there are stern about following protocols and procedures which is a good thing so there are minimal mistakes being made. The hardest part of the job for me is the layoffs cause it is a school. I would rather find a more permanent position so I can be more active."
good,I entered inventory daily and made sure the customers were billed properly.  It was a great learning experience that helped me further my career.  It was a good company for an entry level position.
good,I assist in the setup of conferences and events. Everyday can bring something new so the job doesn't feel routine. I also develop new skills being that I have a large variety of duties. My ideas on how I can do my job more effectively are always taken into consideration. The staff is friendly and everyone gets along well.
good,"A very good entry level experience in customer service. The managerial staff was very helpful in teaching fundamental customer service skills (patience, tactfulness, attentiveness, empathy). The work place was easy to adjust to, and provided plenty opportunities to experience constructive pressure (time constraints, work reviews)."

good,Open at 4:30 am and work until 7 pm.  Work culture is stressful having to be on guard with inmates and the treat of violence.  Most enjoyable was teaching inmates there is another choice.
good,"At times it is fun working with co-workers, but when it's time to clean up every is ready to work.  We set up events hours before started and clean up hours after it is finished."
good,Once you got used to waking up early it wasn't that bad as long as you went to bed at reasonable hour work was gonna be a good day.  I learned a lot about hard work and paying attention to details that may not seem important but are actually very important.  We always knew how to have fun but as is with all work it can't always be fun and I learned when it was time for fun and when it was time to get real.
good,"Basically a typical day starts at 6 am serving coffee, espresso beverages, pastries, and hot food items for both breakfast and lunch. This fast-paced environment has taught me how to multi-task under pressure. We are typically busy and very popular on the military base.

good,I have worked with Aramark for almost 8 years and by working there I have gained knowledge that I can take anywhere. I appreciate all of the training.

good,This is a great place to work if you like working in the kitchen or cafeteria atmosphere. Friendly supervisors and managers who also do not mind letting you eat whatever your heart desires.
good,"Good company to work for on a corporate/management level.  Managers are very personable and big-picture oriented.  There are plenty of great lower-level employees, but just as many very low-quality ones.  Getting the job done decently, consistently, will be rewarded."

good,"You come in for work get your designating work area for the day which changes depending on their needs. As a cashier I go get the money and fill my register. Then I proceed to help the runners get the stand set up to be presentable for the customers. If need be they  put you as a runner in stand that are busier. I look forward to working in the Papa Johns stand. This was my time experiencing how pizza was made. The hardest part is keeping up with the fast pace, but if you have a good team; it's not hard. The management keeps us motivated."
good,The manager was hands on and taught us all how to work in smart efficient ways. The work wasn't hard and it was a leisurely environment. I needed more

good,the job that I do can be real busy sometime. Most of the jobs are good to work in. I work at the GM plant. It is a new to me. I was use to working in schools as a custodian. It is a lot more people to deal with then in the school. It can be hard sometime dealing with people who do not want to work. Most of the people are good people who care about there job.
good,the work atmosphere was a relaxed office but a lot was expected of me. i enjoyed the people i worked with and the kind of job i was expected to do. My manager was friendly and hard working .
good,"typical day at work would be to always converse with customers, regular job duties such as completing transactions, count money box, closing, restocking and receiving merchandise, inventory, attending catering events, community events and college organization events. Management at the work place can sometimes be stressful because some people would get away with things without being terminated or penalized. Co workers were fun to work with since everyone was very helpful and social. The hardest part of this job was if that you were a student there were times when you had to stay longer hours for events and still needed to go study or to class early the next morning. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to see your friends each day, eating with them at your own job, meeting new people, and staying active, there was always something to do to stay busy.

good,"professional organization, opportunities for people who are ready to accept challenge and grow with the organization"
good,"Aramark was a very nice place to work while handling a college career. However, the management could have been better as they caused many unnecessary problems. There was no real interview process and most of the time they would hire workers who spent more time with their cell phones than helping with the jobs that were assigned to them at the time. Eventually I felt it was time to leave as unnecessary tensions started to rise which was again caused by managers. A typical day at work was really not that hard. The second that I would show up I knew what my job was and I did my part to help out the team. One of the biggest things I learned was to establish a relationship with my co-workers and management quickly as this would come in handy later. Also, I learned the importance of making sure that everyone knew who was going to be working and who was going to be off on what days as we had some situations were one person would be off and the boss knew, but the supervisors did not and they had no time to plan for those situations."
good,Over a great place to work for your first job or for those needing to gain more experience to build their resume. Work load varies on the number of clients served a day.
good,"This job started out great, I learned a lot here and had several opportunities in different types of jobs. The bad thing was that they went through a lot of management,"
good,"aramark was a good start up for me gave me good experience good company to work for if i had chance to work for them will work again, too bad that its no longer in place where i work company has change to sage dining. it was good place till it lasted."
good,"A typical day in the cafeteria starts off slow paced and speeds up during lunch time.  Most of the work is done alone because of the population in the jail.  Management is there when you need them but you have to ask most of the co-workers are very easy to work with but sometimes you have the night vs. day competition with the amount of work that needs to be done.  The hardest part of this job is working alone trying to take orders, answer the phone, cook food and pack it right to give to the proper customer.  the most enjoyable part of the job is creating your own specials and working at your own pace when available."

My co workers were all friendly and hard-working people i didn't have an issue with anybody there.

That's basically the rush hour of the whole job everything else is pretty easy going.

I have become a stronger person working in this environment and If I can have an impact on just one inmate everyday and show them what good work ethic and morals are and they apply themselves, then I know I have done my job."

I make sure all ovens and warmers are off, and all doors are locked. The only complaint I would have would have to be the way my district is managed. I GM is a wonderful lady, who tries her best to come by and work out any problems. I have seen her put on gloves and help us out if needed. She has even given me her personal number in case I have to get in touch with her. The ladies in the ""office"", so to speak, never take"

My co-workers were friendly and willing to operate in a large team effectively, however higher members of staff were often inhospitable and patronising. The hardest part of the job was the 12 hour shifts on top of the 3 hour daily commute on a Monday-Friday schedule, however meeting the athlete's of the London 2012 Olympics and forming a personal relationship with a number of them (as well as being instrumental in their experience within the village) was inspirational and unforgettable - as a whole, I wouldn't change my experience at all.

Our supervisors encouraged us to make suggestions about what could be improved for efficiency. We also had meetings biweekly to discuss practical and principle-related issues that came up.  Our main supervisor always wanted us to remember that the people we served were the purpose of our work.

good,I have worked for Aramark for 30+ years and the local Aramark Management is excellent and supportive. Upper level Leadership needs to do a better job connecting with the Client Leadership. I think with the new Aramark Leadership this is recognized and will be accomplished.

good,I worked with Aramark during my exam period and the following summer. I worked on a zero hour contract and had either one or two shifts per week. I was not pressured to take on more shifts than I could handle. The management were very friendly and accommodating though at times rotas were not released on time etc. There was always something to do and being customer facing I was able to develop my social and professional skills very fast.
good,"My day would  start with the startup procedure for the plant, and PM equipment. I did learn a lot about cleaning waste water from the washing process. Management was good at teaching all they knew about the equipment. but the hardest part was keeping it balanced, do to it constantly changing. but i do miss the people i worked with."

good,"The training for the designated positions were great, and helped tremendously to understand the role and the expectation to have. The 1 on 1 feedback from the GM helped realize opportunity."
good,Everyone was treated the same way. Most of the times on your days off you would get called in. Didn’t really get a schedule until the end of the week. Had to leave because I went back to school.
good,The work was very much the same in a lot of cases. A lot of repetition when it came to the work but a lot of it is more so interacting with customers and being polite.

good,"Good company , I was there 15 years, just looking for a change.  They started giving descend raises, room to move up. A good work environment. I would recommend."
good,Fun place to work. Some employees get away with a lot more than others. Would like a lot more hours. I feel like I deserve a lot more hours as I’m eager to do overtime and ask the manager if she needs me in any earlier to help.
good,I would consider it to be a pretty fun workplace for the most part everyone got along. There were flexible when needed to be. They acknowledged your hard work and were appreciative for it. They have a strong belief in employee safety and made sure everyone attended all the safety meetings.
good,"good supervisors, coworkers are upbeat and always willing to help one another, good pay, close to home, two free meals, daily, insurance available, sometimes stressful"
good,the hardest part of the job was truly figuring out the work-life balance as a student since the hours are in pretty long blocks since you are basically managing an event

good,"Aramark, is a great company, every now and then you just come across some managers that just don't support you as they should.  If you come across any just do your job to the  best of your ability, you will outlast them for the most part.  Times have changed over the years as audits are more paper work oriented.  You may have a fairly clean facility but if you don't dot your"" i's"" or cross your ""t's"" it will cost you points.  The most enjoyable part of the job was teaching someone something, watching the person growing from strength to strength and also learning from others."
good,"Good place to work but you need to make more money and do overtime if needed ! They are like a family there, they will help you get more hours, if you want!"

good,"Checking emails first thing "
good,"Quick pace job because you’re always there to cater to people through orders. People can get irritated quickly due to you working at Fenway Park during games so people may end up tipsy and or drunk. Overall, warm feeling especially if a fan of the game and of Red Sox. All the fans around make you feel apart of the game to the point where it doesn’t feel like work at times."

good,A typical day at work in the Sports and Entertainment industry is very different than a typical day at work in your normal 9-5 workplace. I learned so much from working for Aramark and also working in this industry. When you attend events you don't typically think of what goes on behind the scenes but working here gives you the opportunity to understand the day to day operations. It really is a fun and exciting environment and I'm proud to work for this company.
good,Aramark was a good company to work for. They take care of their employees but pay below the industry average. Its a good company to start off your career in and grow.

good,The company makes sure that their employees are happy and work together as well as building skills to work individually. The people themselves are very receptive to ideas and considers them as a way of helping others.
good,You had a simple job. The only problem was the workers. The managers did nothing to fix it when it was addressed you were also laid off everytime school was let out.
good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.
good,Work is steady for the most part but can get very busy from time to time. Plenty of customer interaction. It helps to have good communication among coworkers.
good,The job is fast-paced. It forces you to improvise often. The management experience was great. The hardest part of the job is working inside the county jail for 8 hours straight without daylight.
good,Game days were extremely tiring but fun and worth it. I enjoyed the fact that i could really show off my cooking skills and also get my supervisor experience.
good,The job is fine just not paying me substantial living wages right now. The management is great and the company morals and what they stand by is great too.
good,Good once you get used to working with inmates.  Restrooms aren't in kitchen. Have to plan restroom breakes.  Free meals. Long hours on concrete floors
good,"I felt there was no way to move forward with this business at this location.  They are flexible with student hours and employee emergencies, but I feel you must be ""okay"" with what you do and have no desire to move on to better opportunities.  Simple food management and catering is all it really boils down to."
good,The work was OK for the pay received. The manager style and mine did not match. I have been managing personnel for 20 plus years he was still attempting to manage people all the same.
good,great company to work for. many perks for working with Aramark and being contracted by one of the best company there is. Great management and staff. i work at a quick pace location. Time goes so fast that its almost time to go home. We get free lunch.
good,I am currently still employed at this job. It works well with my class schedule and the managers are understanding of abrupt situations that might occur. The environment is always welcoming and it is a social environment where I have to interact with customers on the daily basis.
good,"A typical day at work could be good or bad, due to being understaffed or at least where I worked at for Aramark. Management is horrible! When it comes to management its not really a teamwork thing, they do what they have to do to keep their buts from being in hot water. So if that takes working you to death in order to keep themselves out of hot water they'll do it. The workplace culture was cool, I worked on UF campus so I met a lot of different personalities and enjoyed being around the gator environment. The hardest part of the job is having to work two different food stations without any help! This happens almost majority of the workdays."
good,i liked the people there but it was temporary. it’s more of a summer job instead of all season long. we constantly were up and moving and always doing what we need to satisfy the customers
good,"was a great place to work if you like fast paced work environment, the only down fall is the parking if you start work after 8;00 am. They let you eat for free on your 15 minute break."
good,I love working for Aramark at Citizens Bank Park.  I have met a bunch of great people that I now call my friends.  I love the fast-paced work environment and I love being around baseball.  It is a great part-time job for someone who enjoys the restaurant industry.

good,Typically at work I was prepping food making sure all labels on food getting ready for the day if the day if the day was slow I would do cleaning . Once the day got started I was serving in different station around the job one station had pizza and one had side foods and deserts. the hardest part about this job was dealing with attitudes and the best part was I got to eat for free.
good,"Busy, alive environment to work. Good structure of policies. 5 star company, always was proud to represent Aramark. Obviously there is some pros and cons"
good,Start work at 8.30am.empty trash cans.help line cooks get ready for the day.Then go do dishes.do whatever cleaning that needs to be done.like walls and floors.

good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.
good,"My time at Aramark was a fantastic experience full of wonderful people who had extensive knowledge in their roles. However, i was part of their A2L program and when it came to my placement  afterwards, they couldn't seem to get together in a timely fashion. Overall good company."
good,"a typical day at aramark , i would count the register and get products ready for the day (restocking condiments, drinks, napkins, chips, snacks).there was never really a hard part to the job. it was a easy and fun job."

good,"I had a Great Team to work & learn with. Meet some great acquaintances. long days and weeks, but you get accustom to it.. Really liked my job, I would do it again"
good,Aramark was a good company to work for.  We had ample support for our contracts account and a workable size management staff for the size of the contract.It was sometime ago so I am unable to speak on the current structure and culture.
good,Overall it was a decent place to work@. I gain some more knowledge when it came down to working in the kitchen and dealing with different personal with in the inmates. Some of the manager's were okay to deal with and some were complicated to deal with and talk too.
good,you meet a lot of new people and and get to see some pretty cool things. it's always a new experience at the job. you build everlasting relationships.
good,"Good work environment. The people was nice, there was some disorganization yet you still could your work done. Supervisors needed more training but were nice people."
good,"My typical day at work can be summed up in one word: frappuccinos. I made frappuccinos every day I worked at Starbucks. The hardest part of the job was the extremes of it; when we're in a morning or lunch rush, everyone is working and sometimes people get mixed up in their duties and when we're extremely slow and we've done all we can do at the moment, staying on our feet becomes difficult."

good,"Since starting at Muncy Hospital through Aramark, I was wracked with nervousness over meeting new people, especially on a job that was my first full time spot. Very quickly I learned that my co-workers were caring, nonjudgmental folk, and it made me more motivated to stay positive at a job where stress is inevitable. I had a trainer show me a detailed way to get through my position, and learning more positions was very easy because of established relationships with everyone. There's a very strong sense of fast pace to most positions in the hospital, but everyone found time to help another at least a few times in a week. The workload for one person, which was the spot I was in, got hectic. Insanely so, when patient census was high. It required me to find a balance fast, especially in areas I was slower to grasp full understanding of to progress smoothly for a shift. A lot of days, it was expected to have setbacks, but because of that and having built a strong foundation with staff, it was doable. That was the most important thing: that it was doable. Every manager I would report to was understanding so long as I stayed open in communicating previous direction, and when I could put focus in a task I was asked to do. Overall the job was pretty great, and had it not been for some factors I'd have stayed longer than I had. Absolutely recommendable for anyone to apply if they have the will to work in a fast paced, friendly environment. "

The most enjoyable part about the job was you never had to work on a weekend and you're always finished by 5pm if not early and the breaks were okay you got to go out for a cigarette break when you was busy and someone was there to cover you. The management when I first starting was going though a change over in mangers from where one got suspended and then the new manager didn't really know what she was doing and she wasn't do thing right. Overall though everyone got along with each other work well as a team and we had a laugh. unorganized

good,"My typical day at work was the challenge of dealing with multiple personalities in both employees and the supervisors that I managed. I also had to juggle getting several projects done that were due at the same time.  The challenge of achieving all of this was exciting because I seem to always get the job done in spite of the deadlines.  There was really nothing to difficult about the job although every once in a while the timing of personality malfunctions would tend to frustrate me, however, I worked it out.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the finished result of my work.  The result of me having people do what I wanted them to do in spite of their complaining and seeing a clean polished facility.  I just doesn't get any better than that.   "

good,"I worked in the Special Events Catering section of Aramark based in James Madison University.  It is definitely a more diverse job in which you are expected to know how to be a waiter, bartender, server, and mover at the same time.  You get to see and serve various VIP's that visit the campus including the president of the university.  Overall the job is not that difficult, but it is very fast-paced at times.  Expectations are high, but you have many friendly employees to help you along the way."

However, the hardest part of this job to handle the rude and messy college students sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I could have free food every time when I worked there."
good,"I was hired to work as an assistant manager at Bryn Mawr College in one of their 7 units. On my third day, HQ asked me how the job was going. I informed him of the various ways his company was being stolen from. He took the manager out to lunch, fired him and made me the manager in his place. We went from losing $2,000/week to making $5,000. The turn around was so great, we took over menus and ordering for the other 6 units nearby. It was work! But, we were winning. It was a rewarding year."
good,"Since I have been here at the Lutheran General Hospital, I have learned a great deal about the buisness acuman that I did not get in my previous jobs.

I was able to gain first hand experience with managing employees in a dining environment as well as up hold the highest standard of quality and care when it came to satisfying our exclusive guests who attended each game. I then moved to the Insperity Club which is also a season ticket holder location, however in this location we would expect to have a higher volume of guests at a faster pace. Here I learned the value of preparation and how to direct production based on the estimated number of guests for each particular game. I am currently in the catering division where I have been faced with the most responsibility and opportunity to manage. Catering is demanding and requires constant supervision over the operation as a whole. Once I am given the event packet listing the most updated events, I will then construct an employee schedule, and create pull sheets based on what is needed for each particular event. The amount of events per day vary based on what the sales team was able to get contracted, on a game day we could have as many as 10 events in one day with an unlimited amount of attendees. On the day of the event I will get with the sales team to check on any updates or changes, then I will go over the menus with the executive"

good,A typical day at work was supervising over inmates in the PDR. I learned how to handle stressful situations and working with others. Management was well provided and took care of there former employees. Workplace culture is very stressful when trying to keep inmates in line on doing there daily tasks. The hardest part about the job was making sure the inmates were not stealing food and other items out of the kitchen.
good,"A typical work day starts with me posting breakfast then lunch then dinner and any special events. I learned how to take photos and make it look appealing to customers. Management was okay though they seemed to lay off or hire people as often as they can without thinking if they will be a good choice. The hardest part is the hours of taking photos only takes about 5-10 minutes and I got paid hourly, the most enjoyable was connecting with the people who ate at the cafeteria"
good,Travail ou l'on est indépendant.Horaire de bureau du lundi au vendredi.Rencontre avec beaucoup de personnes de plusieurs milieux différents.Bonne entente avec tous les collègues.Point le plus difficile du poste sont les charges parfois un peu lourdes(ex:pour le remplissage des machines à coca et le stationnement chez les clients)

good,"Aramark is a great place to expand your career .   The Chefs are very helpful and always willing​ to teach you. They exemplify great customer service and always check on your performance. Aramark has a great reward system to let you know that they recognize your performance and always appreciate it. They do this by giving you bonus cards where you can shop or dine! I also have found that they are compassionate towards you and will get you to the right sources for help. The only downside I think is the breaks , Winter , Spring, and the long Summer break. They also don't have a retirement plan, so you would have to put your own money aside. Otherwise it's good!"
good,"Before I write my formal review about my experience with this employer, I would like to start by saying that my experience there was very enjoyable. A typical day at work consisted of me making sure customers were pleased and received excellent customer service from myself and others around me. I learned how to boost the morale of my coworkers on days when it was low, because I figured out that when my coworkers can work in an environment that they enjoyed, they worked much quicker and more efficient. Management at this particular employer was very understanding and understood the importance that having happy employees was the recipe for having happy customers as well. The overall culture of the workplace was mixed since there were multiple individuals from all walks of life there but the experience was still enjoyable and I learned a lot. The hardest part of the job was that the raises that we were promised were not given to us within the time frame that we had been promised at the time of hire. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles on customers after talking to them and cheering them up with conversation after they'd initially come in having a bad day."

The hardest part of the job is the hours of standing.  The best part of the job is the employee culture."

good,A typical day at the hospital is very busy and challenging as it is at most other food service locations. During my time here I have learned to take inventory and order food and dry goods for the account. The management is like anywhere else. Some are very good and some are ineffectual. The hardest part of the job here has been opening a new and much larger hospital with a much too small staff. The most enjoyable part of my job here is cooking for the catered events and cooking demos.

The hardest part of the job is being responsible for the work of a co-worker when he/she calls out of work. The enjoyable part of the job is simply being around a great staff who respect and enjoy my hard work and dedication. I've learned that it takes a lot of responsibility, hard work, and dedication for being a supervisor and/or manager.

The pay was good and i always felt privileged to be working for a company with such an established reputation in the world of Sports and particularly the food and beverage industry. Management was fair and problems were usually resolved immediately. They fed you good and even allowed you to take food home . The buildings were run like a well oiled mav=chine. They gave you as many hours as you v=could bare if you proved you were willing to go the extra mile. I have worked 24 straight hours numerous time during the Eagles football season. Everyone seemed to be dedicated some more than others and thats because of management setting the tone. It helped that our manager once worked along side us so he understood our struggles and did whatever was necessary to keep us happy so we worked for him like he worked for us."
good,"Everyday i know i will be treated like a human. Aramark really looks out for it's employees.  The first things I do when i get to work are check the mail, check the bathrooms, turn on the machines, turn on all lights, clean the windows, count the safe, and check the walk-in coolers."
good,"a typical day would be food prep, and also keeping things clean around the kitchen. I have learned a lot about recipes and other cooking essentials. management and co-workers are all easy to get a long with and a lot of fun.

good,"I log in at 6 a.m and start my morning task by logging into CBoard, this is the software we use to enter the patients meals, diets and nurse comments throughout the day.  I enter the number of patient meals for each hospital department and forward this information to the Manager and the guest meals as well.  This is a task I volunteered to be responsible of, in order to assist my Manager with her work load. Starting at 7 a.m we log on the phones and start taking meal orders from the patients, techs or nurses using CBoard.  We also data enter Transportation and Housekeeping calls as well, for this we use Isis software. I am also maintain and created our percentage call board.  Every month I data enter the number of calls and missed calls for each of my associates and I am presented with their call percentages for the month.

good,"As a Starbucks barista I learned so much about work friendships, balancing academics with work, health, and relationships, and customer service.  I think it was a great college job - four days a week I would come in around four p.m. and work until midnight.  After I was promoted to a shift leader at night, I controlled the schedule for the night, set break times and when certain tasks would be completed. The most difficult part of the job was the rush times; there wouldn't be any customers for thirty minutes, then we'd have a rush with a line extending out of the door for an hour. They did make the shifts move faster though. I really enjoyed talking to so many different people; a Starbucks at the university attracted everyone, professors, foreign students, people attending summer camps.  It was really great when I started to have regulars, too."

good,A typical day at work would include myself working at either Burger Studio or Einstein's Bagels. At both of these places I would prepare the food for other students.

Management was very friendly and was able to stay professional and keep the workers in organized schedules. My co-workers were also very friendly which is the best part of the job. 
good,Great Job and people. Wish they didnt have to lay off due to low production.
good,"Working for Aramark while balancing school was a relatively easy process to get accustomed to. I got along well with the management as well as my fellow co-workers, developing a very positive and respectful relationship. I learned that through teamwork, the amount of time it took to do one job could be cut in half when working with others, allowing more time to move onto another assigned task and so on. The hardest part of the job would only be the time of day I would have to come in, that being around closing hours and not getting off until midnight, giving me only a few hours of rest before I had to attend classes in the morning. The most enjoyable part of my job was definitely the feeling I got when I received my paycheck at the end of the week and realizing that, through hard work and determination, I had made my family's life a little easier.  "
good,"A day like any other day at Aramark is to cook, clean, and serve college students. I also did paperwork at the end of the day. I learned how to serve people quickly and efficiently. The management would walk around, and keep their eye out if something was hazardous, or if we were in need of an extra hand. The management kept us on task. My co-workers were generally good workers. The hardest part of the job was when we had new employees coming in during lunch or dinner rushes. The most enjoyable part of this job was that I got to meet new people and became close friends with some."

The company needs to grow and update - systems are antiquated and old and so are some of the people. The good news is that they are bringing on good talent and little by little, things are changing for the better. There are lots of opportunities for this company to get it right in the next five years."

good,"I worked a corporate finance role for Aramark right out of college. If its not at headquarters, I wouldnt work for Aramark. They are too big of a company to really value an individual and there are so many redundancies and things that waste time as a result of being so large. They are by no means a pay leader, and you should take it as a fallback job if you can't get anything else."

It is a fast packet, time conscious type of work environment where precision and being efficient are paramount. Three 20 minute breaks are standard for a 8 hour shift. Overtime is sometimes forced.

good,"The environment was great, the managers always were around to help out and joke a bit to liven the mood from time to time. The work was not hard, but there was always something to do so it taxed you after the shift was over, but not heavily, just enough to tell you that you put in a day's work. As well as working University of Tennessee Knoxville's football games was just as good, if not better seeing the football field from 13 stories up. The biggest thing that I learned from working is that people depend on you at a job and if you do not show up for a valid reason and/or prior notice, you are hurting everyone there."

The hours were great! We worked Mon-Fri 8-2 with holidays off. The work was not hard, and the shifts were short. The only downfall for me was the pay. It was only $9.00. With this pay I was struggling to pay my bills, and that is why I had to leave and find new employment."

Not really any distractions and the work always gets completed. A typical day at work for me is pretty relaxing and fast paced. I've learned to further mentally organize myself as far as physical movements and arrangements/orders of freight. I've learned many safety procedures of the kitchen and how to work with larger groups of people. Management could be a little better do to some issues such as communication, timing and just being prepared but overall there are normally no problems and all work gets completed accordingly. Everyone gets along and if there are any issues they are resolved with proper communication and/or paperwork. The hardest part of the job is getting along with certain inmates and communication but that doesn't really effect me because I have good communication skills and a lot of patience. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I'm helping others and not just making them feel like they're not human or subjected to poor behavior do to the fact they're in a detention center. We all benefit from each other and take care of each other."

good,Miller Market on the WWU campus is an enjoyable place to work for college students! They are extremely considerate of class schedules and scheduling you around your class/study times. The times that they are open is convenient for students who are especially on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule. The co-workers are easy to get along with considering that they are also students who share similar schedules. The student managers are also very friendly but maintain a professional environment which is very comforting for the students. The hardest part about this job is most likely hours. IT is difficult to have more than 15 hours of work because the hours have to be evenly distributed among all of the employees.

As soon as I come in I get assigned which store I will be working in. Once I find out what store I'm working in from one of my supervisors I then go to the Retail Inventory room and get my clipboard with key to store. I then go to the cashiers office to get my money for the day, once I get the money I then make my way to the store I'm assigned to. When I get to the store I set up, clean up, count my money for the cash register, and restock shelves with new merchandise. Then once I'm finished with those tasks I sit back and relax and wait for the gates to open so I can get the to most enjoyable part of my day talking and having conversation with tourist to figure out what they are looking to bring back home to show their wonderful experience at the Braves Stadium. Working with Aramark taught me a lot about customer satisfaction and how to deal with customers who may be intoxicated, angry, happy, challenged, just all kinds of lovely people who just want a good time at the ball park. I really didn't have any hard parts of my job besides when I was too short to reach a shelf by myself. Which most of the time my managers would laugh at me about, it was pretty hilarious. But thats a typical day at Aramark just keeping a smile and making sure all customers are satisfied before they leave."

good,I enjoyed the job but the people and the management were not considerate and helpful at times. It seems they were on a power trip at times.
good,"working concessions is easy but the responsibility for the little pay is not great at all .25 cents more than minimum wage is unacceptable. At the end of the games at times you handle thousands of dollars and are responsible for the money and inventory to match. For that much responsibility the pay should at least be at 2 dollars or 1.50 more. I've worked several jobs in my life so i know The amount of work vs the amount of wages. The salaries paid to workers are NOT realistic salaries for people who pay rent, bills, and a car note. Maybe if you are a Manager But for ordinary workers you will barely get by."

good,"Upper level management constantly watches and hopes you fail, talk about people behind their back and are mean. The pay is really low for the amount of work you have to do and for the treatment. Environment is fast pace. Only way to advance is by being the boss's pet and not by actual work. Only benefit is flexible hours, convenience and the ability to make connections with faculty who can help you get a different job"
good,"Daily food production for service to over 2000 client participants five days a week. Planned financial, production, safety & sanitation procedures and standards to ensure effective operational needs"

good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.
good,fast paced &very physically demanding job. time limited as you are against the clock having to meet deadlines for professional athletes. social abilities are  must!
good,"on your feet, which there is nothing wrong with, 24-7 and constantly doing something. positions i worked were dishwasher,food prep as well as food server."
good,"The upper management is horrible.  The people above me were some of the worst people managers I have ever worked with. This is only at the Quicken Loans arena.  I have worked with other managers at other locations that are professional and know how to handle situations/people way more effectively."
good,good job for someone can undergo difficult work conditions  and work management is the worse when I was there they were rude. I like working for  them because it was easy and  wasn't a lot of pressure through the mangers
good,"When working in the retail area, be prepared to do more than what is required of you. As long as you are working with the right people, you day goes by pretty quickly. It also gives you the opportunity to network with company executives."
good,working in a hospital has many more rules and regulations that one must follow as well as inspections and learning and following all dietary by doctors
good,just working environment wasn't good because of the conditions that I was in at the time I couldn't work in cold weather or hot. I had a great experience
good,"It was a different every time you came to work, people was happy some sad but, overall it turn out to be a good day. With this company it was nice to work for as to getting up every day knowing I could work with nice people."
good,I have learned a lot over the years i have been working at Aramark. i learned if u want something done fast and right just do it yourself. You need to have mangers who care about what is going on in the workplace and not just a pay check. Safety is very important in most workplaces but is not enforced where i work and I cant do much about it. I do enjoy working at Aramark regardless of the bad things that goes on. I recommend any who likes fast jobs this is the job for you.
good,"Management was in transition of being replaced so there was quite a bit of confusion initially. Once things settled out, daily routines became clear. Stocking and inventory wasn't hard to complete and cash transactions were made smoothly. At the cashier position, the hardest part of the job was making sure everything was accounted for and loss prevention. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers."
good,"Ambiente increíble con las compañeras y lo pequeños, traer muy bueno con la jefa, experiencia muy buena y sin duda volvería a repetir."
good,Aramark is a fantastic company that I am proud to work for. They care about their employees and provide many opportunities for advancement. I would work for this company for a lifetime.

good,"Everyday I learned something new, I was blessed to move around between two locations and various positions. I learned a lot. My immediate supervisors were awesome, I loved my co workers. I am friends with them outside of work until this day. The hardest part of this job was the transitions and the constant changes within personnel and management. Overall Aramark is a great company to work for, I enjoyed working for them as a temp and as one of their employees."

good,"Met with lot of interesting people, learned how to be a bar tender."
good,"starting at 3am every morning baking and making sure the coffe stations and baked goods are all ready for that hungry crowd. "
good,"A typical day at work is never easy.  We feed roughly 1100-1400 daily.  Open from 7AM to 12AM the shifts are long and strenuous.  I've learned a lot working here especially with how to manage employees who have no work experience or knowledge in the hospitality field.  That is the hardest part of the job as well as you have to constantly be behind them making sure tasks and production are continuously met.  On the bright side, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with these students through long hours of the day, sometimes to 3AM, and seeing their positive attitude in the wake of the morning hours."
good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.

good,"Aramark is an exceptional company to work for. It's a huge company, so change can be slow, but the people who work here are passionate and great to work with."
good,"I really enjoy working for aramark, have been there 5 years. All the guys I work with are great, but the stress of your job really depends on how good management is. You can have managers who don’t do anything you ask for when they are the only ones who can do it or you can have managers that are on top of their work and have everything done in a timely manner. Overall I really enjoy the work and the friends you make on your route."
good,"it was a great experience, my co workers were wonderful and I enjoy making our guests feel very special on their vacations .  My facilities were top notch to work in and I appreciate that."
good,"This is a very fast paced environment with multiple events being coordinated at the same time.  The Pennsylvania Convention Center is a very large venue requiring logistical savvy.  The only parts of the day that I'd say were ""typical"", are providing outstanding customer service to the large array of clients served.  Each show is a different group with a different attitude, so being a ""people person"" is surely a must.  There are many facets of people to interact with to insure the mutual success of an event a PCC.  Being able to manage relationships and be collaborative are a must.   "
good,"Great place to work if you love sports and entertainment. Executing an extremely tight time fraim to ensure all media press box employees get to eat between quarters. Problem solving on a daily basis, keeping a cheerful confident attitude. Working with a crew ensuring all food safety standards. Keeping a crew motivated and fun while getting the job done."
good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.

good,"Great hours, free food, union, yearly raises, bonus once season ends, a sports fans dream job. Cons: not many opportunities for advancement, some concession managers have their “favorites “ and don’t try to hide it. Only certain employees can have their whole families working there.

good,This was a fast paced environment to work in. Very demanding physically. Union job so you should try not to sick very often. Great benefits though and decent pay.
good,"There is a lack of everything at this job either from management or the employees them selves. Even tho the place is nice and calm to work at the managers don t know what they are doing. The best part of the job is that you get to eat what ever you want, the worst part of the job is where management comes in contact with you and your crew mates. They tell you to do something and about 10 minutes after you finished what they have asked of you to do they just tell you to do the same thing differently, other times they even change what you have to do entirely you either have to put everything that you moved back where it was or somewhere else, but its not over there, once you moved it again they ask you to move the same thing that you moved either before you moved it there or where it was originally its like they don't even know what to do with the whole work place. Its a really good place to work a side from all the management issues."
good,My typical day at work was to show and give my customer lots of love and support when they walk in and out of the cafeteria Also have a smiling face when entering the building.
good,Great place to work. Could use better pay or hours for some though. Love the employees and love the kitchen staff i work with. Everything has been great so far.
good,"I loved working at Aramark. at the time I did for 7 years, the supervisor at that time wasn't  so nice, I am a quiet person  didn't  bother anyone, I did my work, and was always on time, I really  loved working there, hanging  garments and folding at times,  i would like to work  there again. I am a cna now, but I would come back to work  there  if I had a chance to!!!"

good,The job was not the problem but the lack of management is what lead me to leave. I couldn’t continue working in an unprofessional place because I wish to thrive at my current job but I was always a problem.
good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.
good,Great place to work and they really work with you when you need time off for family members. Love seeing the kids faces when they come through my serving line. These two meals may be some of the children's only food for the day. I just love it.

I comply with the food, environment and workplace that enrich and nourish the lives of the public on a daily basic.  Also, this is a privilege and responsibility that I work hard to meet every day!"
good,It was a good work environment.  I washed dishes and cooked and cleaned. I served food to kids and made sure they had enough to eat. Great job i loved having my afternoons and summers off.
good,"Mainly just cashiering and cleaning the work place. Nothing too crazy. Good atmosphere among the workers; should the need arise, hours were easily exchangable."

good,Walk into smelling great food in the mornings as some of the employees are making their way into the building and wanting to stop and get going with their morning so they decide to start it off with a breakfast sandwhich which was highly suggested and a nice orange juice. These were all provided by Aramark and were going to start their daily job off with a healthy breakfast.

good,The typical workday was very relaxed and coordinated. The atmosphere was filled with servant hood and anticipation to complete each assigned duty.  I learned patience and leadership from management as dictation for disciplinary actions in a culture that was segregated and isolated from perspectives of lower management. These positions were occupied with shift leaders .I encountered opposition in my initial transition and I  attempted to implement persuasive strategies that would benefit the overall success of all employees under my supervision as well as management as a whole. Aramark is a company that exhibits diversity and room for advancement dependent upon structural issues based on corporate leadership of franchised contractual agreements. The overall mission of Aramark is available to all employees. The most gratifying experiences was the ability to learn and grow from each owner or corporate based facility.

The job entails transporting food to the other jail downtown twice daily so be prepared to get muscles lifting the cambros off the cart and into the van and off the van and onto the cart! They provide the van to drive. If you don't go to the down town jail, you stay and run the line at the Detention Center. The only time you have to yourself is about 30 minutes between 12:30pm and 1 pm to eat a lunch but it is a working lunch usually because you are doing set up or paperwork for when the inmates come back to the kitchen to prepare the next meal. Shifts start at 8 am and you can start at 9 am or 10 am depending on the schedule and you can work until 7 pm if you do the closiing schedule. You supervise the inmates and keep them on tasks and make sure the food is made properly with the right ingredients and most importantly that enough food is prepared to complete the line and the downtown .

good,Working for Aramark was one of the most interesting times in my life. The job itself was really awesome but the higher ups of the Lake I worked at seemed unsure of how to run a Lake. It almost seemed like they were trying to sabotage us at points. That did make the job hard at times but it was so great being out there that it really was worth it.
good,"I am enjoying working at Aramark@L.I.U. Post.  I arrive early in the morning to make sure everything is running smoothly and all food safety standards are met.  The management team is very supportive and welcomes my suggestions.  The hardest part of my job is really just trying to make sure everything is running in a consistent way with all the employees doing their job.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I have with both the students and my employees. I enjoy the students and try to help them adjust to dorm life and being away from home.  Most of them feel comfortable with me and are not afraid to discuss their food suggestions and needs with me.  I really strive for customer satisfaction. Customer service is very important to me and I go above and beyond to help the students.

good,Enjoyed my time working at Aramark.  Most days I was able to run the business and make daily decisions on my own.  But always had upper management there to back me up if I needed it.
good,"Over view when I work there as a housekeeping manager, I disapproved of the Director and asst. director they did not fallow work standards, when I approached them with a serous problem they never listen or just did not care. they took part in falsifying of documents such as training records and must important payroll. I never took part in that! over all i do think this company is a great company to work for but they should have an easier way to contact higher ups without been singled out transferring them or like in my case laid me off."

good,"Dirigir al personal a cargo sobre actividades a realizar."
good,nice company to work for but their management (which was the same people from the hospital) was to irresponsible with us the valet team. we were neglected most of the time and for that reason some of the co workers did whatever they want creating a bad image for the whole valet team.
good,An okay place to begin but everyone should work toward advancing in life. I would recommend this entry level position to people who do not have families to take care of.

good,I found it to be a very good experience even if it was for a short period of time i was able to work in the different pods/kitchens which were inside and outside of the complex the management and co-workers worked well together so the jobs in hand becomes less harder so for the end of each shift it is like we did not work at all work is never hard if we all work together

good,I really enjoyed Aramark as an employee but my Director was not fair when it came to the female supervisors he only wanted to listen to the ideas of the male supervisors
good,"Aramark is a great company with job security.  Even though they are large, each location is ran like a much smaller company where managers can almost be like friends."
good,The hardest part of the working at Aramark is working with the coworkers because it hard to talk to each other because of different opinion and work styles in the environment.
good,"Good place to work, inconsistent management demands and wants.  Driven by shareholders wants and needs more so than operational demands and needs.  "
good,I was let go based off of he/she say. The manager was rarely present. He let the older employees run him& the work environment. It was super uncomfortable everyday going in not knowing what you’d be accused of next
good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.

The only thing that i dddn't like is the fact that the minority was mostly hispanic including the supervisor so they had their favorites as well.
good,Aramark was a good  company to work for. The job security every year they renewed the contract was nerve wracking because we didn't  know  if we would  keep our jobs. The not knowing was very risky. I worked for them 81/2 years. Aramark  left us and we had to apply for Sodexo who took over the contract.  Different company. Different policies.
good,"Certain management was almost unacceptable! co-workers really make you feel welcomed and necessary in the workday. pretty consistent in usual workday, depending on the position!"

Overall i would say that it has been a satisfactory position teaching me a lot about the service industry while improving my personal skills in helping customers on a day to day basis.

These skills have increased my awareness and ability to work under pressure which has also been implemented into my every day classes.

good,I enjoyed interacting with the customers as well as my co-workers. I was busy most of the time which was great since I like a job where I always have something to do. Learning how to use everything such as the cash register and doing orders was fairly easy and I got the hang of it quickly.
good,I enjoy working with the crew that I assembled and they work very hard for me. We have been through a lot in less than one year. When we took over the account the kitchen was in a very poor state. We have been cleaning forever but it is very clean now for a sixty year old kitchen. The staff had a hard time adjusting as we call for a more in depth food safety program. They have had to over come many trial but are doing a great job. Another hurdle was the retail situation. We had to learn out customer base and adapt our menu to what was wanted by them. This was easier said than done and through committees and suggestion boxes we have over come that trail as well. The easiest part has always been the finances and report out. Things are getting better by the day.

good,Hay muy buen ambiente y joven. Es muy compatible con otras actividades.
good,I only worked for Aramark when I worked in Citifield. I worked almost all positions except the upper management position. But the work ethic for Citifield was a bit off and odd. The people or person that I know that works for Aramark in another field said the benefits and pay is great. It's just the people they work around. That makes things difficult.
good,Must be able move things clean up set up break down with a a smile. Mainly general labor which for most men and women is fine. You do have much to do but time fly when your working.

It feels like home every time I come in for work. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the time and the students at the same time, but the longer i stayed the faster I caught on. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get a compliment on your dish. I like all my hard work to be paid in compliments because it motivates me to stay focus and to become a better chef."

good,I began washing dishes there and moved my way up to Prep Cook . Management was great but company didn't pay well . The most enjoyable part of job was serving the customers . They were great people .
good,Overall great place. I learned a great deal about the uniform business. The management was great but a little misleading in some ways. The hardest part was hearing negativity about the company from employess.
good,"Very fast paced but enjoyable, rewarding experience I’ve met a lot of people that I still consider good friends. Ability for overtime was always there if I needed it along with schedule being very flexible."
good,"Fun and profitable. It delivered what I expected-if the Rockies played all year I would want to stay with them for long term. The only downside was consistency in placement. I was moved to a different spot each game, usually acting as a stand- in for employees with seniority that had called off from a game. Then there were low attendance games-sometimes you were called off by Aramark, but usually they would give you the option of working at a beer stand. The best spots and most profitable were the bars and portable bars."
good,"Experience only in this job,you will work from clock in till clock out with only( 1)30 min break."
good,"This was a very fun place to work at. Consisted of a small amount of workers, Got along well. Stress free environment and also laid back. No managers over your shoulders with whips. Let you do your job in piece and we were always reliable."

We had a true team enviroments and the managment was on point for helping the employees that wanted to grow to high levels
good,"Overall a great place to work. Too bad it's not for the whole year, instead of the school year. Chef has sporadic outbursts that can upset people under him, but he really is harmless. "
good,"Great company out of the five and a half years, really had no major problems. if you go to work do your job you're good. good medical plan, you get vacation pay, holiday pay. they are welling to work with you.

good,"Aramark is a Fortune 500 that exists in college campuses across the United States, their food service, which I worked for during college. The opportunity and experiences were great, but I, unlike every student, didn't go home for the summer. So Aramark's policy is to lay off people for the summer and bring back a handful for summer work, this is slightly nerve wracking because the waiting time can be up to a month to find out if you are getting a callback. This has created numerous problems at this location. As with most large companies, the compensation is variable but fair. "

good,"This is a great place to get your feet wet in the business dining and catering arena. I really enjoyed getting to experience the many facets of what it takes to be an executive chef, catering chef, and line cook. Then there is getting to know the business side of things meeting the prospective clients putting together a contract and watching a catering event evolve to completion."

good,"A standard day of work began with review of the day's listed events, room preparation for those events, supervision of events to make certain the customers are 100% satisfied. After the day's events took place, we would clean each room and reset them for the next day's events. I learned through this process that if the customers are happy, management would be happy with the job we'd done. Co-workers were typically hard workers who understood how to get things done and worked in a friendly manner. People skills is a very important part of that job and any job requiring a direct face to customers and clients. The hardest part of this job was to pick up the slack on lazy team members. The majority of my co-workers were wonderful, but if the schedule required me to work with another member of my team that was not experienced or determined enough, the job of setting/cleaning rooms for events with hundreds of people became even more difficult. The most enjoyable part of this job was making friends with my co-workers and getting to know frequent customers."

I really enjoy my interaction with the students. Sometimes I feel like the mother of thousands. I've learned to be patient because a lot of these people have never been on their own before and they have some crazy questions. The managers sometimes have their hands full and am glad they give me the freedom to make decisions on my own. My co workers often are student workers. And as in any work place  some are better than others. The hardest part of my job is  dealing with students who don't accept the fact their job  is a real job .

good,On a typical day i would load my truck in the morning and go out for deliveries and pick ups. The job was customer service oriented. Making sales is part of the everyday routine. I enjoyed the customer facing aspect and keeping a good rapport with the people on my routes. Something I've taken away from my position there is that the customer is always right. One thing that was difficult was that the prices kept rising for our services and having to tell the customers their bill would go up every few months. My favorite part of my job was the quarterly contests that pushed me to make more sales and compete with my colleagues.

good,"Very easy going working environment,  there are a lot of Pro's to this job and very few Con's as well. Most of the people that I've worked with were friendly and very helpful at teaching me the basics of HR. I'm also a driver to help them in picking up international student employees that come to work for Aramark over the summer. The view of my workplace is amazing every day looking at Lake Powell in the mornings and evenings is something to look forward to. The only major problem of the job is dealing with the heat, I mean it is HOT! If you can get past this then the initial job is easy and worthy of working for Aramark Lake Powell Resorts. Meeting international people and going on trips with them across Arizona is in itself the best part of the job, like visiting the Grand Canyon North and South Rim. Looking at Northern Arizona's wildlife at Bearizona and visiting Monument Valley is the best. All in all, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity that I very much will remember forever. #notgettingpaid #genuineanswer"

Once I learned the purchasing part of the job everything fell into place. The hardest part of the job was keeping the sales department in line, (ie filling out paperwork for products). "
good,"After 2 years of working for Aramark, at two accounts, we again lost the contract to a competitor.  The insecurity of not knowing if your job will be safe is the question.  Contract Dining is a tough line of business to be in. However, when your let go, they will pay severance to managers. This allows you to search for work elsewhere.  There is absolutely no guarantee of you maintaining a job with contract dining."
good,I think it is an excellent company with the possibility of growth and support equality.
good,Very good for you and I think it's important to know what you're doing and how to make it easier for people to be happy with their work and their work and their relationship with others and not just because you are not going through the same process as the others in your career and your experience with them in your own way because they have to make sure that your partner workdoesn't have the same experience with your

The work itself is anything but difficult or frustrating. With this being said, Aramark is by no means a perfect  company.

If you're looking for an easy job with very good pay for a part-time job, look no further than Aramark."
good,"Aramark is fun and great place to b employed if I get a call back after these crisis pass over. I will b happy to return. Aramark provides an excellent team of managers who oversea a great deal of day to day and daily operations, food sales productivity as well as food promotions for a healthy choice of foods and life styles."
good,I appreciate the training program Aramark had for the staff. Structured to meet company's needs. Good benefits for management...Medical leave you get paid 100%..not 60%.

The pay is nonnegotiable, regardless to your experience or education. Some of us are higher educated, some of us have lots of experience in HR... and some of us worked at Walmart, a call center, etc and know nothing about HR but we all make the same. Training is hands on and meetings to cover policy. You have to balance the phone, emails and a case load daily.... it’s a lot but you can manage. This is a call center setting... lots of calls. If you don’t like the phone, don’t apply. Great benefits, but wont pay for HR certification or classes towards it. Will pay for Undergrad and Grsduate degree, no PHD or Executive MBA."

good,A typical day is prepping and preparing to serve about 4500 inmates three meals a day breakfast lunch and dinner from recipe to daily pulls. It was a great place to work at and the staff were great and worked well together. It was very fast past and demanding the hardest part was taking everything I learned and using it as a learning tool to teach others. I think one of the most enjoyable parts of the job we served them holiday meals was the look on the faces of the inmates when we served them and greeted them the look of wow this is like being at home with family. One of the hardest things was seeing so much food going to waste that could be giving to others that are in need of food. The managers worked well with others and were very dependable.

Our management team was very attentive to our needs and listen to different ideas about how to better suit our fans for events and very productive in terms of making things happen. My coworkers there at that time was some of the best people I have ever met in my time of working a job. We kept each other focus and had fun learning a job together. The hardest part I got to say is when the event is over we had to clean up after thousands of people attending a event in the building. My favorite part of my job was putting smiles on people faces at the games. Displaying great customer service to several patrons by greeting them as they walked inside the building for yje scheduled event(s)."

As a cashier I really think it makes you really become a people person if you already aren't. Each customer is the same and very different in many ways. The hardest part might be just dealing with the different attitudes of both the customers, bosses and coworkers but after a while it gets easier I think I mastered it, and I always try and leave someone with a smile on there face."

good,"Great company to work for, very strict rules and a lot of safety meetings. Coworkers and managers were great."
good,My review for Aramark is that I love working there because they are the best company. Job work is great and it is awesome. The hardest part of the job was lot of multitasking and stress. My bosses protect me pretty well which me feel secure and safe. The management at Aramark is wonderful. What I learned about the job is that I can do more and accomplish more so I can learn to grow and be the best I can be and do my best which help me focus. My co-workers are the coolest people who I love which is a plus and somtimes they can be a little nuts. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a good interaction with the customers and co-workers just to make us feel like we are at home. The typical day I like about the job is communication and teamwork.
good,"This job provides me with the flexibility that I need for a pt job.  Although the job is 5 days a week, the hours are not set."
good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.

good,"lugar de trabajo agradable   frupo de compañeros con un mismo objetivo constante capacitacion  premios  un lugar muy agradable "
good,I leaned how the Q handles recycling and composting procedures and what goes on throughout the stadium as a whole.
good,"Aramark give people the opportunity in which they(the worker) and their managers are able to set flexible work schedules. They are a large industry and if one needs to they can be easily transferred to near hospitals(in which they are affiliated of course). Usually work consist of checking in during the determined work schedule, and the occasional restock of supplies. After that one start their job and have a lunch schedule around 12pm. After lunch one work until their shift ends. I learned to be more open with my managers and it has helped me to be more assertive in the work force. My co-workers were top of the notch because Aramark has a strict hiring policy in which they only chose a certain few who are indeed motivated/passionate about their job. This job is mainly direct contact with it's patients and so sometimes there may be some stress, not everyone is always in a ""grand mood"". Over all this job was great and highly recommended for people that are in the need for flexible scheduling, i.e. college students, parents, future medical employee/staff."
good,Although I enjoyed working for Aramark I found that their organisation of both staff and equipment was poor.
good,I enjoyed the opportunities of doing many types of tasks beause we were a small office.  It created an  entrepreneurship atmosphere as we worked as a team not the large company it was. I enjoyed interacting with the customers

good,"buenos bonos "
good,"on a typical everyone works hard and together to get the job done and get the food out to the customers. Since I have been working hear i have learned that you have to work as a team to get things done. the management is very good, they work towards the best for everyone. My co-workers are very friendly and easy to get along with. They are also very hard workers and everyone are able to do their jobs in an orderly fashion way. The hardest part of my job is being the last person to leave at the end of the night. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am going to enjoy myself every time I go in to work."
good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.

good,"Fast paced work environment opportunity to learn different aspects of the business.  Was a great job that gave me a chance to learn front office duties. The only unfortunate thing that happened is that while working for this company my husband was injured extremely bad to the point that we almost lost him.  Thanks to the wonderful doctors at the IMC Hospital and EMS team his life was saved after having right and left side brain surgery.  I wasn't able to continue working at this point as I needed to be with my husband through out his recovery process and is why I haven't had employment for quite some time that as well as I went back to school to study becoming a medical assistant.  Times have started getting rough and I need to work again my husband is doing wonderfully full recovery a miracle and my inspiration to chase my dream of being in the medical field.  I am still attending college but, I'm capable and able to balance work and school. Thank you, Jenny McCleery"
good,"This was my first food service job. I already had kitchen"
good,"Work days include contributing my skills to project execution and opportunities to contribute with strategic thinking and project planning.  Learned team work, collaboration, communications skills and project execution.  Management is encouraged to focus on relationship building and deliverable execution.  Co-workers were friendly and caring.  Changes within the organization were the biggest challenge in the past few months.  Enjoyed contributing my skills to the various teams within the organization and the friendships."
good,I loved this job the management was great good co-workers. It was a good place to work 
good,"As the day starts I would change into my chefs coat and then report to my boss, who would give me a status report about the food that I take to the stand, where I serve it. On a typical Komets game night I would serve pulled pork and pulled chicken products to over a thousand people. I would do this until the beginning of the last period where I would have to break down my food area and clean it. Then I would go down to the dish room and help the other dishwashers to finish the dishes. "
good,"At Aramark, I worked independently and made time to innovate new procedures for my peers. I learned all aspects of monitoring systems and applications in a Data Center. The management was always fair and encouraged us to further our knowledge in all aspects of the IT field. My co-workers were always coming together to share information about the job to better the groups knowledge base. The hardest part of my job was working the third shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people that I have known for years which created a sense of family."
good,"I have worked with this company for 3 years and would give it a 9/10 rating. Great people, great environment, decent benefits. Promotions seem to be biased and based more on who you know than how skilled you are for the position. Other than that it is a good place. Yearly raises are not the greatest either."
good,"On a daily basis we served over 900 students for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Constantly busy. Hands on food preparation which I did not get experience from years ago at a supermarket deli. My bosses were rough and tough but if you did your job right there was never a problem. Safety and proper food handling were top issues in our kitchen."
good,"I have nothing but great things to say about Aramark especially Healthcare. From the top leaders to my direct managers, the core values of this company run parallel to my own."
good,I learned alot of things working for Aramark. It has really given me a basis on how a business operates and I am ready to put these skills to work in my next career.

good,This company was one of my best jobs.
good,"This job was an fast pace job, you couldnt be late, you had to be focus and pay attention or youll miss up the cycle. I learn to work at an very fast pace, how to operate multiple machinery. The hardest part was working under different conditions where there would be dusty and in the winter it would be very cold cause air would blow through the dock and employees had to wear coveralls, but after while you get use to it. The enjoyable part of this job was the cookout they give every spring and summer, 25 card giveaway every month, good vacation and salary"
good,Our typical day at work would be to work fast. I've learned to have all my work done before the end of the day so other areas of the hospital can be cleaned. My manager was very keen and very watchful of all the co-workers. The hardest part was not having enough time to enjoy our lunch or our breaks. I really enjoyed working with different people.
good,"I love my job it always keeps me on my toes. The weather could be cold and raining or hot and sunny, or the staff might or might not show up, I could get 5 coustomer complaints or 20 complaiments, I might get everything I ordered or nothing even close from warehouse, and I might have everything still there from the night before or missing a peanut or two or even a pretzel machine. Whatever the challenge or no challenge my job keeps me on my toes and I never know what to excect, and I love it for it."
good,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.
good,"A typical day at work for me is to come and and run reports for the previous daily production, complete manager reports, data entry of all time sheets from the employees, fix errors, data entry of errors from the previous day, open and distribute mail, data entry of all incoming invoices, manage spreadsheets for invoices, and help in various departments to complete an 8-10 hour day."

good,My day starts off at 6:45. I gather the items that are needed to set up the coffee or waffe station I write on the windows. Log into the register get ready to greet the students. That young people need LOVE and they just like older people need a ear to hear and someone that will listen. The management work with the employees. My co-workers were fun and when it came time to working the job was accomplished. The hardest par for me is seeinig the students go and remebering the good days we had at the dining hall. The most enjoyable time was teasing them and letting them know that ROME was notbuilt in a day. That they can pick themselves up and start all over again.
good,I learned I can take on challenges that I never knew I could. I learned that I can work under extremely strict deadlines and handle pressure.

good,"Working at this place was amazing my first day in i started off a as cook within 2 weeks i was promoted to a supervisor.  The coworkers actually became family and we worked so well together without any issues.  We had karaoke moments (not in the policy) but we would sing together to make the day progress and sometime the customers would join in as well ,  I miss those days no day was a bad day in my eyes and if it was we found a solution to the issue and got over it .  The only downfall of the job is that it is a seasonal position operating on a college campus ( you do have the option to file for unemployment ) but overall I will recommend this job to anyone   be prepared to work at all times it does get extremely busy"

Pero me sirvió para aprender bien este trabajo porque tuve que pasar por los distintos cursos de infantil y de primario, así pues estuve en contacto con niños de todas las edades."
good,"It is a rather easy place of work. When you we go in, our job for the day is written out. The co-works are easy to converse with, although depending on whom difficult to understand. As soon as the line begins, everything moves quickly. The manager is on the move doing what he has to do. People on the line assembling and placing things in to position, while the truck runners makes sure nothing stops them and bring the trucks to the units."
good,"I worked for Aramark Uniform Services and was brought there by a staffing agency. I did not realize before working here that I could honestly say I enjoy what I do, but this place blew me away. They have reasonable daily quotas to meet and provide a large wealth of resources, accommodations, and assistance daily. There are many positions and groups so the company is good at helping you find the best fit for you. They also do a lot of internal hiring so there is opportunity to move forward in the business. However this review does need to bring up some cons for those reading. The starting amount is quite low and several employees have to work other jobs to keep a good income for their families. There are stressful times where the quotas are taken more seriously, especially toward the end of the fiscal month. There is also sometimes frustration in the sense that, since you work different tasks and do different things, you could be doing your job spectacularly and you as a group may still show poor numbers due to other areas of the company struggling. All in all, though, the pros massively outweigh the cons, and my biggest regret is that I had to leave this company. Aramark Uniform Services is a great place to work, and I will always cherish my time there!"

good,In my perspective I will arrive to work motivated to accomplish my goals. I would go over the limits to meet the needs of the customers. My supervisors would check on us to see if we are doing our job. We work as a team to get things done on time. The hardest part of my job is standing up all day. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people. Networking and getting to know nice people.

good,a typical day at delta and united airlines during the day is just plain busy. Just trying to keep up with an average flight and make sure that there is nothing in the way to have a delay. is just busy. what i learned is how to clean a plane within a 20 min window of the plane dropping off and the filling back up for a turn around flight. management i would say is the same anywhere but its just a lot more on your bosses plate because this is a multimillion dollar company that makes the word go round day in and day out. so the stress level is defiantly there for the managers. the goal for that is to just make sure you don't mess up. the hardest part of working at an airport is that sometimes planes are just a total disaster and sometimes 20 min is just not enough time to clean the plane. the enjoyable part of working for delta and united is at night when the airport is closed and u don't have to rush to clean the plane everything has a nice flow and its consistent and also looking at the runway all lit up at night. sometimes its just the little things that get you threw the night.

The staff became my family almost overnight, literally, sometimes we would work till 2 am but it was always fun. If you do not like getting dirty, this job is not for you! You get covered in food, drink, sweat, etc. I know this sounds bad but every worker is in the same boat and so you are all a unit. Usually after events such as weddings or ceremonies, once the event was over, we would get to eat the food and sit with our coworkers before cleaning up.

By the end of the day, I would do the same but backwards.. Management handled their responsibilities very well, which made it easy for me to handle mine as an employee. Coworkers worked well together, and we all assured we were on the same page before the store opened eac morning.

On a typical day , prep & serve lunch for hundreds of school kids..I learned how to operate in a fast paced environment while maintaining a standard of quality for a large number of people. end of day i travel back to my home school location to help with the cleanup of our own facility in addition to cleaning the trays for the entire district. also participate in the catering of school functions for the district. hardest part of the job is keeping pace with backroom while we are understaffed due to call-ins or time off. most enjoyable part of the job is getting it done...completed despite any obstacles,suprises or speedbumps."

Challenging at times, Especially play off's for NFL Football, NBA Basketball and NHL Hockey that Literally Shook The SKY with excitement like NOTHING else I've ever experienced in my Life. TBH there was an extreme amount of Supervisors, because of the size of the venues and events, sometimes not being treated fairly out of Control Issues and Authority Roles taken to the EXTREME, but there's always 1 SUIT that uses their Authority Overboard, Otherwise GREAT FUN WORK ENVIRONMENT. Memorable FOREVER. There were difficult times with unfairness with Co Workers that were Greedy,stealing Tips that were meant to be Split and shared evenly,having to contend with Suck Up Types that were Obviously Favored and Teachers Pet's Type,but if Nothing Else, it teaches you how to be TOLERANT when THING'S are not right, but instead, Learning how to Grin and Bare it and to be Grateful for Everything you have as apposed to getting caught up with Work Drama because Unfortunately, THAT'S LIFE."

good,".  An ARAMARK employee is able to remain on his/her child or children's schedule.  It gives the employee  extensive experience in the food service industry. It teaches the employee how to provide a healthy meal for  both the students and your own family.  Training is ample.  Very little expense in incurred on the employee, such as the cost of clearances and uniform.  It is a very busy environment, which makes the time go by faster.  Management is fair. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up to the busy pace.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me  would be the hopefully camaraderie between the coworkers and seeing familiar student faces."

good,"My overall experience was so fun. Every night was different and I loved it because I worked with some hard working people and we got the job done with laughs, cry’s and joys."
good,"Managers are genuinely good people that actually care about you. They also tend to hire like minded hard working individuals with good attitudes. Although at times the work could be overwhelming, its not always consistent. As a part time worker, you could be scheduled for 45hrs one week and 12hrs the next. Mainly because the work is event based, but regardless its still work that you get paid for. As long as you do what you're told to do and make friends along the way, there's nothing to worry about. If you're scheduled for a 12hr shift with a friend it tends to feel like a 3hr shift regardless of the workload put upon you. My advice would be to just be friendly and ask questions if you don't know something and always be as reliable as you possibly can ie; showing up on time and covering unexpected shifts."

good,"Coming in every afternoon starts out with tedious work. Preparing food with a hundred or more required preps and stocking boxes thirty or more. When working in the kitchen prepare to sweat as well as get dirty. Everything is on a timely manner so 15 mins til at the latest prep has to be finished and already displayed. Sometimes, yes, it gets out of hand like if you over cook something and have to start over, but the key thing is to stay self motivated because how you feel shows in your work. Everythings typical independent unless help is needed so employees rarely get in the way. Cleaning after people is always the hardest but you get use to it.

good,"Yes, when you go home after a day of work after a football game at the stadium you may want to cry because your body is aching. The days are long and you many not even get home until the next day. On the other hand, while at work, I love the environment because I love to be around people and put smiles on their faces. Knowing that I did something to make someone's day, even if it is just sweeping up pop corn that they may have accidentally dropped or just saying excuse me, because I was in their way. It gets tiring and  you may even want to give up , but getting the job done is very important and it can be really fun; joking around with co-workers, but still being able to do your job affectiveley. Consequently, supervisors push us to do our job indefinetely and wen they tell you that you are doing a good job, or that they have been watching you and want you to work more jobs because of the exceptional work you have done, it just makes you feel really good inside."
good,We basically start taking orders 45 minutes before the game and we stop at the bottom of the 7th inning. I delivered food to the customers and made sure all their food was good and that they had anything else they might need. I also answered questions regarding getting around the stadium and about food allergies. My coworkers are awesome. Very friendly and supportive. The hardest part of my job would be walking up the steps back and forth because it tends to make my knees hurt by the time I get home. The best part of my job is watching the players and seeing the smiles on the fans faces when they've received great customer service and are satisfied with their food.

My management were supportive and help faith in me to complete all tasks necessary. My co-workers and I shared a joint respect and admiration towards each other, in knowing we relied on each other to complete a repair. The hardest part of the job would be working with the fire marshals and health inspectors right before an event when internal employees also needed my assistance, however, that helped me to enhance my multi tasking skills. The most enjoyable part of the job would be knowing the job is completed and all employees are fully equipped to do their job throughout the evening. Knowing that the event audience enjoyed their evening and ensuring they will return by the smile on their faces."

Once the day is done we clean up the workplace and have everything organized and ready for the next day. One of the many things i learned in Aramark was how to operate a electric power jack and entering data on the computer. Management is very strict and professional, they always keep us posted with what's their goal for progress and advancement for the workplace. Co-workers and I always work together as a team, we help each other get the job done. The hardest part of the job would be when two rival teams play each other, that's when it's mostly busy and difficult to even catch a lunch break for moving around so much.

good,"I was expected to do a routine cleaning, then at dinner time I was the person who served the patients. Also if there was anyone who needed extra or who did receive their dinner tray I was responsible for preparing and serving them their meal. My co-workers were helpful and we all worked together to get things finished right. The hardest part of the job I'd have to say is when patients or hospital employees get frustrated with you and again unfortunately being just a food service workers there isn't much I can do to make them feel better about their situation. The most enjoyable part of that job is seeing someone obviously not having a great time (because they're in the hospital) yet you can put a smile on their face or make them laugh, it's so small and simple but it feels really great."

The person who was in charge of training me when I first started went above and beyond to help me. Sometimes she came to the workplace to check on me and she even stepped in to help me, regardless of whether she got paid or not. My supervisor was extremely helpful as well, as she modified my schedule according to my needs. I'm a college student and they really worked with me. They are very flexible and they respect the fact that you are bearing other important responsibilities."

The hardest part of my job is when I can't have cooperation from others that will help me to complete my task at that moment. Its very frustrating when I can't finish or start a job because someone will not help me with their cooperation. One of the most rewarding thing of my job is, when I have completed a job and I look back at it and see the completed task and how good it looks.When I get great reviews from staff and my supervisors then I know my job was successful. Its a great feeling."
