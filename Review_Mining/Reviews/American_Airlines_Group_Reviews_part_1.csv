rating,review
bad,"If you're young and just starting out, you might like this, but starting a career late in life, do not apply here. You'll not advance quickly at all, and always be reminded you're a new hire..."
bad,They fire people left and right they dont care for anyone but themselves you get written up for using your sick time... You kill yourself doing OT and they tax it right out so you do all that for nothing
bad,"Work for any other airline in the industry before working for AA.  The company's performance in recent years is laughable when compared to Delta, Southwest and United."
bad,"They fire people constantly, they dont care for their employees, you get written up for using your sick time, you wont make no money until your 5th year"
bad,"American Airlines has been mismanaged for decades.  The company has an enormous debt...compared to competitors...and continues to underfund pension plans."
bad,"This review is for the Las Vegas location."
bad,"The worst airline position ever. Employees don't care. Employees are lazy, complain and over all the company  has a bad culture. Leadership does little to correct it and keeps the dung going."
bad,"Poor"
bad,"After the merger with us airways, American Airlines became the worst working environment. No ethics or moral. No appreciation for quality work or loyalty."
bad,didnt pay me for an entire month due to new payroll system then failed to have any empathy when I didnt ave money for gas and couldnt pay my rent. Gave me target gift cards to compensate
bad,There is really nothing good to say about American Airline since they merged with US Air.  They have take away most of the benefits and increased the work load.
bad,"The management is abysmal, The environment stressful, the GM's way of getting people to do their job is to walking yelling and screaming, and threatening to fire people. Management plays favorites with certain people, and will do ""surprise"" drug tests on people they do not like. Management does not furnish proper facilities for break-rooms, water, or PPE (Personal Protection Equipment)."
bad,"Let's start with the station manager. In one year I've only seen him in person a handful of times. He is rarely present in anything. Applies temporary fixes to anything but doesn't implement anything to completely solve the problem. Acts like your friend. Supports racism."
bad,"The only thing management cares about is improving the bottom line so their bonus is bigger. Regular employees bonus is about half of one paycheck.  It's so small its more of a slap in the face when other managers and higher lever employees get 30-40k in bonuses. "
bad,"If you are a young person, I would advise you not to work here, Southwest airlines is the only company that truly takes care of its people.  Machines are replacing people very quickly, and the replacement employees are paid 11.00 dollars an hour."
bad,poor management and too much racism. i don't like the way things go in the office and i want work and gain more experience to be productive in the company.
bad,Management will say they care about the workers but they don't!  They talk a good game but their actions speak volumes in the opposite direction.  Glad I left!
bad,"I had worked for American Airlines for about 4 and half years. When I first started as a contractor, it was a fairly relaxed and had a good work/life balance environment. However, after I converted to a permanent full time employee this changed to where I was working a lot of time after hours. Management at American Airlines can be difficult and if your not one of the ""good guys"" they will find an exit for you."
bad,"Unfortunately, Amer Air lacks the ability to consider the value of their employees, and instead sees them only as faceless paychecks. While the flight benefits are appealing, the opportunity to use them is minimal and at times more costly and not worth the sacrifice of the wages that could be earned in lieu of said flight benefits."
bad,I just didn't like working there. They were prejudice to my race along with my age and didn't feel like they wanted to take the time and be patient and teach me the job
bad,You work like a slave for little to no pay because they deduct for everything. you show your best and get thrown to the dogs alive to die. They bully their employees and the management show stay where they came from the ramp and not interact with people because they have no people skills. they are unfair and ruthless.
bad,"I hated this job, it was the worst job from management to customer. If you want to hate life work for an airline. If you work hard you will go unnoticed and even could get in trouble for doing to much."
bad,company wants to cut benefits and jobs for my work group. Will fire you for petty stuff but not for major safety violations or hurting someone else while on your phone.
bad,"It depends on the station that you work. I worked in Dallas, Dc before. It was pretty good, but Houston Management is unbearable and so weak!"
bad,"The company allows crazed management to run their stations!  HR knew of issues and refused to get involved in situations.  Thusly, I took a buy out package."
bad,Workplace filled with fear on a daily basis to perform. Management not allowed to express opinions or give advice for fear of losing your job. Managers treated unfairly and underpaid in most instances. Union driven atmosphere so company tailors to union however treats management team poorly.
bad,"Not as glamorous as you would think. This is a difficult industry to work in only because they suck, and don't know how to adequately run an aviation company. Unless you are considered management, you will work every single holiday, weekend, and night shift, and chaining you to a desk against your will is totally legal with this company. Again, unless your considered management, you will be lucky to make anything near or above $30K."
bad,"Was brought in to assist with the US/AA merger, and then laid off weeks into assisting. Horrible company to work for or do business with. Horrible Managers. I know more than most of the Management and trainers, and they could have benefited from my help--however they weren't competent enough to realize that. SO, I went and worked for a competitor who actually knows how to be a real airline."
bad,"management wont listen, company not organized in my opinion, needs better structure, micromanaged. I cant wait to leave for a more structure company..."
bad,Management is lacking in the skills necessary to manage and IT department. They didn't understand the systems or the processes necessary to achieve the goals and objectives of the company.
bad,"If you ever think you might want a job at American Airlines, think again and then run away.  Run away as fast as you can.  This airline is not called the ""Sky Naziis"" by accident."
bad,It is a divided and racist culture at American Airlines. When you meet most of the people it is as though there are still 2 airlines fighting from within against each other. You are constantly caught in the US Airway/AA tug of war and the US Airway folks behave like wild animals who were kept away from civilization until recently. The management does absolutely NOTHING to alleviate the tension and drama except pick on and target minority workers who do their jobs better than their non-minority counterparts. If I were given 100 bonuses I would not return nor work there.
bad,"It was a fun working place. I enjoyed the most of helping customers"
bad,"Useless company to work for with a lot of physical work, the work environment was stressful. Long working hours with no bonus.."
bad,"you are brought in under the impression that you are servicing the customers and all of your reviews are based on how many mbrs you can force into applying for the Citi bank credit card. They have NO respect for, or understanding of ppl and their lives, I have watched great ppl be walked out of the door(one girl because she was in the hospital with pneumonia and God forbid you be near death during your probation, you had better crawl your way into the call center, and others because though they were excelling at all other levels, were not great at selling the credit card, which is NOT a part of the job description). My immediate supervisor is awesome, but upper management is completely out of touch with reality."
bad,"This job requires a lot of patience and very stressful, amazing co-workers who are all overworked and underpaid.  Management could use a lesson on building relationships with their employees as well as boasting morale."
bad,"The best part of working for an airline is the travel benefits."
bad,"Attendance policy is horrific, since recent merger no one knows anything. Customers are rude all the time no pay raises"
bad,"Poca calidad de vida por horarios que se manejan ademas de personal encargado, salario muy bajo,no se respeta el escalaf√≥n, distancias mucho muy largas"
bad,"This was a lot of fun working on the airport ramp, laughing and talking with co worker. I learn how our bag go through the system and meets us in the other cities. They are so much fun working together to get the plane out on time and having fun doing this. The heat and it so hot you could fried a egg on the ramp. The most enjoyable backing the plane off the gate with wands or flashlights at night."
bad,bad pay no benefits required overtime on vacation time bad/poor management
bad,"Would enjoy working with others and to complete all assigned duties."
bad,very easy going job i inspect planes before they go out on there flight
bad,"My work shift would start with receiving of work packages and who I might work with on jobs issued, Management seemed to be knowledgeable for the most part,but seemed more concerned with quality rather that quality. My co-workers were very helpful and willing to participate as needed a very good team concept,Hardest part was the cut in wages, benefits, and jobs, the best part was the work I enjoy very much working on the aircraft, and solving problems."
bad,AA could survive if they get new management. The current CEO has mismanaged the company and left it broke.
bad,Bring your own water and keep it icy
bad,"Benefits are good, but work environment is difficult.  The best part about the job is being able to learn so much about the industry as a whole.  Everyday is a new challenge and everyday will be different."
bad,"American Airlines is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. They expect you to be at their beck and call and work any and all hours needed while being paid literally less than a McDonald's cashier! Management couldn't care less about you as a person. Only time you'll see them is when they come to yell at you about something stupid like having pens on the counter or having your drink in view of customers (even though you're standing on your feet for 10+ hours a day!)Your paycheck is guaranteed to be wrong every pay period. You have to send in a dispute if your check is wrong and once they fix it, you'll get an adjustment check about a week later. This place is a joke."
bad,Was always a dream job.  The operation and management and morale went downhill drastically especially after the merger.  Managers and the higher ups completely out of touch with customer service and quality onboard service.  This sad airline is a ship lost at sea.  This company is not listening to employees let alone customers
bad,"The management and supervisors were under the impression that nothing else mattered in your life but American. They'd tell you numerous times that you CAN NOT have another job while working there, because you are to be available to THEM at all times. They'd rarely even offer full time positions. They'd continue to hire part time positions, and mandate people to stay due to their lack of correct scheduling. It is cheaper for the company to hire part time workers to save on benefits and salary, that they would legally be required to provide to full time workers. So....hire part time....and MAKE them stay over. They would make the part time workers...work 5 days a week...for 4 hours minimum at a time. Never in my life had a seen a part time job expect you to work 5 days a week. Wasting time and gas daily. It works for them They gossiped nonstop about each other. They were the most unorganized organization that I had ever worked for. The attitudes from supervisors when you can't help them...is something that I would never expect from the biggest companies in the world. They have more people that quit due to unprofessional ism...lack of communication...lack of knowledge. The union is constantly being held over your head. I have so much more to say....but the bottom line is....management and supervisors needed to do better with leading....not adding to the stress. I had to leave the company...because the promises or work/life balance was null and void there."
bad,"Productive work , enjoyed working outdoors,  flexible work ,free flights, did not like biding for work schedule and biding for vacation time off poor mgmt."
bad,"I had worked in reservations for a few years, left on good terms and then came back. I was trained and was about 11 months into a great position and then laid off with no reasoning. I was told I was rehire-able and now I'm being told that I'm not, without any reason as to why.  Even though they have open positions in different departments. I will NEVER suggest this company to ANYONE. They do NOT care about their employee's, you're just a number."
bad,"You get verbally abused by passengers calling in when issues come up and sometimes harrassed by some managers if things don't go the way they want.  There's also an occurrence system where if you call out sick or anything else, you get flagged for it."
bad,"Treated employees as disposable drones. Pay and benefits routinely and continually cut, while perks for senior executives increased at incredible rates."
bad,"Let me tell you... It was pretty mellow work. Nothing to intense. However, some folks just do not know how to mind their business... Be careful with the people around. "
bad,"I was extremely disappointed in the lack of leaders and the overflow of management in this organization. It was said in an open form in front of employees the following statement ......"
bad,"Horrible place to work,  under staffed, poor management, compensation doesn't reflect the level of work and stress you'll physically and mentally endure. Management from all levels are clueless and inexperienced about job functions and policies they try to implement."
bad,If you go to American Mainline company you will be better off than working for one of its regional groups. You're overworked and underpaid. Upper management doesn't seem to care about the little people that work so hard for them.
bad,"Very poor upper management, upper management and local management very disconnected from their employees, they compare now days operations to the old days which was completely different, always you hear the sentence of ""back in my days when I was in your roll"" ... I would not recommend AA at all. If they accused you off something they won't give you the chance to prove their opposite. It is about who you know."
bad,"The management at this company is poor, they don't know how to be fair and consistant with their workers. They play games with your hours and you never keep the same hours nor same job."
bad,It is a shame that with an aging workforce that American has turned to a management by intimidation attitude . The rewarding part is that you work with alot of great people . Top tier management has lost touch with the customer service and their employees . It was very disheartening to see how many passengers and baggage that gets left behind on a daily basis . The merger with US Airways was more like a hostile takeover . It is tragic what has happened to a once great and proud airline .
bad,No advancement and management it not experienced.  HR is always on side of management and not on side of employee.
bad,"Management in Cary NC calling center is the most awful people u never want to deal with. I meant one manager in charge for Chinese speaker agent , she is from hell. The job trainers intend to confuse u make u fail. "
bad,Many complains for discriminations. The management in Cary NC location is the most ugly people u ever know. Just be aware. Be careful. 
bad,you have less than 1 star to rate AA. Wish you had zeros. This company sucks.
bad,looking for an employer with an exciting culture.Working for American at one Point was very exciting. But the Compay lacks values and culture and needs to refine its employee and management relationship.
bad,"If you want to live off of someone else‚Äôs time and don‚Äôt mind waking up to a phone call at 2 am telling you you have to be at the airport by 5am to go on a rough trip for 4 days, then this is the job for you! If you want to get penalized for calling in sick, then this is also the job for you. Oh, and if you love to hear coworkers complain all day about how much they hate the company... then THIS is the place for you!!"
bad,"In this specific department it goes from bad to worse, they don't pay you anything $16 an hour, if you ask for a salary increase they tell you that that's why you have the flight benefits. With that I cannot pay the rent, do groceries, buy clothes, and if you have children, forget it. If you complain to your supervisor, if you don't get along with a supervisor just for personal reasons, that will be your end with them, even if you do your job well they take everything personal and make your life impossible until you quit or get fired for anything."
bad,"The managers and supervisors nit pick on the workers all the time (mostly on the new hires), and never praise for the great and long work that you‚Äôre doing.  You‚Äôre almost always forced to stay overtime due to flight delays or short staffed.  And your work shift will always change every 2 months and be bid by seniority.  You may work 5am one month, then 5pm the next month. You get to fly free but good luck with that because the flights are always overbooked and the waitlists to fly is always long."
bad,This company does not care about its employees or work environment. They treat employees horribly and it‚Äôs a terrible place to work. Avoid at all costs.
bad,They hire trash so you have to put up with people not showing up to there flight or just don't want to do anything and you have to be a certain color to get any kind of anything there. Just imagine your excited your ready to work and you have two scrum bags that don't want to load bags and Don want to push plane out so it falls on you. Horrible experience just horrible
bad,"Very stressful atmosphere in my department, which was aircraft records. Management is just awful. The most enjoyable part about my job at AA was the free flights, which I could never get on due to NON-REV status."
bad,"The worst employer I ever had. I hale such high hopes coming to work there. T"
bad,Very good company to work for. Benefits are excellent. I really loved the people that I work with daily. Attained my knowledge and skills in the information technology world through American Airlines.
bad,Management is only worried about numbers and does not care about the employees that make the airline run. Some good benefits but compensation is not the best.
bad,"Supervisor power trip they never have anything good to say to you, once month meetings they pointed how bad you did .. how u need get better than they threat you to fire you."
bad,"I hired on at AA working in Supply for $6.05 hourly ( less than the building cleaners ) and everything went downhill from there. In my first month,I brought to my crew chief's attention that there was a discrepancy on the paperwork for some incoming parts,and this fool told me to process them anyway. This was a clear violation of FAA regulations. I later transferred to working in one of the maintenance hangars. There I witnessed a manager berating a mechanic for finding a potential safety of flight issue when the aircraft had only come in for cabin upgrades. He said,and I quote, "" keep that xxx off my airplane."" I suppose that as long as the aircraft leaves on time, safety doesn't matter. The ""culture"" at aa has degenerated to a low that Washington d.c. would find admirable. The crew chiefs are generally half- witted management wannabes who all seem to think every employee was created for their express benefit. Management is rewarded with excessive bonuses for reasons np intelligent human can understand. Idiotic ideas are the order of the day. And wading through this morass of stupidity is the union,lying and deceiving the membership with the standard answer "" The company can do that,brother."" I'm thankful to God every day for so much,but especially that I retired from that collection of self-serving,duplicitous demagogues and morons."
bad,"no idea how to run an IT shop"
bad,"Too heavily into favoritism from upper management, and employees.  "
bad,"Culture is declining, morale is in the tank, no vision is being shared by managers there is no internal advancement above a level 4. Internal job postings are for specific friends or already identified people. You have to know someone to move up or outside your group. There are over a 100 applicants for each open position and 99 folks won't get a chance to interview."
bad,very stressfull because we are cross trained. we work in side and out. i would prefer to do customer service only. not work on the ramp. i was hired in 2016 i was told we were going to divided and not be cross trained. in the year of 2018 we are still cross trained.
bad,"A very unprofessional work place to employed at. Alot of special treatment to a certain race mainly spanish. They look out for there own and only them but treats the blacks like trash, try to take our voice from us."
bad,"Company is massive, cultures are destructive. Organization lead by fear, managers are treated poorly, no support. Targeting happening within, very divisive organization."
bad,"not a good place to work if you don't want to move up in a company and management is not good as well. flying for free is cool, but you cant go anywhere in this job. getting your schedule then management changing it and not telling you that they changed it."
bad,"Worst company to work for in technology sector as they use outdated technology and have no funding to upgrade it."
bad,It was an okay company but not one that I would like to work in permanently. Other people worked there a long time. I don't have much else to add.
bad,The customers are the greatest in the world to work with. In every person I came into contact with was able to learn more and more about the wants and need of a person.
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs ever held. Management is misplaced, then misleads subordinare. Wants more hours per day regardless if there is work or not, than average work day"
bad,The morale of other employees is very low due to management being very ungrateful and not family oriented and also being crisis management by waiting too long to solve a personnel problem.
bad,"This company goes through the most changes out of all airlines that are major. They are full excuses and do not care about their employees to save their lives. They have the tendency of hiring the wrong people to manage the company. This company could use a new team, such as CEO, CFO, ‚Ä¶."
bad,"management continually attempts to terminate employees by using harassment, confrontational and fictitious tactics.   I stayed my 20 years to get retirement, but at the end superiors and union officials would charge employees with charges that never even happened.  If personal notified HR about problems, HR would turn and charge employees with accusations and warn of termination if the employee attempted to go further on charging management with any wrong doing.  If you wish to work there, keep you mouth shut, do not talk with management, do not complain or make suggestions, and be prepared to work in a racially biased environment."
bad,"the cutltue there has and never will change as long as the current management team and style is in place. if you brought your boss donuts and coffee or went to the smoke box with him on a regular basis, you were fine. incompentence was highly rewarded, there was no leadership at all."
bad,The union on the property basically operates the company and allows many to be employed that should have been shown the door years prior - work is optional.
bad,"The last 5 years were miserable, the pay was bad, the treatment of the employees was unfair and unjust. No matter how hard you worked it was never enough, they were harsh and abusive. I had things thrown at me, I was cursed at and verbally abused on a dailey basis. It is no wonder they make no money because they have no respect for anyone."
bad,"People are not empowered"
bad,"Managers just want to show how big their egos are. Nothing positive about working with ANY manager through the global organization. There is no coaching or counseling and if you make a mistake... too bad, you‚Äôre fired without reasonable cause."
bad,"Morale is low, management doesn‚Äôt care at all for employees, no direction from upper management, and the unions aren‚Äôt worth much. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend working for this visionless and sinking company."
bad,"Employees in lower management levels are expected to do numerous duties that truly belong to upper management levels, in addition to their daily work and responsibilities."
bad,"Management says they want to improve corporate culture but they actually make it worse over time. They have an adversarial relationship with the work groups. They treat employees terribly. Compensation and work rules are some of the worst in the industry. Management seems top heavy, unwilling to make changes, focused on executive compensation and not much else."
bad,"The pay is lower than industry average. Little direction. Company vision changes every year.  Long hours. Lack of appreciation.  Very cut throat. Lack of incentives. Good environment if you are single or a newlywed and take advantage of flight benefits.  Not very family friendly.  Work life balance is non-existent."
bad,"Ok place to work, too many coworkers to know everyone, poor management being involved with agent work , crazy work schedules that you get the last pick of, when you're a new worker for AA."
bad,"The team I was on never used any project management practices and did not document anything. No note taking, no risk and issue tracking. The manager used public humiliation to embarrass team members. Most of the work was accomplished by a few people while the majority of the team spent the days playing games on their phones or surfing the web."
bad,"If you are young and have a masters degree from a top school then they will treat you like gold. If you have been a loyal and hard working employee then forget it! There is no effort to retain talent or assistance to help you grow and move up. So if you are looking for a long term job go elsewhere. If you are looking for something that looks good on your resume then this is definitely the place for you. There is no value placed on experience or tenure here even if you are hard working and consistently out perform your peers. The benefits are a shell of what they used to be. Flights are great but only if you can get on. Medical is good but not great and it is priced competitively with insurance you can get anywhere else. Lastly, the culture is very inconsistent depending on the department you are in. Some departments are amazing and others...not so much. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they do not believe in flexible work arrangements such as work from home or less days with longer hours."
bad,"Going out of business, company slowly moving this work to outside workforce. Local manager cannot lead nor did lead this work to success; many employees lost their jobs because of this."
bad,"The environment is based upon a series of micromanaged statistics and criteria that if not met on a daily basis will lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Every call is potentially screened. The hardest part is providing the callers with the policies and procedures that are blatantly designed to squeeze as much money out of someone with no regard to ethical business practices, or care and understanding of basic human needs."
bad,"I tried very hard to maintain that "" I work for American appearance of happiness""."
bad,"The new management is the worst group of people I ever worked for.We went to Capitol Hill to try and get the previous management group thrown out based on what our current CEO promised he would do for our employees...He flat out lied through his teeth and today,we are STILL fighting for a contract...Its all well documented..."
bad,Worst management and can never go back to this company. They treat their employees like trash. They have discrimination. Especially management. I wish they will review the way to pay their employees.  Worst airlines and company ever.
bad,Stressful environment  to work at dealing with a lot angry passengers that‚Äôs unhappy about customer service received and service not as they expected from a big airline.
bad,Managers need to hold employees accountable for when they ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù  Mando OT sucks  every night until 5 am if you are low on the totem pole   Management sucks  the only good thing I have to say is flight benefits
bad,I need to go to a company that will allow change not forced change that bring employees together. Direct a team to success into the 21st century today.
bad,"Flight benefits were great except airport staff were the rudest. These are your coworkers and it didnt matter. Treated them as bad as they do pax. Same with supervising staff. Rude. Rules are based on each supervisors mood, not a uniform rule book. You can be fired for missing one day, and the turn over is extremely high. They changed the bereavement policy and military personnel are treated poorly.  Like I said, policy is whatever the supervisor on duty decides based on their mood.....usually not about people, but based on emotions, politics, poor moral."
bad,"This company will suck you dry and spit you out with no regard.  They will let you go and call it a Reduction in Force, but make you not rehireable with no reason why.  They don't offer to let you retire with benefits.  You cannot trust senior management.  They will not give you a raise and not tell you why."
bad,"If you are a pilot, you are at the mercy of poor management practices, lack of leadership, and the worst scheduling practices in the industry. The recommendation is to go fly for any other major airline and you will be much better off."
bad,Wouldn't recommend it all. Cut throat unfair work environment. If your going to work there do it only for the flight benefits it's not worth the headache. A group that feels like they are better than everyone else. Horrible company to work for.
bad,Head management was toxic. There were a lot of people trying to cut each other down and screaming at each other. The head of the department really likes meetings. There is a meeting for everything and not a lot actually gets done.
bad,"Lots of animosities created between the labor groups and management is keeping this group way behind the competitors.  Benefits are good.  Company's training is lagging.  Company's facilities are lagging.  The employee is destined to be judged quite wrongfully, by the senior manager whom because of their incapabilities and their inabilities to deal with labor, have high and unrealistic expectations from junior managers and supervisors.  Countless other issues to be resolved, such as dishonesty and backstabbing to name a couple."
bad,"An airline run based on quantity instead of quality. If you love working like a robot you can make money from your job, lots of opportunity for OT, company will love you."
bad,"Greed, entitlement, and a lack of innovation make this a terrible place to work.  The infamous MBA recruitment program has created a rigid corporate hierarchy which has resulted in several unfit and clueless high-level managers within in the organization."
bad,"It became the worse possible place to work after four years; it‚Äôs a company all about them self workers mean nothing."
bad,Manager will threaten to fire you if you don‚Äôt commit yourself to the job. If your last on seniority list. You will be threaten by management with your job if you don‚Äôt stay after hours when management demands you too. Love my coworkers but it felt like if you didn‚Äôt do what your told management will threaten to fire you.
bad,They pay very low for what you have to do and put up with you don't get flight benefits and you get all the mad customer in this department they are by sonority you get bad hours there's hardly anyone there to relieve you on time if you got to go home you cannot leave your department unless someone's there to relieve you the management is poor I would not recommend working unless you can work with rude peoplehere unless
bad,"You would expect American Airlines to be one of the very best companies to work for but you will find out quickly that it is not. You have the most cut-throat environment you will ever experience. Management being the worst. They will smile to the face of each other and try their hardest to eliminate that person behind their back. They battle and align each against the other, as to who is AA and who is US Air. They don‚Äôt embrace that the two companies are now one, which spared thousands of jobs. "
bad,"Could be a good place to work if they had a complete management shakeup! Company makes billions of dollars but makes health care a low priority for its workers! Only care of this company is the well being of its shareholders! Low pay, low raises and good luck getting a promotion!"
bad,"I've been with the company for 4+ years. All I can say from the time I've spent there is that it is very stressful, you are given tools to work with on your computer but they do not work. Every day you come to work hoping that something else isn't down or broke. American Airlines is an international company and the largest airline in the world and even the smallest and simplest of things cannot be done smoothly. The management unfortunately isn't any better. They are there to make sure you're number are good, and that they look good that is all. What is missing is the overall work morale in the office. They lack positivity and encouragement all together. It's sad to say because the benefits they offer you right when you are hired are great. It's just you have to deal with such a negative, depressing work environment that eventually you can lose it."
bad,the job was fun at times. there was a lot to do on a daily but it was easy to get it done. the people are friendly and helpful in your personal life. management was cool
bad,DFW area leadership lack vision. Promises not kept. Poor development for self. Management is not engaging and only try to fill their pockets. They express sentiments only verbally - there is no follow thru.
bad,"The future of AA is unstable.   Future employment for AMT's is even more unstable.  Moral is low and tensions are high.  Management does not trust labor, and labor does not trust management.  Tired of the unending daily drama.  Time for a new job."
bad,A lot of old white people that's been with the company 30 plus years since they were teens...who refuses to accept change.. change brings diverse cultures and races...and that is a challenge for them...who were only use to working alongside other caucasians...sad but true...management has know back bone to push awareness for change
bad,"Horrible management with the leftover US Airways managers. There's a ridiculous amount of favoritism and little support from the managers.  In fact, they act as though A.A is a gravy train for them and they don't actually have to put in the effort to actually manage their people."
bad,"Survived many lay offs over the years until certain management was promoted into their roles."
bad,Started with the company in August 2014. Since then we had 3 general managers also lost our contract. Always worked short staffed management only cared about one shift. Best thing about the job was the flying benefits.
bad,"I learned to be patient and manage a pretty stressful day in the midst of a storm or tornado alert. I learned to handle pretty difficult situations although my salary was very low for this type of work."
bad,American purchased TWA and promised to integrate seniority fairly.  They ended up putting all flight attendants at TWA at the bottom of the seniority list and laid us off for 8 years.
bad,Poor upper management and hostile working conditions. The staff is rude their is a racial divide and unfair work practices going on it‚Äôs not a fun place.
bad,"1. When you are working part time."
bad,"It involved regular call center daily functions heightened by corporate pull and direction. "
bad,"They don‚Äôt care about the passengers. Absolutely no customer service. Basically all they are concerned about is numbers they are more concerned with getting the flights out on time and closing the doors on time.  They really don‚Äôt care about the long lines as long as there are two or three agents working, that‚Äôs sufficient to check in the line not considering the fact that that the agent may need to go to the rest room or have a lunch break their main concern is cutting back on giving OT and extra hours which is required to run a smooth operation.  Lots and lots of favoritism, I see people that are put on pedestal just to be rude and nasty to both passengers and workers. Customer Service is obsolete as far as I see daily absolutely no professionalism.  Definitely NOT the AMERICAN AIRLINES I knew and loved. The environment is cut throat you can never trust anyone, everyone is on a mission and has an agenda."
bad,"I worked fr American Airlines for 7 1/2 yrs. And other Airlines fo 5 ys. And was A Travel Agent for 3 Years. il have Resrvation and Sales Experirnce And Tckeing Exsperienve, Customer Service exsperience . And wrk Great With Customers and Staff."
bad,My 30 years of flying/ working for American Airlines was a dream job. Very professional operation with absolutely the best people to work with. From dispatchers to mechanics to fellow flight deck crew members.
bad,"dealing with customers directly"
bad,"My day wouldn't start and stop, in relation to the office building, the cubicles, and the desk, on which my laptop would sit, when I was there. I was the East coast, Europe, Japan, and a few more countries cargo analyst. My job was determining how much cargo each and every plane could take and at the optimal price. I had to come up with short and long term forecasts, taking into account, changes in equipment, fruit season, weather, truck routes, the laws in the different countries, the employees at each station, (union or no union). Then there was the daily emergencies, train schedules, volcanos erupting, bomb threats at the airport, delays, and no delays. I wanted all my stations to make as much money as possible, and life happens, so I made the choice to be the absolute best analyst my stations ever had. My starting wage in reservations was $8.65 per hour. Fourteen years later as a level 2 management, my ending wage was $14.65 an hour. American Airlines does not promote from within, experience means nothing, and unless your an MBA, you are nobody."
bad,The airline industry is governed by DOT so there are specific criteria to be met which I was meeting them. I received an excellent review. Lots of learning involved to stay abreast with the constant changing of policies. Assisting people with their travel plans was a unique experience.
bad,This place is only looking for numbers and there is no room for growth or the potential to move up in the company.  Supervisors need more training on the phones.
bad,Not enough interest in employees welfare in terms of salary and work culture. Best serves as a part time job.
bad,Regional airports that offer American Airlines branded flights are not operated by American Airlines. These employers are known either as Envoy Airlines or Piedmont Airlines. Avoid both companies at all costs. Wages are sub-par despite doing the exact same work as an employee of American Airlines proper that you would find at a hub airport like JFK or LAX or similar large airports. Starting pay is $10/hr. After 7 years I am only at $11.38. Stay away from this airline if working at a smaller regional airport.
bad,"I enjoyed my experience at American Airlines. I traveled twice for training and learned a lot. Typical day was unloading baggage and reloading baggage, in the rain, heat and cold. "
bad,Its not for everyone! I found the exciting aspect of a new adventure faded after about 2 years.  If possible to work part time it would be ideal but because of recent company policy changes this is no longer possible.
bad,"I did not enjoy working for American. The pay was not a living wage. I worked all of the time with little time for my family. We traveled one time and it was not a pleasant experience. If you are retired or have a spouse with a great job, go for it. If you are a single parent and have lots of support (and you don't require a lot of money), it might be a great opportunity for you. I had a degree coming in and was making $10.83/hour...I just couldn't survive!"
bad,"The only thing that stuck out to me the most, is the lack of scheduled breaks, or lunch.  Lunch was taken only when work load allowed, which sometime meant going without.  You had to eat lunch at your desk, while working as the work performed had to be done by someone, and there is no one to take over.  "
bad,Started as a great career job. Turned into just a number. No communication between employees and management. Their way or the highway for better most times worse. Would not or could not listen to employees.
bad,Stood for long periods of time without much training of what I was suppose to be doing. Management was the worst.  Manager was rarely there to supervise and would leave people on the floor without much help.
bad,The amount of pay does not compensate for the work dealt with.
bad,Typical day at american is non stop. Managements main goal is to intimidate.
bad,"A typical day at work is very challenging. I have learned a lot about Airport Operation. As for management, I thought it was a very dysfunctional unit. My co-workers supported and like my presence on duty. My hardest day on the job is to see managers making customer concerns their least priority. My most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers and co-workers happy."
bad,"Terrible management, no union support. Ethics was not an option."
bad,Management was very unorganized and had several changes. Long hours with no additional compensation. Management failed to address issues and expected others to word around the issues. Companies lost customer service standards after the merger.
bad,nothing positive to say but others deal with it for the benefits. The cuture is poor. back stabbing for numbers. no idea of what customer service is. At least in PHL
bad,It was a normal working environment. But the management was very poor. not organized.they are more focus on rules and regulation than there customers.
bad,AA is not what it used to be apparently.  Very little incentive for contract individuals to pursue full time positions there (when available).  Old workplace culture makes AA stuck in a time warp with employees hanging on until retirement with no true contribution to workplace.  Would never want to work permanently for AA.
bad,"As a young woman right out of college American Airlines/American Eagle was  the best company to get a job with as a flight attendant.  I flew for almost 25 years and the company has drastically changed since then. Toward the end of my employment the company suffered bankruptcy, awful Labor Contracts and terribly management. Unfortunately, it has gotten worse since I retired according to family and friends."
bad,The employment culture at American Airlines is more about restriction and limitation than support and accolades.  Upper to senior management have no clue how to fix or address ongoing issues.
bad,". Hostile Work Environment"
bad,"Mean coworkers and not enough attention to team work. Supervisors create an ambiance of passive-aggressive tension within new FAs. High turnouts in the flight department, which creates low attention to their needs,"
bad,"Customer Service VS Time is Money is unbalanced at the Southern Reservation Office. If you can travel they offer nearly free flight benefits which is really the only reason to work there. A typical day is taking incoming calls 80-150 per day. What I learned is some neat places to visit someday, and that it is better to cheat in order to keep your call time down here. The last Manager that I had the pleasure to work under was very nice, I believe she is retired now. When United merged with American call time became even more strict. The Culture of the Call center will always have the ""I hope I die here, at least I'd die Happy"" crowd but for the most part it is ""just get through the day"".  The hardest part of the job is keeping customers happy with the tools American Airlines gives you.  The best part of the job is being able to travel."
bad,"Micromanaged. Limited income. Limited opportunities. Oversees jobs. "
bad,"Upper Management sucks. They threaten and intimidate CSM's. The director does nothing. The station manager knows nothing about it. The workforce treats you as you treat them.  Treat them good and they'll go to the ends of the Earth for you. Treat them poorly, good luck."
bad,"AA and US Airways were still undergoing a merger when I started. This was cause for ultimate confusion as far as process, ownership, and training. My manager had a giant ego and knew nothing of the new processes, but couldn't admit it. Instead, he would plant ""land mines"" by telling you to get ""it"" done, but provided absolutely no support or guidance, because he didn't know himself. This was pervasive throughout the IT organization."
bad,"Merger "
bad,My last 10 years at american was in a transitional mode to where many of the benefits and services were cut or curtailed to save working revenue to keep our employment. By 2003 the workforce in my position took as much as a 25% cut in wages and benefits that was never recouped. Our work force was streamlined to the point where as a crew chief I was directed through management to pick up much of the labor losses whenever possible; as well as initiate my primary functions on a daily basis. The airline travel industry warranted outsourcing our jobs for lack of resolves on fuel and labor cost. Management was in no better shape and cutbacks meant the same lack of resolve to survive daily ; but to take on more and more responsibilty with less support. I look forward to american airlines getting back on their feet; we were a proud and hardworking force and a leader in much of what the industry mimics today. I summarily retired early after 32+ years because my station had outsourced my position; and my family was tightly bound to our community and association in this state.
bad,"A typical day would be the sole responsibility of turnning round, back to the US, two or three somtimes more B777,B767 or B757s. This includs all inspections and rectification of defects or deferrals as required, reveiw of logbook and sign off of logbook. I have learned self-reliance and the ability to interact with difficult and cofused crews. We have a small (31 man) crew for 19 daily turnrounds, so the abilty to get on in a small environment has become all-important .The inflexability of managment to improve equipment and conditions is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part would be trouble shooting a problem and getting a good fix..."
bad,"Don't walk, RUN. Do your job hunting at a company with a management team that wants their company to succeed."
bad,"Fun,Independency,"
bad,If you don‚Äôt mind being micromanage to an extreme Or being treated like a machine than this job is for you. Also plan on missing all holidays. They care only about making money and how to push to make more. Doesn‚Äôt matter that how many compliments you get from customers or co-workers  you receive it is never good enough. Product more!! Also flight benefits are almost a joke. Missed many event and drove home 18 hours more than once because I couldn‚Äôt get a flight.
bad,Unfortunately the work environment has become unbearable. The job in itself is not hard at all and I really enjoyed it. But the flexibility that use to exist when I first started is no longer there. The constant micromanaging and unnecessary drive into the office has become tiresome.
bad,"Do not trust what they say,they hire and promise don't we are keeping you guys on ,after summer laid every one saying we are now reducing our flights and employees.,very mismanaged  company,no customer  service at all"
bad,Unfortunately the company culture at least at my station isn't Customer Service driven. We never know why a person is travelling and it should be the mission of this airline to place a higher emphasis on taking better care of it's Customers rather than the financial bottom line.
bad,The supervisors micromanage. They need to go back to the old ways. Don't get me wrong there are some good managers. They also hire new employees and they make more than those of us who have been with the company for years.
bad,They genuinely lack concer for the employees or are totally clueless. They have the ability to issue mandatory over time and only require an hour notice. They have horrible business practices.
bad,Ok company because I was sick would not let me back. It all changed once we went from us airways to American it has been so stressful i could not handle it .
bad,They lay people off without giving them a reason as to why. The culture is very cut throat. It can be a stressful place to work. You never know if you are going to have job security.
bad,"This airline is in a flux and has been for many years, although most upper management doesn't agree. We need a top down overhaul. The upper management think they know what the employees want but no one talks to anyone. they are going around with the attitude you don't like it here go somewhere else."
bad,Lack of Management and direction in my department. Political environment with forced processes that change frequently. Stressful and heavy workload. I can only speak for my department.
bad,"racism,over inclined passengers, the airline industry is not about the customers best interest, hardest part is dealing with irritating passengers, when your off work and able to utilize flight benefits"
bad,"This is a great airline. One you'll have to fly on at least once in your travels.  Miami, Dallas, Charlotte, Washington D.C., Philadelphia... Try one. Try them all."
bad,Worked with some of the best and worst people on earth! Working with Rolls-Royce products are very taxing. OEM to MRO support is almost non exsistant.
bad,"You don't know if you will be working tomorrow.  There is the constant threat of the company shutting down because sales are so bad, even when the economy is good.  Most of the departments are union, so there is not drive to do a good job, because no matter how good or lousy one does his or her job, they are going to get the 25 cent raise."
bad,In 1990 AA was a wonderful place to work but after 911 there were enormous pay cuts and employees were forced to pay three times more for health/dental coverage. AA and American Eagle give management positions to people who have no knowledge or previous experience in their new position. Managers do not care how hard a person works or how dedicated they are or what a great job they are doing. They give mediocre performance reviews so they aren't forced to give promotions or pay raises as those are based on the performance review.
bad,This company lacks the ability to match the right person and skills for the right position.
bad,"At the ticket counter an agent must check in hundreds of passengers for their flight in a time constraint, with their luggage so that flights may go out on schedule. Passengers may be from all over the world and have individual needs based upon their destination. I operate two airline systems. American Airlines and United Airlines. Some customers send out cargo shipments, often with medical or computer parts. There are also live animal shipments. Upon aircraft arrivals passenger may have not received their luggage which we must create a file for when the bag arrives to be delivered to the customer."
bad,"Don't EVER go to HR with workplace hostility issues. It won't end well for you. I went to them asking for help and suggestions on working with a difficult co worker. I told them I didn't want to open a case. I just wanted suggestions. After they agreed to this, they opened a case. I felt a HUGE sense of betrayal, and the difficulties with the co-workers got even worse."
bad,The IT Help Desk has great analysts that work really hard but upper management or dedicate tools or money to making sure things are done correctly.  Their policies are geared towards punishment and they don‚Äôt listen to feedback.
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful.  The majority of the customers are irate due to cancelled flights.  The most enjoyable part of the job is flying for free.  However, with a rise of flight cancellations, flying on standby is very difficult.  Work/life balance is non existent because you are on call at all times.  However, your pay is not comparable to someone who is on call."
bad,"Making sure that the airline matched Delta and Southwest was more important than changing the culture to an innovative and progressive place to work. Definite swim lanes to stay in for career advancement. Not interested in process improvements if the ideas involved people working within the process: management driven changes."
bad,"If your desire is to climb the corporate ladder then AA is for you.  If you want technology growth then stay away."
bad,"Let me begin by saying that the work environment for the customer assistance representative position in Miami is beyond deplorable. You are the face of the company in this position but you are treated with the upmost disrespect in the company. Starting with the lowest pay for a position that places the highest stress on the employee as you are engaging with passengers on a face to face basis. I say this because you‚Äôre not even dealing with passengers behind a counter you literally have them in your face poking at you, whistling at you or even screaming at you all while you having to keep a cool attitude as hard as it may seem.  You mostly find yourself short staffed in a sea of self service kiosks with a passenger to kiosk ratio that is insufficient. Supervisors constantly micro manage you in an unprofessional manner where it doesn‚Äôt even feel like a job but more  as if you‚Äôre in grade school. I‚Äôm speaking solely on behalf of the customer assistance representative position. This is the reality of the position and it offers little to no room for advancement within the company. Save yourself the trouble if you‚Äôre looking for flight benefits. American has a bunch of basic economy tickets for around $100 rountrip confirmed, just need to be on the lookout for them but they‚Äôre out there. Check orbitz or other travel websites for the notifications. Find yourself a better job where purchasing your plane ticket and traveling would be fun on your free time. The free flight benefits are nice but there isn‚Äôt much to enjoy of it when you get paid such a small amount that it‚Äôs more cost effective"
bad,"This company is very large so your work experience will be different depending on if you work at headquarters, the airport, as a flight attendant, a pilot, or a mechanic."
bad,"Overall it was a great place to work, but they need better management and I always felt like you could lose your job and the pay is poor. I would be careful."
bad,"I was told one thing in the beginning and had to find out for myself the real deal after being their for a while. If your home life is stable and you have people to assist you, you should be fine. I went through several situations there, including losing my vehicle, homelessness, and my father being hospitalized due to needing a heart transplant. My supervisor was unforgiving, but told me not to worry and that everything was fine."
bad,Worked as a flight attendant. It's a low paying job for what they ask of you. Most flight attendants can't afford rent. Management is a mess and could treat their employees much better. There are other airline companies to work for that compensate more fairly and treat their employees better. Otherwise it's a fun experience but not a career.
bad,Many who work here live below poverty line. They also get govt assistance. Upper management has no problem dumping you and replacing you for the smallest infraction. You are not a person to them. Just a number.
bad,Very stressful job in the face paced airline industry. Unloading and loading bags onto planes in all types of weather conditions. Management is disconnected from the employees and tends to simply bark orders.
bad,I have worked for management in the same department but two different cities. my current manager is very condescending and acts like a child when it comes to conflict resolutions.
bad,"The merger has been a complete mess. Constant fights between the work forces, unions and management. The company pits the employees against one another and really doesn't care who comes out on top as long as it is them. Passengers have no idea just how bad it is. Fume events, uniform reactions, different work rules for each fa group, union disorganization."
bad,A.A. would increase profit if they focused on customer service. The work/ life balance is good for those who who don't have a life. Employees need to be treated better.
bad,"Started in 1988 during Crandall era and it was a great place to work. Made the mistake of accepting a position in management in 1995 and was rewarded for all my hard work and dedication by being laid off in 2001. Very political place to work. Advice to future employees."
bad,"Great airline with great employees, all are generally close as they have been there for a number of years working together. Management was great and conveyed day-of tasks in a timely and efficient manner. Taught new employees and practicum students the ins and outs of how the Airline works."
bad,Bring your boss cake and donuts and you'll do fine. Make sure an go outside and smoke with him.
bad,"American Airlines has a LOT of managers, VP's, directors and assistant directors. They're everywhere, and it makes it difficult to listen to one line of thought or find two managers who don't contradict each other. The upside is they pay pretty well. That's literally the only thing that keeps me there most of the time."
bad,Out source outsource outsource.  Cuts everywhere its not a profitable business.Union doens't do anything other than take your money.  They can't negociate.
bad,In the Administration the management and supervisors don‚Äôt know what they are doing. They don‚Äôt support the employees. They are biased. They don‚Äôt listen. If you are a minority you are discriminated against.
bad,"not worth it for 14$ they overwork you for not enough great pay cant pick up any hours until after 90 days. Work environment inst great either, United Airlines is the way to go"
bad,"While the job itself is easy, the company itself leaves a lot to be desired. Management has absolutely zero regard or respect for frontline employees."
bad,"In my tenure with AA at Manchester it was on a temp contract and the ‚Äúsupervisory‚Äù staff and some of the permanent staffmade it very obvious that the temp group wasn‚Äôt being kept on , so I left"
bad,Management is disconnected from the frontline and corporate team and does not provide direction to their teams.  The teams struggle to find direction and lack of collaboration is prevalent since the merger.  The company is too big now to provide any kind of teamwork.
bad,"After American Airlines bought TWA, we were treated like step children.  No respect.  I was very unhappy with them, so at the age of 57 years of age I decided to retire and move back to Missouri to be closer to my family."
bad,"My work experience at American Airlines was with great people but horrible management. If you are a college student or a retiree, its the perfect job for you. Insurance and free flights are the great perks but the hourly pay was very disappointing .  By McGee Tyson airport in Alcoa,Tn. not  being a main hub, the pay was drastically different."
bad,"This position was exhausting and the pay did not make up for it. I worked the night shift as a cabin agent and, while I enjoyed working with my colleagues, there was no advancement and little benefits."
bad,I was a customer service agent for American for 8 years. It gets boring taking call after call for 8  hours a day. Its difficult to sit down chained to a desk all day taking calls from irate passengers. It was great having insurance and travel benefits.
bad,performed a pci external audit against American airlines after they merged with us airways.  it was very complicated as we discovered many deficiencies in every area.  aa personnel were not cooperative with the auditors as they kept stating they were doing internal audist and this was news to them.
bad,"Cold days, hot days. Management never took responsibility and they actually wanted to promote me. Too much passing the blame to save face only for management to eventually be replace"
bad,"I love my job at American. I love working with numbers and being able to work from home. I have learned many things working at American. However, the management is never available when you really need them or have an emergency. My coworkers are awesome. The hardest part of this job is balancing working from home and interaction between my family when they are at home."
bad,having a great time in the airport. Dealing with freight companies while shipping freights around the world
bad,Needs improvement. Good co-workers. Treated TWA employees unfairly.
bad,Taking calls from customer either ready to book flights or checking the status of flights. This is one of the most interesting positions I have ever had.
bad,all they care about is upper management. They cannot seem to
bad,I worked for American in several positions.   Please see the previous.
bad,"Non Rev Flights are Oversold, not what you know its who you know, people not friendly, management and union do not get along."
bad,I learned how to work together with different types of people that I dont get along with
bad,A legacy company filed Chapter 11
bad,The hours make it difficult to have a second job and you will need it. The scheduled hours change and are not the best hours. People are nice and work hard to provide best service.
bad,"Being a flight attendant is more than a job, it is a lifestyle!  You must be ok with being away from home A LOT!  No day is ever the same but the job is fun and what you make it.  Unfortunately, with new computer scheduling (PBS), it's very difficult to get the schedules you want; even senior f/a's at over 20 years, are now losing their bid preferences so it's very hard to ever get the time off you require..."
bad,"I used to think American Airlines was the greatest job. But as the years passed it turned out to be a ""Who you know"" type of promotion job. Senior management does not value their employees. This was very apparent as to the ""American Voice"" survey. "
bad,AA is a golden handcuff job for 70% of its employees. The benefits are great but everything else I can‚Äôt say is. Driven by people who make odd decisions implementing procedures that make no sense they routinely lack the push to make things work better for all of their employees and fall behind other major companies. Though the benefits are very amazing.
bad,"People tell me they wished they had gotten out at the same time I did, and looking back, would not have made a career working there.  I've seen a lot of medical issues from the retired employees."
bad,"Okay Company. Good Benefits. Management is not great. Difficult to maintain a balance between work and personal life, must be very flexible, and difficult to spend holidays with family."
bad,management needs to change how they treat their flight attendants.  the ceo is abusing his position to squeeze as much money as he can to make a profit
bad,Great company to work for if they could learn to collaborate.  Very cut throat management but mostly because younger workforce poses a threat from a technical knowledge perspective. Not interested in new Tech ideas because many don't understand them. Conference calls with visuals are almost always a fail at many levels.  Many only know basic Microsoft Tools.  So expect to always take the very long way to get the job done which means your delivery date always moves because of this.  It does get done though you'll just always be late delivering.  This increased heavily after the merger with US Airways in 2016.
bad,"never enough employees to handle volume of costumers."
bad,Police departments are not a good place to stay with if you have a family. Constant changing schedule and court dates food your life. High stress and cutthroat mentality.
bad,My review is specifically for the reservations department.. Other departments at American are not so micromaged. There are so many job related tasks need to be done on personal time.
bad,The main benefit of working at American is the travel benefits.  The management and culture leaves a lot to be desired.  The company is not interested in work/life balance and does not focus on the customer at all.
bad,Assisting passengers with booking flights and making changes to current tickets. I learned alot more about professional customer service in the time I was there than all my other jobs together. However its all politics in the office and unless you know someone in higher management the chances of promotion are slim.
bad,"Rigid schedule, and lack of concern from management for time off even due to pregnancy, sick with a doctors note.  They make you thing getting time off is easy by switching with peers. However, no one wants to cover schedule 2nd or 3r shift."
bad,"AA is an overall good company to work for, however; they are still behind of the times.  Many of the employees at AA are extremely committee to the Company and will do whatever they need to succeed.  Some employees at AA feel that the company has not always been fair."
bad,"typical day is a nightmare, which is why turnover in corporate accounting--especially financial reporting--is outrageously high.  Stay away from accounting; if you really want the flight perks, try for finance."
bad,"Wish I left sooner under the Working,favoritizim Conditions & bad Managers also IAM Union Representatives really sucks when you pay into union dues & get nothing in return except booted outta door"
bad,"I would have to start by saying that this has to be the worst management I have ever worked for. They are all related, friends or dating on another. The Food and Beverage manager is dating her supervisor...how gross can you be? This was brought to H.R. and top management and nothing was done about it as the F&B manager use to be roommates with H.R. This is a team ""ME""! They have an extremely high turn over rate as they verbally abuse and disrespects their employees as well. The week that I left, 10 other employees left as well. Terrible company, and it is not ran by American Airlines, the Food and Beverage is ran by SODEXO!"
bad,Management changed - lack of job security - often not told the truth by managers - clicks just like in high school - favorites.
bad,Horrible place to work. Pay is ok. Constantly worried about getting laid off. Very boring job.
bad,"The job was a great job for many years. It went down hill after the 9/11 attacks. We lost benefits, pay, and retirement. The physical part of the job is the hardest part. The best part of the job was the flexibility with the hours and working extra hours. The travel is nice too.  "
bad,"Given 40 hours a week to do 70 hour a week duties, management is so messed up they don't know if they're coming or going and there is absolutely no team work amongst them. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO TRAINING GIVEN. Flight benefits are great unless you require flights out of DFW (which almost all Tulsa flights do) as your standby gets bumped by all the higher ups traveling. Keep in mind, DFW is headquarters....bump, bump, bump. The mechanics, CC's and Supervisors are awesome. You hear complaints in every part of Tulsa's Maint. Base about the management and how poorly they treat the employees. Many of my coworkers came from other airlines and said AA is the worst they've ever been treated. A common saying amongst the employees..... ""The good ones never stay."""
bad,Unfortunately the company is going through a major reorganization and it impacts anyone from fronline employees to management equally.
bad,The position was a good entry level position. Needed to have very flexible schedule. Occasionally called in due to operational need. Managment not very hands on.
bad,"I worked there for two years as a Member Service Representative for the call center. This place is horrible to work. There is no room for advancement there. If the manager doesn't like you you are not moving to another department. They monitor your calls, and you can barely go to the bathroom. If you are going to apply there just to get in AA don't do it. It is not worth it, you wont be able to apply for a job for a year. The managers there think they own the place and they can do what they want like they own the company."
bad,management suck management talks to people any type of way it does help college students out
bad,"While Crandall was there, it was a great company. They were forward looking, cared for more than just the next 3 months bottom line. There was a LONG term plan and they weren't afraid to take risks to lead the industry. If he was still there, it would get 4 and 5 stars. The customers always came first followed closely by the employees. Today, AA is almost the laughing stock in the airline industry. The hiring of a telecom CEO is a case in point. United Airlines did something similar and the employees refer to it as ""the banker days"". AA is repeating the mistake. They've seriously lost their way and is no longer the powerhouse they once were. When will companies learn that we need fewer MBAs running companies and more people that actually know how to make something or deliver a product?"
bad,"Great place to work if you love to travel, good pay and benefits."
bad,"Pay is livable, health benefits are good, and travel benefits are AMAZING. However, post-merger morale has quickly declined as upper management as well as local management makes it clear to employees that investors‚Äô returns are ALL that is important. From micro-managing one moment and zero management on duty the next, there is no accountability among workers. Work groups are pitted against each other instead of encouraged to work together as a team. Rampant toxic work culture and harassment go ignored when complaints are raised."
bad,Very clickish and unprofessional practically all of the time. Gossip girls have nothing on this group of ignorance. They‚Äôll all suffer soon. Business is failing due to their incompetence.
bad,"I‚Äôve been at American for 3 years and in this time I‚Äôve watched the company moral go from bad to worse."
bad,Part of your job as an AAdvantage Customer service representative is to promote a Citibank credit card. They care more about transferring their passengers to the credit card application line than they do making sure they have a great experience with flying with the company. Very cliquish as well. Contradictory division of American giving favoritism to people who have the most transfers than people who treat the customer the best. The department is very big on favoritism as well. Upper management has no regard for the reps. Year after year the division has won customer awards for their service and upper management never recognizes our achievements.
bad,"The benefits are great but the health care plans aren‚Äôt good and are expensive "
bad,Upper management is very difficult to work with and they do not treat the employees with respect. The employees seem to have a poor attitude and they do not enjoy working in their position.
bad,"The management is never on the same pace, it's also a very stressful position not due to workload but management. "
bad,"When I started there was profit sharing and decent pay. By the second year profit sharing was taken away. Raises became less often and for a few cents. Employees stayed because of flight privileges and to fly for free or very cheap. By the time I left employees could hardly ever get on a flight because the airline constantly overbooked flights. This would cause paying customers to not even be able to get on their flights, of course employees  on the stand-by list would have no chance of getting on."
bad,"Policies can change various times during the year cause you and the customer to be frustrated.  Work shedules are very inflexible which is ok if you work with good coworkers who will swap with you. But no swapping is allowed for initial 180 working days,  thats 6 months of them dictating your schedule"
bad,"I worked at US Airways and then was merged into American Airlines. I think it's very sad because US Airways had great culture, you felt supported and valued as an employee, and then at American you just feel like a number. The company is so large and has so many employees, you're basically disposable and you will feel that way. I left and now work for Southwest Airlines and it is hands down the best decision I have ever made."
bad,"When I worked there more than 5 years ago, the company was more concerned with saving $$ than Customer Safety. Management did not typically have a good opinion of the Union workers and treated them accordingly. I was laid off many times in my 13 yr career. Glad to have moved on from that company/industry."
bad,american airlines is a hot mess thats it.... Fun place to work the people are really friendly. However management is ridiculous they never had enough staffing so if your on reserve your going to fly fly fly... Pilots have airport standby so your always taking delays... and good luck getting seats anymore to non rev.
bad,"With the merger between American Airlines and US Airways, a lot of confusion still runs in the company, which makes it not a great place to work."
bad,The managers were not very nice at times. And they really were not helpful when i needed to know something about the operation of the store. But i did have some good moments.
bad,"Unless you're single and able to be at work all the time, this isn't the perfect job for you.  Long hours and sometimes stressful environments and situations."
bad,If they walked the talk instead of just talking the talk it would be a great place to work. The CEO seems to be in denial of employee moral being so low.
bad,"If you are someone who intends to be a career flight attendant (hot tip: in my base, the most senior flight attendant has been flying for about 50 years), this job only improves as you get senior. Sticking with the job means gradual annual pay raises, and the ability to hold better trips. EVERYTHING is by seniority from the trips you fly to the positions you work on the plane to the days off you can hold to the vacation you are awarded one year to the next. The first year as a flight attendant is incredibly difficult, and in all likelihood, you will qualify for food stamps in the first city they base you out of. Also, they mean it when they ask in the application if you are willing to work holidays and weekends. But if you are able to stick it out, it gets better rapidly (year 5 is when most flight attendants agree they felt they could comfortably afford the cost of living), and the opportunity to see the world is unparalleled."
bad,"inconsistent management policies across locations - advancement requires relocation - cons outweigh pros, not evolving with the times and technology, high marks for diversity and inclusion."
bad,"once the merger with us air, the work enviorment at AA went down hill so fast!  It was no longer a fun place to work.  You got written up for every thing you did.  Go to Southwest!!!"
bad,"If you're fresh out of a college and simply need a job to keep money in your pocket, look here. Management was terrible. They we're not helpful or compassionate. The salary was low, in which they made sure you were aware of that during the interview. The hours sucked. 3-11pm was my shift. You have to take your full vacation a week at a time and you're given 2 weeks. You have sick time but you're penalized when you use it. Most of the management that was there when I was employed have been fired."
bad,I learned and advanced at AA. However AA does not cherish there employees. I learned very important management skills. These skills will follow me to my next job.
bad,They work their employees very hard and in a very stressful controlled environment. The company is truly on focused on money. It is very hard to get off of work when you need to. Horrible place to work.
bad,Worked from Home. American provided computer and equipment. Flew on American for very low cost. Highly stressful job. Not any real time off with paid vacation.
bad,There are benefits to working for American. Luckily they are not the only carrier. Everyone there wishes they worked for Delta because their CEO treats his employees better. Schedules can be flexible or inflexible when there is weather. Fighting fires for the company isn't worth everything you give up in exchange. The best entry level position is flight attendant or fleet service (under the wing) or if you are fortunate something corporate. The merger did us all in. The micro management has skyrocketed as well. Their policies are arbitrary and subjective at best. The manager you have will make or break you here as well. AA has a long ways to go if they want to beat DL or SW.
bad,"This company is okay if you‚Äôre willing to make a lot of sacrifices for the benefits. The pay doesn‚Äôt add up unless you work your life away. You work long hours and sometimes have little rest. Unless you already live near the base you are assigned, have fun trying to find a place to live within your means. You will end up having a crash pad with many other people. Being a Flight Attendant in general is not as glamorous as you may think. It‚Äôs definitely a lifestyle, not a job."
bad,work days were long at times learned a lot about time management work with all kinds of people delays were the hardest part of job best thing was the travel
bad,"No comment.  Very political environment.  Scared of change.  Their code base is from 1998-2005.  Mostly VB.NET or Classic ASP.  I rewrote several of their Classic ASP apps in C#, MVC5, Entity Framework, Bootstrap and jQuery.  Team lead took credit for my work.  Live and learn."
bad,"Working in the airline industry you get a lot of angry customers and at American the management will not back you up. They cannot keep up with the competition but are under the illusion that they are the best airline in the world. They say there are opportunities for advancement; however, you consistently have to turn things down due to union contract agreements. The employees are extremely dissatisfied and quite negative so the work atmosphere takes a toll on even the most positive person. The benefits of flying for free are great...if you can use them. The health benefits keep going up in cost."
bad,"Today was a typical day at work.  Starting at 0500am 6 kickoff flights before 0700am.  First one boarded up and went out of service at departure time.  We have three gates and borrowing one from the city.  The 0600 Chicago delayed to 0650 with crew legality problems, 0600 DFW mechanical and no place to put 0710 departure.  I was working or answering questions on three flights at the same time, while training a new agent.  What I learned is Organization is everything and communication.  Passengers following me from gate to gate knowing that I will get them where they need to be.  We are short handed so not much to say about co-workers.  The hardest part about my job is not being able to leave on time and getting my passengers to their destination like we had promised.  I enjoy my job because of my passengers and I look in the mirror everyday and know without a shadow of a doubt I did the best I could."
bad,"This career requires strong soft skills such as being dependable, adaptable, and being equipped with interpersonal skills which transcend culture and demographics. The Flight Attendant career requires that individuals be able to effectively work in a team environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction I got from serving others. The most challenging part of the job is having to serve the mandatory reserve time because during that time I am idle."
bad,"You fly for free but sacrifice everything for that perk. You get paid well but you will realize your sanity is more important. If you can't get a better job, this place will do. Do not spend the next 40 years working for this company, word to the wise; you wouldn't understand unless you work here already, by then it's to late."
bad,"Be sure that you are ready for an extremely busy call center atmosphere prior to applying for this position. It is high expectations, and it is stressful. You will be expected to achieve various set goals in resolved cases per week/phone call adherence of inbound call times daily/tracing for bags to which is time consuming/taking calls from passengers at any given time when they call/responding to emails/submitting resolutions for settlements/documenting files, and ensuring you are clocking in/out for all times away from your desk/tasks. You will need to be on time for work otherwise it will be an occurrence if you are even one second late for work. They won't tell you that until after it happens in CBRO. Please know that I am not bitter towards AA with this review. It is simply advising future prospects & ensuring you have an idea of what is to be expected. In the event you are extremely passionate about helping people you will have to curb that and focus on the numbers."
bad,"The stress of AA is unparamount to any other stress I've known! To much work for the stress of relentless customers and high demands from management... That is all I wish to say,,,"
bad,"This was a call center setting, where it showcased many personality clashes, decreased employee rate, and bad management. It was a union representation where the job security was almost pure."
bad,"The benefits of working with AA was great. You, your spouse, and children fly for free, Parents and friends at discounted rates. The customers were the worst I had ever experienced and I have tough skin. Because the company had just merge two supervisor could tell you two different things and policy and procedure could say something different from them two. Payroll was messing up checks, you could work the holidays and your time cards said so and payroll still wouldn't pay you. Overtime was sketchy as well, If you worked overtime you only got overtime pay if the 40 regular hours you worked was you hours, if you swapped hours with someone or picked up someone shift as overtime it was all considered regular pay. Shift bids every 3 months, shift bids were based on sonority and age."
bad,"Its a good working environment , your co workers become family. The benefits is great, you get to fly for free at anytime."
bad,"I had a great deal of responsibility in a variety of areas.  It was a very good place to work and through the years I gained a lot of experience in many areas such as the Operation, Budgets & Costs, Administration, Payroll, Construction and Human Resources."
bad,It was very busy. The work environment wasn't great. The leadership didn't take care of their employees well. Work/Life balance was disrupted by everyday operations.
bad,"My direct supervisor was awesome!"
bad,"No comment. Management wasn't the best, always changes management in Chicago like crazy. Had problems with employees calling off left and right, leaving the employees who do come to work with mandatory overtime and double the work in the shift"
bad,Fast paced environment. Diverse setting with people from all around the world. Wonderful benefits package just show up to work willing & able. Safety is key
bad,"Not a great company to work for. Super stressful work and no family/life balance. Management was terrible, which sucks after already having to deal with a large amount of negative characters. Very little pay for what you have to do. "
bad,"8 hrs. per day normally.. Taking phone calls from airline pilots re: any questions they have re: pay , work assignments , etc.. and use the computer to  find answers to their questions ... Minimal management involvement ...For the most part co-workers were professional and courteous..Hardest part of the job was working overnight shifts ..  Most enjoyable part was resolving issues a union pilot may have had and doing it courteously and professionally.."
bad,"Take incoming calls and assist with booking and rebooking options if necessary. Inform clients of of TSA and baggage requirements and coordinate with multiple departments to improve customer experience. Low pay, but great flight benefits."
bad,"My first year started off good, but with the merger it got too stressful. The MGMT improved, but due to illness I had too many occurrences to move up."
bad,Got to meet great people. Fun place to work. Not enough hours.
bad,"Working for engineers, there was not opportunities to do correspondence or project management. They worked on specific software for airplane design. "
bad,"I worked there 15 years and learned alot of info. About aircraft parts. I interacted with mechanics, planners, crew-chiefs, and shop/dock supervisors on a daily basis. The management team isn't that great."
bad,"Work long days, until tasks are finished, never left undone. Working with high levels of technical data, manager implementation of new procedures and attendance compliance for over 20,000 employees."
bad,"workplace culture is poor, need to improve culture at workplace. Negative environment , where people don't appreciation especially Managers. Hope it change"
bad,"You'll work every holiday, weekend, and night shift. Average salary is under $30K"
bad,"Typical Airport,"
bad,"The union representation is a joke, The management is shady the job is only good for the benefits medical and flight are the only benefits it wears you out mentally"
bad,Not enough money for cost of living and no options to make more money. The airport I worked at was good and the employees and managers were nice but couldn't take the low pay when i worked for other airlines who paid a lot more.
bad,"I love the job at American Airlines, However, I am ready for more of a challenge and need to further myself."
bad,"My biggest goal and give my best for the development of cia"
bad,"A typical day at work is checking in passengers and getting them ready for take off. I learned how to make boarding passes, changing and booking flights and baggage. I had a horrible boss who did his job sometimes, definitely played favoritism in the work area. I had really cool,lay back co workers who made the job fun. Hardest part was late passengers trying to get on they're flights and management who didn't act appropriate. Most enjoyable part was a satisfied customer and they pay."
good,I came to this job on a commission bases. Through my living situation. They benefit more and we did all the work for a place to stay.  Canning and Hunger was management.  (NOT THE AAC)
good,"The position in it self was cool however the vacation relief position was a joke, it was very hard to adjust to a shift when you may only be assigned the shift for a week or two. The pay was horrible for all that was required in a shift, personally I expected more from a major airline."
good,"Management has changed and has no concern for employees only for what can line their pockets."
good,"used to work for US Airways - was a great place to work. Then the merger happened and American Airlines way of thinking (that put them into bankruptcy) started creeping back in. "
good,"an okay job for starters, but the pay is extremely low.  the commute and the heavy load of sensitive work are too much for such a rate. it was not what I expected at all."
good,"this was a temp position  my direct manager was out sick most of the time, I never had any direction as to my roll, But i did my best answering incoming call from US Airways / American airlines employees  with there questions regards to W-4 and password reset"
good,"Flying can be fun, but getting time to actually fly is not. You will work and work and never get anywhere.  Training is limited and micromanaging is the way of life."
good,Alaska Airlines is a good place to work if your looking for summer job. Training was poor but I know with more flights they can do better.  they promote only who they know and not what you know.
good,"It was way better when it was still US Airways, American Airlines have given its employees raises but then turn around and cut their hours. Leaving full time employees to only 12 hour a week shifts. The veterans who have been there for 10 plus years call out and collect sick pay, leaving the rest to struggle and  try to get flights out on time. With less people, missing stock and bad management American Airlines is headed for a crash landing."
good,"I have worked for American for 27 years. It has been a great career, but now I am retiring and looking for a new direction."
good,"I work for ENVOY; which is a sub group under American Airlines. Good for traveling. Not good for creating a living. Pay horrible, Union is also horrible."
good,"It's a job.  Ever changing work environment.  Under a union, so the workplace has become hostile.  Benefits are great, just get in there and do what you are supposed to do."
good,it is ok to work at AA just remember you will become a number plus you need to be apply to handle more than one task at a time  since you are given a job for more than one person can handle
good,Good benefits are primary reason to work there. As a ramp manger you are graded by the number of people you have negative/positive conversations with and how you manage overtime. You are an at will employee so they can get rid of you at anytime. You work in a union environment and you're only as good as the crews who you are supervising.  There are many supervisors with 20 plus years with company but no job security.
good,"Senior Leadership is a ""good ol boys"" community with a very limited amount of woman in Senior Leadership operation roles in PHX."
good,"Having benefits, flying free is nice to work pat-time, but you have to work another job to survive.  But, that's hard when you have to bid every 3 months and it goes by seniority.  That's scary and then you have to hope your co-workers with help you with your shifts"
good,There were many issues and I'm glad I left there. The main and biggest issue was the racial divide among employees and management. The managers at O'Hare were African American and they would promote others of the same race to supervisor positions even though no promotions were posted for anyone to see. They almost fired a 60 something year old white agent for supposedly pushing a 30 something year old black agent to the ground. The problem was the white person was maybe 150 pounds and the black one was about 400 pounds....
good,A 30 year job that ended in my position being removed and a force retirement. This was a great job until local management made it a poor place to work
good,"Great company yet mismanaged by local leadership. Union atmosphere, HR feels they actually run the company, yet not certain where it actually is."
good,"This company has had a lot of changes,not for the better nor better for the employees."
good,"Busy work, hard work. Not as professional as it once was. Still can be a great place to work, once restructuring is completed."
good,i worked through a third party company full time job no benefits do not recommend for career seekers. management was not good but was able to learn about aa through aa workers
good,"Lots of conflicting information, no clear direction from the company on where we are going.  Upper management seems unfocused. Compensation not on par with employee pay progression."
good,"I was the last in seniority list for 6 years. I always had 4 am shift and had to drive 2 am from San Jose to be at San Francisco airport at 4 Am. We had to drive jet bridge, control and board flights, check in baggage‚Äôs and work in baggage claim."
good,Upper management is the absolute WORST. Valid concerns and constructive criticism are ignored. High turnover due to unappreciative and inept leadership.
good,"The airline industry is made up of people who had Generations working there prior to them. Coming in as an outsider in other words never having had family work in the airline industry, was definitely a dividing Factor you're either in or out. The company as a whole put entirely too much emphasis on different cultures and different lifestyles and that segregates people tremendously and there are a lot of clicks"
good,"Although the people on the lower levels of employment are accommodating and generally supportive, upper management is not in touch with the frontline employees. This is a stressful job and the salary is not compensated according to the required workloads. There are many heavy periods due to weather, peak season, delays, strikes - all of which add up to stress not only for the passengers but for the employees as well."
good,If you are friends with the right people great other wise you are just a number also teams did not collaborate enough and caused conflict to much outsourcing
good,Company going through a lot of changes more focused on sales than customer service. Call center unionized and morale is at its lowest. Overtime is mandatory without any advanced noticed. Pay does not measure to other airlines
good,"Ever since US airways took over, Management has been micromanaging all aspects of the business in a bad way and cutting back on staff and benefits.Don't expect raises or promotions if you want to work here."
good,A typical day begins with leaders ignoring employees and deliberately avoiding eye contact to keep from speaking to them directly.  Leaders have closed doors more frequently than open. Work is assigned based upon friendships vs. experience and talents.
good,"Great benefits lure you into working for American Airlines. However, if you find yourself at a station that employs via Piedmont Airlines the starting pay is low. If employed at a station running a high volume of operations while consistently understaffed, a part time employee will work 30-39 hours per week per ""operational needs."" "
good,"Piedmont Airlines, under the umbrella of American Airlines. POOR wages. I am only there for the flight benefits, like most. But I stay too broke to travel. I love my job, but I have to pick up lots of hours just to keep up with my bills."
good,Flight benefits are great but the compensation and opportunities and employee recognition is not good. The management is not trusted by the support staff and for good reason.
good,"Not enough hours or pay to make a living,, sometimes wanted you to come in for 2 hours to off load a Going broke trying to make ends meet working there, basically only got 27 hours a week and those hours were set where you could not really work another job."
good,"Customer call center to make reservation for incoming calls for travels within the us and the Caribbean islands, customer support, troubleshooting travel request."
good,"High stress, but rewarding experience. Learn to work under pressure and with a team. I've learned more about myself as a leader learning from good and bad managers."
good,"The transition from US Airways to American was not as smooth as anticipated, too many managers, not enough effective management. You could only advance to Gate/ticket agent or to work on the ramp"
good,"no benefits , low pay. was my first job moving away from home so it was better than nothing and i got a lot of different job offers because of this so it was good but pay and the management were horrible. they did not know how to operate. us employees ran the show and that place was a mess without a handful of us workers."
good,"The recent changes are potentially beneficial as well growth availability. However, much restructuring is needed within the hiring sector. In this day, there should be acknowledgement of true qualified given opportunities vs who knows who. Some don't always know but would like to!"
good,the Seatac station is small and ran by the agents that have been there 20 years. If you aren‚Äôt willing to participate with them you are outcast. I was excited to join the team and quickly was discouraged
good,"I found the management in the area I worked in to be less than appreciate of the people and work that was produced, management was not on site but ruled through very harassing emails.  It was a union environment when did not add to lessening the stress."
good,"You are micro managed and paid low. The only reason why is because you can fly places on standby so that is supposed to make up for it. Shift bid every 3 months so you never can keep the same schedule. No more home based either. Watch out for managers, they will watch you go downfall and not assist to help. Only good thing was flying and discounts. But beware of standby. People at reservations and airport are totally different."
good,Management at American Airlines does not see what their policies are doing to their employees. The number crunchers constantly say that the airports are overstaffed and yet employees are working shortstaffed every day with no breaks and being stuck on overtime for 4 hours after their regular shift.
good,Dealing with irate customers on a daily basis and working with management with limited resources. Company need to adopt resources for employees to perform better.
good,American Airlines is a great company depending on what department you work in. I enjoy being an American airline employee. I have learned meany great things.
good,"You will have to both work one year and work 1250 hours to make FMLA, and it doesn't matter how dire your situation is, either that or be put on medical leave, and if you know how that works, them you realize how ridiculous that sounds, especially if you were zealous like I was and put all your eggs in one basket. Yes, there are benefits but seniority reigns supreme here and your schedule is going to be horrible for some years until the company finally decides to be fair to those who have given their youth away to this place. Meaning a person there for 20-30 years will always get mornings, and you, well better make some friends or stalk the board posting if that's what you're after. The later hour are unorthodox and not really good for anyone's real schedule, but what can you do, they're opened 24/7, 365 days a year right?! If you're set on this place then I suggest part-time and beware of taking FT here as well the union, sucks here and there isn't much support for your qualms so don't get to upset when you find this out.  You will only know the managers of this place when they want to write you up for something, because the turn over rate for those positions are horrendous. To not be a bitter patty your discounts are definitely epic, I will say that, so if you can put up with this hoodrat work culture that's going on at PHL, then bless you and all the benefits you will gain. I have been going here to work, speaking to a little a possible unless necessary and collecting my coins for a smooth couple years now. May peace be with those who apply to AA at PHL. But I wanted to be"
good,Don‚Äôt work here at one time long time it was fun place to work and learn now with the last merger by the company it‚Äôs the blind leading the blind type of atmosphere your management is a joke they don‚Äôt know you or want to know it‚Äôs employees they don‚Äôt care and are ready to write you up and terminate your employment with the company very good workers and the work is interesting and challenging but the leadership is very bad not a good place to work and if you are a brown noser then you‚Äôll get along otherwise forget it
good,Upper Management would not back Supervisors.  Upper Management worked with the TWU without input from their Supervisors.  Management let TWU members get away with polices and procedures and the TWU contract.
good,"Fun, busy, fast paced, place to work, with a lot advancement. Well diverifed place of business, must be on alert at all times, We get great travel benefits ."
good,I enjoyed the benefits of the job. Mainly the food and traveling benefits were up to par. But the pay rate is passable and teamwork is rare. The tenured employees are entitled and do not help newer employees.
good,"Union/nonunion environment"
good,"The work place culture was steady and new and growing but leadership lacked and communication skills also lacked. There was no encouragement or positive vibes in the area. sadly, most of that team is separated do to like feelings."
good,"Job was very fast paced, very difficult at times but was easy to manage. Need to have a lot of patience with passengers because they could be very mean at times."
good,"I was treated with disrespect through out my work experience with "
good,is a good company with a lot of benefits.  Management is not so good and needs improvements. but overall the co workers a are pretty cool and helpful.  Good with training new hires.
good,It is a perfect job more individuals who have been with the company for 20 plus years. I was a new-hire and it was very stressful and I was fatigued majority of the time.
good,"The airport can be stressful. The customers as well as co-workers begin to rub off on your mood. This is especially when you're working the opening shift of 3am. It's challenging to find a balanced sleep schedule. Due to seniority, the schedule is a hit and miss. Some bids you'll have it good and some you wont.The flight perks are the best part. Some co-workers are fun to be with as long as they're positive. I find afternoons have a better vibe than the mornings."
good,Fast paced environment with some down time. Managers harass you. Great flight benefits. Rotating schedule and you have to bid by seniority. You also bid for your vacation although you do get about 6-9 days depending on seniority. You are able to work as many hours as you would like by picking up other people shifts. Paid lunch. Waiting list if you would like to advance to becoming a full-time employee. Health insurance options suck. At times you are asked to stay later due to weather conditions.
good,"Achievement through consistently achieving a high level of customer satisfaction by exhibiting a helpful positive attitude and building trust, by ensuring commitments are met and expectations are exceeded by offering additional information."
good,"cater plane, I learned nothing, management sucks, I work with a bunch of idiots, inclement weather is the worst part of the job, it's an easy job any idiot can do it."
good,"I work at an airport so the culture is different than that of someone at the corporate headquarters. Management is a revolving door, and job security is not guaranteed if someone is not a part of a unionized work group. As with most airlines nepotism and cronyism is the way things seem to operate, unionized work groups and management have developed a fair amount of animosity after years of bankruptcies, take overs and mergers.      "
good,"This Company offers great benefits. Be ready to stand for long periods of time. Often, it is required to work under pressure. Schedule flexibility for mornings or evenings."
good,Em 20 anos aprendi muito de tudo e por ultimo administrava toda opera√ß√£o desde as chegadas quanto as partidas. O mais dif√≠cil era quando havia quebra de equipamento e o voo n√£o sa√≠da como programado.
good,"Company has moved to an Agile IT shop.  This means their PM roles no longer focus on scope, budget, resource and vendor management, along with the traditional risk, issue and timeline management.  The PM roles are now the equivalent of BA roles where you write requirements, use cases, and tech specs, along with some timeline, risk and issues management.  There is no longer any budget, resource, scope or vendor management aspects to the PM roles.  You have no insight as to where you fit into the overall roadmap or where your project fits into the overall company objectives.  Nor are the PMs considered part of the management team, you are considered an individual contributor on the team."
good,been in mando overtime for 3 years. management is awful does not really care about employees. constantly reminds employees they are expendable. No organization. everything is all over the place. so always worried about your job.
good,"Potrei imparare cose nuove, perch√© √® stato il mio primo lavoro in aeroporto. Servito per i passeggeri: il check-in e anche atterraggio."
good,"The fast paced was great, though the management and employees were a little tough. No day was the same. Though, no matter how hard you work, you're looked at like as if you're no different from anyone else."
good,I worked as a flight attendant for over 1 year.  This job is not a job it's a lifestyle that you have to get use to.  It's a cool life to lead but if you have a family it's hard to balance both worlds.  When you first start you are working ever other month on reserve which pretty much means your available to the company 17-21 days out of the month.  I would say try the job and see if it's a good fit for you and your life.
good,not easy to get a position at M & E.  Hangers in summer are impossible for the aged.  To hard to get another position because of bidding rights.
good,"The best position I've ever had. Benefits of free flight was great, but bumping was common. Clucking about never filing bankruptcy after 9-11 was short lived."
good,"Highly structured and confining, elementary school approach to office and treatment of employee's.  Middle management under utilized and overstaffed."
good,"Because the airline is undergoing massive changes to everything familiar in its merger with USAirways, there are so many things that are frustrating. The change process is always challenging, but this change follows on the heels of many labor disputes and near work-stoppages from employees at American Airlines. The employee morale had been at an all-time low. Employees are hoping that this merger will rectify what has been perceived as a lack of good faith within its own company, and from its own management."
good,This position is one of great responsibility without the compensation. It requires self motivation and discipline for there is very little supervision however there is minimal flexibility and growth
good,After their restructuring plan in the bankruptcy session I fell in the company's claws and got laidoff.
good,"Nice days at work with some good employees. Management not very good, lots of intimmidation. Many lazy and unproductive staff, and the hardest part was working and watching over your shoulder because people want to look for a way to make free money from the funny legal system."
good,Good benefits as far as flying. Great disconnect with employees and management. A lot of favoritism. Still are good people in the company. No respect for the small guy
good,Entry level at best. high school environment for the most part.   management tends to pick and choose favorites based to who they like vs who  does  work .
good,"Everything I ever heard about a call center came true at the credit union call center.  All you are is a heartbeat to answer calls and if you are 4 minutes late, you are written up"
good,Just like in any job there are pros and cons. As a flight Attendant there is a lot of time you are away from home and family. You get two raises a year until your 13th year. Flight benefits are beneficial if you have the time to be able to use them. The first few years are hard as you have to work a lot to make a livable income. There are a lot of middle management and sometimes that interferes with the overall culture and morale of the front-line workforce. Most work is done as a team or flight crew. Upper management and administration sometimes do not see the point of view of front-line employees and do not understand their frustrations of lack of necessary equipment needed to provide best service to customers.
good,"It is a decent place to work. They offer above average pay with decent benefits.  It is a great place to work if you are an independent worker, as Management is really lacking."
good,Very unfair with employees who've been there for over 12 years and no record with performance and attendance. Let me go for one mistake without considering anything
good,"US Airways was a pretty darn good company to work for. Decent pay and really good benefits. They actually took good care of the employee.  Now, as American Airlines; they suck in almost every way except pay. The pay got better but that pretty much was due to strong union contract negotiators.  The benefits are some of the worse in the industry and the corporate culture is driven by a bunch of lying backstabbing one-way dweebles. You are little more than a number."
good,It was great at first then everything changed became negative. Different management. Loved being around the aircraft. Only got part time we where told different.
good,"I would take incoming calls book appointments for reservations"
good,Compensation is lower than most industries and companies. Benefits are okay - obviously the travel benefits are the biggest positive to working here above all.
good,"Management is horrible."
good,Must like people and traveling. Otherwise don't bother applying. Because is the people that don't like to travel or people that make the work environment suck and the job unnecessarily more stressful.
good,"We had a lot of down time, the employees don't get paid enough for what they are responsible for doing. work place culture, there is a lot of favoritism in the work place when it comes to females."
good,Pay sucked they don't care that you have a life to attend to they are all about protecting the brand  forger about the seniority rule they have dumbest thing ever.
good,A general day isnt usually too stressful. Too many CHIEFS and not enough INDIANS. Everyone wants to be in charged but do not know what they are doing. Staffing is horrible. Compensation for the role is humorous. Hardest part is meeting the demand but not enough people to do so. Best part of the job is the slower days where you can work effectively. And not like an auto plant
good,"Fast paced busy office with little time to focus on client relations, just get the work done and move on, fast turn over of most positions due to lack of supervisory personnel and benifits."
good,"I had great managers in my area until that awful merger, then the American people arrived and changed the culture from positive to negative. I would never work their again."
good,"challenging in a good way"
good,Empresa bem estruturada porem com uma gerencia que nao tinha perfil para exercer tal funcao.
good,"Great team of people working long hours on a shift rotation basis. Low rate of pay for responsibilities, work hours, and staff shortages."
good,"The good part here is that you get the chance to speak all your different languages you know. Again, love to work with people."
good,"A workable flexible schedule is difficult if you have young children."
good,Enjoyed working there. Great facilities and equipment. Union mentality through and through. Unachievable for any younger A&P due to their current Bankruptcy and Downsizing.
good,"Major changes in the work environment, most are needed but some border on ridicules. A lot of skill and ability will always succeed when given a chance. Great people around you at all levels."
good,"My typical day was spent constantly motivating and problem solving for an excellent staff and multiple teams under my direction. I learned that cultural change in an untrusting environment where leaders spend their efforts minimalizing the work of their peers can only advance at a snails pace, but unique and well developed teams can be successful in spite of the obstacles. I enjoyed and counted on my reports to continue to motivate me by their loyalty and hard work and that the very best of this organization in is the front-line, not the top line. The hardest part of the job was the continuous struggle to correct outmoded and counterproductive policies and procedures, deal with the politics of ruthless peers, and keep an enlightened attitude in the face of total organizational and administrative dysfunction."
good,"stayed busy with customers and freight, performed a lot of tasks."
good,Working around chemicals is the worst part. Our management isn't very good. I like have flight benefits.
good,"good schedule "
good,"Upon Interview, I will discuss my experience at American Airlines and a typical day of reorganization within the company."
good,Unloaded international flights dinnerware. How to load dishwashers. Staying awake. Long breaks.
good,"After working for the company 13 years... I did not feel that it was a career... just an hourly job, that didn't pay well"
good,Average work day assingned to a computer in a cubicle making fixs to data base refinery.
good,"The flight benefits are pretty good. My experience was that the quality and abilities of many of the people in manager positions was severely lacking. Poor leadership seemed to be the norm, not the exception."
good,"The company has gone through many changes  used to be a great company and I would suggest to anyone to work there, now it‚Äôs different.  Hopefully it is coming around and will be great again"
good,American started the HBR program but the CEO always disliked it. Now they are getting rid of the program and forcing employees to leave to other departments within the US
good,"As a pilot for Trans World Airlines, we were stapled to the AA pilot seniority list via a planned bankruptcy proceeding after AA purchased TWA."
good,"The pay is very low relative to other industries.  I think they think they can justify it since they offer non-rev flight benefits.   I got a 50% raise after I left, which can but many RESERVED seats on flights."
good,"It's not WHAT you know, but WHO you know. AA is only worried about bottom lines, not the employees who keep things running. After 9/11, I was ""laid off"" and not even offered a Kleenex - escorted out of terminal, not allowed to speak to anyone to say good-bye. And all this after I got back from Ground Zero, as part of their CARE Team where I attended funerals and took care of victims families. A great big pat on the back. I was ""laid off"" in 2001 and still haven't gotten that phone call to come back..what a joke..."
good,sem avalia√ß√£o porque j√° faz muito tempo e a empresa tem outra cultura
good,No day is the same however everyday can feel the same. I have learned a lot about myself and also about Corp. America.  The management for the company has blinders on or they are willfully ignorant. They know what needs to be done to increase employee moral yet refuse to do it. The hardest part for me was watching something I cared about become riddled with complacency and lack of leadership.
good,"America West was a great company to work for. With both US Airways and American Airlines,  I felt the level of customer service became below standards. With new management,  we were micro managed even though we abided by policy, met deadlines and our work was always completed in a timely manner."
good,Merger was Bad time and caused lots of panic and grief. lots of confusion and lots of work travel. Legacy AA management likes to bully while legacy America West / US Airways are more people friendly.
good,"Good company to work for. Pay package could be better."
good,"The Pros:"
good,"can be a great place to work. you have days where it can be great, but there are also days where you have nothing but customers that want to be completely difficult all day long."
good,"the job itself was easy do to the fact that you only work when planes are schulduled on your gate. the people that you work side by side with are usally on the same page  the hard part is when equipment is not available when you need it  . there alwaqys is a shortage of tugs, belt loaders"
good,"An influx of people needing help, not enough staff to meet needs, over worked, managers under worked,fast pace, nothings goes as planned, but I enjoyed the one on one interaction with customers who needed help"
good,This has been a good place to work.  I‚Äôve advanced.  The medical benefits are good.  The flight benefits have become less valuable since flights in general are very full so hard to fly standby.
good,"la empresa es muy buena con los empleados directos, pero con sus prestadoras de servicio en caso de M√©xico esta mal regulado pues no hay capacitaci√≥n ni se establece su lugar. Se exige como si fueran empleados directos pero no se les capacita ni motiva. Gerentes y supervisores poco empaticos."
good,Great Place to work but if you are new in the company. You have absolutely no Job Work/Life Balance. A thunderstorm can lead to having to work Mandatory Overtime 10-12 hours that day.
good,"Supposed to be a 6mo contract. When I started there was no direction or support. After the first couple weeks, there was someone assigned for support but were never available nor did they respond in a timely manner when emails were sent."
good,I prefer not to answer at this time.  It would be best to simply leave this question unanswered.  I do not believe it would be prudent to speak at any length where it could be  misconstrued.
good,"I have had serious complaints but the local management pushes it under the rug. I can't even work due to the conditions. If the management would care, then the company would be great."
good,"The hardest part of the job are many...long hours, crazy schedules, constant jetlag, dealing with passengers, missing holidays/special events with family and friends, always remaining calm, patient, and flexible, etc."
good,"In reservations, there is little opportunity to advance. It is a good place to work if you like a varied schedule, with opportunities to switch shifts."
good,"It is a good all boy club when it comes to promotions, it not what you know, but who you know. advancement it not base on productivity, education or back ground"
good,"Es una empresa donde se aprenden procedimientos interesantes, y se prueba el potencial de las personas. "
good,Options to move around the company. Many employees stay with American Airlines for their whole career which is unusual to find at other companies. The flight benefits are an added perk.
good,great job that allows you to help people from all walks of life.Management that gave continuing education to enhance and develop customer skills.The hardest part of the job was working with irrational passengers.
good,"I have learned to multi task very well. I can complete operations quickly and effectively with out rebuttal. American Airlines has made me a more well rounded person. Regretfully, I was unable to advance in the positions that I wanted and the pay grade was not very encouraging for the amount of work that we were assigned. "
good,"create baggage claim report in the system, to follow up and update status of loss.  do inventory and stock warehouse to identify poss matches,  customer service, answer phone calls"
good,"A typical work day may vary due to the nature of the industry, sunny clear skies could be deceiving, and may not account for mechanical delays, overbooking etc. Incliment weather conditions ie: severe thunder storms, snow, and heavy rain would also bring challenging days.  Learned some unique  things about  human behavior and the passenger experience expectation throughout the nearly ten year tenure."
good,"The culture in which I worked depended on what day it was. Some days employees get along and work together, other times the cliquish mentality would kick in and that would leave some employees feeling left out and ignored by both management and employees"
good,"Loved this job! Loved the customers, the work, the benefits, the ability to get people where they needed to be with a smile on my face. There are lots of rules, however they are for safety and regulations. Dave was the worst supervisor I have come across in a long time."
good,Cuenta con buen nivel de trabajo tienen todas las prestaciones ley
good,The training was excellent and the seasoned teammates are amazing. But there exists a lack of care for employees. As well a blizzard in another state can cancel your own personal requested time off and result in a write up if you can't come to work because you are in the middle of your vacation away from home.
good,Employees are very under appreciated by management. Being in the front line isn't easy. Management tends to hide in the office when the going gets tough. Employees have to rely on each other for support. Pay/benefits have improved with the recent merger and unionization of the work force.
good,Never get appreciated for the hard work you do. Just more for the mistakes you do. Its very stressful. Have to be a calm peson. Even the calms person will get frustrated.
good,"It's a tough environment - low pay and lots of hours. However, if this is in industry you love (travel and aviation) and you have a desire to problem solve with customers in a fast paced environment - then this company is probably as good as any other mainline. Msnagement is average to poor - more reactive than proactive and lots of turnover."
good,American Airlines offers great benefits and discounts to it's  employees. It is a great company to work for if you love traveling.
good,The company is stable and a leader in the aviation industry. An the operation is a twenty four hours seven days a week operation.
good,"I liked the small office culture in the big company setting. The overall manager was such a nice lady. She sent out for sandwiches and cookies for us all the time. The work was interesting, and made the day go by faster. It was a first to deal with unions, but the people were usually very nice when they came to our office."
good,"Early departures long days of duty time, non existent management that was never to be of any significant use, most workers tired and pushed to the limit."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Answered telephone calls regarding airline policies and information, and created and updated airline reservations for customers."
good,unstable lifestyle. Poor compensation. If you want to move back with your parents or live with a thousand room mates then this may be the job for you.
good,"Good company, but one not well positioned to sustain momentum in difficult economic conditions"
good,"I appreciate the diversified clientele and co workers experience.  It is vital in the travel industry to be award of your customers cultural and geographical needs.  Although I am self managed and currently work as a home based full time agent I have worked in the call center environment for the first four years with the company.  The challenges more presently have to do with the instability of the industry due to bankruptcy of American Airlines, merger with US Air and restructuring of company has let an uncertain future if I remain in my current position.  I love the excitement of dealing directly with the traveling public in building itineraries, changing existing reservations,re booking travelers due to delays and cancellations, dealing with distraught passengers is actually an enjoyable part of my job due to the fact that helping to find difficult solutions and meet their needs gives me personal satisfaction.  I also love to travel!!"
good,"Equipe formal, qualificada e escolhida com um prop√≥sito: tornar a experi√™ncia de voar uma incr√≠vel realidade."
good,On a typical day at work I deal with many situations and various personalities.  Because I work on a plane decisions have to be made swiftly and firmly.  Many times I may be the only voice of reason.
good,It was a nice job. lots of time lines to meet each month.  most of the management has a problem with telling the truth.  Would go back to work for them had good insurance easy to get time off when you need it.  flex time was great.  working at home part time was ok.  they like to out source work thought.
good,Good coworkers. Hardest part of job was trying to make cutomer service happy and it is kind of difficult on this bussiness but we made it happen every day.
good,‚Ä¢ Managed and audited Aircraft Maintenance ‚Äúbills of work‚Äù and flow.
good,"The people at American Airlines make it a great place to work. A new member of the senior leadership team once said, ""American Airlines is a banking institution that happens to own an airline"". I think that says a lot about the company."
good,"Corporate culture is great however seems to vary drastically from department to department. Little room for advancement, no corporate training programs, worked 60-80 hours per week."
good,"Work in a department where you get no respect from other departments, yet the other departments revolve around decisions that you make. No support from management."
good,"Exciting and Fun job with Fantastic Co-workers and Great Travel Opportunities"
good,"The first 3 years are the toughest as everything is seniority based. The job is flexible however , there is a period of time for at least the first year where you only know your days off and the other days you remain on call (available to the company, must be at airport with in 2 hours of them calling ) when they need you. After 3 years it‚Äôs definitely a better schedule. Pay is great and I personally believe it‚Äôs worth the wait. 6 weeks unpaid training in Dallas however they pay for hotel and feed you 3x a day"
good,"Entitlements, assumptions are large issues that along with accountability are never addressed among the technicians union, of the two devil's neither the twu or the iam are the answer, grouping them with other classifications was and will continue to be an issue .Then comes management,higher management they don't just want their cake ;"
good,Management needs work. Too much time away from home family and friends. Missed out on most holidays. Work a lot of ground time/sit time without pay. Over all ok.. fun travels and great coworkers
good,"Pay and flight benefits were the only good thing about this company. Mandatory overtime was issued ALOT for an additional 4 hours along with your shift. Shifts are based on seniority as well and there‚Äôs people who‚Äôve been there 30+ years with the good shift while you have midday/3rd. Management is not helpful and does not take time to get to know each employee personally. Lastly, the amount of stress that comes from dealing with irate passengers all day because of cancelled flights or things you can‚Äôt control is not worth it."
good,"Management is horrible and there is a total lack of consistency within the department. Horrible training and you are expected to work as if you had great training.  Even FREE FLIGHTS are not worth the mental drain of working here."
good,"The beginning was fun.  My first manager was amazing, the second one, not so much.  It used to be easy to fly for little to free, but now it's impossible.  AA oversells flights making it hard for employees to use the benefits."
good,"Unpredictable working for an airline especially one of the largest in the world.  Work day was always hard.  Had to get back into the mode of providing an even decision making skill while maintaining the guidelines. "
good,"I enjoyed learning the inner workings of an airline, but it is very much a standard corporate setting. You hard work is not rewarded as much as it should, and it is more about who you know."
good,"America West was a great company to work for. With both US Airways and American Airlines, I felt the level of customer service became below standards. With new management, we were micro managed even though we abide by policy, met deadlines and our work was always completed in a timely manner."
good,"Managed 6 Technicians. Assigned duties to technicians daily as well as weekly, and followed up on completion. Worked alongside the technicians to assist with repairs. Gained ‚ÄúTrain the Trainer‚Äù Forklift Operator certification while employed, and trained the Service Techs in my department, as well as other regional employees. Daily and weekly conference calls from station managers in the region to update on status of repairs and preventative maintenance schedules. Managed parts ordering with local and international vendors from standard to complex components. Stocked and organized parts rooms for multiple airlines. Corresponded with ramp managers for additional service and preformed daily status updates on equipment. Traveled to multiple stations in the region to aid in completion of work load. Performed monthly OSHA checklist on shop status and safety. Most of the service provided was on heavy duty diesel and gas powered machinery including electrically powered equipment up to 480v."
good,I believe American Airlines portrays a good public image but at present they are struggling internally. The merger with US Air has resulted in a clash of two cultures and the old American Airlines management team is being systematically eliminated. This has developed a culture of mistrust.  AA has always paid well and offered great flight benefits along with taking care of their team members.  The taking care of their team members is not such a crucial element anymore.
good,"Station agents never know when they will be leaving work for the day. If planes are delayed for weather or other reasons, you could be there well until the next shift of agents arrive for work. I do not know how single parents ever handled childcare responsibilities. Mandatory overtime was expected. It was nearly impossible to keep people on staff. At least, this was my experience when I was there."
good,It‚Äôs an ok job. However the supervisors made it harder than it should with their lack of leadership when it came to pulling there own weight and owning up to responsibility.
good,"Depending on the airport you work in, work can be insane or it can be mundane. "
good,You learn new things only when its convenient for them. Never show up. Can't keep employees. Tell you a new schedule without 24 hour notice. Payroll is always wrong.
good,At American we were allowed to do temporary assignment till the US airways merger.  Then they stopped. I would not suggest a flight attendant position if you are looking to advance in company.
good,"The benefits American Airlines has to offer are great in & of themselves."
good,Overall good for younger people looking for something to do outside of the home. Not so good for someone that is driven and looking to further better themselves as a leader.
good,I learn about IT but the work environment was ok the training was basic but you learn more while you‚Äôre on the floor in the department we were more Help Deak resetting passwords trouble shooting with computer issue
good,Material Logistics is basically the store room for the plane mechanics. The work is not difficult and there are really good days there. Everything goes by seniority and sometimes theres favoritism. The pay is not great if this is your only job but flight benefits do come in handy. I'd work here again if the had a part time position that would fit my schedule.
good,Generally speaking there is a lot of management in IT. You will need to ask permission to do virtually anything. Typical day includes numerous meetings.
good,"Needs massive overhaul managers lack communication with employees,too much favoritism,employees treated work as a game area"
good,There are a lot of great people working at this company. Peers and coworkers all work together trying to help anyone who needs anything. However there is a great chasm between subordinates and management. This gap fosters a us vs them mentality and it is felt throughout the company unfortunately. If I e is lucky enough to be assigned a good manager then you will succeed in ways you never dreamed however if assigned a bad one then you are as good as dead in the water.
good,"A typical day working for American Airlines is very long and heavy. Depending on the number of customers that day. You also have to work wheter its raing, sleet, or snow."
good,I would say this was a great place to work my first 13 years and the last year was difficult working with US merger and bad management..  Benefits are great which compensates for the low pay. It's sad management makes the big bucks.and any position under management makes minimalism wages.
good,"The role of an airport CSM is challenging, exhausting, stressful and demanding. Yet...it can be extremely rewarding when employees/customers are happy!"
good,"My first position at American Airlines was as staff assistant, with no benefits.  I enjoyed this role, just wished it had not been temporary.  My second position was working from home helping customers make their flight arrangements.  I enjoyed this job, and would still be there, except for the schedule changes endured every quarter.  I feel that we should have been able to select a schedule that worked for us and stay with it, instead of having to change so often."
good,"This was a very nice job, I just wish that there was better management. Unlimited potential but hours & pay we‚Äôre a little bit shabby. Coworkers were amazing."
good,"Airline catering for American Airlines, Japan Airlines ,Lufthansa, KLM, Air France and charter airlines. It was a Twenty four hour operation, requiring shift work."
good,Company is changing computer system and replacing it again within the year. Management is more concerned with on time departures than customer service.
good,"Dealing daily with angry customers.  As long as you kept a positive attitude and not take anything personal you'd be ok. Slowly turning into a call center, and that's not my preference of work."
good,Under staffed for work load and upper management didn't understand programs limitations.  hang on to old ideas too long and too slow to change directions when needed
good,"I have to sit all the  time , have to look at screen for 10hrs ... fingers on keyboard  have to take calls after calls n I don't like that anymore ..."
good,"I dedicated alot to this job unfortunately as a single mom this industry is not forgiving to us no matter how much we put into our work ethic. "
good,They need better management and pay. The probation period is the most difficult time to get through because you can not call out at all. Easiest way to stick around is show up on time.
good,The job was fun and I made a lot of good friends and traveled . I like working with the public most of the time and met some very nice people. Company did not want to deal with union contracts and then it just fell apart with the merger and employees were passed over. some prejudice with mangers and higher ups.
good,"great as secondary income, shift work,have to bid for shifts, blind leading blind sometimes. no real interaction with employees because your hooked to phone all the time."
good,"I worked for AA before the bankruptcy restructuring in 2012 and the US Airways acquisition so things must be a lot different now.  At the time I was there, hierarchy was very important and employee attitudes toward management were very sour (understandably).  From my friends who have stayed through the transition, it seems to have been a positive thing."
good,This job was physically demanding and taught me how to be able to work at any point on any day. I learned customer service and how to handle situations with tact and grace. I was also trained medically for quite a few different possible things that could happen while flying. The hardest part of the job was that it is hard on your body and makes you tired. The best part of the job was traveling to fun places.
good,"Passengers tough to deal with flying is boring at times. Most people good to fly with. Mgt tough to deal with too much time away from home, no extra work beyond flying activities"
good,"Bags Inc. is a good place to work but a very fast paced environment, you have a uniform code, and there is a lot of training to complete before you can start"
good,A typical day at work will be arriving at 6am checking the indirects meaning checking cargo that arrive and are ready to be picked up by the customer. Dailly their is 6 flights that have to be completed by the end of your shift. Completing a reporting sheet of the flights with all the correct information of each cargo.You are very active with phone calls and e-mails. Co-workers are friendly the environment is calm mostly all worker get along with all the other agents.
good,The pay and hours of work do not match the physical labor you must endure. Working outside in all weather conditions. The positive aspect of the job is the flight benefits.
good,"Overall, a good place to work.  Plenty of opportunities to move around and learn other aspects of the company and airline industry."
good,Fun work place because of coworkers. All about the numbers and getting jets out on time. They care more about the protection of planes then your safety.
good,took the job thinking it had great layovers but haven't been successful at all definitely not the type of job i thought it would be
good,"Its Fun to work at as long as you working with mainline. Have its everyday issues like cancellation flights and angry customers that need to be help but overall its a great company to work with i will only recommend the customer service area if you have great computer skills and a lot of patience to deal with angry passengers... Really good gain a lot of experience from it in all Areas,, Customer service, management."
good,"Extremely proud and excited with my role prior to the merger.  Many persons roles changed due to duplication of responsibilities.  Miss the people, but needed a change and challenge."
good,"High pressure, fast paced environment with a great deal of exposure to different clientele.  Everyday is a new challenge which creates an exciting atmosphere to work."
good,I loved working at American airlines because they do offer great benifits
good,"Come in get your assignments, do your jobs, get the supplies you need for your job, then go home to family. try to be quick but be right first. Management was management, Some was good to talk to, get help from, help you when you needed them and others had to watch your back. Making sure you were right with the regulations. The people that was helpful, then going home to family"
good,I like the people I worked with but the schedule changes about every four months so you never know what days off and hours you will be working.
good,The customer can be rude and unhappy and expect you to create miracles
good,"The experiences we all have in life are what one makes of it. The amount of training and experience received in my my sixteen years was tremendous. Qualified on seven different fleet types, worked three separate bases, and nine different work areas was an experience of a lifetime."
good,"American Airlines was a good sometimes great company to work for.I was proud to work there for most of my 23 years.I made sure I earned my keep going beyond and achieving excellence.My former co-workers are all good people ,almost all good workers.The hardest part of the job was lack of honesty and too many hidden agendas,Union and Management alike. Most enjoyable part was laughing,sweating,and getting the job with my friends.Meeting the daily challenges and adjusting on the go,the current Union staff is the best in the country .The soldiers are good,the generals weak."
good,"So many changes to the Industry completely overwhelmed the company. THE industry leader for a long time in the 80's and 90's when it had a reasonable business model. It worked hard to build and maintain its brand. Since that time it has been a constant, slow decline with weak management to counteract internal and external threats."
good,‚Ä¢ Track rotable parts and materials with shops and stores to insure aircraft schedules are meet.
good,"A typical day is very busy from start to finish. I learned the fundamentals of managing inventory, forecasting and problem solving. I had opportunities to work with various teams on projects that were very rewarding."
good,I was started American Airlines in 1991 to oct 30th laid-off so experience cleaning Plane's inside stuff dirty and put some supply each lavatory also galley kitchen and seat pockets ....
good,Its a good company with good benefits. Airline industry is very challenging and competitve these days. so lots of competition and need to remain on top of everything.
good,"Great company to work for, been with American for 28 years. Due to recent downsizing and possible layoffs, many including myself are seeking employment outside the company. Due to current reductions in force, all additional workload is being distributed among all other employees who are currently overworked."
good,Its a job that is truly 24/7 with a lot interesting people you meet everyday. A typical day at the airport is always a new adventure and you learn a lot about yourself.
good,"Compensation was very good, Very little respect for the contribution for it's labor force. The constant seeking to find problems with there workers makes for a very combative and mistrusting relationship between labor and management."
good,"Its a nice place,flying benefits are beneficial and working environment is good if you have good workers that work with you..but that's the best atibute"
good,Needs better structure and leadership not afraid to hold employees accountable. The company is skiddish when dealing with unionized employees. The company needs to develop a stronger stance.
good,Without flight benefits the job would not be worthwhile. No guarantee to leave work at your schedule time. Unionized front line group with little to no respect.
good,"Great benefits and yearly pay increases and bonuses. "
good,I interact with people daily through phone and in person. I've learned to be very personable with people. Workplace culture could be better and managers need to be better trained.
good,"As , Hispanic, working at ORD; I NEVER experienced anywhere the level of racism, bigotry and unmitigated hatred from white workers and chief TWU union reps. Management was right in bed with this vile racism. Pathetic. Sickening."
good,"Work - life balance is non-existent and upper management does not support nor empower the managers who are leading the teams doing the work. (My immediate manager was awesome, however.)  Very little opportunity to advance from within."
good,"American Airlines is headed into a new direction, which has caused a lot of change and turnover. The change will be good in some areas like restructuring team objectives to accomplish goals but the open area office layout kind of seems too much."
good,stay out of customer service positions if you do not have the ability to control customer conversations over the phone. Be prepared to be bullied by low level supervisors!
good,"Overall the company has great pay and amazing benefits but it is an extremely stressful job, and they have no pity for people who have medical conditions. It is very easy to get in trouble for attendance there, they have no leeway with any excuse you give them. If you have a flat tire, you get pulled over, your kid is sick, etc. If you can‚Äôt make it to work you will be written up and it will take a whole year for it to leave your record. If you reach a certain amount of occurrences they will give you warning letters that will eventually lead to you being fired. The kicker with that is the managers will decide if you get a letter or not so there were a lot of managers favorites who were absent frequently but never received a warning letter on their records."
good,Although I liked my job there were somethings that could be better. Due to the high demands of the job there is a high turn over rate. All in all the job it self wasn't hard.
good,"The Agile culture is the most amazing I have seen in many organizations. The ability to have all stakeholders in a room for a day or two of iterations to look into the possibilities results in a high-quality product. The team's collaboration and spirit are amazing and it produces code with few defects.  "
good,"Benefits of travel are awesome. Benefits of travel are awesome. When writing your review, please consider the following guidelines:"
good,"American Airlines have many things to offer an employee. From a work culture that is generally designed to keep you motivated to the ultimate benefit of free travel. As a past employee I would advise that this is not the job for everyone. The day to day stress of properly serving your customer is tested daily. The customer service position is not for a new rep to try out and I would recommend this to seasoned customer service reps who can easily detect when the customer is getting tense and proactively work to calm and customer down as well as helping them within the guidelines of American "
good,"Depending on the station and management,  this is a great job to have. "
good,Great place to work but not for a career if you a family person. Not enough money to take care you and your family. You do not advance in this company unless you know somebody
good,As long as you don't work at MIA and speak spanish you should be good working with American Airlines. Managers are not very smart or helpful and only know how to manage people more than deal with people
good,A typical day at work for me consisted of assessing the operation and staffing levels to make sure we had the right resources to deliver great customer service and handle the operation.
good,"The work environment is okay,relaxed and productive.it has its pros and cons.the biggest concern is pay.the pay isn‚Äôt too good.theres been protest by the employees against the union asking for more pay.overall I would give the job a fair rating though"
good,I retired due to bankruptcy and loss of pension. Union leadership was pro management and disingenuous in their communication with our group. Heartbraking.
good,"More political and some of the MD's need more training on how to handle / work with employees. "
good,"The Company offers many opportunities for learning and advancement, but the location I would prefer is not slated for far future.  If you are interested in relocating the company would offer many exciting opportunities and benefits for a long term career."
good,great for those who want to travel the world and have no attachments or home duties and responsibilities. also you must be willing to relocate to any base the airline has
good,I was a contractor in a six moth role and can only speak to that experience. AA was definitely burning out their contractors thought the merger. The only real issue was the amount of time worked against actually getting paid for the actual time worked. I have heard that has since changed. Fast paced work environment and too many meetings with the amount of work that needed to get completed. Felt the culture was good but a lot of managers had different initiatives and direction was some times not clear as to what the priority was. That was probably the most difficult part of the job. Resources were over allocated causing many projects to be delayed or of poor quality. Most enjoyable would have been the people I had the opportunity to work with and the type of work we got to perform.
good,A great place to work if you are provided with the right manager who knows how to treat their employees. A place for advancement if you are in the right state.
good,"This is a manageable working environment, if you remain flexible and follow the established job description. "
good,Good group of employees. Rewards for great customer service. Can travel free anywhere American flies in the United States and pay only taxes and fees for International Travels.
good,Good work and life balance environment. Lots of opportunities to move between various departments. Excellent flight benefits.  Fair benefits with okay salary
good,"It seems like sometimes passengers think that Airlines Agents are not as frustrated and unhappy as they are when there is a canceled or delayed flight. Actually it makes our job harder when those unexpected situation happen. Agents as Passengers, we don't want these to happen, we want our day to go peacefully and serve our customers with so much pride and joy; and passengers want to benefit,use and enjoy the service they paid hundreds of dollar for."
good,"It can become very difficult at times to wanting to wake up every day to work here with so much negativity surrounding you. Everything is based on bidding, that is how you attain a shift, and your schedule can move around."
good,"No backing from management. You must follow the rules but then management will break the rules in front of you making you look like an idiot."
good,Good people to work with. Very busy operation with a small terminal for passengers. First real jet. Airline went bankrupt and everyone lost their job.
good,Work culture is a little lack luster. There is a big divide between management and workers. Benefits are pretty decent. Major perk is that you can fly for free.
good,"The work there was pretty simple,  the office politics were over the top.   The flight benefits were nice,  however,  they tended to pay much less than the industry standards for senior level positions."
good,"Working 4 four hours shift 5 day a week with 2 days on. Typical day involve preparing oneself mentally and physically for daily operations within the airline for flight checking and departures. Interacting with various personalities and cultures for all over the world. Always new airlines procedures that pop on the job, new situations both internally and externally. Customers missing there flights and need help because they may not know what steps to take to get home or to their business. Always extending oneself to help customers. Hardest part of the job when flights are delayed and cancelled which disrupts our customers travel plans and life. This always affects time spent at the airport so if I had plans that would go out the door.  most enjoyable points is when you finish boarding that aircraft it pushes off with a ontime departure."
good,"Once the aircraft arrive, we download luggage and/or cargo from the bin. After this is done, we upload the aircraft with luggage/cargo thats going to that particular destination. I learned a lot about time management and preplanning with this job."
good,"challenging work environment. Long hours. Good benefits. Good opportunity for advancement if you are willing to relocate. No pension for lower management, but they have a 401k match."
good,"Management a little disorganized but overall a good place to work. Co-workers were nice and helpful when needed. Most upper management are former field operations staff, very knowledgeable of the airline industry."
good,"Job can be stressful during high travel time."
good,"Atendimento de Check-in, Procedimentos de Seguran√ßa Internacional, Facilitador do Setor de Bagagens, Tarifa√ß√£o, Auxiliar de TI, Marca√ß√£o e Altera√ß√£o de reservas e cobran√ßa de taxas, Coordenador de Embarque Internacional de Passageiros, Opera√ß√µes de Conclus√£o e Fechamento de V√¥o. Ao final, j√° desempenhava a√ß√µes de supervisor da √°rea de seguran√ßa."
good,"Scheduled Airline reservations and rental cars in a call center environment. "
good,"This job was very hard. we did so much for so little. a typical day at work would be to push people heavier than yourself around until they are set to go while hoping to be tipped. My co-workers were very nice and motivating, other than that, i would not go back to this place."
good,"Direct and lead research projects using aircraft operational data"
good,"Long days and hours"
good,Enjoyed solving various maintenance problems.  Training personnel on equipment and procedures.  Management was very engaged.  Co-workers were from all walks of life & learned a lot from them.  Hardest part of job was the hours (midnights & weekends).  Most enjoyable was seeing your work fly away in the morning.
good,i like working for american airlines i feel that i take away something every day from my customers because they're all different and you can actually learn from them. its difficult when you get a customer who is already frustrated and it seems there is nothing you can do to please them but overall i never end a call unresolved. the supervisors are good with checking in monthly to see how you are doing and to let you know what areas need improvement or just to tell you how good of a job you are doing.
good,It was just a job to hold while I figured out what I wanted to do.
good,"A reasonably decent place to work, if you don't mind working outside in any and all weather conditions.  Job security was the biggest problem - the company out-sourcec many stations, including the one where I was working."
good,"Good Company to work for, worked as consultant, good managers and followed agile. Awesome J2ee development team,  Most of us were consultants except upper  management."
good,Co workers a great plus good work environment and safety a plus 
good,I recently injured myself on the job. I have a permanent lifting restriction and can no longer perform my job duties as defined by the company.
good,Constant struggle with Management vs Union.  Difficult to get jobs done due to Union; especially when there was a time crunch involved.  The shift rotation for Supervisors was terrible.  Usually received support from management on non-union issues.  
good,"I nice place to work, depending of your job's duties you have to travel a lot. Good work environment. "
good,"I would start early and get all the required cleaning agents and equipment needed for parts. My co-workers and I maintained a clean, organized, and team work oriented work enviroment."
good,"A very busy operation,everything has to be done in a timely fashion,starting my day as a coordinator and scheduling personel as well as organizing and rerouting,you learn how to accomplish a task by maximizing whatever amount of heads to be productive,given that, you are aloted a limited time-slot for every task,however I've learned over the years effective production and quality control.But at the end of the day it becomes gratifying when the operation runs sucessfully due to the teamwork.I believe,the sucess of every company is based on it's employee's perfomance. The part of the job that i found very interesting,was being exposed to people from walks of life(social & economic) as well as cultures and nationalities.At times making life-long friendships and being able to travel internationally."
good,"Wonderful group of people to work with. Everyday was challenging, but always different. I really learned how to listen. Very important to know exactly what your customer is expecting of you so that you can help them. The pay was great as were the benefits. Hardest part was the lack of balance with work and family. Almost a 24 hour operation with almost no balance of good family time. Even with 26 years of service, could not have a weekend or holiday off without great sacrifice."
good,People are great to work with. Fast paced and varied clientele make for fun and exciting days.
good,"A typical day at would involved ensuring area was a safe work environment for the employees. Working directly with my front line leadership team to accomplish the requirements to get work done to properly flow aircraft. I learned how to deal with people, both positively and negatively. I learned a lot of management skills on how to run and know the business. The hardest part of my job was being the middle man between the union and management. I had to work directly with the front line employees to produce output and explain to my boss why certain things didn't get accomplished. I enjoyed working with my co workers on the other shift. We had a good working relationship and was on the same team. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the crew chiefs and employees. We had a lot of mutual respect and they performed well for me."
good,Anyone that has worked at an aircraft repair facility will know what it's like here. I have visited many MRO's and I don't see much of a difference.
good,A typical day consist of taking inbound calls and addressing customers needs.
good,"The group I was in had a chauvinistic tyrant, so I really didn't enjoy my time there."
good,You work different shifts all by seniority with the company. Great money if you work a lot some what stressful at times. You make many friends and work like a team.
good,I loved working with my colleagues and the fringe benefits of free flights was well worthwhile. I would recommend this job for those reasons and those reasons only.
good,A company that's doing well financially but not inclined to share with employees.. plus needing a cultural change immediately. AA has potential to be a great company to work for however there's quite a bit of changing the mindset of the leadership.
good,"Work in all types of weather, rain, snow, or shine. Your out to grind. Depending on location determines how you are treated. Some mangers treat their crews like family and others like scum of the earth. Have to be able to deal with unhappy travelers also."
good,"It was an okay work environment. The management was all over the place. There was barely a clear direction, but the benefits were good. The pay could be way better as well. My coworkers were wonderful though."
good,American Airline is one of the best company who really helps his employees tol explore the world with their flight benefit. One of their mejor priority is their customer hapiness
good,"we work 12-14 hrs / day on a typical day , managers are nice but people who work are not given their due recognition. every one is considered in the same category.It does sponsors visa for employment so good for people looking for sponsorship."
good,"The culture changed when US Airways merged with American Airlines. Although they preach no age discrimination, I saw more and more of the older folks being let go and more and more H1-B folks filling positions."
good,"Although the job itself is one of the most desirable jobs out there. It is quickly losing the flexibility it once had, and the compensation does not match the sacrifices made. I had a great first two years even with the compensation being so low, however in the last year the work life balance has completely disappeared and my salary has not budged. The benefits are great and its an industry that continues to grow and ideally is great for someone in a dual income household. It is the perfect job if you can do it part time so that you can still be home."
good,"It was a good experience, I would work there again. The job is not for everyone, theres alot of heavy lifting alot of bending and customer service. It's a good job though"
good,"Interviewed after just turning 23 and the train was two months later. Trying was fun  would say it was like an adult summer camp. But when we got to our base, our apartment we chose was awful. I slept on the floor the first night until my grandparents brought an air mattress."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with . However it was very stressful . Often the planes were late and baggage would be lost, passengers were often rude when you helped them."
good,"The thing I liked the most about American Airlines were the travel perks.  I did not have children when I worked there, so it worked out great for me to travel a lot.  The downside was having to work weekends, holidays and all types of shifts depending on the bid."
good,I think desktop support is largely the same everywhere you go. Pay slightly lower than the industry average for contractors. 80% of the techs are contractors waiting to be hired on. Often waiting for YEARS and occasionally laid off and brought back. If you care about actively managing your career I would pass on these guys.
good,I cannot go into details about the dynamics of my day to day operations at American. I am not allowed to disclose these details at this time. The day to day activities change
good,Builds you to deal with high stress. Must be able to work in a fasr paced setting. Deal with union employees. Prepare to work long days and physically exhustaion.
good,decent place to work at most of the time they really do work you hard oveer their so just be prepared for all of that. for the most part its a friendly place to work
good,"Historically a legacy carrier with unique culture but recently management is making changes to improve and modernize internal company culture."
good,Lack of care for their employees..  don‚Äôt ever get sick bc you‚Äôll get penalized. Union is lacking and falls short no matter how much you call them. Management needs better training and people skills.
good,"loved working for AA, you get to meet a lot of amazing people."
good,"My manager has been wonderful, but American Airlines has an organization does not value its employees. Work rules are designed to maximize profits, and encourage decisiveness among the various work groups. You can make it work if you are resourceful, and as you gain seniority."
good,"All the different people you get to work with, friends made for life. A learning experience nearly every day. Valuable skills learnt that will allow you to improve your work ability now and for the future."
good,AA is one of the best airlines and continues to lead other carriers in innovation and customer service. There are opportunities for advancement if you are willing to relocate.
good,There‚Äôs a tv open to all workers to watch.wonderful place to work other then when the weather is bad out. A lot of the staff are also wonderful people once you get to know them.
good,"American has a ""always busy"" culture, but the people are great - so at least you are being busy with people who care.  The flight benefits are incredible, but the company needs to find additional incentives beyond this."
good,"Performed my job as necessary, safely and efficiently as possible. I worked for American Airlines thru 9/11, bankruptcy and Reduction in Force all while perform my job and giving American Airlines the best product possible."
good,American Airlines has been an eventful place to work. I have experienced everything from engine changes and flight control rigging to basic aircraft servicing in my time employed. Great place to advance knowledge in aircraft maintenance.
good,home office work with great pay. the management is black and white seem to be looking for a reason to cut staff. overall flexible and a good place to work
good,"Overall American Airlines is a fabulous company to work for.  I have been on 3 separate teams across 2 different departments, and what team your on makes night and day difference for the work environment."
good,Enjoy benefits and assisting passengers. As with all jobs you can sometimes feel unappreciated. Being yelled at and called names by passengers can be mentally draining. You have to have tough skin.
good,"Fun and friendly staff, same work schedule with set hours ,depending on the flights. Hired as part time but actually was getting way more hours. Great flight benefits but not able to use the benefits."
good,"it was a good company to work for with many experiences to be had. The traveling was a great plus. However, the union does not have as much control as they should"
good,"Acted as a liaison to manage and facilitate audits, investigations, irregularities, and fines received from the FAA(FARs), TSA, DOT, OSHA, EPA, and other regulatory agencies, resulting in immediate action plan to provide corrective solutions."
good,A typical day at AA can be all over the place. the days are usually packed with meetings and I'm not sure anything is really getting done. It takes forever to get decisions made or to move projects forward because it has to be vetted by many people and the executive leaders make the decisions on EVERYTHING. The company makes decisions based on the feedback or complaints of one person that affects the masses. The company culture could use some tweaking and they could definitely benefit from having more diversity. They tend to place emphasis on higher education if you come from the outside and they pay accordingly. The hardest part about the job are the way decisions are made and the length of time it takes to do anything. The most enjoyable part are the great people that you work with.
good,A very stressful work place and can be more female friendly  To work there you must be patient and calm  You must be able to take a fast pace job and realize that problems arise and you must be able to resolve those issues to the passengers satisfation
good,Overworked and Underpaid is the best way to describe this working environment. Great place to work just not paid enough to live off of for about 2 years.
good,"The flight benefits were amazing. Their marketing department left something to be wanted however all of the employees were super nice. "
good,"This is a great job if you like to be outside, it is a very physical and heavy job. The best part of the job is to be able to take off or pick up extra hours in a day.  The insurance is very good, and you can fly if there is a seat available."
good,The company appeared to be a great company. Some of the staff were not. They offered great benefits.  I do not have anything further to say in regards to this company.
good,On a daily basis it was very satisfying work. It was a wonderful opportunity to meet the needs of the passengers while affording me an opportunity to visit other countries and experience other cultures.
good,Many changes going on with the industry during my tenure. At first slow to stagnate upgrades. Then rapid growth with addition of over 75 new CRJs. I enjoyed working with the professionals crews.
good,"Can't say enough about American. First real job after USAF,"
good,The work place culture was very professional and motivating. The organization is very focused on training and promoting volunteer programs. There are many opportunities for advancement.
good,"American Airlines is a great place to work, however you will deal with some difficult people, and that comes with most customer centered jobs. Overall I enjoy my job."
good,"After the merger of US Airways, the company has really plummeted down a hole.  Introducing the optimizer (longer days, shorter layovers), a new sick policy, and a scheduling system that does not work have taken the working conditions to an unfortunately discouraging level.  Employees don't feel valued and, in fact, feel related to Robots.  Benefits such as travel really no longer exist because of low sale prices and oversold flights.  Even the launching of toxic uniforms solidifying how little the company really cares about its employees.  Sadly, it is no longer the company I was proud to work for even just a year ago."
good,good company to work for and I would like to continue working for this company. their incentives are great and I am pleased to received them. mangers are great
good,"Part of the team involved in the End to End Testing of Life of Flight for the Single FOS Partition."
good,"Management isn't the best. By AA being a 24/7 operation, work days are pretty long but busy. The hardest part was working on all Holidays. The most enjoyable part was the flight benefits."
good,Doing all at the same time but makes sure that everything will be done as good as I can. Giving full customer service experience to the guest. And helping each other to be able to operate flights and on-time departure.
good,A career at northern airports can be challenging and rewarding at the same time. I enjoyed my time helping people get to their destinations to be with family and friends.
good,There is no explanation of the amount of knowledge that I gained here. The people were for the most part very fun to work with and knowledgeable of their positions.
good,Was able to travel if I wanted to.  However it was standby. Benefits were good. Just wished they did not farm out their work to other companies and lay there employees off.
good,stressful job working with lots of passengers at one time. managers with no airline experience trying to run the show. the best part of the job is the flying benefits. if you like to fly and see the world than this job is for you.
good,"Good company just not for me. The union was horrible. The boss was fair but the union ""brothers"" wanted more  than the company could give so it put a lot of us out of work."
good,"American airlines is a great place to work.My experience with them was one of the best.I encourage other people to try it if it is possible.Because the have good structure, with them you can learn how to be on time, how to work under pressure, how to be organize, etc.."
good,"Remain extremely focused , professional at all times . Trained to handle any type of crisis situation, physically fit for lifting & carrying luggage for clients , giving clients the rules on a boarding the plane"
good,"Worked through 2 mergers and for 3 different companies. The culture at American is not as good as working for the other 2 companies. Adopting American culture was not a good idea. "
good,Answer phone call after call was too much. That was many years ago and now you can make your own reservations which is much better. I would not work there again.
good,"Supportive and nice colleague  on GSE shop,Good Supervisor and crew chief,more task  and busy sometimes,supportive crew chief and co worker.Love to see airplane everyday on job site."
good,The company focuses more on tiny things and bullied by QC persons instead of mentored and helpful! Cubicles are aligned with clicks and groups that harassed individuals in near by areas and were noisy to what their neighbor is doing. Management didn't discourage this behavior.
good,"Overall, a great place and company to work for. The management is very knowledgeable and helpful. It was very nice to be able to travel for a very minimum cost."
good,"Nice people to work with, for management we are just numbers."
good,"I learned time management and cultural diversity. There is no hard  part of the job. However, assignments need to be done in a timely manner. Management assistance needs to improve."
good,"A typical day was answering calls for eight hours while reserving flights and collecting payments. I learned how to better deflect anger from customers, and also how to keep conversations going while processing information in to the computer. I learned to have patience while trusting my instincts."
good,"Many of the people working there are rude & very disrespectful , it was alright starting off but some people try to take advantage of you while working there,"
good,"Depends on the department.  Antiquated company from top to bottom.  Claims to be working to be the best in the industry, but have yet to see any progress."
good,"American is one of the largest and best airlines in the world. As a place to work it was great at the time. My area was in information technology, which was spun-off into HP, so there were a lot of structural changes. Awesome benefits too."
good,"Stress is according to weather conditions around the world and closing of airports or delays. Flight Attendants willingness to work, The people you work with are great lots of friendships and comraderies,"
good,Not the best job but it does the job but look for something better. Its a good job while your young but as you get older look for something more stable some place you can grow.
good,"A typical day at work as a reservations agent for American Airlines, during the time I worked there was different, each and every day.  All flight schedules are dependent on, among other things, the weather, in order to function as a well-oiled machine.  "
good,"The pay for non-MBAs is typically quite low, even once you attain a level in the organization that is equal to that of starting MBAs. Non-MBAs typically leave after a few years for this reason. Travel benefits are amazing!"
good,"I was hired by Ozark Airlines and have been acquired 3 times now to the current American Airlines.  If a pilot was hired by AA their career is great.  The others from acquired airlines are at the will of the pilot union, who do not particularly care them.  The pilot‚Äôs pay, position and future is always at risk.   "
good,everything was who you know and what you know if you was not cool with the manager you wasn't getting anything. no sick pay no vacation pay so it was hard to take days off
good,"It was oksy I was their in 2005 so I'm sure a lot have changed,  maybe they have better benefits  now and better pay. What I enjoyed I worked from home"
good,I believe working for AA can be a very rewarding job as long as you have a great manager. The work conditions can be very stressful at times but can also be rewarding in terms of building relationships with customers.
good,"The merger between American Airlines and US Airways has caused a lot of strain.  It feels like there are competing sides with employees.  Other than that, it is a good place to work depending on what group you work with."
good,"Was a great experience working for the company"
good,I worked long hours and the atmosphere was stressful.  I did not feel appreciated.  The union employees were allowed to do pretty much whatever they wanted to with little to no consequences.
good,"American Airlines seems to be a great company to work for as long as you are a regular employee. My experience as a temporary contract employee was a bit of a struggle."
good,Dealing with irritable customers was the hardest part of the job along with standing up most of the day. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers. They are a good company to work for but could use a bit more care in booking flights and timing.
good,"I worked for American Airlines for most of my adult life, in several capacities. I miss the people I worked with over the years and still feel like I am part of the American Airlines family"
good,"Typical work day was fast paced"
good,It was nice to work with them as a vendor. I was associated over 2.5 years with them. Management skill can be improved a little bit that's what I thought.
good,"management doesn't seem to know what's going on. The onboarding presses is very slow and no one really tells you what to do, you have to find things out on your own"
good,"Upper management are not that great no experience just in the right place at the right time. If any management personnel are not ex USAir employees, they are not considered for upper management positions."
good,"Great Travel Benefits. Outdoor airport work. Sometimes very enjoyable other times miserable. Often under staffed and rarely backed up by management when difficulties arise with agents. Very high turnover due to working conditions and low pay. "
good,working at American airline dealing with different kind of people could be very challenging but as a team once we are on the same page and work together there is nothing can stand in our way.
good,"i come in to work, i had to communicated to people. Mangement was ok. they tried to keep us going. fast paced, and rude.picking up bags sometimes. when celebraties come in."
good,"Good place to work. Good benefits, good salary, good opportnuity for advancement. World-Wide Travel.  Good insurance"
good,"Have the opportunities to work on various fun projects"
good,Fun place to work. Very chill. Weather delay days are bad. Benefits are good. Management team could be a little more courteous towards others with the reason of a call in.
good,"Good place to work,though bit less salaries, they give importance for work/life balance. flying benefits,PTO's,sick leaves,good environment to learn the technologies."
good,"typical day lasts about 8 to 10 hours per day..."
good,I did not enjoy working for this company.  The environment was quite hostile and unsettling.  Layoffs were done monthly in large quantities when I worked there.  The management appeared to be under too much stress and it trickled down to all the employees.
good,"I personally feel that American Airlines gave me the opportunity to train and learn many types of positions in my career. I held multiple jobs in the administration department and in the operation.  The fun part of my job was assisting employees in their needs. Unfortunately, I was not recognized for my work by management and advancement opportunities are rare.  The non-union salaries are stagnant as well with minimal increases."
good,"It seems that if you are liked by management you get better options.  And if you are not liked you work under a microscope.  The company should trust the people in the front line to make the right decisions.  Also management needs to pay more attention to the way the passengers treat their employees.  There should be some type of performance review, even though raises are not based on performances.  Management should not wait until months after something happens to discipline you on it, and there should be more coaching and counseling."
good,Going around making sure everyone make it to their flight in enough time also helping with any questions they may have about their flight what gate they might have to go to or simple as where's the restroom.
good,"After 9/11, it was no fun working for the airline industry. I hope the working conditions have improved since I resigned in 2004."
good,"Return all calls from the previous day, reply to all emails, then go through yesterdays mail.  Sort new invoices, send others out for approval.  Match, batch and sort invoice for processing."
good,"Great work life balance. However no program for advancement of employee skills or career."
good,Excelente experiencia no estrangeiro durante cursos nos EUA
good,"Working for this company was great but couldn't survive on paying rate. Which is one of the reason I left the company, but other then that I learn a lot of different skills when working with this company."
good,I feel this forced review is unfair of Indeed to require. I am seriously considering taking my resume off this site because of it. There are plenty of other sites to post my resume without such tactics.
good,This had flight benfits that made it a good place to work.  It allowed me to travel to a number of places. I worked with a great crew. The hardest part of the job was working outside.
good,"At work I prepped, cooked, and served the food"
good,"American Airlines is a nice,and relaxing place to work. The managers are always going out of there way to help you. My Coworkers are very pleasant to work with."
good,"The company is very divided between US Airways and Legacy AA employees. The culture is very tense in head office in the higher levels. "
good,I have been displaced twice with this company in 8 years due to the companies bankruptcy and the closing of a business partnership. My situation is due to circumstances and the company provided most people with continued positions. I decided to try my options somewhere else.
good,"very fun environment to work in"
good,"Ever changing work environment, need to be flexible working in an Airport setting. Requires ability to multi task while making quick decisions."
good,"- Training and development of the department processes "
good,"American was a very good company to work for in the beginning. Over time they lost touch with the work force. They restructured the pay and benefits, which totally changed the career path. American could still be a great company if they reconnect with their workforce."
good,The opportunities to grow from within are very much a possibility. It's a great place to push yourself and move through the ranks.
good,all my jobs working  with you coworkers for the most part work well together  each one i came  out learning something new  management were very supportive the most enjoyable part of me day was helping customers with their shipments
good,"Good working environment; however, regular communication between on-site manager (one who signs time sheets) about realistic expectations of the potential of hiring contractors as full time EEs or if they are strictly short term contractors."
good,"American Airlines has great benefits however the scheduling is not very flexible and management-employee relations can be ""stranded""."
good,I did enjoy my job here learned a lot about airline procedures and self control and motivation since this was a stay at home position. Trainers and other coworkers are very friendly and personal it is a delightful environment to work at.
good,"Double standards for contractors vs employees. Contractors required to be dressed up, but not employees. Contractors 9 hr. day, mandatory hour lunch. Employees 9-3pm with 2 hr. lunch. Never know where the funding is, can be cut at any moment."
good,"Took a long time for my systems to be set up. Didn't train much.Good days and hours. Didn't have a cubicle for me to sit in. Had to share a small conference room with two other employees. Didn't have a desk, had to use a standing table."
good,A great place to start your career because the aviation industry is different than most industries. Great benefits with access to flights anytime you want. Company is still working to create a new culture for the Management level.
good,"Great job for people-oriented employees. Travel while working and days off, too. Comforting passengers was a joy to me, while always keeping safety in mind."
good,"Flight Benefits are an absolute joy to use if you enjoy flying. "
good,This company has zero concern for it's employees. They are considered like numbers and are nothing more than expendable to the company.
good,It's a good and busy environment..however we all get along and work together well.  Its a very large work environment with hundreds of people.  Alot of customer and employee interaction.
good,"AA was like any other airline company, Worked to have great customer satisfaction and retain them. Long hours no sleep but fun job."
good,"Great benefits if you like to fly. Low paying salaries. Good people, made long term friendships. Met my wife. Fun place to work."
good,"Typical day at work include building financial analysis for specific projects, monitoring supplier performance improvement and addressing all of the unexpected issue from maintenance operations."
good,"nothing too challenging, worked as a clerk for a hot minute, little supervision."
good,Excellent company to work for excellent benefits and job opportunities.
good,"not a great place to work anymore"
good,"good location. hard workers, close to places for business meetings."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,Reviewing out of stock items is my first priority.  Making sure that delivery is done in a timely manner is very important for the suppliers as well as pricing.  A typical day consist of managing my time effectively to get past due shipments in and purchasing to keep the availability of stock on hand.  The hardest part of my job is getting all the work finished in an 8 hour day.  The most enjoyable part is having all items available.
good,Working in Advantage department people want to use their miles to book flights. Processing refunds as well as problem solving calls with certain issues that we were trained to take care of. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the great customer services skills and always remaining professional when customers get out of line with you.
good,"long hours, not enough pay, travel benefits"
good,I am given a seat to work. I do my work to FAA and American Airlines standards. I have been in this current shop for 11 yrs am growing bored with it. Ready to try something differnt.
good,"* a typical day at work would be to service aircraft "
good,it was a very good place to work I enjoyed every challenging day.
good,Great flight benefits.  Culture needs improvement. Flight benefits and other benefits have been good.  Pay not great.
good,"Fun workplace always meeting new people and assisting, however the pay is low to start. Hardest part is pushing people in wheelchairs, and when there are  flight delays."
good,"Assisting customers with booking flights, i take about 50-70 calls maybe more depending on call volume"
good,"Due to the cutbacks and bankruptcy agreements, Alliance Airport was closed.  Employees were given the choice of being placed anywhere in the system or an early out option."
good,Secured flights for frequent flyer customers and learned how to best service the customer requests.
good,"check guests in, assist with any flight issues, help with any children flying unattended"
good,Setup and support for travel agents with Sabre automation. 1 day to 1 week visits.
good,"The company was a great place to work, but like all big companies they used 911 as an excuse to cut wages and benefits."
good,"- Answering incoming calls and assisting customers"
good,"ÔÇÆ	Professionally greeting and checking-in passengers"
good,assisting customers with their accounts
good,I learned time management and customer service skills. i also learned how to work better under pressure.
good,"After 35 years, They made me an offer to retire early. So I took the package."
good,"Handling reservations and the customers that paid for them. Sales was required in pursuing ANY revenue opportunity. Call control extremely important also, ensuring every customer is taken care of. Management was no news, good news. Co-workers real cool. Hardest part of the job was having to wait on another department to assist with the call. Most enjoyable part definitely was when you get calm customers."
good,This airline is really struggling financially and with labor. Co workers are key to help you and lean on when needed. Unfortunatly in my experience you can not count on management for much support. If you question procedures even for your own understanding they consider it insuboardination. At every chance since 9/11 they tell you how lucky you are to have a job.SInce bankruptcy they have ended all pensions. Third year in a row that a larger percent of your healthcare comes from you and they are proposing a pay cut by the end of this year for people who have not had a raise in over 10 years
good,My position did not allow for a typical day as I supported 30-50 field stations in Materials Management of aircraft material and with a dual position I was also a supervisor over labor union employees.
good,My typical day is basically making lost claim on passengers bags and items. I learned how to deal with people especially the mean one's. Management is okay. My coworkers were the only thing keeping me their. The hardest part of my job was dealing with flight delays. The most enjoyable part were my co-workers.
good,"The people i worked with are very helpfull if you need anything work wise in my department that is. But alot of nosey people who want to know everybody's buisness. I enjoyed going to work everyday there, the hours were great and i lived less than 12 min away."
good,"Due to the changes that the company is facing financially, it is difficult to say at this time whether there's an advantage to stay with this company in the long-term especially now that want to get rid of many benefits that current employees receive."
good,"A very changing work environment..... You get to interact with all sorts of people, different languages and cultures."
good,The opportunity to travel around the world and you get paid to do it. Not alot of stability though.
good,"Very capable Mechanics, handcuffed by arrogant and immobilizing Management and Staff. Direct Supervisors to busy trying to justify their bad management skills by blaming the abilities of the Mechanic."
good,There are opportunities for advancement and training depending on your manager. The airline struggles with team work across work groups. The culture is slowly improving along with our performance.
good,american airlines was a good company the only thing about the job is that was part time job and you only can have american airlines no more other company.
good,"I was a work from home representative and it was my second full time job in addition to my day job. I loved my training where I learned a great deal about the industry and the process of booking travel. My biggest pet peeve with the company is why they don't offer more part time opportunities, as I am certain it would improve morale and definitely provide work/life balance."
good,Making and changing reservations everyday is great. the job is not hard its just a lot  of information to learn. management is not great. Some managers constantly remind you that you can easily be replaced.
good,"Good work environment and competitive. Location was great as well. The staff and management was vey helpful. Staffs had good area for lunch and personal lockers, however it closed its operations in Suva Fiji"
good,"Overall, I liked working for American, but it was stuffy and very old school. There was no real culture and every day was a grind in a cubicle. Very hard to make a comfortable living there if you start as an hourly employee."
good,"AA 20 years ago was poised to become the largest airline in the world. All management and employees where all pulling together to make that happen and we did. Even after 911, departments consolidated and skills where assessed and spread amongst all departments to safe money. AA was able to stay in the black for many years. Once the merger with US Airways took place the culture changed. Change is inevitable to stay competitive in any market but some changes can disrupt culture and motivate experienced employees to look for a more suitable culture."
good,Not the best to work for but not the worst. There are pros and cons depending on your department and what you are looking for. Lots of OT and opportunity to move around.
good,"While I think the company overall is decent...I believe they rely too heavily on ""free travel"" as a benefit to justify lower pay.  The ""free travel"" often costs quite a bit b/c you end up spending a lot of time at the airport waiting for an open seat since you fly on standby."
good,I need to to burn all of me characters so that i can go to bed.  This isn't a review for american's employment opportunity.  But i'm not a fan of not getting paid real money.
good,Work at American is collaborative and self-paced. Management is given to critical representations and over-estimates ability of teams to deliver. Technology is good and training is acceptable. Vendor relations are cordial but sometimes strained.
good,"Started with America West and that was very enjoyable and it was a very good airline to work for, I learned a great deal about A320's and B757's. At that time we (as Mechanics) were able to fly the jumpseat....that was so cool.  As time went by I've experienced many things that happened not only for the airline but for the aviation industry....like 9/11....so much has changed since then.  America West went on to become U S Airways and that was a change in policy, culture and corporate, but times at U S Airways wasn't that bad....a few years later U S Airways became American Airlines, that really changed the scope of everything with the unions, culture, corporate policy and many other things.  Aircraft work scope has changed and for awhile it was confusing.  Working at American became different, you become a number and not necessarily a person."
good,"back to back calls, many customers are angry and that makes it stressful. Shifts are bid on based on seniority. Plan to work holidays. Pay is average at best."
good,Benefits are great .. I love that I meet new people everyday and the stories they tell about there trips. Somethings could be better but American is good place to work
good,"With the exception of the pay and the job security,  when I was there, it was a great place to work and the benefits were fantastic which includes: medical, dental, vision, 401K and travel benefits."
good,The company is changing the culture to be more DevOps in nature. This is a big change that will require a shift in thinking. The change is in progress with reorganizing teams.
good,Enjoy performing my job duties and love the people I work with. My manager is a smart caring man who really cares about his employees. On a typical day at work I can expect to inspect packages and freight to make sure that they are safe for transport.
good,"Being an airline reservation agent is a mixed bag.  There really aren't incentives to do a great or a bad job. Though perhaps well intentioned, the upper management gives little personal attention.  Blanket emails of thanks extend to all employees, making them meaningless for individual job performance.  You can be rude or polite to customers, the difference only matters to you and your state of mind."
good,Airport environment is very busy and can be somewhat stressful. Have to be able to make quick decisions in a sometimes stressful situations. Satisfying to be able to get customers to their destinations.
good,"It's a great job for those who want to travel. You have very little control over your work life as you could report to work thinking you were going somewhere and because of weather or a mechanical, you could end up in an entirely different location. You have to get along well with others because every trip you work with different people. You have to have an even temperament and always be able to apologize for multiple things (lost luggage, seats not together, etc) that are not your fault and always appear to be sympathetic to the passenger needs. Its a different way of life, sometimes exciting and many times frustrating. And you get paid very little nowadays."
good,"Job consists of audits, fast paced, timely completed. knowledge of work unions. requires consistant customer service tasks. Maintaining safe operation and coaching of employees."
good,"I would not recommend working at the airport.  Very hectic and disorganized and unappreciated.  Very low pay and management did not want to make changes to make the workflow better and more professional.  Very disinterested in the people or making work conditions better.  Did not want to solve problems.  Just wanted you to deal with ""the way things are."""
good,"Place has gone downhill since merging with US Airways / America West.  Too much in-fighting between departments and senior mgt gets paid obscene amounts of money compared to other airlines.  Turns them into yes men, instead of doing what is right.  "
good,It was a fun environment at first while meeting new people and learning more about the job. Training in Charlotte was fun as well since you get to know all the ins and outs of the job and what to look forward to when you start.
good,Highly structured organization top heavy in management. Union ruled work divisions dominated by work groups that outnumber maintenance groups. Poor morale in general throughout the system. Employees strictly a number. Little incentive for improvement or upward mobility. Working environment is dull and ruled by seniority. You can have 25 years of seniority and still be working night shift. If you like doing the same thing over and over each day this is the place for you.
good,"The culture is not great and there isn't a lot of collaboration among the different components of the company."
good,"The best part about working american airlines is the benefits! Being able to make up your own schedule, work as many hours as you want pick up and drop shifts. Also being able to travel anywhere in the US for free."
good,A typical day at work is fairly slow paced. I have learned that there is a lot more that goes on behind the scene of an airline. Our management does the very best they can. The hardest part of the job is the instability of our schedules. I enjoy our benefits and the people I work with as well as our busy days.
good,"Enjoyed my time employed with the company, but enjoyed it more when it was US Airways. The constant uncertainty of job security due to airline mergers is nerve wracking."
good,I was laid off in a company-wide reduction of force following 9/11.  The atmosphere prior to 9/11 was wonderful.  Ability to advance was good.  Benefits were exceptional.  That all ended in a single day and was not the fault of the industry or the company.  I wish them well.
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with uncertainty.  Employees experience bankruptcy, corporate merger, loss of benefits and some layoffs.  The combination created an extreme anxiety in the work place."
good,"Not too demanding work load, great travel benefit, exciting industry, fast-paced, the company culture is changing since the merger"
good,"flexible schedules to fit every employee, great training programs, good customer service, knowledgeable and well trained management,"
good,"It was a fun place to work  from home for nearly 7 years, the ability to work from home and work as many hours as you wanted  was awesome."
good,"Good airline, but work environment is a bit unstable with pending lay-offs always looming (at the time I was working there)"
good,"I learned a lot about the airport, airplanes, driving jetbridges and marshaling the aircraft to and from the terminals."
good,Flexibility exists with shift trading and who doesn't love to travel? Problem is that if you're an adult with bills and any responsibilities you can't afford to take off work because the pay rate is absolutely awful.
good,"The best part of the job is the benefits which are offered to you including travel, health, and the ability to have flexible hours. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the fact that there is rarely a perfect day in the industry."
good,typical day would be me waiting on a flight to arrive and offload it and load it that's pretty much it. hardest part of the job was loading and offloading flights you'd be surprised at how heavy those bags can be. especially when the flights came back to back. the most enjoyable part was my badge let me go almost anywhere in the airport felt cool to have so much access felt like VIP.
good,"A typical day at work consists of being tethered to a phone line for 8 hours a day with 2 15min breaks and a 30 min lunch. I love the aspect of working from home with this job, although I do not enjoy the pay. Most customer service positions at least start you out at $12-14 dollars an hour. For home based its about $9.53 (give or take) then after training its about $10.20, then 40 cent raises from there per year. They do have max pays for different home based departments but with the raises it would take a very long time to get to the max. For example, domestic sales home based max is 15.99, but with 40 cent raises.. that's about 14-15 years I believe to get there."
good,"Management is good, very little micromanagement, but job security is low"
good,"If you survive the intial 6-week training period and can adjust to the inflexibility of your workday (as determined by a seniority-based bid), AA can be an okay place to work. You can determine your schedule by trading shifts with other co-workers (with some limits) and no permission needed from management. However, there is no understanding if you miss work due to illness or inclement weather. You will be terminated in short order if you have more than 3 instances of absence or tardiness in a 12-month period. Pay starts fairly low but will increase with seniority, based on the economy and success of the company. There is even an occasional bonus when profits exist (rare since 9/11). The main thing in this job is giving good customer service on the telephone and staying up-to-date on the ever changing world of airline reservations and rules. The health benefits are good, the number one benefit being free flights in the U.S. and inexpensive flights overseas. If you stay long enough and are 50 or over when you retire, you will keep flight benefits (assuming AA survives the current bankruptcy filing). All in all, it's a job, it's pretty secure once you are no longer probationary, and the health and travel benefits make it worthwhile."
good,Started becoming more focused on additional sales or transfers to outside agencies such as car or hotel rentals in addition to wanting higher rates sold to customers when booking.
good,"Friendly Co-workers "
good,"I worked with AA for over 7 years. Started most times @ 4:30am. A typical day is employees saying hello with hugs. Then we all go out to our assigned positions. Dealing with the passengers can sometimes be so frustrating to the point where you just want to quit. But, I learned to have a lot more patience. and I went out of my way to make sure that my passengers were completely satisfied with the service that I gave to them. But, the only sad thing, an O.C. (operational coordinator) or a CSM would always have an issue with something when you go out of your way but still would not acknowledge compliments spoken about you by a passenger as quickly as they would a complain."
good,The benefits and flexibility are definitely the best part of this job. The airline industry is difficult to break into and a huge mental challenge. The benefits of traveling outweigh the stress of the job.
good,The work culture is good and there is a good work-life balance. The compensation is below market standards. Good international exposure. Overall a decent place to work for.
good,"The management style has charged. It is now micromanaged. The great flexibility in reservations. In most departments, you can trade hours off. If you want to pick up hours,  the sky is the limit."
good,"American Airlines is great to fly for. The training, training facilities and instructors are top of the industry. Being an employee of American Airlines leaves a lot to be desired. The airline is almost too big.Change is very slow to come about as the American culture is that ‚Äúour way is the best‚Äù It isn‚Äôt.  Too many mid management  types and lack of communication make for a frustrating employee environment. But as far as flying."
good,"It was good experience working with that company."
good,Worked from home and it did not like it. I am a person whom likes to be around others and being in my own home 8 + hours a day for work was tough for me personally.
good,I do not care to comment on American Airlines at this time.  I worked there for 8 years.  To not wish to say anything negative or good about my time there.
good,"Would recommend to a friend, good company to work for.  In transition now as all companies change after a merger, be willing to adapt and embrace change."
good,The job  was stressful. Sometime you felt like a machine. Management was not on you side. Making sure the customer was happy with your service. Thank u
good,Always Pay atention for everything because everyone need that for you did a Good job...
good,"While I do enjoy my job, it has been extremely difficult to advance due to a very competitive hiring process. Even with a Masters in Education, securing an job interview has been discouraging. Despite the good pay after 7 years and flexible schedule, I am looking to others careers because it is just too difficult to secure Full-time agent status with the new collective bargaining agreement."
good,Check-In passengers and assure they‚Äôre needs are satisfied. Email and audit revenue of multiple airlines. Embarking all passengers on board in a quick amount of time. Paperwork and records all accounted for. Usage of SAP and SABRE to account for inventory and invoices. Direct communications with managers and supervisors on a daily basis
good,"Until you're a union member, your job is in the air. Coworkers know that, so above and beyond for the first six months is the only way to survive. I like the upper management. The middle and lower management are biased and sneaky."
good,Managers do not coach or hold poor performers accountable.  It's a who you know vs what you know type culture.  It's hard to advance unless you have a friend in Mgmt.
good,Very good place to work! Management is incompetent but nice place to work! Very physically demanding & stressful job but wages & benefits are excellent!
good,"AA was a great workplace, both for the money and benefits. We enjoyed the workplace and coworkers until politics and laws changed the work environment...the airline business is both rewarding and stressful with the ups and downs of the industry."
good,"There is no such thing as typical with any airline. You are constantly on the move. Passenger contact is very important, American like any airline was a very busy place to work. Exciting and full of energy,Most people are happy because they are going someplace nice."
good,"There were things I loved about working for AA and things I hated.  It was fun being part of a large company which sometimes had a family atmosphere.  However, the work load was usually overwhelming and hard work was often rewarded with more work. I had some supervisors I loved, and some I would never want to work for again.  The benefits were very good as were the travel benefits."
good,"Large company with large profits, but not very good at sharing."
good,Great folks to work with and for. Each day is filled with challenges but rewarded with positive feedback. Vacation can be anywhere in the world.Hard to beat that.
good,American Airlines is going through a merger and its a tough ride for all. I personally had an amazing inflight supervisor but the politics and upper management took the joy out of coming to work. That is not why I left. Change is imminent in the airline industry. I was ready for a change.The hardest part was being away from familyand the crazy hours. The best part was the job itself.
good,"Pros:"
good,Like working at American as a PM.  Only down fall is I am a contractor and it is taking forever for them to convert contractors to employees.  Contractors must take mandatory furlough every November for 1 week and 2 weeks in December.  :(
good,The management was very friendly. Customer Service could work from home. Advancement was encouraged by management. The workplace was relaxed.
good,AA is an awesome company to work for. You can not beat having flight benefits. We had some of the best flight attendants in the industry.
good,"I was a contract employee and my interaction was limited. I was responsible for entering maintenance repair updates to the techiical manuals.  The work was not difficult and it was steady.  After I finished with manual updates, I worked on the Boeing Release project from the American and US Airways merger."
good,"Family oriented workplace however there is little room for advancement."
good,"You're constantly on the go. The pay to work ratio- especially when starting- is absolutely awful. The job is not hard, has benefits, and can be very fun. HAVE to be good with people. The layovers can be fun. Free travel."
good,"Management is horrible, its all about favorites. Excellent pay but stressful environment. However corporate seems to care because if you submit a suggestion, they will listen."
good,"My typical work day I am on average 30 minutes early for work. I start my day by making a cup of coffee. I sit at the computer while the coffee is being made and start putting together the flight schedule for the day and seeing what the days flights are booked to. I then assign duties to the ramp agents. I have a different agent run a flight everyday so they can gain experience and knowledge of how to run a flight. I then go into the operations office to make sure that nothing has changed with any flights that might not be in the computer yet. By the time I get all of that done it is my scheduled start time. I head outside and start getting the equipment ready and in place to start loading the aircrafts with the bags so they are ready to go for departure time. The rest of the agents 30 minutes to one hour after I do so by the time they come out all that needs done is bags being loaded. This is how my work days typically go. The rest of the flights for the day all have someone else assigning people different duties for each flight. I also watch the agents work and perform safety audits and time audits to see where we can be more efficient. I have learned that by letting the agents having the responsibility of getting a flight out on time helps them become stronger agents and have the ability and knowledge to step up into a leader role when it may be needed. I enjoy the people I work with. It is the type of environment that we are always having fun and laughing. The hardest part of the job is the elements in the winter and summer months, and the constant short staffing. When I"
good,"This company has great employees. It is really like family. You quickly learn alot, information can change daily on  a regular basis. The hardest part about my job is having to bid for vacation almost a year in advance, but that is only in my department, which isnt so bad. It can be adjusted at a later time."
good,working with other to make sure QC is in order to provide the best possible result. managing other to have a clean and safe cabin.
good,"It was a great company in the beginning but management vision along with union divisiveness brought the ultimate downfall into bankruptcy. I really enjoyed my coworkers though, great people and sad to leave them."
good,Great place to work if you are looking to balance work and life. Travel benefits are plus. Shift trade gives you extra time off during the year.
good,"One of those days that I love to go to work, is when everybody is doing their part and we are all synchronized. The hardest part of it is when anybody did not catch up the mistakes and the whole company is responsable for it."
good,"American Airlines was the biggest foot in the door when I was hired on Feb 8, 1999.  At first, I was a lost puppy dog not knowing what to do being sent to the wolves.  You did at each day & month learn the job functions of transferring bags to there final destination, Have to be on time for work, delivering bags, preparing for flight arrival at the gate, not making the tower angry, working as a team member and with other managements, also having a Union rep be with you if something goes wrong in the Fleet Airport environment.  "
good,"Working at AA was so much fun, great culture and a lot of opportunities to explore the world. If you are looking for diversity and lots of overtime, this is the place."
good,"I've worked at the company for ~5 months, and as of yet, I haven't had more than about 6 hours of work to do in a single week. In addition, I was furloughed for 3 of the last 6 weeks of the year right around Christmas. "
good,The company has dramatically changed since I left so not in a position to offer a fair assessment.  Company has all new leadership which was not open and welcoming when they took over.
good,"A great company to work for, very relaxed in nature yet competitive to work in and advance in. Most managers like to promote from within their groups and it is difficult to transition from support staff to management level staff (salaried)."
good,Good company to work for good  benefits.  You can work from home and they  train  You it is only a 8 hour shift and two days off. A lot of over time and okay pay
good,"Work was continuous travel 90%, 10% office, company provided excellent training for EHS, workplace was very friendly, management was somewhat unstable due to reorganization and combining with US Airways. None of the position was to difficult, enjoyed the people, constant differences of the work."
good,A typical workday was processing the public for air travel on daily flights. In my job I learned technical and sales aspects of the airline industry. Mgmt was administratively involved with day to day operations exclusively. Co-workers were collaborative in meeting required objectives for a safe and timely processing of the public for flights. The greatest challenge of job was handling the public discord when delays and off schedule operations occurred. The best part of job was the interaction with people from all walks of life.
good,"Great company to work for. Enjoyed learning more about the airline industry and how it is handled. Management as well as coworkers were all a joy to work with. Kept busy with high call volume during the holidays. Never worked from home before, so loved the atmosphere and comfort of not having to drive into the office on bad weather days. It did get difficult as the company merged with US Air and new rules and regulations were implanted, but it was part of a process and I quickly caught on."
good,The Airline is ah hard seasonal job bt there pay rate is worth the time and effort that goes into the work thats put into the job
good,AA is a great company to work for if you are wanting to gain experience in various departments and build your business expertise. I worked in three different organizations and had three very different experiences in terms of management and peers. For the most part upper management is personable and it is a good atmosphere to work in. Teams are usually close knit and work feels like an extended family. The flight benefits are great.... if you love travel.
good,"Very busy, the company didn't care for there employee to much. The benefits was excellent."
good,"Well started out here with great promise, was getting just that until merge with other airline as we have been forced to do the same things that did not work for them. Now it's a nightmare."
good,"AA is a great company with amazing benefits! It was hard to enjoy the flight benefits due to the pay being low. Employees are awesome, just hated being tied to a phone all day!"
good,"Great travel benefits and nice pay. Room and board is covered while in training but no pay for eight weeks can be challenging."
good,If you want to fly free anywhere in the world this is the job for you it can be very stressful and customers aren‚Äôt very friendly  but if your willing to put up with that it can be very satisfying
good,"This was a great company to work for in the late 80's. However, when AMR created its marketing entity (Teleservice Resources) the forerunner of Travelocity.com, they figured out that they could consolidate operations into one service centre which would reduce workforce expenses which, in turn, would deflect from having to pay employees what they were worth. I took this job as an inexpensive way to gain knowledge and experience working with computers and early Microsoft suite elements. I ended up learning how to price flight itinerary segments - while interacting with a diverse group of people on the phone. The managers that I worked for created opportunities for learning to use grammatically-correct Spanish when speaking in a variety of its dialects. All in all, the learning opportunities were limitless - as long as you were popular enough with management to be placed on a very slow ""special projects"" queue."
good,"Worked in Call center for reservations. Everything is timed. Your calls, breaks, lunches,meetings. You have a set schedule when your breaks and lunches are. Customers usually calling because of negative experience- delays/cancellations, website not working, airport issues, baggage- so most calls are stressful. Great opportunity for advancement. Not a lot of flexibility with work hours. Would not recommend if you like face to face interaction- very little time for socializing."
good,Operate a folk lift load an unload trucks with merchantdise sometimes we have to deal with hazads materail the most enjoyable part of this job attending meetings and travaling
good,They do a lot of special treatment with passengers when they're buying their plane tickets and checking in baggage. The company itself was really cool the people were great although there were a few that caused problems or did extra stuff. But staying to yourself and not getting too close to the people you work with would definitely best.
good,It was a great job with great risks. A typical day was start 2 hours before flight time. Check in on the plane. Start getting safety equipment ready and make sure in place. Get passengers on board. Take a head count. Get out of the gate on time. Serve meals and drinks. Make sure passengers adhere to safety guidelines. Get everything stowed before 10000 feet. Land and prepare for deboarding the plane.
good,"I do alot of instructing,"
good,Just like any other job. You have your good days and your bad days. Yes you are the face of the company but make sure if you do get hired don‚Äôt really lean on upper management. Get your job done and go home. Simple as that.
good,"The beginning was great a few years ago when I first started with American. But, I came in when the company first merged with US Airways.  I came in when American was still American a great company that cared about their employees.  But when the changes came the policy got worst.  The Mando OT is disrespectful and I lost so many co-workers off of the horrible schedule practices that are going on with this company.  The little staff we have is getting thinner and there is a need for people to get hired."
good,fun place to work and you even get flight benefits but its not  a job that you would like if you like to be off on holidays because they will make you make mandatory if there are canceled flights or lots of delays and high call volume
good,"Airline jobs rely on many external market variables that influence the forecast of job security and Implementation of strategies. As much as jobs within hospitality industries allow one's career paths to reach  great personal development, new business models have cut in to these prospects of the percieved job security."
good,A lot of ours required with no overtime.  For example they pay you for 8.5 hours but they schedule you to work 10 hours A-day. It was assigned to work in many projects outside to work description
good,The employees are among the best team members I've ever worked with. The benefits are really good and the company really values taking care of their employees.
good,"While working with the airline, I always heard that you would either come to absolutely love it or hate it and I loved it. "
good,LOve working with fun people
good,"Very good company to work with and grow with. Offers many benefits, also very flexible however really strict with time and attendance. There's room to grow with the company at your own pace. Does require mandatory overtime from time to time. Could be a tad bit stressful if not experienced."
good,I can complain with american airlines is my way to sustend a familily in the medium higth class.also good benefits and time to spend home and travel the world
good,"Very simple, follow the structured schedule assigned. Mostly you will be working with the same people, and the same flights everyday. Overtime is always available"
good,"The task and duties that you face including various type of passengers, which most times was a problem solving call to the extent of the passengers being upset about something all the time."
good,"Working for American is was very different and interesting. There were a lot of different roles and positions you can take part in. However the rules and regulations for certain departments are never stated to you up front, they only get brought of when you have done something incorrect or violate a policy."
good,"Great work area, worked at our own pace. We had our own break room, only shared by the employees that worked in the shop. Changed shift when we needed to. Great Base."
good,"Working in customer service anywhere is demanding, but the free flights on the weekends made you deal with it. No other type of benefit can top that."
good,"Department leadership lacks long term vision, many of the processes are manual causing for lengthy processing times, there is a fear of holding team accountable for the work they do, so data is wrong most of the time."
good,The company is ok to work for its a good parttime job I wouldnt recommend it fulltime In my deptartment it is mainly for younger people it does require alot of physical work but you can pick up almost as many shifts you would like too
good,Operational jobs are thankless and hours are not set. Things change as the day goes so you must be flexible. Advancement is difficult and may take years to move up.
good,okay place to work. if management knew hot to do their job. they make up rules and are two faced. constantly try to set you up to be in-trouble. only good thing is free flights
good,"-filing claims for delayed bags, damages, and pilfered"
good,"Its a nice steady paced job but they do not have any organization. The pay system is very difficult, if you don't put in your own time exceptions for work they will not pay you for the time that you have worked. Managers have little work experience with their job and the employees under them. There are some work associates that know what to do so they can help throughout the day, but overall its a good job with good benefits."
good,"Great company with good benefits. It‚Äôs really nice to be able to travel. It‚Äôs not easy to travel non-rev though. Compensation was way below market."
good,"American Airlines management is made up of people who know someone else in management. Without knowing someone, you will never move up the ladder. They will hire outside before looking within for management positions."
good,"Aviation industry is definitely a unique environment compared to most other jobs, especially ever since 9/11. High security, safety focused, and very strict regulations and policies. "
good,"I enjoyed working as a reservationist however there was not much job security. I had to have my training classes fee taken out of my paycheck and the company later changed that, I was still required to pay for training that was free to new employees"
good,"Provided high level of customer service to passengers, employees and management. .Checked in passengers who came to the terminal entrance or passenger drop off.  Answered questions regarding departures, arrivals, cancellations and terminal facilities. I often worked overtime, double shifts and alone, assisting a high volume  of customers under little or no supervision. Stocked supplies."
good,Most enjoyable part being able to support the community through a corporate company by giving back to our military soilders and familes
good,"industry is not stable, stressful environment. Good benefits comparable with that industry, however, low pay ranges for management taking in consideration the type of work environment without work-life balance"
good,"Typical day at work involves Lifting bags.  I have learned how to work safe.  Management can be a pain sometimes because they kind of focus on the little unimportant things instead of the real important issues. The coworkers are okay, everyone does their job.  The hardest part of the job is the weather, if the weather is bad then it makes everything difficult to get done. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that at anytime I can hop on a flight"
good,Over 28 years I found American to be a good company to work for. Although changes in recent years management at American is negative toward employees and very politically charged. More attention to your political connection than qualifications. Very manipulative.
good,Gives the opportunity to learn from other companies. Not to much form the company.
good,"√≥tima empresa ara trabalho, porem a gest√£o √© p√©ssima."
good,"Customer relations taught me how to have compassion for each air traveler, network through out each agent to educate more about the database. I learned how to communicate between management and flight crew on reports, operations in irregular cirucumstances."
good,"I come to work for the people. The people I work with are great. Leadership team are managers, not leaders. They do not inspire, they demand. Very rarely was I challenged or taught."
good,Not open to change. There was a lot of friction between managers and fleet service clerks. When in management you have to have tough skin. Workers have protection through the union. Managers have no protection...
good,Very stressful and a lot of a mandatory overtime. The people i work with are wonderful the management's you never knew what direction they were going and what kind of mood we're gonna be in
good,"The job required excellent customer service ability which entailed answering customer calls regarding flight information. There is a very strenuous orientation. That most do not make it through. Once you make it through orientation, your schedule changes every week. And you must be there for a while before there's any type of rays or advancement."
good,N/A for this company Overall its ok. Nothing to really review.  Its the airline business.  You either love it or you hate it.  There is no in between here
good,"Good Benifits. Great Job. Poor Management"
good,"Different environment and staff every day.  "
good,"Have worked for the company for 12 years but have had a lot of difficulty growing ny career. I have noticed the company does not always like to promote within, they like to hire people from outside or friends."
good,"Applications systems are archaic and the department has no interest in investing in re-writing. They would rather spend the time fixing abends. They have no concept of Detailed User Requirements, Functional Requirements or Technical Requirements or Structured Design."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you love to travel.  There are some good people working here, and it's a great start for anyone's career."
good,"Some teams have work-life balance, it seems most do not."
good,"Ein gutes Unternehmen, international. Es gibt immer neues zum lernen, die Verguetung ist momentan nicht genug."
good,"How its today's market its a good place to work"
good,"*You are constantly on the go. "
good,"enjoy working here, but the leadership is not very forgiving with family illness. Someone has to be on their death bed in order to be away from work, and major heart surgery does not count. it was really the only downside."
good,"Establishes long term career path that allows you to build life long friendships world-wide."
good,"Number of meetings that are had to determine the process for how a project will move.  Tends to create process of paralysis by analysis, because of the large number of people that get brought into the discussions."
good,"Working for American Airlines has been quite the experience. I would be telling a tall tale if I said my time working for this company has been bad. Just like with any job, you‚Äôll have your good days and bad days. Time management and supervision are the two things that are key in this position."
good,I worked at an American Airlines ticket counter part-time seasonal position in the Colorado mountains for the ski season. It was a fun working team environment.
good,"Overall, it was a good company to work for, they needed to pay their employees better and provide more resources for people who need to take random days off."
good,A typical day at work at American Airlines is full of constant change.  I have learned an abundance amount of information about the airline industry.  In my 5 years management there has been constant management change over.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with micro management.  The most enjoyable part of my job is what I'm learning about the airline industry and the relationships I've made.
good,Pay is low and the Management needs better construct their message and purpose without leaving every one in the dark. Takes and act of god to get any worth while advancement opportunities.
good,American is a great place to work yet there are management problems that affect the customer experience. American needs to focus on empowering agents to due whats right to help a passenger.
good,"The station manager was unprofessional most of the time in the office, he would not accept any suggestions since according to himself he was always right needless of external opinion of operational issues or management comments."
good,Great travel benefits management and pay sucks and that's why the turn over is so high.If the management and pay were better for all the work that you did then this would be and awesome job to have and grow with.
good,"Very challenging place to work. Very negative atmosphere, constant arguing about union vs management. Rotating shifts, low pay and poor management.  Had to take a pay cut amidst bad economy."
good,It was a lot of Labor not very much money but it was fun had great benefits but also had a poor management. We often had meetings which was good we got to voice our opinions but overall the management could improve.
good,"Working in an airline environment is naturally fast-paced and stressful. Must be able to work with all departments at all levels. Understand that if you are in management, you are tied to a cell phone at all times and places regardless. Tough situations at times when working with union issues as there is some heartache from some in past relations. Great co-workers from a management perspective. Hardest part: Getting phone calls in the middle of the night when living on little sleep. Most enjoyable: Working with all the other great station maintenance managers. Free flight benefits were great too."
good,"American Airlines was a great place to work . But I miss Kroger and that's is where my heart was, I call Kroger and, they hired me back on the spot."
good,Most organization have multiple people to accomplish what I do personally on a daily basis. It is challenging and rewarding on a professional level. I have worked with some of the greatest people in the aviation and energy businesses.
good,"Never regretted going to work in my 20 years! Could allow employees to think for themselves more, and develop a culture of team work. Hardest part of job was getting it."
good,As a whole the company was decent but management needed improvement
good,Lost sight of there goals as far a airline.Treat there customers and employee very poorly.
good,"AA is a good place to work as long as you don‚Äôt expect to advance. Promotions typically go to people who know certain managers. Other then that, it‚Äôs a fast paced environment where you work hard and the free flights are definitely worth the stress."
good,"Overall a good company with a good attitude, however there is a definite separation between the line workers and the corporate members that executive leadership does not efficiently address, groups are very clique-ish so promotion while changing teams is very rare."
good,I love the company and its benefits. It can't get stressful very quick but if you have great customer service skills its the perfect opportunity. I have recommended this company to numerous colleagues.
good,"I do not wish to write a review for this company.  This is the last time I will type something, so if it doesn't take, it is no longer my problem and you will lose all of my other data."
good,I enjoyed working for AA for 14 years. They gave me a chance to learn and progress. Hardest part of the job is to work several hours and sometimes have a short layover. The best part was to be in contact with customers all the time.
good,Needs better compensation as well as working with irregular life happenings. Benefits are great but you need to be able to afford to utilize them realistically.
good,"I am so thankful to have the experience as a flight attendant.  I was able to travel and see beautiful places I've always wanted to see."
good,"Glad to see they gave profit sharing back to the employees.  Flight benefits are invaluable if you take advantage of them.  Mergers are always difficult and not sure where they are exactly, but it was tough bringing together two very different cultures.  American was very bloated and lacked teamwork, in my opinion.  Still a lot of great folks there to work for.  Not always merit based for advancement and more who you know - typical."
good,"typical day at the airport - routine"
good,"Worse part is working in the weather.  The current manager is wonderful and works with you with your schedule and is very understanding.  The atmosphere is pretty relaxed, but when a flight is ready to go out, it's time to get busy."
good,"American Airlines is the biggest airline in the world, and the travel benefits are worth all the hassle of working late nights, early mornings and all holidays."
good,American Airlines ha sido una gran escuela de negocios y de vida. La base fundamental de un d√≠a t√≠pico es el trabajo en equipo y el respeto entre colegas. La parte mas dif√≠cil es el estricto cumplimiento de las normas y regulaciones ya que no dan cabida a errores. Lo m√°s gratificante es la oportunidad de brindar a cada cliente una experiencia de viaje extraordinaria.
good,"If you like being busy, and love surprises, then do this job. Its a very physical job, and if you like fast pace then this is for you."
good,"The typical day is going in getting your job assignment on what you have repair that day, looking up the correct procedures to get the job done through the maintenance manuals. In the years of service there at American airlines I have became a skilled AMT ( Aviation Maintenance technician). Most all my co-worker had a sense of pride working on aircraft and or parts that goes on the aircraft."
good,I started with American when I was 19. I started out as a customer service agent. I learned a lot and worked my way into Management. I was laid off due to a reduction in force.
good,Must have great time management skills.  Fast paced work environment.  If you love to travel then this is a great place to work.
good,my day will go fast by staying busy and able to learn to work around new equipment such new aircraft normally not flying to our station. the hardest part of the job was working on a cold rainy day. And the part that I like the most was able to fly at no cost.
good,I loved the benefits especially being able to fly for so cheap but the men I worked with were very hateful at times and I didnt like the particular position I was in. The pay was too low for the amount of stress and swing shift that was required.
good,"Great job. Helping people. "
good,"great place to work while you in college, but after, if you dont want be at the airline industry, is not worth it."
good,"I would come in each day and do the same thing, nothing new or exciting, just same ol' thing. I learned very little as some would like to keep knowledge to oneself in order for others not to know. Hence JOB security!"
good,"Merger work is always busy, USAir and AA merger was no different.  As a program manager I had wide areas of leadership communication responsibility and reporting. Multiple decision makers and a large multi departmental team supporting the program."
good,For my company review I‚Äôll just say it‚Äôs A cool company to work for but I‚Äôve only been there for a year so far working with American as a flight attendant.
good,"High stress, overly compliant, very little room for advancement or creativity. Attendance policy very stringent and unrealistic. Usually dealing with penalties or punishment, not reward."
good,"A day can be very stressful if a flight is delayed or canceled."
good,Flexible schedule with seniority. Explore different cities and always work with new people. Very easy job duties. You get to meet interesting people along the way who become your family.
good,Good culture and good people to work with.  Everyone helps each other and has a common goal.  New technologies are considered and people are given an opportunity to learn and grow.
good,It was a good job to have because of the flight benefits. It was Easy hours and it had fun people to be around. The weather was tough to work in sometimes
good,Great flight benefits. You will love flying all over the world. American Airlines is one of the biggest airlines in the world so you will probably have room to grow depending on your goals.
good,"I enjoy communicating with people from all over the world and helping others.I am a creative and analytical problem solver, so my skills were used on a daily basis."
good,After American merged with USair there seemed to be a disconnect between management and employees and it appeared as there are 2 companies under 1 roof instead of joining the work groups together.
good,"Was required to work overtime several days a week. The pay as a contractor was great, but no flight benefits for contract employees.  Nice clean environment."
good,"- Very flat orgnization, even entry-level employee can make impact."
good,Enjoyed working for the company and the different people and backgrounds. Fast pace and interesting environment. Good staff and sense of security with job
good,A typical day at work is usually long but fairly enjoyable when we are given a lunch break and enough time to rest when we arrive at our final destination.
good,"putting out fires all day isn't always productive, but you learn how to make quick decisions and when their is no fires to be put out you can then use the things you have learned to grow."
good,my coworkers keep me there ... AA in general is going through a rough time. which is stressful for all workers. Benefits are great... Love that its a Union. But the management needs to get themselves together.
good,"I started working in the warehouse and was forced to work second shift weekends for 5 years! I enjoyed the challenge of the work ! However in the beginning the training was sub par and many people were reluctant to share knowledge with others especially new employees! I worked with the company and the union to try to improve working conditions! I represented TWU employees for five years as a union show Stewart. Hoping for better job opportunities I transferred to the aircraft overhaul hangers and worked in two areas ! I worked many different jobs and enjoyed most of them! I honestly felt most of the time my work was never recognized or appreciated by my management! It was amazing to me they would promote some of the most incompetent individuals with little to no people skills into management positions for political reasons! Many times there was backbiting and fighting within certain work groups! Employees would compete for preferred work assignments and undercut anyone else looking toward the same positions! I finally found my niche in organizing and improving parts storage and kits for maintenance!  I enjoyed it and was recognized several times for my contributions by the FAA and my bosses! However they would never consider me for promotion despite my going back to college and obtaining a bachelors degree in statistics! During my final years I gave up trying to improve things and resigned myself to maintaining the status quo because of my declining health! In the end I had an outstanding supervisor and crew chief! Most of my crew chiefs and supervisors were either idiots, dishonorable"
good,"Los lideres son buenos y crean un ambiente muy ameno en el trabajo. por otro lado, demasiado trabajo y presion para tan poca remuneracion y no hay tantas oportunidades de linea de carrera."
good,"Overall American Airlines is a great company to work for. However, if you get into a entry level position, there is no pathway to promotion lined up to advance to the next level in your career, unless you know someone in a different department."
good,"its a good company, its very flexible it allows you to have a good work-life balance , great benefits but the pay is very horrible. we work very hard but the pay is not enough especially for the cost of living. we have to work 3+ days extra just to see a comma in our pay checks, it sucks."
good,"Good company to work for if you like people and travelling.  There is some career advancement, decent benefits and perks. Go for it if given the opportunity."
good,"High volume of work coordinating merger between two companies. Typical day included multiple meetings on aircraft certifications, introduction of new aircraft, development of new manuals, PAs, service and safety. "
good,A great place to gain confidence. A lot of opportunities to learn new skills and interact with different people from around the world. You will learn how the system of flights works.
good,Good in some ways. Not so much in others. Upper management seemed fixated on keeping pay lower. Wanted to call how much could be made. Never really understand our mission either.
good,As a manager in certain departments you are to learn three different areas.  Not a bad thing but you do not focus on one in particular and spend more time on that area.  Can be stressful.
good,I truly enjoyed being a flight attendant when I was based in Miami because that airport offered so many international flights and so much flexibility with my schedule. When I moved back home to a smaller base I didn‚Äôt get that same flexibility and was tired of being gone all the time.
good,"I loved many things about the place. But it‚Äôs definitely not the place for everyone it can be a stressful job. It‚Äôs fast paced and talk to people from all different race, religion, and diversity. I loved truly helping and hearing places people would go."
good,i enjoyed working at American. The unions were not very fun. To much discontent between company and workers and to trust. The management can seem a little disoriented at times.
good,Very good work environment at AA. American Airlines has a very good architecture team across IT who oversee the technology standards. Very good management team and very happy to be part of the group I am in.
good,"Good for longevity, and for something temporary. decent workers, understood job easily, able to understand management well. Non-stressful work environment."
good,"There‚Äôs a power in a group of people who work together toward a shared goal. A properly managed team, boost strengths and brings out the best in each member. Following this idea, really all employees should work in teams. Because there‚Äôs no better way to achieve more than by working together."
good,You get to travel. You work long hours and in hot and cold weather. Meet a lot of people and must like people to work for airlines. Would do the 20 years over again.
good,"Fast past work environment, which requires going in and out of various systems to find information. Management needs improvement. Friendly work environment. The hardest part of the job is going through the various systems. The enjoyable part of the job is the team atmosphere."
good,It was a good job but did not pay very well.  My commute to the airport was good but had to leave extra early to make it through security.  Was able to take on extra shifts.  Most co-workers were friendly and helpful.
good,"Laid back and casual, however, co-workers not very friendly.  Meaning most of the people here will walk past you without saying hello or goodmorning and most do not give you eye contact at all."
good,Working with AA was a great experience I would definitely go back not only for the work experience but for the coworkers I had we all put in our part witch made work easy to handle and fun.
good,I love my job at American Airlines (Envoy)!  The pay is horrible there is no way to make a living!  I love the people i work with the morale is great!
good,"Easy work, hard to get an interview.  Management mages decisions that are made without common sense involved.  A lot of knee jerk reactions.  Pay is good if you stick out the wait."
good,"I was happy until I made a mistake with my flight benefits and I was fired for something small. I had great stats, no slippage, at work on time, and worked great with others."
good,It was a good job to maintain throughout the years. There were good benefits in addition fo compensation and travel benefits. The shifts were bid but there were decent shifts to choose from. Seniority based.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working with this company is to make customers travel experience enjoyable. On a good day, all flights leave on time with no problems and this makes everyone happy. On a bad day, there is weather all over the country, snow, rain, hurricanes, cancellations and every one is stressed and in a bad mood. I've learned to never take anything personal, and at the end of the day I always get to go home."
good,AA is a great company to work for. The position I was in was very monotonous and the pay was too low to survive on. The benefits were some of the best that I have ever experienced.
good,AA is making lots of changes in good ways for their employees. AA is still going through growing pains after its merger with US Airways but this means there is room for fast career advancement.
good,"Great layovers many fun co-workers, but the next generation of workers feels that they should get it all now so at times difficult to deal with the me, me Millenials. CEO needs to stop being so greedy, echoes of the old AA hence the bankrupt AA. The management takes all the stock options and provides garbage to the customers who are paying good money for their tickets"
good,Working for american airlines at williamsport was alright. The lack of hours though is what killed this position for me. I would like to have more than 30 hours per week. Granted the benefit of free flying on your days off was good but it wasnt worth it for only 13 hours a week.
good,Some managers make up rules as they go along and change them daily to suit their current needs. That makes it hard to keep up with what they require. Luckily that is limited to only some of the manager/supervisors.
good,"It's a good experience and workplace culture, everything was good. The management and the staff were very friendly and they participated in every activity."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company.  I loved the benefits and the ability to find someone to take my place if I wanted some time off. The hardest part was to deal with the public who where less than kind, especially when the Airline cancelled a flight due to weather. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new things and being able to be allowed to travel."
good,"AAdvantage¬Æ elite status gives you access to exclusive benefits designed to add more comfort to your journey at each membership level ‚Äì Gold, Platinum, Platinum Pro and Executive Platinum. New this year, your base purchase price will count toward your Rolling Elite Qualifying Dollars (EQDs), helping improve your upgrade priority. "
good,"Decent schedules and decent pay.  Good maint. and no flight ops pressures.  Enjoyable most of the time.  Much of that changed, and NOT for the better,  after merger with American."
good,"American Airlines is a great company to work for.  At the time when I was a skycap, the pay was great and the hours were flexible.  After 9-11 however, there were changes made that affected all airport employees."
good,"It was a minimum wage at that time. However, the flight benefits were  very good. Work was stressful, but travel opportunities balanced the negative sides."
good,Great job that is flexible and allows you to see the world. It's great to be able to work in different cities to get an idea of what it's like to live in other places.  It's an industry that allows you to work in various departments as well.
good,airport work fun and very busy nice fast paced place for working a lot of walking and moving constantly teamwork is very important due to the fast pace
good,Each department has their own respective group of employees that were phenomenal at their jobs. Middle management usually works to make sure employees are happy and does their jobs.
good,A day in HR at AMR was busy with on boarding and new employee orientation to staff the call center that had a high turnover rate/attrition due to high performance standards.
good,One of the greatest perks of this job was flight benefits.  Co-workers were a great diverse group of people.  The hardest part of the job was having to bid on time slots for your schedule every quarter.   The workplace atmosphere was very upbeat and fun.
good,"Amazing face paced work environment. In this job you have to deal with unpleasant passengers, delays and canceled flights, supervisors that abuse their powers, and you need to basically dedicate your life to it. But in the end everyone was family no matter what and I couldnt have had a better job."
good,"It was for a short period of time, but it was great experience nevertheless. I worked for American Airlines in Cura√ßao and had a great working environment and awesome colleagues. I had to quit the job when I started college."
good,"American Airlines is an amazing company to work for, great work environment and even better benefits. This position will teach you a lot about the airline industry."
good,A typical day at work would consist of utilizing several computer systems while talking on the phone with members and resolving their issues. I really learned how to fine tune my ability to diffuse a situation as well as my multitasking abilities. Management was strict but friendly which made for a pleasant atmosphere even though it was an inbound call center. The hardest part of this job was dealing with irrational people even though I knew that they weren't mad at me personally; sometimes people just need to vent. The most enjoyable part of the job was when someone was genuinely thankful.
good,"It was a great experience working for American Airlines."
good,"I am an excellent team player, self-starter, positive enthusiasm and can pick up any kinds of complex applications very quickly and finish up my job within given time frame with less supervision."
good,"It was a good learning experience."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with great people to work family, family atmosphere. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist customers"
good,"Generally a good laid back environment to work in.  Immediate managers are pleasant to work with.  Some of the tools are antiquated, but that is changing."
good,"Typical day at work-clock in 15mins before your shift, open all systems on computer, get comfortable because you'll be taking back to back calls through your entire shift. Booking flights for distressed passengers when their flights are cancelled, etc..I learned from this job that your not going to make every passenger satisfied. Something very hard for me to grasp onto because I want to satisfy every person that calls American Airlines, Hardest part of my job was the hours. You can get stuck with over nights for 6mo at a time. This is a union job so you have seniority and you will start at the bottom every time you move into another department. Something I wish I'd known before. The most enjoyable part of this job is the passengers you get to talk to from all over the world. You will get the bad ones like any job, but when the fun ones call its makes it a pleasure to service them."
good,"Working at US Airways now currently American Airlines is a wonderful experience. A typical day as a gate agent consist of answering what ever questions passengers have concerning the flight. Making sure the boarding process runs smoothly for an on time departure. Providing crew members with the necessary documents they need for take off. The hardest part of the job is the experience during bad weather/ storms in the surrounding areas concerning accommodations on the following flights for the passengers. My coworkers are awesome, we all work together on a daily basis. Management is there to support in any way possible."
good,Good company to work with good opportunities to learn and develop more skills.  Excellent benefits with travel benefits too.
good,American Airlines is a great place to excel your career and see the world thanks to the company's excellent flight benefits!
good,work long hours in this job title. start at 0400 and get home 1600 do a lot of trouble shooting and directing mechanics in the right direction
good,"I trained in Dallas, Texas for 4.5 weeks to become a flight attendant for the worlds largest airline. A typical work day for me is waking up at 4am, on duty for 10 hours at least, and having rest for 12 hours. I have learned to have more patience and smile even if you are completely exhausted. A smile is a universal welcome sign and a smile can brighten anyones day. The hardest part of my job is working up to 14 hours and only having minimum rest before doing it all over again. I absolutely love the idea of traveling and seeing new places."
good,"Work long  flexible hours preparing for games, stage events, and etc."
good,"Good benefits and decent pay, management is okay, coworkers are nice, taking phone calls all day, flight benefits for employees...only thing is the upset customers on the phone."
good,"-	Customer Service."
good,Enjoyed working with American Airlines because I got to travel for free within the company and love working with different types of aircrafts as a Ramp Agents.The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"American Airlines was a good place to work.  Energetic environment with opportunities to learn various areas of the Airline Industry.  Cultural diverse company, which is something I appreciate."
good,Travel anywhere in the world and enjoy all the service AA can offer to their clients.  Great vacations with the great airline.  Fly anywhere in the world and enjoy great service from their employees.
good,"I learned a lot from this job, they taught me how to be a better sales representative, how to help the customer more. I enjoyed being able to help people find the best prices for their family to travel. The hardest part was not being able to help people when they needed to make a change and couldn't afford it. Overall a good company, great employees."
good,"Most enjoyable part of job was solving customer problems"
good,"New Technology and new Aircraft "
good,"I enjoy the people that I interact with daily. However, it is apparent that from a management perspective, the employees are expendable and they place little value on their employees."
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at work which is a good or bad thing depending on who you ask. For me it's been great, I've met an array of interesting people that I wouldn't have otherwise had an opportunity to come in contact with. I've also been able to travel everywhere. I've learned to be diplomatic as it relates to team work. Co-workers vary from trip to trip which is also a good/bad thing depending on who you ask. The hardest part of this job? Not having weekends or holidays off anymore. The greatest part of this job? Mostly everything else. The layovers and the awesome crews make it a great adventure.  If money is a priority, don't apply. If the experience and people is your priority, apply."
good,Reservation sales taking incoming calls and finding solutions for client air travel and rental car.  Traveled extensively. Afforded me opportunities I could have never had if it weren't for flight benefits.
good,"I learned so many rules and procedures when it comes to the airline business. I don't like to be bored anyways so I love when its weather. I feel bad when flights cancel but Ii take enjoyment in finding the passengers other choices to get to their destinations as quickly as possible. My coworkers and I all work amazing together. We all learn from each other, if one needs help with something we legit have each other back. Everybody does not know everything and if one doesn't know something the other may and willing to share the information. It doesn't even have to be a weather day for things to go crazy, we also have oversold situations, the crew can timeout or get sick, and also maintenance issues may all cancel flights. The hardest part is just not being able to get the passengers out the same day because all flights are full or going through the same issues so they have no choice but to wait until tomorrow."
good,Flying for a living - what could be better?  Great people to work with!
good,Many Celebrity and High Profile Clients come in daily expecting the highest level of service and quality care.
good,Able to work around your school schedule. Fantastic training.
good,"At AA I received calls concerning reservations, accounts, or lost/damage luggage. I learned that working with the public can be challenging, but also can prove to be rewarding."
good,"I have never worked with a more dedicated group of employees.  I learned much of my duties from the employees themselves, as I tend to learn their tasks to be a better manager. The hardest part of the job, the weather. When Mother Nature speaks, the industry is tested. The outcome always left me in awe and as the challenges were met the team work prevailed and the extra mile witnessed."
good,"Extensive customer service."
good,"Sabre logbooks and creating workload for the night or turn arounds"
good,"Being the passionate traveller that I am, working for this airline has been an amazing journey. I was provided a position to help people in a very unique way that I found incredibly fulfilling, as well as the ability to fly around the country for free!"
good,"J'ai fait de travail de H√¥tesse d'accueil, r√©ceptionniste, agent de ventes et assistance de passagers VIP, a l'a√©roport International a Buenos Aires."
good,Good experience for a young professional just starting out.
good,You are a number.  The pay is low.  I loved the job and the employees.  Flight Attendants are the best people in the world.
good,I was nice working for American Airlines. Customers were very plesant most of times. Great meeting celebreties and co-worker were great poeple.
good,Great company to work for. Benefits are amazing. Co workers were great.
good,"Assists with TWU crew changes, vacation bid lists, maintains attendance for department and overtime records.  Processes various forms of paperwork for a variety of procedures located in several different locations including computers and system accesses. Administers self-audits and monitors shop compliance, retrieves and analyzes lost time and unidentified labor reports, develops and maintains additional management reports as required.  Prepares flight and hotel arrangements."
good,I really enjoyed working for American airlines. felt I had great job security and loved the travel benefits.
good,The most enjoyable experience is being able to assist our customers and the most difficult experience is the weather delays. The workforce at O'Hare is diverse and constantly changing.
good,"I would come go to the bank in the airport and, walk to the gift shop with my money to go in my register. Walk around clean up and hang shirts up. and get ready for my customers. And talk with customers and talk about the great gifts in the store. end of the day filling up for second employee. Count money down and wait for person to come with her register and I would walk my register back to the bank and they would count my money down sign a paper and then clock out for today."
good,"‚Ä¢	Have set up Agile Project Management Office, defined - roles & responsibilities, changes management, testing processes & templates, and participated in the effort to staff the project organization."
good,I enjoyed working at AA very much. I have nothing negative to say and I would have wanted to stay with the company if I could.
good,"I enjoyed speaking with the public and helping them coordinate complex travel with medical equipment,service animals and supplimental oxygen"
good,"A typical work day was from 6am - 2:30pm, home by 3pm. Management left you alone to do your job but yet supported your job with supplies and information. The hardest part of the job was putting up with some of the union dead-beats that didn't want to work. I enjoyed doing field trips to other stations and able to pick and choose my overtime. I learned a lot about the airline business and the FAA."
good,"A typical day at work is when all planes are on time. I have learned a great deal with dealing with customers. The management was always a turn over I have been threw 4 managers within 3 years. My co-workers we all worked very well together. There were times where we bumped head but, we got the job done. The hardest part about the job was sometimes you didn't get a lunch break. The most enjoyable part about the job was the flying benefits!"
good,"American is a great place to work, giving you the opportunity to work with multiple people in multiple industries. I've learned to find common ground across industries that would not normally work together to benefit both parties in Marketing and Promotions to the customer."
good,"a typical day was customer service and after 16 yrs coworkers were fun but most importanly was I liked my job, solving problems and at days end making customers Happy. I had many compliments with proof that I am a Good Customer Service Rep with good work morals and a love for my job. I loved working for the company for 16 yrs but management was not for the worker but for themseves. overall rating is I gave all of me and didnt get as much in return."
good,Typical environment for a company of this size. Made many lifelong acquaintances while working there.
good,"Working in an airline call center was a fantastic job. Every call was different and often a challenge. Because procedures and rules were always changing , no day was ever the same ; yet , there was minimal stress. The most difficult part of the job was to calm an irate. There is no question that I loved the work or I would not have stayed four decades. I only retired to move close to family in Idaho."
good,"Supervise, instruct and coordinate the activities of flight attendants"
good,Not much to say but that it did not end well. The perks were nice the work environment was very tense at times.
good,Being Laid Off leaves a sour taste in my mouth but the company was good to me.
good,"I am very aviation oriented and knowledgeable. There are so many levels of interaction there with people and equipment. High demands, schedules and operations vary from early to late. A very fast paced environment. Management locally though, can be very condescending and unknowing and unappreciative of quality personnel. operational coverage is inadequate. The environment is an enjoyable one when attitudes, and coverage is adequate. What i've learned there goes beyond deep because of different aspects of the job itself, then the many Personalities of Co-workers, the different cultures from all over the world and knowledge and readiness of the whole aviation operation, is vast."
good,"I had a broad and successful career at American Airlines, a leader in the industry and great company to work for."
good,"I worked at smaller station so I was responsible for much more. I checked in customers, made reservations, boarded flights, loaded and unloaded aircraft, create the flight manifest, calculate weight and balance of the aircraft with fuel, passenger, and baggage weights, marshaled aircraft, and handled hazardous materials trainings. The best part of my job was seeing the passengers go in and out of town, building rapport with frequent flyers, and of course, the free travel benefits."
good,"Very fast paced, Need to have a uniform training program. A variety of work experience."
good,"Great place to work,  fast paced , goal oriented. we provide services to aircraft, set up and operate baggage and cargo , management equipment, supply snacks , food and drinks, also, adhere to strict occupational safety regulations."
good,Takes a long while to make a decent hourly wage and hours preferred.  Travel benefit is great and insurance good.  Good opportunity for someone just starting a career.
good,Indifferent. Haven't worked there in over three years. Have been removed from AA since 2017.  There is nothing more I can say it was a supervisory job that I did well.
good,"Good place to work, good salary. Diverse group of employees. I had  a  Union represented position.  The hardest part of the job was the work hours, early morning start time."
good,horrible flight service operations managers at LAX. The benefits are great. most of the staff are decently nice. Management need reviewing to see if they belong there.
good,"Was much better place to work, even with new headquarters."
good,"American Airlines brinda oportunidades de entrenamiento en el exterior a sus empleados."
good,"does what is needed to get the job done, monitors system and makes suggestions for improvement.  Creates timely backups, schedule reorgs and maintenance."
good,great team spirit and coworkers but job is very stressful.  Customer service and claims handling for customers that have travel and baggage related incidents.  Handling claims and investigating inquiries for all travel related incidents.
good,"a fat-pace work environment with a very flexible schedule ( but working weekends and holidays are expect it), a nice place to grow professionally and as an individual."
good,"American Airlines is a good place to work overall. They have decent compensation and great benefits. Good insurance plans, flight benefits, and discounts or special rates at other businesses. "
good,"With a myriad of departments & areas of focus you can find something that'll satisfy you for as long as you'd like to work there."
good,"It was a great place to work, but the leaders there did not get it when it comes to diversity in its leadership. They just barely have an African American or two (men) in senior leadership and NO black women in officer roles that I could discern. They are on the right path, but need to join the 21st century in their thinking and hiring."
good,Good company questionable managers I would like to make a recommendation for any one considering working there . Every manager is different some good some not so good
good,It a good job. I like it a lot. The work environment is nice so you talk to a lot of different people and work with interesting people. Just drink lots of water.
good,"I loved working for American.  At times it felt like family, however, when the time comes for a reduction in force, the cuts are swift and deep.  "
good,"Started with US Airways, fun company that fostered collaboration. After merging with American Airlines, job responsibilities became siloed and upper management began to make big changes with little communication. Hopefully they figure this out as the people there were very helpful and friendly."
good,"Thanks mostly to it's pay and benefits, it's a great company to work for.  However, due primarily to a turbulent past and numerous mergers, trust is a fleeting element in it's culture.  Top leadership is working hard to vocalize the importance of restoring trust, but has mostly failed in building it, especially outside of it's corporate headquarters campus.  It's a company unable to find a unified culture, affecting employee morale and it's collective barraging agreements."
good,"Great workplace culture "
good,"Great workplace and great benefits for employees and the family.  The pay should be better, but it's not the worst in the industry.  Should give management some training on how to handle employees."
good,"There is good and bad with Any company. I like the people I work with and the job isn't hard for someone used to phone work like I am. I have tried other Departments and not yet into IT but still hopeful. Some things at the company are changing for the better, others not so much. But we do what we can for the passengers."
good,"Management is still working from a pre-computer paradigm.  Bureaucratic nonsense is typical.  Working with aircraft can be both frustrating and highly interesting.  Culture is modest paced, but can be flexible.   Benefits and time off are mediocre."
good,"Management changed several times just in the couple of years time that I worked there.  Every manager wanted to re-vamp the entire department and bring in their friends with little to no applicable work experience.  "
good,Very hard to assess a typical job position for a company that has over 100k employees. I've had positions that I've both loved and positions that I've hated as well. It really depends on the management in your department.
good,"Good company to work for, low turnover and friendly people. The only con is the commute. Having to be bused thru the airfield to get to the office adds at least a half hour time to your commute."
good,I enjoyed working for American Airlines over the years. I met nice people and travelled to some neat places. I am to have had this experience. It is a great for to get started in life and it can also be fun.
good,The environment was great they encourage you to be creative.They also encourage you to be open minded and to explore other job opportunities to continue to further yourself with the company.
good,"My coworkers. We are like family. Once you start working closely with a group of individuals, you become really close even personally. My coworkers make me feel like part of the crew. They genuinely care."
good,I looked forward to going to work every day. American Airlines allowed me to find new ways to resolve difficult problems by using my imagination and creativity.
good,Very adjustable and helpful team within American Airlines IT infrastructure. They work as micor team within many application projects and solve day to issues in IT
good,"It s a great place to learn new skills.  Because of the workload, I am busy with multi tasking various duties. I always have a productive day in my role."
good,I enjoyed working in AA and it was a challenging and fulfilling job. I worked in many different departments and each role helped me learn new skills. I also appreciated the work life balance.
good,"First class and coach lead flight attendant, Dallas Cowboys Charters and Manager on Duty."
good,"A typical day at work is handling passengers who are understandably upset because our flights are always delayed. Upset because they have to pay baggage fees. Because they want something free. Some days we work our scheduled 10 hours, somedays we work up to 16 hours in a day. It doesnt matter whats going on in the day-diversions, delays, rebooking passengers, we still have to maintain perfect numbers on baggage and safety audits"
good,"Worked in aviation career through a number of positions and responsibilities.   Starting as mechanic,   crew chief,  engine mechanic,   Production planner,  Scheduler,  Router,   Technical writer,   Maintenance programs technician.   Company allowed volunteer and civic opportunities for a work life balance."
good,"I liked my job but there was not much chance to progress. There was no good management of the staff, one group worked a lot than another."
good,"As a 28 year employee of Legacy American, it was with excitement and trepidation when the company merged with USAirways.  I have always been willing to embrace change and looked forward to making the New American the best place to work.  Unfortunately, it has been a challenge in seeing the culture change so much from what I was used to and the operations and most of all, the customer service going downhill over the last couple years.  The company is making money which is good, but the work environment is more USAirways (and in Phoenix, America West) then truly as a combined company. As I have told my employees many times, if you aren't happy, then time to look for something else. I have many fond memories of my job, my co-workers and friends and I am not saying anything bad about American in general. It has and I hope it will be in the future a fantastic place to work.  After 28 years and reaching a certain age, I hope to find something else to challenge me and grow as a person and an employee."
good,"I've been working at American for a while. Its a really nice place to work. It's like one big family. The only negative, is that there is no advancement opportunity within the company."
good,Being a F/A in American Airlines is a great job yet is a lifestyle. You usually work with different co-workers every time and meet people from all over the world as well as visit places you never thought you would. You also have plenty of flexibility on your schedule and can normally drop or trade trips around. Some of the downside is basically not having stability when your away with constant schedule changes due to weather or delays and any day can easily become an 8-16 hour work day. You also get your hourly pay for flight time only making everything else per-diem and being away from home gets tiring since it‚Äôs not a normal schedule like a regular job. Seniority plays a big part in this job. I will also say its disappointing how a federal job does not back up flight attendants as they should whenever a situation/confrontation occurs with an irate passenger.
good,The pay from commission was great was great. I just didn't like the adjustments having to be made every payday . There could be a difference of what expected to be paid.
good,"Excellent company to work for. Industry is extremely interesting and the learning experience is excellent and constant. "
good,"it was a great job extremely stressful. the longer you work there the better... Not just because the stress will reduce but its the only way you can make a livable wage. you can fly anywhere for free, but you cant afford to take time off work b/c you don't make much."
good,I enjoyed my time at American I was able to experience new places different cultures and come in contact with different people every day.as long as you stay out of trouble American is a great company go to work come home and never have to worry about bringing work home with you.
good,"difficult to maintain work/family balance because of the high turnover.The hardest part of the job was the physical aspect of the job.The most enjoyable was the customers, passengers. Getting to meet people from all over the world was an awesome experience."
good,"The people are great.  The environment is fun, you work hard and you learn a lot.  "
good,Excellent opportunity to work from home. scheduling would change bi-monthly and available scheduling went from 4 hours to 8 hours a day whereas the majority of scheduling was on the weekends.
good,"American Airlines was a nice place to work; good benefits, good work environment. Fair work expectations, with supervisors who were willing to help. Proper equipment was available at all times."
good,"I had worked with the company indirectly of sorts, more specifically as an Envoy Air employee stationed at Eagle Aviation Services Inc. in Abilene, TX. First word of advice, if you are not planing on settling down for a quiet life and want to move up in the company, then STAY AWAY from the Abilene repair station. It is the only location that is not unionized and make ""transferring"" to a new location VERY difficult, partially due to the management and the other being the fact you will loose all your seniority once you move to a new location."
good,Love the flight benefits and meeting people from all over the world.  The company is stronger and has a bright future.  I am proud of AA progress.
good,"Fast paced environment with multiple coworkers. Constant changes that need quick resolution.  Due to merger, computer systems and work teams being integrated."
good,"Used to be a great company back in the day.   I see it slowly getting rid of its maintenance division just to save money.  Just like every other corporation, if they can ship jobs over seas and line the executive pockets,  they will not hesitate."
good,"I love the flexibility with the schedule, you are able to make your own  schedule by giving away your hours and picking up hours to make them up.I really enjoy the flight benefits"
good,Attendance is key. You can move around to different departments once you get in the door which is the hardest part. the travel benefits are amazing and i do mean amazing!!!
good,"Typical day at work is very adventurous, never a dull moment when you meet new people from different parts of the world. Probably the best part of my day. I enjoy every moment."
good,I love working with American. great environment and it can create a fun lifestyle. Most of the people are great and the job keeps you on your toes.
good,Gave me the opportunity to do what I love best. Management would micro manage. Pushed too hard on getting the aircraft off on time rather than work with the customers.
good,The company does promote within and believes in collaboration with employees. The company had a good vision and mission that includes diversity.
good,"Empresa multinacional enfocada al servicio , coordinacion y prevision de la operativa diaria , buen nivel de entrenamiento"
good,"Stable Company to work for. work was enjoyable. Most of my co-workers were easy to get along with. Management were mostly competent. Benefits were good.I learned how to do repairs. typical day at work was going to crew meetings, and being given work assignments for the day. hardest part of the job was the hot summers. Most enjoyable part of the job was when I got to work in air-conditioned shops."
good,The people in DFW were very nice and were willing to help you out any way they could. The parking lot was hard to get to but they had a bus to get you there.
good,"Overall, I had a very good experience.  Some of my positions I enjoyed more than others.  My colleagues made it all worthwhile."
good,The Company is great.  Constantly growing which allows room for growth.  An industry that allows you to meet great individuals from all over the world.  The traveling benefits are great.
good,"excellent job,great support able to see the world learn about different cultures. Flexible schedule great benefits able to take family on trips with you."
good,American Airlines is a great company to work for. It's everything you'd expect from a Fortune 100 company. The merger has created some tension between the 2 former companies but that is to be expected.
good,"If you are into inconsistency, random days and being away from home all the time then this job is for you. It was fun, but there isn't much of a challenge. Free domestic travel in coach is awesome and international rates are super cheap. $40 to France in coach you can't beat that. Being on standby would be considered the con, but that wasn't too bad, you just have to be patient."
good,"Working at the airport is like working in a different world... So much traffic, so many people and something is happening all the time. It is so fast paced environment that never stops. Plane lands, calls you, needs to be parked, serviced... people offload and onload. Plane needs to be pushed and take off. Sounds simpe? Not really if one step goes wrong the place turns to a ""dream"" . In my job I have to know about everything, know everybody and most importantly save the problem in no time :-) . That is what I like about my job. It is never same, every day is different and I learn every day something new."
good,"American Airlines is a great place to work. It would have been a job for life had I not been made redundant."
good,Nice place to work. Goof Management and personable. The Work is not steady enough to make a living off of though. lots of hands on learing great place to learn HVAC.
good,"Great job, extremely flexible but just does not pay an acceptable salary in order to live."
good,"I loved working at the airport. What a neat atmosphere and so addicting. It was neat chatting with people as to where they have been, or where they are headed too. Met some many unique individuals. I learned how to check people in, drive the sky bridge, how to do a final check and shut down of a plane overnight and how to do look for lost baggage. Truly interesting job. The management was great, the co-workers were great and the majority of the customers were great. It was sad that it was only a summer position and the wage was not the greatest. But I wouldn't trade the experience for anything."
good,"Great place of work, energetic always moving, knowledge of cargo industrie"
good,"Customer services representative. Worked with passenger and documentation. I learned to be patience. Changed only twice and they were very flexible. "
good,"Oversaw 12 gate operation, 25-30 agents, 45-50 flights,departures and arrivals"
good,Active and ongoing training available.
good,"exciting place to work however due to the nature of the airline industry it is difficult to juggle work/life. fast paced, energy driven. Very diverse workforce"
good,easy to rotate within the company
good,"Uma empresa muito bem organizada, trabalhei como terceirizado e a empresa deu todo suporte para exercer minha fun√ß√£o (forma√ß√£o, equipamento)"
good,"The position held consisted of many hours each day to maintain productivity with the changing aircraft schedule. Due to many outside influences, personnel were strategicly positioned to maintain maintenances schedule for 3 hangars and 22 aircraft docks. Under the current circumstances surrounding the airline, the greatest challange was keeping personnel motivated to complete all assigned tasked and produce aircraft on schedule. The greates aspect of the position was the people I worked with, who were on my team, and those in my department."
good,great people. upper management is really inept. learned on different aircraft and engines. the hardest part could be working in the elements. most enjoyable is the camaraderie.
good,"Typical day at work, physically labor intensive, subjected to the weather at all times, and challenging."
good,"Reviewed finances of Admirals Clubs, Flagship Lounges and concierge services for high end customers. Paid lounge invoices for American Airlines passengers with access to lounges operated by other airlines. Made accounting accruals and journal entries in SAP. Produced P&L's for all locations monthly. Produced NPV models and projected P&Ls to evaluate future investments. Developed annual budget for 30+ locations."
good,"Would get assignment, check out what needed to be done. Check in maintenance manuals to find procedures, tools, materials, and part numbers. Procure parts, do the job, return whatever needed parts and material to where it was to go. Clean up area, sign off paperwork, and get another assignment."
good,"Talk with co-workers, get on clock, recieve work assignments and go do job/jobs. Usually re-trouble shoot equipment and then repair, if you have a problem that you cant figure out ,you can get with co workers and ask for help, great source of knowledge.alot of diversity with experience and skills. There is really no hard part with this job, if you are willing to learn and work with others. You can not know everything. Alot of different equipment , so if your willing to learn , the opportunity is there."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, was the satisfaction of seeing"
good,Phoenix management are great to work with.  They trust you to do your job and do not micro manage.  Lots of changes taking place in IT.  Not sure what the future holds.
good,"Its been a pleasure to work with big company"
good,"As an employee that's been with the company for a year.. I am satisfied with the pay and perks that come along with working for AA. Standby travel, 401k, job security(union).."
good,"I enjoyed working at American Airlines. The people are great, the culture is amazing and the benefits even more amazing. The management could use some help."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job occurred during the transition to outsourcing my department - I love training processes and I was given the sole responsibility of training a team of 3 ladies on the manual processes used by AA to audit and ensure timely payments.
good,"Everyday was new and exciting. On a daily basis I worked with ground crew, ticket agents, pilots and ground operations. I was able to fly with flight attendants one to two times a month so I was not completely in the dark regarding their daily interactions. The best part of my job was being able to establish meaningful and true friendships with my coworkers. Many had experienced things in their lives that you only read about."
good,was a good company to work for.... flight benefits were a nice incentive....easy job ....valued customers...pay was pretty good..overall good experience
good,Recently relocated to new state of the art Headquarters complex.  Offers a wide variety of career paths and easily accessible training options.  Growth and advancement are strongly encouraged.
good,"The people that I worked with were great. The culture of the workplace took great pride in providing a friendly, motivating and collaborative environment. Employees engaged with one another in a positive way throughout the workday. The company was inspiring and employees felt compelled to work hard. Additionally, employees and teams worked well together cross-functionally to accomplish their goals."
good,"I loved the culture there. Very good use of Agile methodology, excellent training programs and adequate tools to get the job done. I loved my time there and would happily go back."
good,Great opportunity for someone looking to start a fantastic future.  Lots of experiences and fantastic people who become life long friends.  Customer Service is a MUST
good,"there are a couple of travel benefits."
good,"There is no typical day since every day brings up numerous and different scenarios at the ticket counter. I have worked in the airline industry already for other airlines, so I‚Äôm kind of used to expect the unexpected all of a sudden. "
good,My review is based on the department management making decisions on how to do the job without knowing or taking out time to learn the job not the company as a whole
good,"The interview was easy. The class was difficult, we had to take a class for two weeks and pass at 80 percent.we had a test every day. My class started with 30 people and only seven of us succeeded in passing. This prepared us for the very challenging job we do."
good,"Perfect job if your into traveling. Definitely the job you want if your looking for change every single day, keeps you on your toes because no days are ever the same."
good,"if you have another job that is full-time and you want a part-time job with flying benefits then baggage agent  is the job for you. As a former full-time employee as a Baggage agent, I could not live on the salary and because I work full-time and covered a lot of shifts I was not able to utilize my free flying benefits which is the biggest perk for a position such as this. You do work hard.  Overall I love the job, I just wish I could‚Äôve been paid more in order to afford to stay with American Airlines."
good,"I enjoyed working at the 1914 Club and learned a lot about how to operate as a service industry professional. I got along with the management team well, and my co-workers were a delight."
good,Great company but has its pros and cons. Everything is based on seniority because it is a union job. It takes years to get the good shifts but will be worth it when you get to the top. Pay is good also good benifits for the most part. Also flying for free is great. Schedule can be flexible if you want it to be. Upper management wants to eliminate and outsource jobs to vendors so it can be stressful with contract negotiations.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with the most. The pay is a bit below market since they play up flight benefits to offset slightly lower pay. Management is fair, limited opportunities for advancement."
good,"fast -paced, very stressful working enviroment"
good,"Training was very good to prepare you for your roles."
good,". Mostly pre-determined beginning each month"
good,"Workplace is very good . Employees are given free Airline Benefits  .People who love to travel will definitely enjoy working for American Airlines."
good,"When I was first hired in 1992, American Airlines was the pinnacle of exceptional customer service and safety.  However, through decades of bankruptcy and consolidation the corporate outlook and management are no longer in step with the airline industry as a whole."
good,"Was a good company to work for.  Flexible work from home.  Power struggles with management but overall, not a bad place to work.  I was a Project Manager and the company was transitioning from waterfall to Agile methodology."
good,"Great amount of hours, fast paced, free flights, can be very busy at times like during the holidays such as thanksgiving and during times such as summer. But other times can be very laid back and chill place to work. management is awful, takes almost 9 years to reach top pay,"
good,"I really enjoyed working here.  "
good,The most enjoyable part of this position is the colleagues I get to work with. Really has created a more positive environment and teamwork is just amazing! Could not have picked a better group of people to worth with!
good,"Overall company culture is good. AA provides many opportunities at airports, maintenance bases and their headquarters. There are some perks to working at AA such as travel benefits and discounts with certain companies."
good,Enjoyed my time there... Great work environment sad to have left. It was part time due to the pay and hours available. I am a single mom and was working 2 jobs. Great people great team! I would go back...
good,Excellent benefits. Great place to work. Management was a bit unorganized but other than that it was a good company. I would recommend working for this
good,Flight benefits are incredible....well worth the other stuff...IT management kind of 'stay in your box'. They have very well defined PM role there at American.
good,"The company gives you many opportunities to travel and to move up in the company if you're willing to work hard and have a personality that allows you to get along with everyone.  It is a ""Level-Based"" company."
good,Great culture and a nice place to work.  It's a constantly changing environment due to the size of the company.  Coworkers were great and a pleasure to be around.
good,"AA went through merger while I was there. Good senior management structure but top heavy. Going through organizational changes to fix this. Many positions at all levels eliminated. From a company perspective, good move."
good,"Always worked under decent or better management.  Given lots of free reign to accomplish assigned work.  Great benefits, although free flights have become harder to get as industry has consolidated."
good,"Overall, customers were very patient. Tasks included all areas of the airline, from customer service, check-in, to baggage claim and recovery, operating jetway, boarding, however hourly wages and stressful environment were not equal to tasks involved."
good,"AA is a good company to work for, and provides plenty of room for lateral growth. Plenty of opportunities for PMs, BAs, QAs, and developers. Flight benefits are a definite plus."
good,"fun company to work for and also advancement career opportunities. great flying benefits, as long as its an empty seat we can fly anywhere in the world a American airlines fly into."
good,"Traveling from state to state in one day. I've learned that the United States is truly beautiful and people should get out and travel. Management can use some work, workplace very diverse. the hardest part of my job is having someone arrested when the situation could have been resolved. Most enjoyable is having a first flyer that is extremely scared to walk off with a smile and say that the only way to travel now and after landing thanking every passenger for flying with us."
good,"American Airlines has blessed me with many opportunities to travel this world inside and out. The level of diversity is amazing, however, management can do better with caring for employees."
good,"American Airlines is a great company to work for, as long as you don't mind being part of a union. You start out part time, but can put in for full time, which is granted based on seniority."
good,I'm happy to work for American and excited to see what the future holds. I'm really hoping that the company will add tuition reimbursement upto some percentage to help boost the education of its workforce.
good,"its very hurry up and wait."
good,"Great and long legacy history. Some recent changes that do not tap in to the many tenured employees who can move AA into the next phase. Great Company, however, with a great route structure. Well-positioned for the future."
good,"good benefits, flexible hours, hard work and long days, plenty of time off. travel and industry discounts. largest travel network extends to many partner airlines."
good,Flex hours makes if nice for appointments.  You don't need to take vacation or sick.  You can come in as early as 630 am and as late as 830 am. The two hour window in the morning is great.
good,It was a great learning experience. Working for American Airlines was my first gateway into the many different peoples of the world which broadened my cultural knowledge. These encounters also further increased my customer service experience.
good,Very fun place to work very flexible and your treated properly lots of freeedom you get to meet a lot of famous ppl traveling thru the airport on a daily basis
good,"Typical day is showing up at 0400 (waking up at 0300) of course this depends on what shift you bid depending on your seniority. Job is very relaxed and has a lot of downtime but when you work it's decently fast paced. Managers are pretty cool but can micro manage sometimes which is annoying but understandable. Great place to work though, highly recommend. The pay, health care, 401k and flight benefits are amazing."
good,"Provides unique opportunity to work on multiple projects in several areas of the company.  My experience was targeted to AA.com and working in team environment, on projects ranging from fare options to technology upgrades."
good,"Very fulfilling safety culture, with industry leading projects and programs. "
good,"Responsibilities included safety qualifications on six aircraft.  Executed all safety and travel-related FAA regulations on a daily basis.   Provided extensive customer service, first aid training, nationwide travel, public relations, and problem solving and report completion."
good,"long training process 7 weeks. 1 week in dallas at corporate headquarters.job was handling international flights mostly evenings unfortunately 9/11 happened never called back,understandable at the time."
good,"many opportunities to learn something new, great work culture and friendly co workers. learnt several sales and customer service softwares and telephone systems"
good,"If you are looking to work for a company that allows you to travel everywhere you want, then AA is the place to go.  Reservations is a place where you will devote your life, but when you have the days off you and your family can travel anywhere!"
good,American Airlines provided me with the opportunity to learn and grow in various management positions. High level of interaction and mentoring with the ability to learn and hone your skill set for future job opportunities.
good,"I did really enjoy the environment of worker there regardless of being a vendor. But, it was a lot of fun meeting new faces and possibly famous people(even though you can't talk to the celebrities or ask for autographs or be terminated). Only one thing bothered me...It was the owner of the particular vendor i worked at. Only because he would hold my check a week after pay or even two weeks. A very struggle some time for me financially."
good,"I have experienced a lot of great aspects of the company and some not so great aspects.  The big thing to remember is that we are still transitioning and we are very large, it will take some time.  The key to company success is having the right people in the right places, they are working on that but there are some hang-ups.  In about 4-5 years this will company will be golden."
good,"Very hectic but can be sometimes fun."
good,"It is a good job to have if you like the life style of traveling when you are at work and on your free time. Get to learn from many cultures like their food, languages and their people. Great place to have friends all around the world."
good,So far so good. Just wish my union would become one union. The company is making good progress in making money. It needs to become a employee owned company one day.
good,"As a flight attendant you are the Face of the company.  "
good,"I work with a small group if developers and so far the job has been pretty great. flight benefits are also great, my current boss is a little hands off which can be a good and bad thing depending on the situation."
good,Have to be a flexible and dedicated worker who does well with time management and diverse environments. Great company. currently going through changes with merger but remains positive for future business initiatives. Overall had a wonderful experience.
good,"The daily life of a flight attendant is never the same. One day could be spent on five different aircrafts with a layover in Tulsa and the next could be one direct flight to Rome with a 24hr layover. The work environment is constantly moving and your coworkers are ever changing. If late to work, your office leaves. While you may think they are the ones to greet you and serve you a beverage, a flight attendant actually has the ability to multitask without you even noticing. The safety and security of everyone on the aircraft is their top priority. I loved my job as a flight attendant . I was able to see the world and get to know some truly amazing people. However, the hours and time away from home was not conducive to the family I was about to start."
good,"I was working through Prospect for america airline, it was great working with them. I gained a lot experience and made a lot of friends."
good,"My work started at 10pm until 8am,working night shift was good I didn't have to set an alarm. I really liked my co workers,management was good they were not there much at night, my supervisor and crew chiefs were good people !! Cleaned the interior of the planes, cleaned the exterior,washed windows ,Hardest part of the job was waxing the tail of the Aircraft !!"
good,"I show up early work out my problems on my design, make drawings for the shop, take them to the machine shop to have them made. Talk it over with the machinists on how this best way to build the parts. Then over see the project until complete."
good,"Communicate with your employees and do not treat us like a number.  We work very hard at our jobs and we are proud of it.  WWhen a CEO doesn't communicate nor does he care all we can do is keep loving what we do because the CEO sometimes doesn't care about their people.  "
good,"Good company, great benefits, should have better starting rate of pay, better maternity leave process, should have paid maternity leave, I am sure they can afford it."
good,"Excellent Management styles,The pay wasn't very competitive.  AA has issues with the union groups. The culture was challenging at times.  The work was most stressful."
good,"I love providing a first class experience to families traveling together, where I know its the children's first time flying in first class.  The look of excitement on their faces is refreshing and enjoyable!"
good,"It's a great opportunity to learn how to handle different positions at the same time. "
good,"My typical day to day works were:"
good,"Overall is a good company to work for, but it is hard to have a life at home if you are a flight attendant. Don't expect to have weekends of holidays off. I would only be home about 7 days a month. Expect to get up extremely early and go to bed late. Long hours. It is hard to even find time to eat during the day. These problems come from being a flight attendant in general not from American Airlines. There is a great work environment and people are nice. They train you well. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you meet on a daily basis and the travel benefits."
good,There were variety of things to be taken care of. Used to be busy.
good,Great way to see the world and learn about different cultures. You never know who you will meet or what you will see.
good,"*Sell travel insurance."
good,"A great job to have to balance life and work. Opportunity to relocate, and no other jobs like it."
good,You have to keep an eye on Security. They are under lots of pressure and will pick on any one. Even if you are from India or Mexico.
good,"Great fellow workers, and good pay structure, but not secure as far as job security after September 11, 2001."
good,"Like the job. Very Flexible. Typical work day is make reservations, or changing them, or just answering questions. Management is great. Co-workers are excellent."
good,"Two teir wage system made it impossible to stay , people were good but it was to much of a megalopoly ."
good,"Work days varies from 8 to 10 hour days. 3 shifts offered, and some flexibility of schedule available. You get to learn various areas of the company, if desired. Good coworker atmosphere."
good,"Gracias a esta empresa,aprendi otras facetas de trabajo del aeropuerto de barajas y el conocimiento de sus instalaciones mas modernas "
good,I had a great time learning about planes and being with people it was a nice work environment.I spent 27 years with this company and watched it grow .
good,"American Airlines was a fun place to work at the time with the culture and dynamic that are not compared to no other job.  Operations started at 0400 , planned flights arrive, ground crews, agents, flight attendants, gate agents all need to coordinate to receive each and every flight safely ensuring a coordinated timed on time performance on the in bound and out flight portion.  Multitasking is a must!  Employees are great to work with from every level and every station, a lot happens in such a short time.  The hardest part of the job would definitely be bad weather conditions and trying to maintain a safe on time performance, I myself love a challenge and it made it easier for me to give 100% of myself to ensure that it happened. "
good,I loved my time with AA and would go back in a minute. I was laid off when American decided to replace all of the mainline employees with American Eagle employees.
good,"Es una muy buena compa√±√≠a a√©rea, en el area de carga donde laboro, el trabajo es muy bueno."
good,Flexibility in creating solutions
good,Loading and unloading freigworking around aircraftht shipping and recieving managment was top heavy great co-workers polite and helpful lifting real heavy bags
good,"I am a very hard and diligent worker, I aim to go above and beyond to perform the job in a timely and efficient manner, my style of working is to set myself up with a format where I able to doble check myself without even realizing I am doing so. How I perform reflects on my 2 daughters who i am proud to say have turned out to be excellent employees in their companies and great human beings in their daily interactions with family and friends, it's the hardest job being a mother and I am proud to say that I got that right. When I leave my workplace I must feel self satisfied that I have performed to the best of my ability and have made my employers proud of me. A good employee reflects a good company and and in the end the customer and everyone else is happy. A typical day at work would be usually a very demanding and stressful one, however due to the fact that I love challenges and believe in keeping my mind active, I must say I handle it very well, I learned that we have to deal with many cultures and beliefs and we must be able to have an open mind, because anyone can teach us something new, My job did not have a hardest part really, because in the airline business changes occur quite frequently due to weather, loss of manpower or supplies, so having done so for 16 years I have become quite accustomed to changes and it was my job to handle it. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the finished product done on time in an efficient and timely manner. Whatever I do I do it with love because it makes no sense doing a job that you don't like, it's not only wasting time but"
good,I enjoyed my 14 years at American Airlines it was a learning experience everyday. American Airlines gave me the opportunity learn different roles in my career. To visit different parts of the world. A typical day at work would be visiting an account review their performance and placing goals where both parties would be have a win/win at the end of the day. The hardest part of the job was having to say NO to a customer service issue that was beyond my control.
good,Great benefits. Could be infexible sometimes. A great place to work
good,"- Day to day scheduling, keeping up to date of off scheduled operations, weather and staff."
good,"Although just the Base Manager's Secretary, I have been exposed to the operation of the airline from the Flight Service point of view. I have learned about the jobs of the Flight Attendants along with the regulations and procedures that must be followed. I have been given the opportunity to work with all levels of management. The work environment was really good before the company filed for Chapter 11. Since then the morale of the office has not been as positive."
good,very flexible job great benefits good enviroment great flying benefits
good,"Excellent organization with excellent beneficts. Perfect for developing skills in customer service, time management, decision making and problem solving."
good,I love my job it gives me the flexibility I need to pursue my photography. I can travel as well. This job is good because it puts me in a position to help people.
good,"New, collaborative work environment, very modern and professional.  Lots of stress-relief activities such as game rooms, coffee bars, taco bar, gelato bar, private work areas, sound booths, shopping. The culture is very diverse and upbeat. Travel benefits are a plus."
good,Airline Operations have  many components that need to work together in tandem to achieve the desired result of a safe and on time operation. Ground operations agents work in all weather around heavy equipment. Safety is our first priority always. After work employees enjoy generous flight benefits as well as health and welfare benefits. The culture is diverse and works well together.
good,Working for American Airlines gave me an opportunity to make new friends. I also kept in shape by getting the exercise required for lifting and stacking luggage in to the air crafts.
good,I love working an American. Great company and great benefits. They are going to be cutting back this year and that is why I am looking for another position
good,"Good place to work, plenty of benefits and always striving for the best. Just give them your full dedication and the future is yours. the technology side of company is constantly looking how to improve."
good,"Is hard, physical labor, intense one minute then not so much the next, then picks up in intensity again; Indoor/Outdoor work, Clothing VERY cheap, not durable."
good,"Challenging workplace with lots of exposure to a wide arena of job responsibilities.  Work was never ending, while providing a pleasant environment.   I loved this career!"
good,"Must enjoy interacting with the public on a daily basis, as well as working weekends and holidays. Great travel benefits, deals and discounts and developing solid working relationships"
good,"Lots of hours and continuous calls, never a dull moment. "
good,"Overall American airlines was good to his employees benefit was that my position was a union position"
good,"Each day working at the Airport is different than the next, no day was ever the same and no customer was ever the same. Great and exciting place to work with great opportunities."
good,"American Airlines is a good place to work.  The benefits are great.  Work, life, balance varies by department.  The management quality varies by department.  There is opportunity to advance."
good,"Great place to work, but you have to put in your time to be where you want to be as far as work and life balance .. It works for some but not for everyone"
good,"Working for the airline was fun and the benefits were great. the only issue was the favoritism from management.  its fun to work in an environment where you can meet new people every day, provide customer service and make people happy. I was proud to work there and i would go back if i could"
good,It‚Äôs a great place to work. But every quarter you have to bid on a shift. And you earn sick days and vacation days. The union is a joke when I was injured and needed more time off they fired me. And the union didn‚Äôt nothing. They just want to collect dues.
good,You get to travel for free! However the work life balance was a struggle for me as I was a new mother at the time of my employment. I did advance in my field and received promotions
good,"Shift work is hard. I can never get weekends or day shifts because of lack of seniority. Great flight benefits. Chances for advancement if you are willing to relocate,"
good,Can work as many or as little hours as you want. I like that I can trade off my shifts and work them at a different time. Travel benefits. Very diverse work environment. Union controlled.
good,I spent many years with this company and the benefits and education was more than I had hoped tfor.  I experienced growth in Customer Service and an opportunity to travel the world! I am a better employee for it.  The ability to handle diverse situations are skills I have learn from this opportunity.
good,learn alot meet great people pay is just not the best fly free while you can most people are nice work can be great and challenging all at the same time
good,High Stress Job not for the weak at heart! Great benefits!!! Work schedule flexible but can bit you in the butt sometimes. I would recommend this job to a friend and foe.
good,"I actually really enjoyed the high stress and fast paced environment. We worked really hard and had a lot of fun. It was really busy as we were working the ski season. I learned how to check in passengers as well as board the plane; change and update people's flight plans, re-book tickets."
good,American is easily a day full of meetings. I've learned a lot about time and project management. Workplace is friendly and diverse. Hardest part is keeping up with all the different projects. Most enjoyable part is the people and the travel benefits.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working for AA the pay was bad but the flight benefits were amazing! The only real reason I would reccomend working here is for the flight benefits which are amazing, it's a great opportunity to see the world and enjoy life but you will have to save your money considering how low the pay is."
good,"the typical day at work was fun. You never have the same day twice which keeps the job exciting. I learned how to interact with many different types of people from around the world. The hardest part of the job was having a very unpredictable schedule. I enjoyed my time in the aviation field, but I want to explore other opportunities."
good,"My position is being eliminated as part of a test to determine that Executive Assistants are no longer needed in new job culture at AA."
good,"I was a  power plant engineer at American airlines. My manager and coworkers were great, they really improved the day to day job. AA is a huge company and that has its pros (good benefits, opportunities) and cons (lots of departments with different goals)."
good,If given the chance would love to work for America Airlines as a fulltime employee. It was fast paced and different every day. The employees were like an extended family.
good,It was okay.  Not a lot of movement unless you are willing to move.  Had a great time working the teams and learning about the industry. the people are great.
good,"Awesome place to work with great company benefits. Work life balance is okay, could be better. Plenty of job opportunity in regards to getting promotions."
good,AA overall is a great company to work for if one likes travel and job flexibility in specific positions. More attention and training is needed for middle managers. They are doing the best they can for what minimal training they receive. My hat's off to them.
good,I have really learned a lot working with AA. They have provided me with a broad experience that I had not been able to achieve previously. They are working hard to create a culture that is conducive to working and having fun.
good,My time at AA was filled with growth. It was a fun learning experience. I was able to work and maintain healthy work relationships with many co-workers.
good,"The job is OK free benefits great health insurance .  The hours are not that flexible everything is based off of  Seniority..  we are  Union ,  Pay $40 a check union dues.  Get paid biweekly"
good,"I worked for American Airlines during a time when the company went through several major transitions.  The company went through bankruptcy and then a merger with another airline shortly afterwards.  Overall, I very much enjoyed my time at American Airlines."
good,"very stressful ,high pressure job. Always working under very difficult situations with many diverse groups of passengers with a multitude of needs. You have to be a very good multitasker especially with the time constraints  you face working the gate functions."
good,"Working at AA has been great, nice bonuses and they offer a profit sharing bonus every year. Raise opportunities are available annually as well. Downsides are if station in PHL there is no career growth opportunities available in the IT department. However if you are just looking for a good steady paycheck I would recommend working here to anyone. Only downsides for this department is the 24/7 365 coverage means weird shifts and off schedules. Plus on-call time and a lot of last minute travel due to regional airport coverage."
good,"Recommend this company to people who are driven to succeed. Aircraft technician positions at major airlines can be rewarding and enjoyable. The negative side of these positions is having to work nights, weekend and holidays"
good,American Airlines is a good employer and they provide a secure place of work.  There are many good people at American Airlines and people are treated well.
good,Job was very structured. Worked by union contract and FAA time and duty rules. Can live anywhere you wish as long as available for schedule. Good training for job.
good,"American is a nice company to work for, great facilities and awesome benefits.  It is a large corporate entity, with large corporations are the challenges that come with it.  Staff and Management are friendly."
good,American Airlines is a great place to meet the general public and develop customer service skills.  Exposure to the airline industry is great and opens an entirely new world to anyone lucky enough to be hired there.
good,"American is a great airline to work for going through a merger with US Airways. As with any merger it is a bit rocky with combined management styles, but they have a bright future on the horizons. Tons of knowledge within the ranks at American."
good,"Every day in AA is exciting and unpredictable. "
good,"Great environment for learning teamwork, customer service, and meeting different kinds of people from all parts of the world. Being able to watch majority of the events you work is a great benefit."
good,"Face paced, constant time managment and a lot of goals to meet and maintain. Managment is is different based on your manager, therefore goals always change."
good,"American Airlines is a great company to work for, especially if you love to travel. Employees get free domestic flights and only pay taxes and fees on international flights (but you always fly stand-by). Working at the airport isn't for everybody though. You could have weird working hours or weird days off that aren't normal weekend days. The culture is more immature than other places I've worked, but the people are nice overall. Salaries are fairly low, but the benefits are great! It is a fast-paced environment most of the time."
good,Good company to work for. Good benefits. Good retirement. discounts. Relaxed. Union. Always changing. Periodical lay-offs. Advancement opportunities. Travel.
good,"Good company to work with on full time. Flexible timings and work culture. Nice and supportive management and office colleagues. "
good,"Loved meeting new people every day and remaining friends with others after I left. Each day was different. Meeting VIP, Dignitaries to your neighbor next door."
good,"I learned how to interact with people from all walks of life.  The management team is very much involved with the every day work environment.  The hardest part of the job is the log hours that may take place due to inclement weather, cancellation, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting great people and ability to travel."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo con personas colaboradoras, fue una escuela para mi y creo que para todos los que pasan por esta empresa ya que presta un entrenamiento y formacion continua, gracias a ella pude conocer gran parte del mundo por sus excelentes beneficios de viaje"
good,"As Resevations Agent/Customer Service, I answered calls for flight reservations and booking problems. This position was before you could book your own on a computer."
good,"The time I spent there was nice, learning different skills like how to properly dice an airplane during the winter time and also learning how to use the forklift correct and over the years I met some wonderful people."
good,"I enjoyed most of my time at AA/AMR.  I was there both pre- and post- 9/11, so it was a unique time for the entire airline industry.  I only left to be a stay-at-home parent, but I do not know if I would have stayed there if kids weren't an issue.  I've heard it's gone downhill."
good,"The compensation was good, but the benefits needed help.  Management was very hung up on ""visual progress"" even when it was not in the best interests of the operation."
good,"Fast paced good place to work. "
good,Planned customer router and itineraries. Computed fares and fees Made and confirmed Reservations.Determined customer service requirements and travel..
good,AMAZING company! You will not meet a stranger once you walk through the doors. Everyone is there to help each other. We ALL work for the same amazing airline and we are all going for Great!
good,"As f/a you might have to based in a city you do not live in meaning relocation or commuting to you base. Work only about 70+ hours per month, but can pick up more trip and get more hours. Good benefits, yearly pay increases, great travel benefits."
good,Be on time and check your schedule review the flight that your schedule to work and be on time at the gate check for inbound flights and connecting passengers. Check for international flights incoming passengers. View inbound flight make sure aircraft is arriving on time and always check your watch flights have to begin boarding 30 min prior to departure and close ten min to departing time the door closes
good,At this time I'm trying to locate employment. I feel that should not be a condition of using this sight to find employment and I'm tempted to remove my reusme
good,"high stress level functions. however, this opportunity also offers high, yet restrictive rewards. almost definitely most-suited for adrenaline junkies and perfectionists."
good,"There are great travel benefits, but I find that we are not given enough vacation time to really take advantage of them. "
good,"Overall, American Airlines is a solid company to work for, there are challenges as with any company. The major challenge is creating a company culture that speaks to employees importance overall. The departments are close and it is very diverse within the rank and file as far as Executives -they need a little more diversity."
good,"The hardest part of the job was the responsibility all AA workers have in their shoulders for being responsible of the safety of the passengers and the airplane at the airport, however i got to learned a lot about a whole new world i found behind the counters that no so many people know about."
good,"I am a home based reservation agent based in Dallas/Ft. Worth. I get the luxury working from home, am paid competitively by the hour. I have a very flexible schedule and most of all I get the travel benefits that come with working with an airline. Working for American literally gives me the ability to give my family the world!"
good,Working as a LDAP Engineer Enterprise directory in AA. Each task and work in AA is so challenging and great to learn. the most enjoyable part of my job is client management and employee communications.
good,Still some legacy systems in place but management team is working hard to bring the enterprise and its work force into current business standards if not above business standards.
good,Seniority growth is good - new equipment and progressive management concentrating on improving the aircraft and improving the flight operations department along with trying to grow market share.
good,A good place of employment for someone who not only likes to travel but also likes a change of scenery every day.  It is a fun job but it's also more detailed than what society thinks.
good,Loved this environment and love being around air craft. Would get really busy with holidays and bidding on shifts would be an inconvenience because it goes by seniority.
good,"I absolutely loved working for AA.  Every day was an adventure.  However, the terrorist attack on 9/11 took all of the joy out of the job for both passengers and crew members.  Due to security measures that kept changing according to the latest attempted terrorist activities, instead of being able to visit with my passengers and focusing on making them comfortable, I had to check every 15 minutes to make sure that no one was trying to blow up the airplane.  I also was having to frequently apologize for the reductions of comfort commodities such as blankets and pillows, bottled water, etc.  I would have stayed longer than the 4 years I worked, but I wanted to go into the medical field, and did not have the seniority to keep working as a FA and take classes that required lots of studying and practice."
good,"It's a great company to work. but after 20 years of service, I decided to change career.  If you love traveling, this is the company to work for it.  I have travel benefits for life."
good,"I am greatful to work for American Airlines after 20 years of military service. Working for American has been very fulfilling in that it has exposed me to the corporate world after transitioning out of the Marine Corps. The company is currently working to complete a merger with US Airways and there are many changes in day to day operations that I have been able to easily adjust to in comparison to legacy employees. I was also introduced to Union relations with Americans workforce. This was a new concept for me and I have quickly adjusted to the dynamic of the relationship. The company has a great compensation package with flight benefits and holiday pay for lower level supervisors. This is on top of the regular benefits of 401K, profit sharing, Medical, Dental, and Vision. There are numerous employee purchase programs as well. If you are willing to transfer locations within the global company the opportunity for advancement is limitless."
good,"Good place to work with a competitive benefits package.  Love the travel incentive, home based openings and advancement opportunities provided.  Management staff there to assist and help employees be successful in their position."
good,Great company just 50+ years behind the technology curve. They use Sabre for the 1960's do do all of there scheduling. They do have a union if that is something you like. When it comes to scheduling its very nice to have a union because the company can't abuse you. Like Delta Airlines.
good,"The company was great to work for.  The only issue was that there was not a real balance of work/life.  That is the only issue I had with AA.  Loved the job, it was just hard to get days off sometimes without having to pickup other hours from other people so that your shift would be covered."
good,Fun perks for permanent employees. Travel benefits cannot be beat. But salary is very low compared to other positions in other companies. Everyone I met were nice and professional to work with.
good,American Airlines is a great place to work with a culture that is growing to adapt to ever changing workplace. Over the last several years since the merger there have been many positive adjustments to the corporate culture.
good,"During high season, days at work were very very busy. Typically close to 2000 passengers per night. All passengers had to go through a security procedure which included several questions and document checking. With so many passengers and not too many employees, we had to work really hard and fast to satisfy all customers and get the job done."
good,"The new leadership took a bankrupt airline and provided stability and career advancement after 10 years of uncertainty and stagnation. Also, they gave the most lucrative pilot contract at the time to the rank and file pilots."
good,Greet and check in customers and their baggage for travel. Maintaining all visual on all possible security threats. Offloading and onboarding customers at the gate.
good,"I was hired with American Airline as a temporary worker. I worked for the credit union in the account payable department. I was mainly data entry, I worked in programs like SAP and Invoice Works and IPayables. The system allows us to put a payment out for vendors who we owe. The team was great! Everyone worked as a team and met deadlines when needed, and my supervisor was a sweetheart!"
good,"A flight attendants life is full of adventure,excitement, last minute schedule changes and a lot of flexibility. It is never the same day or flight. The passengers and crew are always different but the scenarios are always similar.  Travel is not what it used to be since 9/11. It is our job to reassure and comfort passengers through their journey. "
good,"um dia t√≠pico √© din√¢mico"
good,everyday presents a new challenge and It keeps me invigorated by challenging me to think outside the box and to react quickly to the ever changing nature of the business
good,"Enjoyed working at AA, Its really a fun to work."
good,"Great for meeting people. Rarely work with the same crew twice."
good,"An education like this isn't available at any university.  Travel, is the best means by which to grow personally.  Experiencing cultures, languages and cuisines in the flesh, is something that is typically reserved for the wealthy who can afford it.  I was a member of the 'jet-set' for nearly 30 years.  As a result, I know People, Places and Things that most people never get to meet.  I'm eternally grateful for the opportunity."
good,"This company welcomes you to its fold, expects a lot for its money but delivers for the right person a very different working life.  Occasional training or meetings in the USA and free travel around the US.  The span of work is diverse and if you are an expert and can juggle 18 things at once it is the place for you.  Many employees have stayed for over 25 years moving around the company gaining a variety of experiences as development and keeping employees is what it does best. Colleagues help each other and global teams operate as if they sit in the same office, seamlessly."
good,"Excelente empresa no segmento de transporte a√©reo, porem deve buscar melhorias no atendimento ao idoso, Pcd, gestantes e outros priorit√°rios. Jornada de trabalho exaustivo e √°rduo, por√©m gratificante ao ver pessoas realizando sonhos e suas necessidades dentro poss√≠vel, a curta prazo."
good,working for this company was great!!  Working for the Airlines was a wonderful experience. Company benefits included travel and the opportunity to get Iatan card
good,The most enjoyable part of working at American Airlines are the benefits I mean who doesn't want to fly across the world for free.
good,"In spite of the stressful airport environment, it was a very exciting career with no two days ever being the same. I had the pleasure of meeting a wide variety of people from all over the world from all walks of life."
good,"Responsible for on-going maintenance of American Airlines, Sabre and Travelocity intellectual property."
good,"The sheer volume of people dealt with on a daily basis is sometimes astonishing. Home life was a challenge."
good,"Check in and process passengers tickets and boarding passes. Deplane and welcome inbound flight as well as board and send outbound flight out all while staying within the time allowed. I have learned a lot when it comes to both people and work skills as well as a lot of computer skills with the programs American uses. My ability to time manage has sky rocketed and I have found that I work even better under pressure than I ever have. Management helps to ensure everything runs smoothly with the operation. My coworkers and I have created something incredible when it comes to teamwork. we have become a family and work very well together to make sure our flights get out on time. I believe that the hardest part of this job is having really long delays and no other flights to get our passengers out. I love every part of this job. From checking in my passengers, to welcoming inbound passengers, to saying aloha and a hui hou to my outbound passengers. I really do enjoy working with people and that's what makes this job so enjoyable."
good,"A Flight Attendant position requires a VERY flexible personality."
good,"Loading and unloading aircraft baggage"
good,"I have worked with a fantastically varied, dedicated and diverse workgroup over the years. My projects have been spread across the UK, Europe, Asia and South America and have afforded me an insight in to different cultures, work ethics and personalities. "
good,"I learned to have a greater ability to relate to people I just met , It was very interesting to know cultures and customs from many people from around the world. Lessons learned every day."
good,"The role of a flight attendant revolves around two major premises:  Safety and Service.  A typical day at work is never the same.  Work environment is subject to frequent changes in climate and locales and involves variable hours and working conditions, changes in cabin altitude from sea level of 8,000 feet, variable positive and negative G loads and occasional turbulence in flight. In actual operations, Flight Attendants may be rescheduled to remain on duty for up to 14 hours Domestic, 16 to 18 hours International.  In an emergency, must be prepared to rapidly evacuate passengers from an aircraft, provide leadership, direct and assist passenger in accordance with government and company regulations.  Service will include food and beverage services from a modest snack service on a short haul flight to a full course dinner on the long haul flights.  "
good,"Great place to work, great advancement opportunities.  Learned how to lead employees and enjoyed working with corporate accounts."
good,"If this job paid more it would be the best job in the world, in my opinion."
good,"A career in the airline industry, particularly as a Flight Attendant is filled with education and adventure."
good,Very fast paced environment with flight preparations for inbound and outbound planes.  Supervised a work crew and was responsible for weights and balance on aircrafts and for on time departures.  My work experience and interaction with co-workers who were from other counties and different parts of the US.
good,"I worked 15 years on domestic flights and 20 years on Int'l flights. I liked Int'l better because of the great layovers in other countries. Days were 12 hours or longer on domestic and Int'l. My co-workers were fun and energetic both at work and on layovers. The hard part of the job was the pay; never enough for the flight  attendants.  Pushing 300 lb carts up and down the aisle was a problem as were times when the airplane broke.  Those breaks were bad for both workers and passengers. Management was good as long as you were working and harassing when you called in sick.  I learned I was lucky to have a job that did not require 5 days a week working with only 2 days off, and that was the best part of the job."
good,"As a successful executive assistant for one of the largest employers in the metroplex, the primary required trait is flexibility.  Influences beyond our control frequently change the direction of our planned schedules; adaptability is key.  Being able to convey a sense of calm and effect change with poise and confidence is a requirement.  "
good,"Fast paste environment where vigilance, production and promptness are essential for the daily operation"
good,I love working for American Airlines. They starting pay is not the best but the management is awesome! 
good,I loved this job.. I traveled the world.. I just loved traveling
good,"The morning started with checking the weather and flight conditions for that day. Partially knowing what to expect with incoming calls helped field what could occur. It could be anything from a lost bag, a lost child, a credit card that didn't accept or travelling to Germany and finding a routing. The pride in the company was great among most of it's employees, it declined a great deal when bankruptcy was announced. Each call was unique. It could have been a group going to a wedding, reuniting a family, a funeral for a child that committed suicide. Many calls were extremely hard emotionally, but for the most part, the happiness we provided and stories we heard made our day. We passed them along to each other on our breaks. We all became a family in this process."
good,I loved working here but hours were cut too much because of bankruptcy.
good,‚Ä¢ Communicated effectively with multiple departments to prepare & change reservations for passengers. Established strong relationships to gain support & effectively achieve results.
good,It was a great airline to work for much better value system than a low cost airline. Great for flight benefits & got raises.
good,"My past work experience and educational success has shaped me into a professional with skills Mobile Device Proof of Concept, Troubleshooting/Support of Mobile Devices, and Next Generation Evaluation Processes, servicing a wide array of global corporations. I am confident that my ability to manage daily operations, with strong communication and organizational skills will produce best results for your establishment."
good,Can not beat the benefits. I believe this is the best job anyone could as for.  Gives you the opportunity to see the world and network while you do so.
good,This job has the potential to evolve into a nice career if you are able to hang in there for ten years or more. The pay structure is such that an employee needs to be there that long to reach maximum salary.
good,"The ability to trade shifts and get extra time off as well as the ability to choose your shift. Great benefits, and the ability to help people and learn new policies and procedures on a regular basis."
good,Overall I really enjoy working for AA it has many opportunities to advance and grow. I have work in many different departments and continue to grow and explore new areas
good,"I like working at American airlines. The management staff and co-workers are easy to work with. The guest is generous and kind. The wheelchairs could use a little fixing up . The gates could use a little fixing up . Over all, I am please with the rules and regulations of this Airline. Thank you."
good,"Stay focused and positive!!!! Good environment, can interact with worker more but overall good job!!!! More pay is always a good options, it has great benefits on and away from work if u like traveling.."
good,"Great atmosphere, workers are very cut throat, management very unprofessional union and have a couple of union stewards that make the job worth having. The job is very demanding but very full filling hard customer service and computer system but they think the benefits of flying free is enough to make up for all their miss treatment. GSP is one of the worse to work for in industry only because of the unprofessional management there most people in the SC area transfer to CLT for better treatment. GSP pretty much hires everyone that applies because you only get the job if you pass a 3 week training course where you have to maintain an 85% for the week."
good,"Shares many pitfalls of a big corporation, but overall seems to be dedicated to employees and their development. Each team is different and there are opportunities to move around and gain new experience."
good,I love working for American Airlines. It is a great company with lots of opportunity. I am just looking to relocate and haven't found the right position in the right location.
good,"You get lots of breaks, really don‚Äôt ever have a manager or anyone breathing down your neck. It‚Äôs physical, the pay sucks to start but it get better over time fly for free"
good,"It was a great place to work  Work , life balance was great, the benefits are outstanding, health coverage best in the business and a great price."
good,"Good experience. Very diverse community.,majority of the staff members are very cooperative and very hard working individuals. Easy to manage as some of the resources are very experienced that know the business very well."
good,"Working for A A was an amazing experience. I learned a lot. Worst part about the job was the customers. They can be difficult at times. "
good,"FREE FLIGHTS "
good,"Very Productive and family atmosphere "
good,"This place is fast pace with a lot of information to retain. It's great but hard when you have a family at home and have constant mandatory overtime. You can miss alot with family but then again, save money and take a day trip with family on your days off. Find that balance and your okay."
good,"One of my best jobs, great flight benefits and the work environment is wonderful. Every day at work  you supervisors and bosses would be in the mix which is nice to see."
good,American Airlines was a great company to work for. I was able to travel to many different Sates and meet all sorts of people. I was able to make many different friends as well.
good,Learning the requirements of the FFA and American to what placards went where and what the stencils were to say and where they went. How to prepare the surface to paint as required. Paint the stripes as required.
good,"If you've ever worked for an airline, you would know that the culture is the greatest. I've been in higher paying fields and I like none better than the airline industry. Over time, I think AA would be a great place to work."
good,"Guarantee raises yearly, unionized employment, training to reassure job knowledge . You can move up with the company with good stats a maintaining attendance"
good,The team is a group of material planners who support the American Airlines fleet of aircraft by moving materials to anywhere in the network for aircraft that are out of service for maintenance or overnight maintenance work or heavy maintenance work.
good,"Great coworkers with new challenges everyday.  Seaonal work loads add to challenges with customers. Delays, cancellations, weather all play a role in this position."
good,"An employee does a jobs and training for all ground handling. Great boss at my station but the company is going union so be aware. Check in, unload and load luggage, send the flight out, repeat."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is providing face to face"
good,"Okay place to work -- workplace culture, particularly management need to be more diverse and salaries need to be highly.  Otherwise, everyone is approachable."
good,"Good place and work environment and able to meet different kind of people "
good,it was very fun for me working at American airlines I get to go see my kids but the union that suppose to protect you a lot of them will but if the others just don't like u you are scewed
good,"There is different cultures in the workplace, its never boring. There will always be something to do on the job and you are never alone so theres always someone to help if you get stuck."
good,"Empresa com boa remunera√ß√£o e benef√≠cios, por√©m ao passar por fus√£o, perdeu-se alguns aspectos muito importantes."
good,"Whatever I can say, I‚Äôll be talking to a completely different company. I‚Äôm retired since 2013 when it was American Airlines under AMR corporation. Today everything is completely different as yesteryear with the merge of AA and Usair. I have been told by active employees that all is different; the friendly culture was destroyed and they are working under over stressed environment."
good,Ceiling for potential hours is high. Benefits for both Full Time and Part Time are good. Hours are distributed via seniorty-based bid and changes quarterly.
good,"It is a great company to work for, because it provides you with amazing benefits, the hardest part of the job is attendance. I learned how to manage my time extremely well since in the airline industry this is the most important quality."
good,"Un d√≠a t√≠pico en el trabajo era recibir llamadas entrantes para solicitudes de tickets a√©reos. Muchas de las personas que estaban en el Call Center ten√≠an, 5, 10 y hasta 15 anos haciendo lo mismo, a√∫n as√≠ hab√≠a buen ambiente pero con pocas posibilidades de crecer."
good,"Altas posibilidades de crecimiento, estabilidad laboral y excelentes beneficios"
good,"I started at AA janurary 1990 at DFW airport. I went thru a 6 months"
good,I talked to customers for ten hours a day 4 days a week.  Really enjoyed my job.  Sometimes customer's requests were really out there but most customers we very enjoyable
good,"El mejor ambiente laboral dentro de una empresa, se preocupa por su personal"
good,I work in a sales based role where being a millenial is somewhat frowned upon. American is a very old school company that does not seem to have a light to change. This worries me in the sense the world continues the change and they are currently stuck in place. If you do not change with the times your company will eventually deteriorate.
good,No 2 days are the same. If you like aviation American is an excellent opportunity. In OKC it can be a bitt gossipy due to the small station but the company in itself is a wonderful company that takes very good care of their employees.
good,"It‚Äôs an okey place to work, a lot of benefits for you and your family."
good,"Attending to demanding customer needs, tasks such as problem solving, travel packages and sales, both personal and business travelers."
good,"Great place to work, if are flexible with your work hours on a quarterly basis. The benefits are great if you love to travel. You can pick up and give your hours as needed."
good,It's been ten long years since I worked there. A LOT has changed so my experience with the current work environment is limited to friends who still work there.
good,"I enjoyed doing my internship at American Airlines, very professional and relaxed atmosphere.  I was allowed autonomy to finish my projects and management was readily available to assist in any problems encountered."
good,"Very good benefits, management for the most part cares about employees, would be living paycheck to paycheck, mandatory OT during busy times such as weather events or accidents, way too much sitting and being in front of a computer."
good,American Airlines was a really fun company to work for. It was amazing to work from home.  Lots of training before being sent home to take reservations over the phone. Their training programs were excellent. The supervisors were very nice and fair. Coworkers were a blast. Lots of travel perks which was a great advantage of working there.
good,"Only required to work 50% of your schedule yearly."
good,Envoy  workers  poor pay for AMP compare to AA main line and I think these the reason por many people quit and plane to leave. the gap between both companies is hug.
good,Great benefits but the pay is too low. Where can you work that you can just jump on airplane for free in the middle of the winter and in just a few hours be on a warm sunny beach somewhere?
good,"The department does not escalate cases, so you have to be prepared to deal with difficult cases. Training is intense, and much of what you learn goes out the window once you hit the floor. Be prepared to be given conflicting information as so many processes and issue you deal with fall into a gray area."
good,"My days were filled with meeting new people, exploring different cultures, geographics/regions in domestic and international and planning great events for our clients.  The position required heavy travel, excellent customer service skills, upbeat personality and attention to detail."
good,"The seats are extremely close to one another.  If an evacuation occurred, there would be many that would not make it due to this feature.  "
good,"I worked in several departments over my career at American ranging from Collections to Refunds to Credit Card Customer Service, working directly with American Express disputes Dept. American Airlines was a steady place to work with great benefits for me to raise my daughter as a single mother."
good,"Working at American Airlines provided to be a very fulfilling experience.  I was able to develop many workforce skills such as my communication and customer service skills, while also helping the company by promoting their services in a positive manner."
good,"The work required a lot of physical work.  Handling heavy luggage.  Easy to do, but after a while i suffered a back injury which required surgery.  Made good friends in the process. It was a good working environment overall."
good,"Union job. A great place to work if you don‚Äôt mind the crazy hours. Work weekends, second shift, midnight shift, Saturday and Sunday evenings, leaving at 2:45am"
good,"This was my first job."
good,In my years with American I gain many family members and some long time friends.  I miss the family but I am grateful to have built a new career and American gave me the experience to do that.
good,"A good place to work. There are a lot of areas to improve but it will cost and maybe this is the reason for the lack of improvements."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y trabajo por horas y buenas prestaciones incluyendo boletos de avion con descuento
good,"I was hired by AA during massive onboarding of more than 600+ reservation agents; also at the growth of the HBR remote reservation role. The job, career path and opportunities within the division were well defined meeting expectations. The downside of the experience were underlying implications indicative of a company in the middle of merger of equals. I was hired in May; the merger with USAirways was completed in October of the same year. Although I have previous extensive experience working at the enterprise level during M&As this situation was different proved challenging. Prior to this job I had worked at 5 different global companies during the merger having access to information, authority to question/critique and opportunity to provide feedback to decision makers. The struggles I observed at the operational level both teased and tested my boundaries as new, subordinate at the entry level having a breadth of knowledge but lacking seniority to gain trust or opportunity to increase my value as an asset. There are many things I could say about the trickle down effect and implications of mismanaged information on employees, morale, producitivty, performance, reputation risk. From experience I can say with some level of expertise that the key to successful transition is strategic handling of BOTH inherent and residual risks that happen when 2 companies become 1. "
good,"I Enjoy working for my current manager(s). I enjoy the opportunity to be a maintenance supervisor at American and am honored to serve my team. Overall, it has its challenging days, but I feel very satisfied for the work I put in."
good,"I started working at America West wich merged with USAirways which merged with American Airlines. I left before the American merger. I loved working for the airline, but it is a stressful job. There are a lot of employees and they are unionized which I didn't like. Great benefits"
good,Great Job Just a lot going on all at once from getting passengers on and dealing with upset passengers for 4 to 5 hours depending on length of flight. your alone a lot especially on the holidays when your working
good,The environment is fast paced and can become overwhelming at times. The management teams do their best to help the employees in anyway possible. During peak season the company makes small yet very appreciated gestures whether it be an email acknowledging our customer service or a gift card from different vendors.
good,"The work is enjoyable, depending on what group you are in.  The good thing is if you aren't happy in your current group, it is relatively easy to find a new position in another group.  There are positions in all kinds of roles, from marketing to pricing to finance.  The flight benefits make it hard to leave, but the other benefits are lacking."
good,The hardest part is being away and sometimes not knowing the area.  The best is the wonderful places you will see. Sometimes you get long layovers and sometimes they are just enough to sleep.  Holiday's are non-existent.  But as I said before if you want to travel great place to work!
good,High pace operation dealing with both customers and employees.  Have to be good at time management due to the operational requirements.  We have a good group and my every effort to always bring fun into the workplace.
good,It is a good job.  I worked there and the only reason that i am not there any longer is due to American Airlines shut down the base that I was working at.
good,Great place to work.  Plenty of opportunities to excel. You need to be able to think/act quickly making sound decisions.  Each day is different if you are in the operation.
good,"The only thing i didnt like when i was 1st hired was that you had to bid on shifts, based on senority. The pay was not that great but the travel, hotel and car rental benefits made up for that."
good,Great job! I loved the fast paced environment and working with the public. The days could get long and rerouted but the overall job is good. I very much enjoyed the training and work environment and the other crew members I had the pleasure of working with. The job is what you make it.
good,"Working for American was a great job.  I would have stayed longer, however, I was at that time getting a degree and went into a position in my degree field."
good,Work environment that gives each employee the opportunity to learn and become responsible. Demanding at times but employees are trained to excel and become or show leadership capabilities.
good,Overall I really enjoy working for AA it has many opportunities to advance and grow. I have work in many different departments and continue to grow and explore new areas.
good,Working for American Airlines is a good job. Benefits are great. It can be stressful at times but the people you work with will help you through that.
good,Lots of opportunity to work.  Can trade hours with other employees.  Flexible work schedule.  Ability to cross train and advance within the company.  Great employees.
good,"I was responsible for making travel arrangements, assisted passengers with checking in to their flight and making alternative arrangements when flights are delayed or canceled. It was fast paced job that had to think on your feet."
good,"you do not get compensated the same as other places because of the weight they put on a ""Free"" flight . overall a fun and great place to work at. I wish I had time to fly to take advantage of the benefits."
good,"Working within the airline industry can be real intense from day to day. Each work day brings it's own excitement from a co worker or just seeing a former college colleague who you attended college. The job gives you plenty of flexibility while each aircraft is safety parked at the gate followed by the procedures of unloading the aircraft. Working as a team and building a bond is one thing that's great within the industry. You spend years with other co workers and they become part of family. You interact with flight attendants, captains, and gate agents so you never working with the same people each day always new and fresh smiles each day."
good,"I enjoyed working at American Airlines, a typical work day starts about 3am getting set up for the passengers to arrive at the ticket counter to check in and check baggage. It can be stressful at times, but you also get to meet different people from all walks of life. Most of upper management is very hands on and willing to help whenever a problem occurs or we have to deal with a rude passenger. the coworkers are all a great part of the team helping to check everyone in and get them to their proper place.  I enjoyed working there because you had flight benefits"
good,I chose American Airlines out of family pride - 4 generations of my family work for American Airlines.  I left a few months post 9-11 as a single mother layoff notices became increasingly threatening and I had to leave.  I would have loved to stay with the company and build a strong career.
good,"The people are great and professional but the health insurance could be a lot better. The company can make you do mandatory overtime when there is extreme weather, can be a hard job on some days."
good,"Designed effective planning for SCM and implemented the setup of the Environment"
good,Average place to work. Benefits are good.  I have been there for 4 years and it is a nice place to work.  I work from home to the workplace is great..
good,"Fue mi primer trabajo, empece a desarrollar una carrera en lineas aereas, mis colegas excelentes, la parte mas dificil del trabajo fueron los horarios de madrugada"
good,Being able to see most shows for free was a plus. The most enjoyable part about this job was meeting so many exciting people. My co-workers were great individuals and management were great also. I learned a great amount of coping skills on this job.
good,This job is great but does require one to be absent from family a lot . The travel is exciting but dealing with customers needs can be challenging at times. Availability at all hours is required and flexibility to new places and environments is a must! Can present physical challenges due to constant altitude changes. Being a team player is important and of course positive personality is needed . I enjoyed my time as a flight Attendant !
good,I very much enjoyed my time with American Airlines as an Office Based Representative.  The company is very busy after the merger with USAirways.  I was promoted within six months of hire and would've remained had I not moved out of state.
good,"Un d√≠a normal de trabajo se desarrollaba en la oficina principal en donde para realizar mis tareas  tenia todas la herramientas necesarias como computador y celular de alta gama."
good,Great place to work.  The travel benefits were outstanding. Great team of people willing to do whatever it took to keep the airline going.
good,"Transportation and safety a must. Goal oriented, Zero tolerance, Employees well being. Team work.  Daily work goal must be achieved as planned. No slacking. Every minute counts and cost. On my time working for this company, I learned to handle everything at a Zero tolerance."
good,".good place to meet famous people "
good,"Cross utilized. Could start with Passenger Check-in, then move to departures and boarding, After departure, could be at the ticketing counter, Reservations or coordinating with travel agencies debit/credit memos."
good,It is a work from home job. Log on to the computer check for any policy updates. You do have to learn how to self manage yourself. Hold yourself accountable for being on time because there is no leniency for tardiness. It is a lonely job because the only time you see your coworkers is during the business meetings that happen once a month. The hardest part of the job is being a caring and compassionate person. Yet having to follow or lay down rules to the customer that are not always in their favor in extreme and desperate moments of their lives. The most enjoyable moment is helping people when they are desperate and having them genuinely thank you.
good,"Working in the airlines is a very challenging place to be because you don't know what can happen from one hour to another.It can get ugly and i had to take care of all the issues as they arise. very supportive managements where we worked as a team and were there for each other. they were days where it get so bad that you see steam coming out of your head, but i managed to take care of it in a timely manner."
good,"American Airlines is a great job.  A typical day at work is back to back call taking (I was in reservations).  You have to deal with snobby customers, irate customers, and really nice people too!  There is A LOT to learn for what little you get paid.  Starting wages are $10.21 per hour until they get a new contract with their union.  You have to make it through your 120 day probationary period and attendance is a MUST.  Once you are out of training you bid for your shifts that you work against all of the people that are in reservations.  We are talking like 500 people.  Seniority rules.  If you are a new hire, chances are you will get a crummy schedule unless you are really flexible with your time.  The benefits are AMAZING.  You get medical, dental, vision, 401k, and the BEST benefit is Travel Benefits.  Thats right, you fly for free.  Management for the oat part is okay.  You have members of management that are more strict than others and for the most part they are helpful."
good,there was always team in order to get the job done . it was always a pleasure to work for this company the hardest part was making sure all passengers baggage reach the gates on time for the departing flights
good,"Great benefits, Management can sometimes overwork you.  Agent and Ramp positions are very flexible so that is a positive."
good,Great flight benefits and lots of opportunities within the compoany.  They encourage employees to move around the company and learn different areas of the business.
good,"Would definitely go back for the right opportunity."
good,I work with the passengers. I learn how to communicate with an angry passenger and to solve problem. I like this job because I help people specially when their are lost.
good,"This position provided me with the greatest amount of on-site experience, and growth."
good,"Un d√≠a en el trabajo de acuerdo al turno, empieza a las 4:45 am, nos dirig√≠amos a las oficinas a organizar papeler√≠a y a la reuni√≥n correspondiente para acordar los par√°metros de la operaci√≥n. Al salir a los counters cada cual nos ubic√°bamos en nuestro lugar de trabajo, all√≠ con mis compa√±eros comenz√°bamos con la asistencia, orientaci√≥n, instrucci√≥n y conducci√≥n a pasajeros, resolviendo dudas e inconformidades frente al servicio del vuelo, durante este proceso estaba pendiente de cualquier apoyo que pudiera brindar a mis compa√±eros o mis jefes, al cerrar los counters nos dirig√≠amos a la salida del vuelvo donde deb√≠a organizar a los pasajeros para su entrevista y r√°pido acceso al avi√≥n. Al despegar el vuelo deb√≠amos volver a la oficina donde empezaba con el inventario de papeler√≠a, organizaci√≥n de archivo, apoyar el cuadre de vuelo  y estar  a disposici√≥n de las necesidades laborales de los jefes hasta que llegara la hora de la siguiente operaci√≥n."

good,the biggest perk for me is the flexible hrs & flight benefits & working outside & not in an office were im formally from ....so its pretty good its a tad of an issue when the winter weather hits o- & the summer weather hits over 100 if i had any grievances that would be it ....
good,American Airlines is a great job . It was a great experience working with planes and  Communicating with passengers around the world. A normal day in American Airlines is  Arriving to work greeting passengers .checking passengers in to their flights and helping passengers have a great fly experience. I worked 12 years of customer service at the airport and it's a great experience

good,"they seem like they are considerate of their personnel"
good,"Your typical work day was very busy , always filled with different things to do. I definitely learned a lot here most importantly teamwork. The hardest part of the job was the extensive strain on your body day after day but after a while your body adjusts to it."
good,Ambitious and at times very dis-organized environment to work in.  Dealing with irregular operations or cancelled flights.  Requires strong organizational and people skills.
good,The travel benefits were awesome and used frequently. The ability to switch shifts or work as much or as little as I want allowed for the necessary flexibility of work and life balance. Also allowed me to setup my own vacation days.
good,"A American Airlines √© uma empresa onde me senti muito bem, tanto ao trabalhar na parte de cart√£o de cr√©dito e tamb√©, na √°rea de reembolso para passageiros, os gerentes sempre est√£o dispostos a nos ajudar com os desafios que surgem durante os dias."

good,"Days are normally the same, except when the weather changes things could get a little hectic. People are great to work with, you learn a thing or two as you grow with the company"
good,"My job was mostly set up crew for shift. Monitor them constantly. Not all but some. Three shifts consisted of AM,PM,MIDS. Mostly on the job training. If you catch on quick good. Or if you have a good coach to help you learn then awesome. To many systems to learn right away it could take some time. Besides crew members you also follow up with maintenance on jobs for aircraft. And ramp for AOG ships to other stations. Occasionally calling emailing other people for follow ups. Good company. Good benefits. Just culture is a little old and outdated. Very union so it can get frustrating at times. All in all it‚Äôs an ok company."
good,"I enjoyed working at American. I really liked the flight benefits. I worked for some great bosses, truly solid human beings. There was usually a threat of layoffs, but they never really happened while I was there. I really enjoyed working for American and would live to return someday."

good,"A typical workday was pretty much laid out when you arrived. Sometimes, because it was a repair maintenance base with customer deadlines, we were required to work O/T to meet goals.  Everyone seemed to pull together and meet the goals."
good,My issue with this job was salary based...started out making 11.25 ended making 11.58 in the 3 years that I was employed there. Supervisors were great however managers were not so good

good,"Glad to be part of AA Pivotal Cloud, DevOps  automation  and  development team. Good place to learn new technology and do  research and development. Best workplace."
good,"always on the cutting edge of new technology; typical work day Monday-Friday 0700-1530; mid-level management not as competitively qualified as in past years; large company, hardest part of the job is locating inter-company sources that can assist you in problem resolution, networking is a must; most enjoyable part of the job is collaboration with experienced employees in problem operational problem resolution"

good,"Becoming a flight attendant has been truly my dream career, outside of wanting to become an entrepreneur. I've learned so much about, myself since training leading eventually making it to the line. The training I received then and once a year now makes me completely comfortable in my role in and off an aircraft."
good,Never been surrounded by so many smart people before.  All very hard working.  My department was constantly changing and required flexibility on everyone's part.  Must be flexible.
good,"Buen ambiente, trabajo en equipo, se aprendi√≥ mucho sobre atenci√≥n a clientes, quejas reclamos, tambi√©n sobre seguridad y primeros auxilios"
good,"The work is straight forward and the day to day does not deviate. The company is trying to improve the culture, but there are a lot of legacy employees that are resistant to change. There are many great managers and many old school managers. The hardest part of the job is the bureaucracy. The best part is the flight benefits."
good,Great company to work for the chance to see the world. The job is working from home so you have little to no chance to mingle with coworker or customer.
good,"I was highly engaged while a Sr. Project Manager at American Airlines.  We worked a lot, but generally not more than 45 hrs/week.  I had a very good opportunity to be involved at supporting the bottom line and was even slightly involved in strategic decisions as a level 4 (low level management position), plus I had a lot of visibility with senior management."
good,"I was hired as a temp worker for the holiday season. The managers are all very sweet. You can tell that they care about the business and the people. In fact, everyone was very nice!! Problem was low pay, no benefit, training wasn‚Äôt great, no good full time employment opportunities, and a lot of hassle to get your airport badge and go through security every day, which added 30 more minutes to my commute since I also had to park far away from the terminal. Overall, I just didn‚Äôt think it was worth all the hassle for this low paying position. It‚Äôs definitely for someone who wants the flight benefits if they can obtain a permanent position."
good,i like the unity and productivity and training that american airlines offer its employees. There are so many ways to advance while working with them. Its a place to retire from
good,American Airlines has many opportunities for their employees to move around the company and gain a plethora of experience. The travel benefits are a plus!
good,"Great benefits.  Great Managment. "
good,If I was paid a bit more hourly or had more hours I'd bump my rating up. Some days are more difficult than others due to the weather and I have not been there long. So far it's been a positive experience. The people that work there are nice enough and willing to help you learn the job. There are times it can be pretty fast paced but the majority of the time it's a calm environment.
good,"always fast pace environment with technology and trainings,  with a lot of competition,  working closely with managers assisting you on the daily basics"
good,Cool job. Had fun meeting new people it was a job I had when I was 18. It was with prime-flight so unfortunately we didn't get much benefits. I'll work here again
good,This is a workplace that is very diverse.  You have many opportunities to participate in additional job assignments and it provides a flexible schedule.
good,"Good, professional people. Company merged with other airline and is moving in new direction and is trying to obtain the highest rating and be the best airline"
good,"Is an amazing company, employees are great people, only managers at the ticket counter are so rude and militant, even when people go to the bathroom they follow you there and count how long it take you to go there, can you believe it? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one saying this."
good,A typical day at work is relaxed with a manageable number of meetings. The culture is vibrant with chatter of the next non-rev travel adventures. Learn as you go is the key principle with average amounts of training available. Management is good and respects your humanity. The hardest part of the job is keeping focused on the ever-changing vision. The most enjoyable part of the job is the travel benefits.
good,"Working in AA was  very learning experience. Job I was hire didn't open manager didn't  said why."
good,"The airline offers various seat classes to suit the needs of its passengers. This includes the Flagship Suite for international first-class passengers flying on Boeing 777 aircraft. Business Class is available on all widebody aircraft, including the Airbus A330. Other classes available on American Airlines flights include Premium Economy on long-haul wide-body aircraft and Main Cabin Extra economy on regional aircraft."
good,very enjoyable place to work allows for growth and educative with management  with very personal touch to employee lives and allows a learning centre for all
good,"we took calls for our dept , yet when othters had low calls they were allowed to leave , and we had to take their calls, thus we never did have the apertunity to go home early"
good,"it was a call center that I loved working at, very relaxed and comfortable.. no stress if my assignment hadn't ended I would still be there til this day"
good,No comments on this company at this time.  Employment was very short and not enough time to evaluate culture of company.  Did not use benefits.  Compensation ok.
good,Over all American Airlines was a good company- I was among the ones that was recently laid off- So at this point not sure of the companies future so I will choice to look for other opportunities.
good,"Great place to work but they were moving Payroll, Accounting & Collections to Ft Worth/Dallas & Phoenix and I did not want to make the move.  Worked with people that were helpful and were team players."
good,"it was regular cause its a job didn't expect anything just my salary but the environment was good to be around cause everyone was busy to work, so i enjoy the time working with them"
good,"Really no complaints. I go to work and have no issues with anyone around me. Quiet environment, travel opportunities and willing to work with your schedule."
good,"American is a great place to work. Very culturally diversified throughout the company. It's a fast paced environment, which requires self management depending upon the department where you work. This means that the managers are usually busy most of the time so it requires you try to problem solve the situation at hand. A typical day is again fast paced and high volume of work depending upon your department. For the most part, a positive active work environment with great co-workers."
good,I really enjoyed working for the American.  I enjoyed fellow employees and the freedom to work at other airports and the benefits of flights around the world.
good,A typical work day was answering phones and booking flights. It was a fast pace atmosphere. Once you were off one call the next would immediately come through.
good,I have enjoyed my time with American Airlines.There are  flexible work hours and the opportunity to work from home remotely. Management coaching throughout the entire process.
good,American airlines was a good company to work for overall. Its unfortunate I had to part ways but im certain this next phase of my life will be just as plesant
good,"Lower-level management always treated employees very, very well. The pay and benefits were above average. The flying benefit was, of course, the greatest part of the benefits."
good,this is a great place to work. friendly atmosphere. knowledgeable staff. it was a work at our own pace atmosphere but with daily goals set. stress level was low. i entered and documented old records into sap system. wish i had never left.
good,It does not shine a very good light on the company for a manager to promise a full time college student that if they needed time off with short notice for school to let them know and it would be covered until you can get to the station.
good,I have had 30 years of aviation  work--but if I could work from san diego it would help not to travel to another city to start work...being able to work in a different type of flying is my interest--thank you--pat diamond
good,"Work at Amrican Airlines is extremely fast paced but a great experience. If you like meeting and helping people, this is the PERFECT job for you. You will love everything about this job and what it'll do for you. Being that Charlotte is one of their main hubs this is the place for meeting people from all expects of life...but remember that you hold the perception of so many people that come and go."
good,"arrive on time and clock in, go to your assigned bay, (or Check Job Posting location) Wait for crew chief to assign work duty, preform job assignment, turn over unfinished work with proper papers.Use break periods properly. pick up, clean up after work before punching out"
good,"unload and load bags on aircraft or off cargo belt"
good,It was a good learning experience i love to help people and making then happy so they Will com back the hardest part of the job Wiz when people miss their flights you got to have patience and come your customer down and let them know everything's going to be okay you will make it to your destination customer service is a number 1 the best part about working at the airport is getting to work with people and helping people and making sure they get what they want
good,"A typical day at work includes handling customer complaints, rebooking tickets, ticket sales, issuing boarding passes, baggage tags.  Service to our customers is essential.  Working Ticket Counters, Self Service Areas, Que the lines, Assist customers with obtaining boarding passes and baggage tags thru the self service machines."
good,"‚Ä¢	Weight and Balance Planner uses a computer systems and information collected agents to collect load data (passenger counts, cargo weights and fuel) to develop accurate computations of an aircraft center of gravity to determine aircraft payload limits."

good,"Was able to work from the comfort of my own home to provide the needs for my father and not have to worry about his care."
good,American gave me the opportunity to start in the lowest level and continue ascending every year. At the time I was there there were great opportunities to growth. But after they declare bankruptcy my job was in jeopardy and decided to look for a different job.
good,"this was one of my favorite work place.It was base on team work,challenges and stressful situations.every day was a different day and it was a versatile work place."
good,I enjoyed working here however I wanted to return to my hometown and decided to give up my job. The management treated me well and team work was encouraged.
good,a typical day was non stop busy going from heavy lifting to driving forklifts to running freight to the terminals....the hardest part of the job was working out in the extreme weather elements....as well as the constant heavy lifting....the most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers who were made of different cultures..
good,"Although, AA is not perfect, it is a company where you can advance and try different positions. Definitely a place where you can grow, but you will have to work very long hours."
good,Always engaged with your team to provide the 'Best Customer Experience' to our customers.  Always try to find the best solution to help our customers with their travel experience at the first point of contact.
good,"Great industry to gain a multi-faceted experience."
good,"The airline industry is extremely interesting. American encouraged employees to work in different areas of the company so as to understand demands of other departments. A good system was provided for moving up. The culture changed drastically after 9/11, shifted into a ""survival mode"" which was extremely stressful. I retired prior to the merger with another airline so cannot speak to the new environment except to say they've not been protective of retirees. My rating below of the CEO refers to the previous CEO when I was employed. I have no opinion of the current CEO."
good,"My years with American Airlines were filled  with  learning, promotion opportunities and fun. Management is easy to work with and are there when assistance is needed. I loved my many years with American."
good,Great Job Airbus 330 Captain
good,"even though the pay was low, the travel benefits made up for it.  The workplace was very aware of it's diversity and performed accordingly.I am not sure what the environment is like since I retired"
good,My main job description was to assist travelers in guiding them to the correct terminal and schedule flight departure. Also acknowledge them of the type of products on-board the airline and luggage weight.
good,Ok there was typically a lot of work to do ubt it was seldomdivided properly making the environment somewhat difficult to navigate on a good day. Management was fair but not very willing to be flexible.
good,"If you can deal with the customers it is a very good job to have. You fly for free it is stand by, our manager was not very knowledgeable  about most rules"
good,Excels in making sure the employee has as much training as possible. Flying for free is always a bonus. working with a diverse group of people are always enjoyable.
good,"Eight hour days , using all the information learned to complete your tasks. Management worked with the employees , although  the employees did not always work with each other. Your  job tasks were always under time constraints which during your shift could become stressful. The best part of the job was life balance and not having to take your job home with you at the end of the day."
good,El ambiente era agradable. No tengo mucho mas que decir de la empresa.
good,"During my employment it was somewhat stressful job, however it was well worth it and rewarding. I was team leader to improve company moral, which now missing"
good,AA is a fast paced work environment due to airline scheduling. Would recommend to anyone who loves that type of working environment. Not sure of working conditions post bankruptcy.
good,"It's a give and take. If you like a fast pace job, then this is the job for you. I learn how to stay humble through all situations. You will learn to be people oriented. And to add learn to be patience."
good,excellent work environment management was considerable love to interact with my co workers typical day interact with people all day hardest part would be raining days  enjoy all about my job .
good,Obviously the best benefit is the travel. If you like to go places this is a great place to work. Enjoyed my weekends and time off to the max. Other benefits are typical.
good,"Some teams in finance at the firm have significant work loads, party because it's necessary and partly because of inefficient systems and processes. The company is performing well and morale is generally fairly high. The travel perks are unreal, especially since it's extended to direct family and parents. Overall, it's been a good experience. If you are committed to the aviation industry this is a marquee player and there are many initiatives ongoing to continually improve the business."
good,Must be on time American Eagle commuter flights for American Airlines mostly turbo prop.  Same process as American Airlines flights must leave on time. Time is very important specially the first flights of the day to keep balance with the rest of the flights as to achieve a on time record
good,This was a great place to work.  You have to bee very flexible and understand that many times things are completely out of your control.  You have to work well under pressure.
good,"Started as a reservation Agent in 2012, Overall, the position is stressful. Back to back calls. Call volume stays high, have to bid for your shift based on seniority so every 3 months your shift changes. Co workers are friendly, management listens,. pay should be a bit higher due to all we do as a rep. No room for advancement unless u move to Dallas where the headquarters is located. Most ennjoyable part of the job is speaking to ppl all over the world, travel benefits, health benefits. Hardest part is putting up with disrespectful, rude passengers who feel deserving of everything yet u have to smile . out of 80 calls a day, 60 of them are curse outs."
good,"The job was a great building block for me. I learned problem solving as well as trouble shooting to solve issues. It also taught me how to work as a team. The hardest part of the job I felt was learning the manuals.  Last, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with other mechanics, sharing knowledge."
good,"American Airlines is an excellent company to work for. The caliber of the Pilots, Flight Attendants, and Mechanics is extremely high. The present management team really knows how to run a business."
good,This was a call center job that I took as stop gap until I could find another position in my field.  I stayed there for a year and was given a glowing recommendation when I moved on
good,My experience at American Airlines was very good overall. Fast paced and productive work environment. I worked here for 1 year as a student/volunteer for school credit.
good,"The flight benefits that come along with the Fleet Service position are hard to beat. Since this is a union job, you just have to show up work your 40 hrs/week and go on vacation to the various locals that AA services."
good,"There was a lot going on daily with this job.  Airlines are busy all day long, all week long.  It was very interesting and exciting at the same time.  Working with the people was the highlight."
good,"I loved American Airlines with all my heart. I wish they had not gone bankrupt. We the workers did everything we could to save her but it was not in the cards. All the workers at Sea-Tac who did not move to Dallas lost their careers with American. Hurts me to this day and I wish the new American Airlines nothing but luck and success."
good,Always a challenge after 9/11    Great people to work with    Worked with a lot different people.   Learned a great deal and used what I learned to expand my knowledge
good,"Must have passion for superior customer service to work in fast paced ever changing environment. Good benefits, schedules are 24/7 in good and bad weather."
good,"good place to work with, competitive and balanced. Good Culture and acquaintance. Would love to work here."
good,Typical day @ work included getting the production and enjoying the family atmosphere. I learned that you can do any job with training and a lot of people willing to work together.
good,This job is great if your looking to travel the world. You can easily swap shifts with your co-workers without getting supervisors or managers involved. If you call out or come to work late frequently that's an easy way to get fired
good,Good job and work environment.  Learned a lot about repairing airplanes.  Management was good.  Enjoyed the people.  Took a lot of time to work on the entire plane.
good,"If not for the lay-off, I am awaiting recall for up to 10 years time, I would still be there.  The energy, the excitement of the aviation industry is mind blowing.  I see everyday large 767/77 aircraft that come in for maintenance or engine repair.  It's an amazing process to see the aircraft restored to safe flying time and inspections.  It's a pleasure to be part of that process that so many travelers depend on that parts are verified by you!"
good,"I was a Home Base customer service representative. I would take calls from passengers to schedule or change their flights, help them choose what was the best route and best price."
good,Had a 28 year career with AA.  worked a lot of different jobs but enjoyed Load Planner the most. I went to school and received a dspatch cert from FAA while at Load Planner. This was a fast paced and rewarding career.
good,Challenging work environment that changed on a daily basis. Wonderful co workers and colleagues. Needed ability to be flexible since every day was different. Satisfaction in knowing you contribute daily to minimizing customer travel disruption. Learned to work as part of a team to achieve the final result.
good,"Excellent company! Challenging, yet fair, work environment. Dedicated ""promote from within"" philosophy. American Airlines is an innovative company that encourages values driven, hard working employees!"
good,"Assistant duties. Ordering and tracking airplane parts and dealing with the fuel available for the planes. Planning travel, expense reports,organizing schedule for 3 engineers and 2 Managers. Assist analysts with FAA projects."
good,"I'm contracted for AA, so personally I don't interact with the CEO's and their high ranking management team, but with the team that I do work  with on a daily basis, I enjoy them and value what they do daily, but the agents on the ground floor as you check in from the street level  are the rudest people,and TSA  are no better as an employee its no better for me either but the way they talk to guest is embarrassing and uncalled for."
good,really good place to work for. a lot to learn and enjoy. the culture is awesome. if I had made more money I would probably still be there enjoying the atmosphere
good,"AA taught me about work culture and the airline industry."
good,"Fun, exciting, challenging business.  The changing shifts, night work and holiday work can be trying. Providing a safe, reliable and efficient service day in and day out was quite rewarding."

good,An average day was never average. Maintenance could be anything from a seat belt change to a jet engine removal. That was what made the job so interesting! Working line maintenance prepared me for most duties needed on most aircraft. Being able to complete a job in time for departure is VERY satisfying. The hardest and sometimes most enjoyable part of the job could be the weather. It could be a downpour of rain or snow or a beautiful sunrise or sunset!

The most difficult part of this job was working outside in humid, hot conditions. I learned to work pacy while working smart and safe. Efficiency is the key so employees typically have a lot of downtime to preserve their health. This was the most enjoyable part of this job.

good,"A typical day as a Reservation Sales Representative consisted of answering constant back to back calls, and sometimes answering the same questions more than once to the same customer. I personally learned so much from this certain position not only about a positive and memorable customer service experience, but about myself and how I am most productive. There were about 6 weeks of vigorous training on how to work on certain systems such as Sabre or Citrix, and also on how to treat customers. Most supervisors were more than pleasant to work with, at the end of the day the supervising department wants you to succeed. Some approach the situation differently of course, but still amazing. I truly loved working with my co-workers, through out those 6 weeks of training you grow extremely close, and learn to rely on each other when needed. The hardest part of working for this position was working from home. We knew from the get go that the position was working from home but for some of us didn't know what exactly we were getting into. In my case I was more productive in an office setting because it felt more high energy, and you also see how your co-workers are doing and you keep each other company when in between calls.The part I most enjoyed about the job was not only the life long friendships you make with some of the employees, but also the way you can flip a customers situation around to where they are so happy they got you as a representative. For example, I once had a customer who, after I solved their problem, thanked me so much for helping them. They explained to me that they"

A typical day at work could start very early in the morning or very late at night, but each day brought new customers to care for and new challenges and experiences to grow. Self discipline was extremely important since we worked unsupervised and co-workers were always different. A lot of patience and professionalism was requiered since we worked with different personalities and differnet cultures all the time. The hardest part of the job was to stay constantly away from home for a few days, but at the same time being away brought personal growth and the opportunity to visit many places and meet lots of people."

good,"American Airlines was my favorite employer. I worked for the compnay for 5 years before being laid off. A typical day at work included the inventorying of lost bags and trying to find the owner of them through the use of our proprietary computer systems. I also made calls to customers when bags were located and also answered incoming calls from customers inquiring about the baggage claim process, and even managed our warehouse which contained the lost bags. I learned many things about airlines and the transportation industry as a whole. My co-workers were all hard-working, but had a good sense of humor and kept a lighthearted attitude. There was never a dull moment. My favorite part of the job was when I had found a customers missing bag that was missing for a long time, and I got to make that phone call to that customer! The hardest part of the job? The airline industry as a whole is very dependent of the price of fuel, which, as we all know, tends to be very high. So there were many times of uncertainty when the company mentioned it would be downsizing to support the rising cost of fuel. Those uncertain times were never fun. Management for me was never an issue. My managers always set the standard by working hard and always being available. At the same time, they weren't micro-managers and allowed us to do our jobs."

good,A professional attitude is what is required on a typical day at work with the Premium travelers. I learned to work with all areas of management and being a self starter.

If you left hub at 7am, you could fly to three different cities or more in several States, and finish about 8pm, taxi in time at night. The meals and hotels are paid for when you stay over I. Other areas not your hub.  Hardest part not a fair question, quite simply put, I would describe hard as the seriousness of the crew and passengers you serve abiding by all Safety rules to ensure they have an alert and serious person who was capable of handling emergencies at any moment in a calm intelligent and expedient manner.  It was a fun job."

We are their for the safety and comfort of our passengers.  The training is extensive and excellent.  It is a career that I would love to pursue again and with American Airlines.  It is a career that offers a great deal of flexibility, but can be very demanding at times as well.  I was treated, for the main, with respect and kindness from other crew members and some aspects of management."

good,"It was a great company to work for. You were able to pick up or drop hours whenever you needed or wanted to.  The flexibility was great.  The company also had good health and dental benefits.  After 911, so many things have changed over the years, it got to be a job, where as before you enjoyed going in and working.  The good thing was even though the day was probably a stressful one, once you walked out of the airport and went home you didn‚Äôt think about it till you walked back in the next day.  It‚Äôs now time to retire."
good,"Great Pay. Plenty ways to get more hours and great trips as flight attendant. Company encourages advancement! After working there for 5 years, i have seen improvements and changes in management- things are going in the right direction. American wants to be the best and they expect the best from their employees, holding employees responsible for there actions and rewarding good performances with advancements or honorable mentions. Company needs to better equip flight attendants with better tools, coupons, comp miles, etc to better improve a customers experience during delays or during bad customer experiences. Union works to get better quality of work for flight attendants. Great place to work. I highly recommend."

good,"I work as a home based Rep so I did not have much interaction with my co-workers. What I liked best about this company is the opportunity to make a difference by participating with multiple resource groups as volunteers, fundraisers and/or the ability to set up a inclusion group. The  training and the tools we used are complicated but with continual use I found to be pretty user friendly The benefits were exceptional. The administrative staff is exceptional always aware of life events of employees, kudos given by customers and sharing a kind word to motivate when most needed.

good,"I loved my job before I got lay-off. Although yes there are bad days such as when the weather is bad, or there is a maintenance issue where we cannot get a flight out one time. Working at a smaller station like MSP, sometimes it becomes more of a problem when one flight is delayed because we don't have many gates. Regardless of involuntary reroutes and people getting mad, I really enjoyed looking for other options for passengers, even the mean ones. What I liked most of the job was that not any two days were the same. It's always something different and you meet new people everyday and you get to know some of the most frequent flyers and you get to hear peoples different places visited and experiences. The hardest part of the job is working a double and then getting stuck because of delays. Sometimes you cannot take a lunch break depending on how bad it gets."

good,"siente que American Airlines es una gran empresa reconocida globalmente, ofrece muy buenas prestaciones, sin embargo el staff administrativo y de gerencia en la cd de Monterrey no es bueno, por lo tanto afecta la visi√≥n global de la compa√±√≠a."

Managements are very supportive with the employees and the work enviorment is fun to work with. I have learned how to value friendship with co-workers, just like a family. The hardest part of the job is , a stressfull job, you have tobe clear headed and make good judgments, because knowing everytime the aircraft leaves the gate, everything must be correct in the weight balance of the aircraft, we are responsible for the lives of all the passengers on borad.The most interesting thing working for AA, I enjoy working for them, its always friendly enviroment, everyone cares about thier individual job and theres team works.."

good,"Management is always a con in every job. They tell you how do your job not knowing what's actually goes on the ramp. The boss though hes cool. It's the ""supervisor micromanagement"" that everyone tends to stay away from."
good,"AA is a great company to work for. While the overall work environment is very faced paced and offers a wonderful product that I believe in and support, the culture needs an enormous amount of development. This industry functions by having bodies in place. When those bodies are individually devalued, that lack of value is unfortunately passed on the the customer."
good,"American Airlines is a great company to work for with opportunity for growth. The benefits are great and flight benefits are amazing."
good,I recommend someone who has no kids and currently not stable. This job is for someone always on the go. The job is more of a priority. You will have to work in a main hub versus smaller ones to have more people to exchange for you. Larger hubs more communication.
good,The typical work day would involve high stressful situations of having to advise and reschedule passengers flights for their business or leisure needs. We also booked reservations for future travel trying to find the best times and dates by listening to the customers needs and wants. I also had a help with lost baggage as well as questions for international travel having to deal with custom regulations to exit the country for travel.

good,Great company to work for and great benefits. The way the company makes customer service the most important in all areas was amazing and very rewarding.
good,"People you work with are great. Management ok.  Move up quickly if you follow the rules.  Hard to get into management positions.  Travel benefit is fantastic and amazing, take time to travel and be very flexible"
good,"I had a good run, and it is time to move on.  It is like any large organization if you get assigned to a good group it can be a very positive experience.  Unfortunately the past few years I have been assigned to the opposite and unable to move with in the organization. Advice, be mindful of organization changes."

good,American Airlines is a fun work place and allows you to feel comfortable. It is very rewarding to work in an industry that is so dynamic. I would recommend American Airlines to aspiring job seekers.
good,American Airlines is a company I see myself with for a very long time. With tenure the benefits grow. Normal work day consists of inbound calls to satisfy customer needs.

good,American is a great place to work. There are excellent benefits. Depending on the department Management can be less than supportive. It can be stressful and is a quick paced environment.
good,It's a great place to work. Recently they have more micromanaged the agents making things a little more stressful. Things always change. They give benefits such as drive time and then take them away. Calls are consistent. Typically not much time between calls.
good,Working at American Airlines gave me good experience that I could later on use. Although it was a comfortable setting I wasn't growing at the rate I would have like to
good,Enjoyed my career with America Airlines.  Left their employ only because I turned 65 and was forced to retire by federal law.  There were many positive things happening at the company and the future looked really good.

good,"American was one of the best jobs anyone could have. Self managed, flexible hours, and great benefits. The management and supervisors teams are hands on and relatable."

good,"I worked at the Akron/Canton Airport for American Airlines, I enjoyed the job very much so.  Unfortunately, American pulled out of Akron/Canton and the only way for me to stick with the company would have been to move out of state.  I was not comfortable at the time moving so i resigned."
good,"American is a good place to work there are long hours some days, The work atmosphere is fast paced and you must have a thick skin to work here. over all this is a good place to work."

good,Very flexible schedules and amazing benefits for employees. 
good,"I came in late in the morning because only two flights went out early in the morning and that shift was already covered. I enjoyed meeting various types of people from former US President Bush's daughter, celebrities, underage minors and handicapped passenger. That taught me to never judge a person period, everyone was a different walk of life and you see it everyday working at the airport. The hardest part of my job was making a customer happy when a flight was cancelled due to bad weather. But other than that I enjoyed my employment with American Airlines and would go back at the drop of a hat."
good,"Everyday is a challenging day, every passenger has different needs and being able to provide excellent customer service is what is necessary to complete passenger satisfaction."
good,Best job in the city. Always overtime. Shift bid every couple months. Free flights for employees for domestic travel. Actual physical work isn't hard or overloading..

good,"I loved working there. The training is the toughest part. I did t like how the older ladies bullied the young ones. Some people lacked sympathy so, so its best to do your job and enjoy the sights"
good,Must be able to lift 70-100lbs there is a union so you have to bid on shifts job is amazing if you love to fly but won‚Äôt pay all the bills with the paychecks
good,This was one of my favorite places to work because it allowed me to be home with my daughter. Travel benefits were great even though I didn‚Äôt travel often. And we got raises based on performance which was nice.
good,The schedule is based on a seniority schedule.  The ability to grow in the company is fairly simple if you show initiative and are eager to learn.  The job itself tends to be monotonous. Really great people in different departments.
good,"I hope to get a new job there , soon!  My contract ended and I'm looking for another opportunity."
good,Great benefits and job flexibility is awesome. You can pick up as many hours as you want regardless of being part time or part time. The management is just awful.
good,"Sometime disrespectful show to who deaf employee in American Airlines they do not understand how deaf culture are! They discriminate and also rude on me"
good,16yrs w the company.  Good place to work.  Job security is a big concern.   Not sure of what companys plan is in merger w US Air.  Cant afford to lose this job or move.  Airline industry is great as long as the jobs are around.
good,Loved my job I wish I never had to leave. Family comes first at the end of the day. The job was fun and they had plenty of career advancement opportunities.
good,"My overall work experience is above average rating.  As a part-time employee it was a little challenging when it came to mandatory OT.  Part-time employees are mandated first before full-time employees, and can last for several hours.  The job is fast-paced and you must be able to make decisions quickly and know how to multitask at the highest level.  Must be able to communicate clearly.  Great place to work; however, you must be willing to relocate in order to advance.  Starting salary for airport personnel is extremely low and cannot negotiate a higher starting salary, even with experience; however, the pay does increase gradually.  Early morning start time and late nights....Odd hours/days off can make it challenging for family life.  Unpredictable weather, maintenance and other situation causing cancellations and/or delays can result in an unplanned longer shift."
good,"Wonderful travel benefits "
good,"I have a large fan so the free flight benefits are very enticing. Unfortunately, the trade off is pay. You don‚Äôt get paid very much as a part timer but if this is your second job it‚Äôs perfect. The environment is chill and the team is great for the most part. We usually have to work really hard and quickly for about 1-2 hours then you get 1-2 hours down time to wait for the next plane to come in. It‚Äôs an easy job honestly but you will be doing manual labor and some heavy lifting repeatedly. If you can handle working outdoors and sweating in the summer or freezing in the winter, this job can be fun. It is a team effort so everything you do is with a coworker. I love my job."
good,"I did like everything about the company. I learned so much with the company. I would love to get back on board again."
good,Its a very respectable company to work with. I saw a lot of people from different parts of the world. Every single stake holder was very helping and understanding.

good,Simplifica el proceso de llenar los formatos  den oportunidad a las personas con deseos de trabajar
good,"en resumen muy buena empresa, con altos y bajos, pero BUENA"
good,Pretty laid back place to work and coworkers make it so much easy during rough days.  especially days when we have thunder storms outside or blizzard warnings .
good,"Different line of work but beats working for a living.  Definitely a culture change from military flying to commercial flying. The pilot job went to a secondary position below the marketing positions of flight attendants, which was often an issue that management supported."
good,"Tr√®s bonne ambiance dans l'entreprise."
good,I had a great experience working at American Airlines. It was busy and we always had something new to keep us on our toes. Management in our department was supportive and helpful with any and all aspects of our job.
good,i am having great time working at american airlines. company uses many advanced technology for data analytics. and work culture is also awesome. i learn alot at my internship

good,Very dedicated to the company and committed to my work responsibilities. Getting along with co-workers. Provided great customer services to the callers.
good,Would definitely recommend as a great place to work awsome pay and benefits and good co workers. Spent 25 fun years there with no regrets. Enjoyed the professional atmosphere generated by the dedicated employees who made the day to day operations run as smoothly as they did.
good,Working hard everyday is always challenging but at the end of the day the task are always completed . The most enjoyable part of working is making a customer happy  at the end of ther day. It's always easy to say no to a customer when you cant help them however its easier to say no however you go the extra mile to making the problem  less stressful.
good,Working as an intern at American Airlines' Machine Learning Center of Excellent was great. There were plenty of diverse problems to work on with lots of incredibly smart people from different backgrounds. The ambience was peaceful and the travelling benefits are great!
good,I enjoy working for American Airlines. Work and home life balance is very hard but you're able to pick up and swap shifts.huge support system once you get to know other employees and managers there. The hardest part is dealing with some of the travelers. The best part is being able to swap shifts with other co-workers if needed for a day off or to work overtime.
good,I enjoyed working at American Airlines and meeting new people every day.  The people I worked with for the most part were friendly and willing to work as a team.  My managers were fair and considerate.
good,"Casual, but high paced work environment.  Most days included high volume of color printing and production graphics.  Some design work most weeks. Sometimes juggling 3 to 5 jobs at a time."
good,"I got my start with this great company and took great pride in being a representative of theirs. Their attention to detail not only has kept the company one of the top, but the customer service awareness is strong. "

good,"Great company to work for and the benefits are great also. "
good,"Hey all I can say is:"
good,"Very challenging industry, considerable customer service exposure too. Typical day could include de-icing planes, dealing with weather, canceled flights and customer complaints"
good,Great pilot culture. Typical management/union stress. Timing of your hiring means a lot since opportunity is based on seniority.  Future pay increases should be very good.
good,"Work is fine but sudden changes in management is unproductive and stressful while working."

good,"This job was in Manhattan, it was managing some of the top revenue generating clients for American Airlines.  We worked with top Corporate Departments and Travel Agencies in the New York market place.  My job was managing the department of 23 inside sales reps who responded to client needs to make changes to reservations as well as receive favorable fares while creating sell up opportunities.  We successfully did that as our clients and the company had a mutual understanding of loyalty.  As they say if you can make it in New York you can make it anywhere, so true..."
good,I work with a new crew everyday which is always a challenge because everyone has different work styles. I also interact with a wide verity of people and cultures everyday and one has to always be respectful to others beliefs and customs. The hardest part of the job is probably being away so much from family and friends but I get to travel the world and that is always nice.
good,"My typical day at work consist of interacting with all agents on a daily basis."
good,"AA is a part-time dream job, it is great if you have another job and just working there for the travel benefits. The job dose not pay well enough for the responsibilities that it entails, it is so important to have alert reliable and caring individuals in these positions, but I feel that the pay should reflect the responsibilities."
good,"Employment with this company was very educational, gained knowledge in the aspect of airlines industral.  By been able to work in varies different shops and departments."
good,"Great place to work, many opportunities to learn and grow."

good,"Work for American airlines MIami airport was an great expeience. Your never felt that your are working , is a great place to work , learned, enjoy , help people, and make a career."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was working outside. Fun work place to airplanes take off and arrive. Great team.  The break had started to to get crowed as the company grew.
good,A typical day at American Airlines is filled with providing excellent customer service while booking or changing customers reservations.  I even take in a couple of customer complaints for the airline to improve. The hardest part of my job is remembering that you can't think of your pockets when booking or making changes to a flight reservation. American Airlines is a great company and the people there really do become your family.
good,"I would use my key card to get into the building twice. Then I would head to my locker and put my personal belongings away besides a few dollar bills and my  lanyard and my headset. I headed off to the cafeteria and bought a hot tea where I met my table of friends I trained with for 6 weeks about 7 months ago. We still remained tight. Between all of us we had flown all around the world. I would not trade this moment for anything.....single, loads of friends, and traveling where and when I want. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the hours. We are seniority based. My first shift was 3:30-Midnight, with Tuesday and Wednesdays off. Most of my friends were similar but with different days off. I learned to be very adaptable. The most enjoyable part of the job, teaching and flying!"
good,"The day started out at 4:00 am. I was the crew chief of the gate. I had to make sure all the equipment was running and enough equipment was on the gate to support the incoming flight. I learned how to run the gate in a timely fashion. Everything is timed. Management was ok but, the people they hired as the manager and supervisors had no experience in the airlines. It was about cost. My co-workers were great, good people. The hardest part of the job was the quick turns of the flights, when you had to check others jobs and they didn't do it right. Watching the planes come and go. Wow"
good,i have graduated so i am ready to move on and work in my field of study
good,Excellent company to work for. Great place and people. Will Add more Later.

good,love to work for this company and after 12yrs got layoff with the hopes to return back even if it is at another airport
good,Working as an Aircraft Maintenance Tech for American Airlines was an incredibly challenging and exciting career. I had the opportunity to maintain the world's top notch jets.
good,"A typical day at American was never typical, because you didn't know what you might be working on next. I worked in terminals and aircraft hangers at DFW Airport as well as buildings and hangers at Allience Airport. The fact that you were at an airline ment that even though you were a facilities mechanic you could be called upon to work on an airplane also. I learned a lot about what makes an airline run as far as maintenance is concerned and since I was called upon to fill in as crew chief at times I learned how to motivate members of my crew. My co-workers were all professional in there jobs and always ready to lend a hand if needed. The hardest part of the job was moving from one location to another where you were needed as you felt you were leaving family behind. The most enjoyable part was finding co-workers you had worked with before at the new place."
good,"sometimes, the job is very hard during oso but other wise, its fun to work with this company"
good,The economy and unions have cause strain within the workgroups.
good,"Striking balance in the work environment,  providing competitive pay and benefits packages, ample opportunities for career growth and development, a diverse and inclusive working environment and the recognition our employees deserve. Great place to work."
good,"No two days are ever the same. "
good,"I am absolutely appreciative and respectful of the career opportunities American Airlines provides. "
good,"Free flying benefits for yourself , children and spouse . Parents / in laws or step parents fly at huge discount. You get buddy passes each year for friends and other family to fly at a discount. So the flying benefits are huge and make up for the pay  ."
good,Great place to work part time.  Everyone works as a team at Erie airport.  Must have some flexibility as far as hours because of bidding process for your schedule. Best reason to work for airlines are the free flight benefits.
good,"Le salaire est le minimum mais les tickets restaurant, le remboursement transport et surtout les avantages voyages accessibles d√®s le 1er jour (m√™me en cdd) valent la peine.."
good,Enjoy my time at American  Airlines and learned so much about leadership and directing the workforce.  Each day would consist of planning and organizing in addition to presenting to Senior Leadership.
good,"Its not a bad job, very laid back. There are many opportunities to transfer to other departments once you are part of the team. They do try to encourage a family type environment."
good,I have no complaints. I'm up for retirement and need something new. It is a great place to work for someone young and have the ability to work well with other. Plus traveling is not so bad
good,"good place to work for, good benefits, good culture and management is air. Most co-workers are fun to work with. The hours are comfortable and flexible."
good,"Good management. Happy employees. Good place to learn new technology. "
good,The job can be stressful and changes all the time. The training is long and you must pass weekly test. When there is a problem with weather or planes themselves you may be required to work overtime.
good,You know what you are getting into in this industry.  Things operate  24/7/365.  Everyone wants cheap fares and the company wants to make money.  Local PHL management is good.
good,American airlines has awesom benefits and area to grow withing the company. You can try out any field to see what best fits. The compensation isnt too bad but needs improvement. However the medical benefits are great.
good,Very nice work life balance plenty of vacation and time off. Can pick up shifts anytime and flight benefits were fly free in lower 48. Now they pack the planes so full hard to get on.
good,I feel the job is fantastic for someone who is single and has no children.  The hours when you first start are changing all the time.  You must be flexible the first few years working for this company.
good,Good company to work for with excellent benefits.  Only sorry that I had to retire at 65!  A typical day at work included an average of three flights with about an hour off between them followed by a fairly short stay in a hotel near the airport.  Management always treated me fairly and let me do my job without interference.  Hardest part of the job can be long hours on bad weather days and about half the month on the road.
good,"It is a very fast pace job and it requires a lifestyle change that is suitable for you. It was amazing to travel and see the world, but the time management was difficult. Being able to balance work and life was hard but the benefits and experience that came with the job made it all worth it."
good,"My career at AA has been quite challenging and rewarding, both of which I appreciate. Opportunity to advance within the ranks, certainly if you're willing to relocate to other cities."
good,My job is fast paced & we work under pressure at times when we are boarding a flight & giving other passengers exceptional customer service at the same time.

good,"American really taught me how to be an adult and evolve my sense of individual culture through an expansive platform to meet, greet, and get to know people of different cultures from all around the world."
good,50-70 calls daily. Reservations. Must be able to adapt to change. Great work-life balance once you realize how to adjust your schedule. Recommend for those willing to work for travel benefits.
good,"Normal work days "
good,I loved the family life of it all. We helped one another as a unit. If you love traveling then you'll love the diversity of the atmosphere. Sometimes the days get hectic but you'll make it through.
good,"Was a good company to work for i enjoyed my time thereMy time was limited but i loved the teamwork spirit very fast and demanding and long hours."
good,A lot of great employees that are ready to help you whenever needed.  Always greeted by fellow employees and most of the employees are cordial and helpful.
good,Great Experience. Learned a lot of about fge airline industry. Poor management. But the best co-worker there like family. Great flight benefits fly for free.
good,"This was a great job when I was young. I got to see the world for very little money. It does get tiring when you fly all of the country and the world. The time zones make it worse. Sometimes passengers are unbelievably rude, but this is typical in any customer service business."
good,"International excitement and a lot of work."
good,"great faced paced workplace, great co-workers, great benefits beyond the the usual ones like free flights anywhere in the us . how great is that, horrible pay for what you are responsible for after 13+ years of employment and being a crew chief and trainer it was very low pay"
good,Los beneficios economicos tienen una brecha muy grande en comparacion con los colegas De otras estaciones all rededor del mundo
good,"American has been a great place overall to work. It can be stressful at times with delays or cancellations and upset passengers, however the reward of being able to help someone get to where they need to go is worth it. You also get free unlimited travel on American Airlines domestically, and for international flights you only pay for taxes."
good,If your working in the airport it‚Äôs very face paced and a lot of different faces. If you enjoy meeting new and exciting people this is the place for you. Great benefit. It is a union job.
good,I loved working here it was stressful to the max but challenging and fulfilling when you get your flight out on time. I never wanted to leave but 9/11 made American Airlines make cut backs and I was on the bottom of the pool. I understand but wish I was still there today.
good,"I like the job just not the long commute, I drive in very heavy traffic for 50 miles each way and the traffic can cause a 45 minute drive to be up to 2 hours sometimes."
good,"Never worked a day with AA. Fun and exciting job, but you will put in a lot of mando hours with a lot of irops. But..... free travel when you are off!"
good,"American is a great place to work. High time work force. Lots of experience and constant learning opportunities. Everyone knows their job well and there is a general culture of respect among the employees. Some of the best experienced mechanics on the planet. From a technical perspective, the job of supervisor is a pleasure."
good,"While working for American Airlines, I had the best time of my life. The duties were demanding and challenging. My colleagues were the most diverse group I have ever been with."
good,"I worked at US airways and became an AA employee after the merge. The management of native US airways was great, the staff was the best, the work day was FULL but went by quick and was complex but loved every shift."
good,I truly loved working at American Airlines.  Their senior leadership has exactly the right ideas about the directions.  It will take time for all to take the same leap of faith.

good,Loved working at American Airlines! Great company to work for in the airline industry! Flexible schedule and great travel perks! However flight attendant managers could be more understanding.
good,Challenging work and everyday is something different. Plenty of growth opportunities. Operational experience is a plus if you want to grow in aviation.
good,This was a contract position with American Airlines.  The job was fun and co-workers were very supportive.  There was always work to be done.  The only con would be that some of the permanent employees looked down on the contract employees.
good,"Trato con usuarios de diferentes lugares del mundo, hacer reservaciones nacionales e internacionales, entrenamiento y uso del sistema sabre ademas de el manejo de tarifas de boletos aereos"
good,"Friendly Team and Environment"
good,"Each day was different. Great customers and environment was great. Enjoyed working with all my co-workers. Great supervisor!"
good,Leads handed out the work for the shift.  Based on your ability determined which assignment you received for the day.  Some co-workers worked hard getting out of work than actually producing.  You can only do what you can in a given day as time permits and what you are actually working.  Very good company!
good,I really loved working here. There is a ton of culture and great customers. I enjoy that lifestyle that came along with working here. It is a family owned business and run well.
good,"Pros: I love this company! Competitive benefits and salary, great work/life balance and an industry leading, innovative company. Management is great and responds to concerns quickly and responsibly."
good,"A typical day at American Airlines is usually quite busy and fast paced. I've learned plenty about time management in American Airlines I came in unorganized and left with an appreciation to management and time. The management are okay, they are very helpful in various situations such as schedule changes and such. The co-workers are basically family, you cannot go wrong with your co-workers because they are in the same boat. The hardest part of the job is the work load on and off the clock. There is a saying everything changes but the runway. The most enjoyable part about the job is when you get to hear a satisfied customer."
good,"Everyday as a Gate agent is different, But on a daily basis we have to Securely off load passengers, and board passengers with a specific time span, helping with all customers questions and concerns on top of the required tasks per flight."
good,"This was my best job ever. Lots of opportunities, travel opportunities. I liked the idea of being self managed.  I liked that management allowed me to be cross-trained in all my areas of interest."
good,After 24 years of tenure with the airline the company culture had changed and no longer felt like home to me. American gave me a great opportunity to move into a second career and for that I am gratetful.
good,"Fun place to work.  You meet co-workers all over the country.  With the merger, this company has done a disservice to it's loyal employees who have retired by changing the travel policy."
good,"Great people, good benefits.  plenty of time to develop the proper skills. Hard to get hours due to cuts. management did the best they could do."
good,"A very active job, which allowed me to evolve and better all managerial skills by constantly dealing with different situations and a large amount of employees to work with."
good,"i enjoyed every day at work"
good,I loved that my skills were utilized while I worked with American. They had confidence in me and excelling within departments was amazing. The job offered so much learning and variety. I was sad that the contract position ended.

good,It was a great job lots of different challenges every day. Co-workers were great direction from manager was spot on. Plus you got to see the jet you worked with every day.
good,"I answer incoming calls from Advantage customers who need assistance in booking reservations, changing reservations and baggage loss. Some are very patient and understanding and some are very irritated that issues have come up in their experience with the airline. I enjoy resolving problems to the customer's satisfaction. I have learned to be patient, understanding, a good listener with empathy and multi-tasking. My supervisor is very knowledgeable, professional, a good teacher and employee oriented. Since I work at home, I have no co-workers which is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable is resolving issues and problems for customers that began with a great deal of frustration for them and ended with complete satisfaction with the resolution."
good,drive to random address hope the journeyman was sober enough to not leave the job in your hands before ready. organize a small warehouse tool supply by taking it all apart to reassemble cut apart as many units as possible pull weeds for pass time work help manager be involved handle short tempered customers for someone else.
good,"While working with this company, it allowed me to pursue my studies because of the flexible hours. A typical work day can be very challenging and allows for mental growth. Working with this company allows for  perks which would not have been possible with the economy. Hardest part of the job was having to inform passengers of cancellation of a flight, especially if they have a pressing engagement and time is a factor. Most enjoyable part of my job is getting my flights out on time and seeing the looks on the faces of the passengers when everything is on schedule. Worked with a great group of people. This job came with a new and rewarding challenge each day, and as such it built character, inner strength and made me better at multi-tasking and more customer oriented."
good,"I feel that after having gone to travel agent school and being placed with American Airlines, first in Austin, and then in San Antonio, I was able to accumulate so much experience, had it not been for my employment with this wonderful company, I never would have been able to see as much of the world s I did nor would I ever have been exposed to so many different cultures.                                                 "

good,"busy, sometimes hectic environment. good support from co-workers and management."
good,"American Airlines is a great place to work. I work from home so a typical day at work is pretty much me being alone for 8 hours. The hardest part of the job is have no interaction with people during my shift or even on breaks or lunch. The most enjoyable part of the job is i have learned self motivation, determination. I have been with American going on two years and i love the independence this job has given me to work on my own."
good,work at the baggage claim area verify the baggage for the customer and they something happen help the customer also do the inbound and outbound of the aircraft

good,I like my work.good people there & nice schedule. I see my myself staying with the company for a long time to come. I‚Äôve been employed here for 3 years & I don‚Äôt plan on going anywhere as long as I‚Äôm being treated like I am at the company.i don‚Äôt mind coming in for overtime or to help management out when they are in a bind with staff.

Everyday I meet new people and faced new exiting challenges. Besides, I love the aviation industry. I loved when I knew I made people feel comfortable and happy even when traveling is not the ‚Äúmost fun thing ever‚Äù for a lot of passengers. AA has amazing managers. Sadly, I did not feel treated fairly with my last manager, but I am sure that mine was an isolated case. I was working overseas and things are different from country to country. My mistake was not to talk about what my situation was."

good,"Enjoyed my job, hard work made fun by attitudes and good co-workers.  Loved the traveling public, conversing with people from all over the world.  This was my happiest job and most fun job I ever had.  Happiness is contagious, but so is negativity.  You can choose who you want to become just by your attitude.  People will be drawn to you when your friendly and smiling."
good,"Rerating tickets, working spreadsheet. closing accounts every month.  I learned a lot about the airline business and how they compete and operate on a daily basis."

good,I was very impressed by the professionalism of the employees. I loved the fact they had so many tools that assisted me to do my job.
good,"Great opportunity for growth horrible management... overall great place. outstandin benefits"
good,"Yes, you get to travel, but main focus is professionalism, high level customer service, flexibility and positivity. This can be an extremely stressful career. You are required to know and perform at a high level of safety and security regulatory compliance. Must keep up to date on FAA regulations. Starting out, you are on call for any shifts, day or night. You must be willing to work as a team with whomever you are working with on a flight. You are required to deal with high stress situations, while maintaining a professional attitude and keeping the  operations running on time. Sometimes you are working on minimal rest/down time."
good,"For the short time I worked for American Airlines at Detroit Metro Airport, I enjoyed every minute of the experience.  Coworkers were a lot of fun and hard-working.  Everyone worked together and had your back at all times."
good,It is a great place to work at . I feel that the pay is too little to support my family. I am a very hard worker in I like to smile..
good,"Easygoing, focus on human factors great experience good relations with the employees fantastic colleagues enjoyable to be with"
good,"Start my day interacting with passengers in the terminal, answering questions regarding travels and other inquiries. I learn about different cultures. Management is very supportive. My coworkers are easy to work with and very understanding. The hardest part of my job is not being able to get my passengers to their connections on time, they get very agitated and I have to be as patient as possible. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing their smiles after arriving at their destination, and when they tell me job well done."
good,"I would answer phones, Book Flights, cancel flights,and change flight information as requested by passengers."
good,"It is a daily challenge, to get flights out on time, and is rewarding at times to see various needs to get a flight out on time.   It is not a walk in the park, but if you put effort into it we see the benefits of working together."
good,The only downfall the job had was the scheduling. I would love to comeback if they could skip the training process for me too.
good,Working for American Airlines has been a great opportunity for me. A typical work day includes me arriving to the airport about 45 minutes prior to the beginning of my shift. I have to take a bus that takes me from the employee parking garage to the airport. And then a second bus that takes me from the airport ground level to my station. From there I clock in and receive my work schedule that has all my flights listed. My shifts are very short and only last around 4 hours. As long as you arrive on time to your flights you don't have a problem.
good,"a really fun and interesting workplace, i loved working there."
good,"An amazing company with endless possibilities.  Growth, experience, travel, benefits, many areas and colleagues to learn from."
good,Loved seeing the world but wanted to settle down and put down some roots and rebuild my life at home.  After 24 years I decided to take company proffered retirement and make my dreams come true of trying something new.
good,Opportunities for advancement. Great mentors. Great benefits.American Airlines career opportunities are unlimited. They encourage employees learning more about every aspect of the business.

good,It had it's ups and downs. However if you can connect with people on your shift you can have a lot of fun and still maintain a safe work environment.
good,loved this position had the chance to route maintenance on aircraft.
good,"Some areas at entry level take longer to work your way up, but with perserverence and dedication, it can be done. Like anywhere, there are good and bad bosses, and most of mine have been amazing. The employees are like family and pull together during tough times, and the flight benefits are pretty cool. There's a positive energy that can be contagious if you let it!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of finding what my overall mission was going to be within my eight hour work schedule then getting all the resources together in order to complete all required task. It has individual break areas for it's employees; and a place to relax when on break.  Most of the supervisors are knowledgeable in the objectives of the company.  I experienced a little bit of a problem with some of the time restraints that were in place but find ways to complete the task within the time required.  My co-workers were an important part of making all the task that had to be completed in a timely fashion.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when i managed to complete all of the task of the day well a head of schedule.  But, lets be clear i'm a firm believer in the fact that a manager or supervisor is only as good as the very worst employee on the him or her.  But, first he or she most know clearly what the primary objective is."

My co-workers a awesome!  Although we are home-based we have built a support base that allows us to successful at our jobs.  The hardest part of the job would be working holidays, the calls are generally slow.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and benefits.  ."
good,"American Airlines is a very inviting community that offers a lot of different opportunities, as it is a very large company. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to fly across the world at a very cheap price. A typical day at work was not extremely demanding as you keep your own hours, but professionalism is key. The management is also understanding for the most part and are willing to help you without looking down on you."
good,Worked reservations call center an then advance to airport duties.
good,"A typical day at work is look to see if the flights are on time or any delays, It is an enjoyable place to work you work with people all over the United States, I have learned so much about aircraft itself, meaning there is a certain amount of weight you can put on one, in bad weather you have to know the correct way to deice an aircraft, I have also learned how to be in charge of a large amount of people and what everyones jobs are, but to put it all in a nut shell it is a good place to work."
good,"Since I took early retirement on 11/1/2011, I'm not too sure what it's like to work for but it was great when I was there."
good,My main job was a fleet service clerk but I volunteered to help out with the training aspect and took on the local aircraft parts inventory job too. The last was a very rewarding task as I cleaned up the old area and reinventoried all the parts at the station. I also took a hazardous shipping class on shipping dangerous goods related aircraft parts. I shipped and received all parts as necessary depending on which shipment was best. I handled all aircraft parts to ship by packaging as necessary or handled heavy parts with a forklift or other means. I labeled the parts and did a monthly shelf life report where required. It was very rewarding and fun job to do and would like to do it again. Had to leave American Airlines as they closed my station to my job and although I could have transfered I choose to take an early out /retirement package.

good,"With American airlines, we have the opportunity to fly to amazing destinations and have wonderful layovers. We meet the most amazing passengers, and have a lot of fun on every flight!"
good,American Airlines  is truly one of the great airlines in the world    And I have worked for six different airlines    They are driven by marketing which I suppose is as it should be but they are also committed to safety and the well-being of the flights is left up to the Capt which is also as it should Be.
good,American Airlines is a great opportunity with good benefits and a place where I can see myself retiring there. The leadership is kind and care about the employees. can't beat the flight benefits either.
good,"This company is transitioning constantly and many unions have been restructured.  I no longer work there but I feel I had a great job with pay and benefits.  amazing benefits and also travel benefits for myself, family and friends."
good,"My days usually began at between 5 and 6 AM. Most of my career was spent in an operational environment, so I began by checking to see if there were any problem aircraft that needed my attention. "
good,It was great till the last manager took his office. Either he laid off senior supervisors or demoted them. finally he was fired for job done very poorly.
good,"great job, great culture, benefits."

good,"flexible work schedule. All employees have well defined duties and"
good,"After gaining seniority flight crews can choose own schedules and work high or low hours. Good flexible schedules are usually available."
good,"It was a great job overall, and love the fact that we could give out some of the hours or taken them if you want to make more money."
good,Great opportunity for those individuals who love to travel and prefer to not have a 9-5 job. Also very beneficial for those who can live in base and really take advantage of picking up extra hours every month.
good,Would highly recommend working for AA. They and United are the only two airlines that take care of there employees. You get free flight benefits in the U.S
good,I really enjoyed working with American. It was a fast and active job. I never felt like I was set up to fail. There were so many opportunities I was able to experience.
good,"a typical work day I would mostly make copies print and input items in computer."
good,"The work culture is amazing, work hard but have fun doing it.  The management in Records is far superior to most management. They understand the importance of family and the balance of work and family.  They do not micromanage and trust their employees are adults that should be mature enough to do their job to the best of their ability, which leads to a stress free environment."
good,During my time here I had a lot of training and learning experiences. It was fast paced you needed to  stay sharp on events and flights    that required you to be focused and sharp for details and options to get customers to their final destinations.
good,"typically we clock in and go to our gate, meet the in bound aircraft and then start to work the flight, check in the crews answer any questions passengers may have and then board the flight."
good,The culture at American was that of a family. It was always a great place to come to every day. The people around you made sure that you were the best employee you could be.
good,I worked as a gate agent in the AA terminals. I had enjoyed working with teams by providing a high quality of customer service. The management team was friendly and flexible to work with each employee schedule and to meet their family commitments.
good,"Being a flight attendant is a great job/lifestyle. It is generally an easy job but sometimes can be very stressful due to passenger complaints, weather and mechanical delays and passenger complaints over which you have no control to resolve. The free/discounted travel enables you to travel the world at little or no expense for the airfare and you get hotel and car rental discounts and other travel benefits. Most days are great fun but there can be very stressful days as well."
good,"Terrific place to work"
good,"If you want a fast paced ever changing environment, then the airline culture is yours to tackle. I enjoyed my experience enough to go back and grab some more!"

good,"Great group of folks to work with.  Great Teamwork."
good,If you love to travel and if you's like an introduction to the airline business. This is the place for you! Excellent benefits and excellent company to work for.
good,"This place offers excellent benefits and good pay, but it is very repetitive. A typical day involves customer service in a call center environment. Management is strict, and there is no room for flexibility regarding scheduling. Work culture is your run of the mill office crew. The hardest part of the job is probably the inflexibility and meeting such strict guidelines. The most significant part is the flight benefits."
good,"Great co-workers, always willing to help. Awesome benefits. You can easily move inside the company. Perfect place to be directly in contact with airplanes."
good,I enjoyed working for American. The people were  friendly and the work was not too hard. I developed a rhythm and that made the day go so much faster.
good,"great career! I was very fortunate to work for a great company, wish I"

good,"American Airlines is an excellent company to work for thus many stay within the company due to the ability to change positions frequently. Days fly by because you are so busy with your day-to-day responsibilities. Excellent opportunities for growth all within one single company."
good,I would recommend this job to someone who isn't interested in starting a family or has small children as you are not home a lot of the time and you are stationed where the airline needs you. and that may not be close to where you live. But made lots of friends and had so much fun seeing the world and meeting new people

good,"Costumer service center, great benefits and great growing opportunities, I deeply enjoyed working with American Airlines."
good,I worked with an AWESOME team and supervisor and I enjoyed the job I  was doing.
good,"Trabalhar com eles foi a melhor coisa que ja me aconteceu na vida, infelizmente tive que me desligar deles pois minha m√£e na √©poca andava muito doente e n√£o tinha com quem ficar, e obviamente que nunca deixaria minha m√£e sozinha."
good,"Great coworkers, good entry level, all the travel benefits of an American Airlines employee"
good,Excellent company with plenty of opportunities to advance.  I supported a staff of approx. 12 Customer Service Instructors at the Corporate level as a Lead as well as facilitating training within the US and International locations. I learned every facet of the airline industry from being a Ticket Agent to Corporate Instructor.  Management was quick to listen to suggestions and acted as needed.  One colleague is still my best friend.  Getting communication of changes from Headquarters.  The best part was visiting 45+ countries including 170+ cities and working with and meeting new friends.
good,"Typical day at American Airlines entailed of answering phones and assist customers with their travel needs. Sales of tickets, re-issuing vouchers, helping airport agents via phone to locate better flights and/or re-booking customers on different flights if there was any cancellations to customers travel arrangements. "
good,It was really good experience working on the US Air merger trial. I learned a lot and worked with really professional attorneys.
good,Exellent airline when I was hired but management lost it's way after 9/11 and did not implement needed changes to prevent bankruptcy.
good,"Pretty entertaining job, something new to do everyday. Met great people from all over the world. Union helps you out when ever you need anything and you pretty much got control of your schedule since you can pretty much give your hours away and pick up hours when ever you like without a problem. Unlimited Overtime so you can make as much money as you want as well."
good,"I must say that I enjoyed my 23 years at American. It felt good to be yourself, treat passengers like.. we want to be treated. I was able to take time to console, listen, connect with the person on the other end of the phone even if they didn't make a reservation. On the other hand I was trusted to handle a call with efficiency and product knowledge and excellent customer service skills to make a sale. I learned patience, how to listen, how to respond to difficult situations and hopefully have a loyal, satisfied customer on the other end of the line when all's said and done. Management was helpful, fun and fair. We were like family, management and co-workers. We had events all throughout the year either on or off site. We celebrated and mourned together. "
good,"Working at American Airlines is a very good place to work. You are not sitting at a desk all day. You stand for four hours and receive the passengers. You check their documentation, you check their bags to their final destination, etc. It is a job where you keep moving all the time and hours go by really fast. You deal with people from all around the world. The hardest pat of the job is when a flight is cancelled or delayed. Passengers get really upset and many of them don't treat you in a very good way. I have a very good relationship with my co workers and that makes me enjoy work everyday. Also, when passengers thank you and treat you well and when they congratulate about your work done makes me enjoy work."

good,"buen ambiente laboral, grato. fueron muchos a√±os de experiencias bonitas y valorables con pasajeros y compa√±eros. aprendi mucho a tratar con personas de todas las culturas, religiones y estilos de vida diferentes."
good,"What I enjoy most is the variability at work, every customer is different and the way you have to adjust yourself to their needs to help them. Really this is the first time that I spend so much time on a phone and I guess that's the hardest part, I have been in customer service now for more than 14 years but always on the face to face, at the begininig I thought maybe was not the right job for me but you get used to do it and everything is getting easy everyday, even when I still enjoying more the face to face customerr service. My colleagues are amazing even when we work from home and we don't see each other everyday but we really keep in touch through a group on facebook that we keep to make trades on our shifts or only keep updated about work or other things, we spent 8 weeks of training and really we had the best trainners we could have, they were so nice and with an amazing experience that tried to put on our hands, was a beatiful time and great experience sharing with all my colleagues, were so much experience between all of them with great background on aviation or out of the aviation industry but overall on Customer Service."

good,A typical day at work was just supervising employees meeting and greeting arriving passengers in the baggage claim area. Take claim for passengers lost bags and announcing flight arrivals and carousel assignment for inbound flight. You learn great patience with customers because everyone is different. Management was fair they listen to you. My co-workers were amazing people to work with; the hardest part was leaving because I really enjoy working there.
good,MBA rotational program provides amazing opportunities for advancements.
good,"The work environment was engaging and fun, but when the time came to get work done, everyone knew how to be professional and take their job seriously. That, on its own, is what I love about the company. The days always felt to go by so quickly because there always a constant need to get work done and improve.

good,Enjoyed working with maintenance crew and staff. Everyone I worked with were professional and great to work for. Would recommend this company for employment.
good,"Awesome work environment. Management is responsive to employee feedback. Assistance is always available and scheduling is flexible if you do not abuse it. You can combine your breaks and lunches to get an hour long lunch. Hardest part of the job is getting started as a new person but once you get in the rhythm you're good to go. "

good,"If your looking for a company with room to grow, then American Airlines is your company. There are so many other benefits to being a flight attendant besides being able to fly for free which really give them an edge. The health care program could be better."
good,Be punctual and pay attention to detail.must be able to adapt quickly. Actively listen and patience is key when work for the establishment. If you like interacting with people and want work for a company that provides excellent benefits then this would be a company to work for.
good,"I was honestly scared to come to American. I had a good internship with a smaller company and was scared of a large corporate atmosphere.  However, I felt an immediate welcome from my co-workers and almost everyone I worked with was super helpful in answering my questions and encouraged me everyday to be successful in my position. The travel benefits were also amazing!! Can‚Äôt recommend it enough."

With management, the more things you solved without getting them involved, they would leave you to do the work and would appreciate you.

Most all of the employess I spoke with wer happy to be associated with American.  Before I got hired, I would see American Airlines Flight Attendants in the airports.  Most of them were so lovely and coiffed with sharp appearances and warm, beautiful smiles.  When I finaly got hired, I stepped in to a warm exciting, welcoming family atmosphere.  I was in heaven.  I absolutely adored being a Flight Attendant for American.  American's attention to customer service was what I really liked. We were trained to go out of our way to make sure that a customer had a positive experice on board.  The other flight attendants were quite supportive.  The one thing everyone seemed to understand was:  American meant business about upholding their standards.  I think that was one of the reasons I enjoyed working there so much.  Beautiful people with high standards.  I was heartbroken when American Airlines changed the paint livery and logo on their airplanes.  That was one of the ways they had it over all the other airlines.  Along with their consistant customer service.  I found it a great place to work.  Loved the flight crews and customers and the destinations. I thought my management was great.  I found almost nothing hard about it."

good,I'm glad I had the opportunity to work at American Airlines. after a 28yr career working in 4 different states I decided to retire and move back home to be with my elderly parents.
good,"I voluntarily went from FT to PT and kept all my same benefits! If you can deal with the redundancy of taking calls for a living you will like the flexibility and culture with the new management. You are held accountable for your work and it's an equal opportunity place and I've noticed little favortism as number don't lie. There are plenty of options to advance but you will not be able to do so unless you keep optimum attendance as that is vital at American, punctuality is everything. It can be stressful especially with the crazy weather we have been having, so you will have to deal with people in very high stress situations and offer solutions but that really helps you build your customer relations skills. You will be subject to work different shifts as you bid quarterly and may be mandated to work if call volume spikes due to weather. etc."

My advise to anyone who is looking to get into Commercial aviation American Airlines is the place to start your career very outstanding training department.
